         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

no better fared it with him in his miniſterie, than it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

fareth ſo with vs: For can we (who are but rude in

rare a <hi>Rhetorician</hi> found not? little or no fruit could he
ſee of all his trauels; and yet he doth not faint, but
with an inuincible conſtancy goes on in performing his
propheticall function.</p>
            <p>Oh! how ſorts the humour of many with this his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23164:13"/>
practiſe? ſuch is the impatiencie of our hearts, that
except we ſee preſent reformation in thoſe we haue to
deale withall, we are ready with <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Ier. 20. 9.</note> to reſolue to
ſpeake no more in the name of God. It is noted as his
blemiſh, and the word of God giues him no reſt vntill
he had altered his reſolution.</p>
            <p>But what courſe wilt thou now take, oh thou man
of God with this obdurate people? Their hearts are
fully ſet in them to doe euill, they will not obey: nay,
which is worſe, they will not heare thee: would they
liſten to thy Sermons, there were ſome hope they might
be wrought vpon: but turning away the eare, what
hope is left? Tell vs then, oh noble Prophet, what wilt
thou doe? let vs be ſo bold with thee as to aske the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
and be ſo fauourable as to acquaint vs with thy
purpoſe.</p>

win vs? which way ſoeuer our deſires ſtand (that is not

            <p>In which <hi>Song</hi> we haue a <hi>Parable</hi> propoſed of a
fruitleſſe <hi>Vineyard,</hi> which after great care and coſt of the
painfull Husbandman beſtowed on it, is left deſolate
and forſaken for its barrenneſſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Argument</hi> of it ſeemeth not to differ from that
of the fore-going Chapters;<note place="margin">Argument of the Song.</note> here being nothing ſaid,
that for ſubſtance was not before taught:<note place="margin">Luther.</note> The difference
that is, is only in circumſtance, the ſtile and method
only being altered and changed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scope</hi> and drift of the Prophet is,<note place="margin">The ſcope is three-fold.</note> firſt to get au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and attention: And therefore he chooſeth to
deliuer his meſſage in the ſweetneſſe of verſe, rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
than in proſe, that ſo the eare hauing that which deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, might without tediouſneſſe liſten to that which
was taught, which being liſtened vnto, might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more kindlier worke vpon them. And queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſſe,
by this courſe he got him hearers; for many
would flocke to heare him ſing, who would not ſtep
ouer the threſhold to heare him in his wonted veine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they might the ſooner learne, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
retaine what he did teach them: For Verſe being
compoſed of certaine Muſicall proportions, both in the
number and meaſure of feet and ſyllables, are ſooner
and with greater delight learned; and once being lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
are longer retained; as by experience we finde, that
our common people haue many vnwritten ſongs,
which are older than their great Grand-fathers Father,
thoſe they learnt being children, and neuer forget
againe vntill their death; yea by this meanes, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of ſome things haue beene kept from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ages paſt, which both Hiſtorie and Tradition had
elſe for euer left neglected and forgotten.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that he might bring them to a ſight of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
ingratitude, and draw from them an impartiall ſentence
againſt themſelues: For looke as it is with the eie which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23164:14"/>
both ſeeth and correcteth all other things ſaue it ſelfe;
ſo is it with the ſinner, when his owne caſe is propoſed
to him, not as his owne, but in the perſon of another,
he will ſoone ſee the fault and paſſe a iuſt ſentence on it,
but elſe it cannot be eſpied. Whiles<note n="n" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> wiſe <hi>Nathan</hi> was
querulouſly diſcourſing of the cruell rich man, that had
forcibly taken away the only Lambe of his poore neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
how willingly doth <hi>Dauid</hi> liſten to the ſtorie, and
how ſharply (euen aboue law) doth he cenſure the fact?
<note n="o" place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> 
               <hi>As the Lord liueth, the man that hath done this thing ſhall
ſurely die.</hi> See how Iuſticers we can be to our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
owne crimes in others perſons? Had he knowne on
whom the ſentence would haue light, it ſhould not haue
beene ſo heauie; but now he is ſelfe-condemned. The
like was our Sauiours practiſe with the Scribes and
Phariſes, in propounding<note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 21.</note> that Parable of perfidious
Husbandmen, who beat the Seruants that were ſent to
receiue the fruits of the Vineyard, and ſlew the heire;
and not without the like ſucceſſe: For being<note n="q" place="margin">Verſ. 40.</note> asked
what the Lord of the Vineyard would doe to ſuch;
they anſwer,<note place="margin">41.</note> 
               <hi>He will cruelly deſtroy them, and let out the
Vineyard to others.</hi>
               <note place="margin">43.</note> Then Chriſt infers, <hi>Therefore I ſay
vnto you, the Kingdome of God ſhall be taken from you,
and giuen to a Nation that will bring forth the fruits
thereof.</hi> And this is the reaſon why our Prophet doth
not only ſing, but ſings a <hi>Parabolicall ſong,</hi> propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the truth in ſuch an obſcure manner, vnder a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſimilitude or allegorie; like ſome expert Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
who ſo cunningly wraps vp his pils and conueyes
his doſe, that it <hi>begins to worke</hi> ere it be taſted.</p>
            <p>And ſurely, there is no one thing, wherein is more
vſe of wiſdome than in the due contriuing of a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
which in a diſcreet deliuery, helps the diſeaſe;
in an vnwiſe, deſtroies nature.</p>

Iſrael to be meant hereby: He ſo terming them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the great loue he bare towards them, and great
care he had ouer them, they being dearely beloued of

               <hi>the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoaſts, is the houſe of Iſrael,</hi>

the people of God, but God himſelfe. And he cals him
ſo in a two-fold reſpect.</p>
            <p>More <hi>Generally;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.</note> as he himſelfe was a member of the

               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Iohn 3. 29.</note> 
               <hi>He that hath the Bride is the Bridegroome: but

            <p>
               <hi>A Song]</hi> Three kindes of Songs were in vſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
amongſt the Iewes:<note place="margin">Mizmor, Tehillah, Shir.</note> Some they called <hi>Pſalmes;</hi>
otherſome <hi>Hymnes;</hi> and another ſort they had which
they called <hi>Songs</hi> or <hi>Odes:</hi> All which kindes Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
mentioneth, when he willeth vs to ſpeake to our ſelues
with Pſalmes, and Hymnes, and Spirituall Songs<note n="t" place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 19. Coloſſ. 3. 16.</note>.
The firſt of theſe were ſuch as were artificially framed
in a certaine full number of words and meaſure, as the
originall word noteth; it comming of a word<note n="u" place="margin">Zamar.</note> which
ſignifieth to prune or cut off ſuperfluous twigs: and
containeth in it holy matter, of what argument ſoeuer:
whether <hi>Precatorie;</hi> Praiers for benefits to be receiued:
or <hi>Deprecatorie;</hi> Petitions againſt aduerſities: or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatorie;</hi>
Matter of comfort and conſolation. Theſe
were wont to be ſung both with <hi>Inſtrument</hi> and <hi>voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort, were ſpeciall ſongs of praiſe and
thankſgiuing, and come of a word<note n="*" place="margin">Halal.</note> which ſignifieth
the lifting vp or exaltation of the voice, in extolling
and magnifying either the worthy perſon or his noble
action; and theſe are properly thoſe that ſet forth the
Almighties praiſe:<note place="margin">Hymnus Pſalmo ſanctior.</note> therefore ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome; A
Hymne is more diuine than a Pſalme.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chryſ. in Coloſ.</note> Theſe were wont
to be ſung either with the <hi>Inſtrument,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. Hom. 9.</note> or without.</p>
            <p>The third kinde contained in them doctrine of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23164:15"/>
chiefe good, or mans eternall felicitie, with other ſuch
like Spirituall matter, and were artificially made, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a more maieſticall forme than ordinary. Theſe were
ſung only with the <hi>voice,</hi> without any Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>A learned writer<note n="x" place="margin">Zanch. in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſ. cap. 3. verſ. 16.</note> ſheweth diuers other differences,
and diſtinctions giuen of theſe by diuers of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents:
but that I haue named, is the moſt receiued. Let
this ſuffice, there were and are varietie, and all allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the Lord.</p>
            <p>As for this Song of our Prophet<note n="y" place="margin">Calu. in loc.</note> it is of this latter
kinde, and was moſt artificially compoſed, and ſet out
with the moſt exquiſite skill that might be. It is of the
like nature and kinde with that of <hi>Solomons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Oecolamp.</note> which is
called the Song of Songs: For here the great loue of
God towards his Church, with the fruit of that his loue
is ſet forth vnto vs. In this indeed they differ (as ſome
haue well obſerued) that is <hi>Comicall,</hi> but this is <hi>Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;</hi>
for though our Prophet beginneth merrily, yet
he endeth heauily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of my beloued]</hi> Here the Prophet vſeth the ſame
word that he did before,<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(For ſo it ſignifieth as well as friend or beloued) and
would by it note out the Meſſiah, and his humanitie in
a ſpeciall manner: For <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcended from <hi>Dauid,</hi>
and ſo was of Chriſts kindred; in which regard (ſay
they) he calleth him his Vncle or his Couzen. But this
expoſition is reiected by other of the learned<note n="a" place="margin">Caluin. Vrſin.</note> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained:
And they take the word here vſed to be the
ſame in ſignification with the former, holding the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be but a garniſhing of the Prophets ſpeech,
which liberty <hi>Poets</hi> haue aboue other writers, to the
end that by the rime and running of the verſe, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
might be the better helped, and the Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
quickned.</p>
            <p>Now, in that he ſaith it was <hi>[Of]</hi> his beloued, he
hereby noteth out his <hi>Warrant</hi> and <hi>Authoritie:</hi> It
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23164:16"/>
was the Song which his Beloued put into his mouth,
and which he had in charge from him to publiſh. It
was of him and from him, as well as for him.</p>

               <hi>Touching his Vineyard]</hi> Some reade it, to his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard;
others, for his Vineyard. The word may be read
both waies, both in the Genitiue and Datiue caſe (as

While he hath to deale with a people of a tractable

            <p>Againe, when he hath to deale with a people of a

it would little elſe than amaze his Auditors. Wherefore

for which his plainneſſe let him not be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
but reuerently and deuoutly ſee that his doctrine
be receiued, that obſcure things may afterwards be
more profitably opened. At another time it ſo falls out,
that he is to ſpeake to a more learned and intelligent
Auditorie, and then he takes more ſcope to vſe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of his liberall education, in quoting the Fathers,
and alledging humane teſtimonies: Sometimes in caſe
of <hi>Grammar,</hi> that the true ſenſe and meaning of a word,

when as that other <hi>Amos</hi> was of meane paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,

the <hi>Maſter</hi> which they ſerue is the <hi>higheſt:</hi> The <hi>worke</hi>

            <p>How guilty then are ſuch as thinke baſely of ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

Oh curſed times! wherein prophane liuers doe account
no mens perſons, no mens callings, ſo baſe and vile as
ours. The name it ſelfe of <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Miniſter</hi> by ſuch
is caſt in our faces, as termes of infamie and reproach,
and vſed no otherwiſe amongſt vs, than the name of
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> is amongſt the <hi>Barbarians</hi> in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> by way of
diſgrace: And the very weed and garment of a Miniſter
is enough to procure contempt, though otherwiſe he
himſelfe be free enough from all contempt. This is one
of the blots of this our Nation, that a Miniſter is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
ſpoken of but with <hi>diminution:</hi> And the ſimpleſt
in a multitude, though he be not able to giue the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of one petition in the Lords prayer, yet hath elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
enough to diſgrace their perſons and their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.
A horrible confuſion it was, that was foretold
by this our Prophet, which ſhould come on Iſrael:<note n="t" place="margin">Iſay 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>The

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23164:21"/>
this confuſion is befallen this generation? Who almoſt
ſo vile, but thinks himſelfe a better man than the ableſt
Miniſter? What <hi>Gentleman</hi> ſo meane, but thinks his
childe too good for this <hi>Prieſtly trade?</hi> Yea his whole
houſe diſgraced, his bloud and familie diſparaged, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his <hi>daughter</hi> be matched with a <hi>Preacher,</hi> or his

thee, who thus baſely iudgeſt, That God hath honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the pooreſt Miniſter farre aboue thy ſelfe; and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him to ſerue at his owne table, when he hath reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
thee and thy fathers houſe. Be not then any more
ſo much deceiued, as to thinke the calling of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie
to be baſe and beggerly, and not meet for any, but
the poore to liue by; fit only for the lame, and ſuch as
are disfigured; for younger brothers, blunt-headed
ſchollers, and ſuch as are good for no Trade elſe; when
<hi>Princes, Peeres,</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> and ſuch as haue beene of

it is a great helpe to memorie, and cauſeth things (once

            <p>This may ſerue firſt to <hi>informe</hi> our iudgements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the lawfulneſſe hereof,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that ſo this exerciſe and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23164:23"/>
Art which is by ſome wrongfully held in contempt,
may be brought into a more reuerend eſteeme: for what
is the maine cauſe ſo many ſpeake againſt Poetrie, but an
ignorant miſconceit they haue thereof? imagining
it to be but a vaine inuention of man, and an vnfitting
language for to expreſſe holy and ſacred matters and
myſteries by. But that which hath beene ſaid before
ſerues for the diſcouery (and I truſt ſhall alſo for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie)
of this error. God hath vſed Verſe to expreſſe a
great part of his reuealed will vnto vs: and hath ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
many of his heauenly precepts with the ſweet and
pleaſing ſtraines of <hi>Poeſie</hi> and <hi>Numbers.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let it neither be thought a vaine and vnneceſſary
curioſitie, nor yet (as ſome others doe) a horrible and
damnable <hi>impietie.</hi> True it is, in theſe wretched daies,
for the moſt part we ſhall finde, that the ſubiect of <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi>
is wantonneſſe and laſciuiouſneſſe, wherewith the
mindes of youth are wonderouſly bewitched: But yet
as<note n="ſ" place="margin">Plut. de Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic.</note> one ſaid of Muſicke we may ſay of it: The proper
and principall ſubiect of it is the Almighties praiſe.
Shall we then condemne the lawfull vſe with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
abuſe? That may not be. Let vs caſt away the
<hi>faſhion,</hi> but keepe ſtill the <hi>ſtuffe.</hi> Let not the exerciſe
it ſelfe be abhorred, nor the vſe thereof condemned;
but the corruption thereof: For certainly, there is no
<hi>Art</hi> that doth ſet forth the glory of God (which is the
chiefe end of mans creation) with ſo much excitation
and expreſſion as this <hi>Art</hi> doth. And therefore by
<note n="t" place="margin">Spondanus.</note> ſome it is preferred to all Arts and Sciences. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this vſe; if euery Art be the gift of God; and if
it be of him<note n="u" place="margin">Exod. 31. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> to inuent and finde out curious workes,
to worke in gold, and ſiluer, and in braſſe, &amp;c. Then
muſt it likewiſe be of him to guide the pen, and giue
the tongue for ſpeaking ſuch excellent things, and after
ſo elegant a manner. The like might be ſaid for her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Muſicke.</hi>

as abuſe this Art which in it ſelfe is ſo lawfull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
and by their wantonneſſe cauſe it to grow
contemptible.</p>
            <p>And thus doe vainer <hi>Poets,</hi> who by their laſciuious
rymes, luftfull Sonnets, Plaies and Enterſudes, bring
ſhame vnto the Art, diſgrace to Poeſie, and diſhonour to
the giuer. The like is the practiſe of wicked <hi>Fidlers</hi> and
<hi>Baladmongers,</hi> who make it their profeſſion, and get
their liuing by poiſoning many a ſoule, in alluring their
mindes vnto vanitie with their bewitching harmonie,
and tempting charmes of laſciuious Muſicke.</p>
            <p>A ſhame it is that ſuch <hi>Vermine</hi> ſhould be ſuffered in
ſo well a gouerned Common-wealth as this is. And the
greater is our ſhame, in that our Magiſtrates haue no

vnto the Lord.</hi> And againe;<note n="e" place="margin">Iam. 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Is any amongst you afflicted?
let him pray. Is any merry? let him ſing Pſalmes.</hi> And
there alſo we finde it vſed by<note n="f" place="margin">Acts 16. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> who at

exception) who ſang a <hi>Pſalme</hi> together (as at other
times) ſo that night in which our Sauiour was betrayed.
Thus out of holy writ we haue proued the point. Much
might be brought likewiſe for the further confirming of
it our of Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie (if it were as needfull as
eaſie ſo to doe) of the practiſe of Chriſtians ſince
Chriſts time;<note place="margin">Vide Eccleſ. hiſt. Theod. lib. 2. cap. 24. &amp; Clem. Alex. lib. 2. Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog. cap. 4. Euſeb. Eccleſ. hiſt. lib. 2. cap. 17. &amp;.</note> but of that much, I will alledge only at
this time that teſtimonie which<note n="h" place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 33. &amp; lib. 8. cap. 9. &amp;. lib. 10. cap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Plinius ſecundus</hi> (a
Heathen, who liued about 200 yeares after Chriſt) gaue
vnto the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> in the behalfe of Chriſtians:
<hi>They vſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to riſe before day, to celebrate Chriſt
in Pſalmes as God:</hi> And as <hi>Socrates</hi> reports; neither
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> nor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> euer began a battell,<note n="i" place="margin">Socrat. Schol. Eccleſ. hiſt. lib. 7. cap. 22.</note> but firſt
they and their ſouldiers ſung Pſalmes, and made ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
to the Lord. Let vs now come to ſome profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vſe.</p>
            <p>And firſt it ſerueth ſoundly to leſſon ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
this exerciſe;<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> or deride ſuch as vſe it either in
publike or in priuate. Such mockers are euery where
to be found, who as they deride all other parts of Gods
ſeruice, ſo amongſt the reſt, this. But if it be a worke of
Gods ſpirit to ſing; and if Gods children<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15.</note> ſing with the
ſpirit, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> auoucheth; then againſt whom doe
theſe open their mouthes? whom doe they blaſpheme?
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23164:25"/>
A <hi>lamentable</hi> thing it is, that in a Land profeſſing the
Goſpell, and after the continuance of the publike
preaching thereof ſo many yeares; ſuch an ancient,
laudable, and holy exerciſe, ſhould be made a matter of
ſcorne in the ſeeming of any. The Lord lay not this
ſinne vnto our charge.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> let vs be ſtirred vp on all ſides to a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
performance of this Chriſtian dutie. We haue
ſeene it <hi>commended</hi> to vs by the practiſe of Gods Saints,
and by Chriſt himſelfe: And not only ſo, but <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
likewiſe in expreſſe termes; ſo that wee may not
thinke it as a thing indifferent, whether we ſing or no;
but euery man to whom God hath giuen the facultie of
ſinging, ought as well this way as any other, to ſet forth
his Makers praiſe.<note place="margin">Motiues to ſinging.</note> Now the better to ſtirre vs vp to the
performance hereof (for we ſhall finde our fleſh back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enough as well in this as in any other good exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe)
I might vſe many motiues: One taken from the
admirable effects and vertues of the Pſalmes; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them a pretious balme for euery preſent ſore; ſo
as that there is no temptation nor affliction which can
befall a Chriſtian, but in the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> he may finde both
the formes of expreſſing them, and their meanes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.
Another might be drawne from the practiſe
of the dumbe creatures: As the <hi>Larke,</hi> and other birds,
which ſhut vp the light with a ſweet dittie, and againe
ſaluteth the Sunne when it begins to peepe the next
morning, with ſuch ſweet ſtraines as God hath naturally
giuen to it. This<note n="l" place="margin">Ambroſ. Hexa.<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lib. 5. cap. 12.</note> one of the Ancients vſeth as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to draw vs to the exerciſe of ſinging: For how can
men but bluſh, ſaith he, to remember that they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
or ended a day without a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> when they ſee the
birds, thoſe <hi>wilde quiriſters</hi> of the wood, conſtant in their
deuotions, beginning and ending the day with variety
of ſong? But I loue not to be tedious: Remember
only what <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith;<note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 147. 1.</note> 
               <hi>It is a good thing to ſing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to our God: It is pleaſant, and praiſe is comely.</hi> There
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23164:25"/>
are ſome things <hi>good</hi> but not <hi>pleaſant,</hi> as <hi>afflictions:</hi>
Some things are <hi>pleaſant</hi> but not <hi>good,</hi> as <hi>ſinne:</hi> And
ſome things may be both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pleaſant,</hi> yet not
<hi>comely.</hi> But this is all. It is <hi>good,</hi> becauſe commanded
of God, and agreeable to his will, as before hath beene
proued: It is <hi>pleaſant,</hi> as the children of God experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
haue witneſſed; who in time of tribulation
haue vſed them as a great meanes of conſolation, and as
a ſweetning to their tortoures. So did <hi>Theodorus,</hi> a man
young in yeares, though not in grace, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we reade,
<note n="n" place="margin">Auguſt. de Ciu. Dei, lib. 18. cap. 52. &amp; Ruffin. lib. 1. cap. 35.</note> that being cruelly tortured with vnheard of torments
from the breake of the day vntill the tenth houre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
intermiſſion; and then ſet on horſebacke, &amp; on both
ſides tortured by the executioners, ſang with a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
countenance the 96 Pſalme. Which vndaunted
conſtancie the Officer perceiuing; ſent him backe
againe to priſon; reporting to the Emperor, what was
done, and withall told him, that vnleſſe he forbare to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
ſuch cruelty; it would redound to their glory and
his ſhame. It is <hi>comely;</hi> for it is the exerciſe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in heauen to ſing praiſes and Halleluiahs to the
Lord. Wouldſt thou then exerciſe thy ſelfe in that
which is both <hi>good, pleaſant,</hi> and <hi>comely?</hi> then ſing
<hi>Pſalmes,</hi> for all theſe are met in that one dutie.</p>
            <p>Now for as much as many a good duty is mard in
the making,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 3.</note> and ſpoyld in the performance, let me adde
a third vſe for our <hi>direction,</hi> and therein ſhew what is
required of vs in our ſinging that God may haue the
glory. The rules that concerne this exerciſe are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily
comprehended in theſe words of the Apoſtle to
the Coloſſians,<note n="o" place="margin">Coloſſ. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Teaching and admoniſhing your ſelues
in Pſalmes and Hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs, ſinging with
grace in your hearts vnto the Lord.</hi> Here we haue directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
both for <hi>Matter, Manner,</hi> and <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>matter</hi> of our ſongs: It muſt be firſt
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>wholſome; ſpirituall</hi> and <hi>heauenly:</hi> Such
ſongs we muſt ſing as are either already in the word, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23164:26"/>
elſe compoſed according to the word. 2. It muſt be
<hi>ſitting,</hi> that it may edifie: <hi>It muſt teach and admoniſh:</hi> and
therefore wiſdome is required euen in chuſing of a
<hi>Pſalme,</hi> that it may be fitting the occaſion.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>manner</hi> of our ſinging,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> theſe are the
things required. Firſt, it muſt be with the <hi>heart.</hi> Now
to ſing with the heart is to ſing with <hi>vnderſtanding,</hi> and
with <hi>feeling.</hi> For he that ſingeth and vnderſtandeth
not what he ſingeth, what is he better than a ſounding
braſſe, or a tinckling cymball? And therefore ſaith the
Apoſtle,<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 15.</note> 
               <hi>I will ſing, but I will ſing with the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
Our hearts muſt goe with our voyces; the one
muſt be lift vp as well as the other: For God is a ſpirit,
and will be worſhipped with the ſpirit. Looke then to
prepare thy heart before thou ſingeſt, and awake thy
tongue with<note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 57. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Dauid</hi> before thou ſpeakeſt. For when the
mouth ſingeth,<note place="margin">Plus valet conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantia voluntati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> quàm vocum. Bernard.</note> man hath muſicke; but when the heart
ſings, we make God melodie: that is the beſt Organ,
tune that, and all is well; God heares not words with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Non vox ſed votum, non Chordula Muſica ſed cor;</l>

               <l>No ſongs, but Loue he ſings, whom the Almighty heares.</l>
            </q>
            <p>As it muſt be <hi>with the heart,</hi> ſo ſecondly <hi>with grace</hi> in
the heart, <hi>i.</hi> we muſt exerciſe the graces of Gods holy
ſpirit in ſinging, as well as in praying, or in performing
any other of Gods ordinances. The diſpoſition of the
heart muſt be ſuited to the nature and qualitie of the
ſong: If it be a <hi>Pſalme of praiſe,</hi> then are our affections
to be ſutable; our <hi>ſpirits</hi> muſt be <hi>cheerefull:</hi> If of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi>
then muſt we ſtirre vp our <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> in <hi>Gods
mercies:</hi> If of <hi>threatnings,</hi> then muſt our hearts be
ſtrucke with an <hi>awe</hi> and <hi>feare of Gods greatneſſe:</hi> If of
<hi>petition,</hi> then muſt our <hi>affections</hi> be <hi>feruent:</hi> If of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:23164:26"/>
then the <hi>Soule</hi> muſt be <hi>humbled.</hi> And this doth
the Apoſtle meane by <hi>Grace in the heart.</hi> Thus for the
<hi>Manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>End</hi> is now to be conſidered; which is 1. <hi>Gods
glory.</hi> 2. The <hi>edification</hi> of our <hi>ſelues</hi> and <hi>others.</hi> Firſt,
we muſt direct our Songs to God: for ſinging Pſalmes
is a part of his worſhip, and his glory he will not giue
vnto another. The Papiſts then are much to blame, who
rob God of this his right, and giue it to the <hi>Virgin
Mary,</hi> in ſinging ſongs of praiſe to her. And as much
to blame are they, who ſing to their owne glory, deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
moſt in ſweet voyce, cleare throat, &amp;c. This is
ſinging to our owne ſelues, and ſenſes; not to our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
praiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in our ſinging, our owne and others edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and profit is to be reſpected.<note n="r" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>All Scripture is
profitable for our inſtruction;</hi> and whatſoeuer is written,
is written for our learning: The booke of Pſalmes then
muſt needs be profitable for this purpoſe. Thus edifie
thy ſelfe by applying the matter ſung to thy owne heart,
and examine thy ſelfe after the Pſalme is ended, what
thou haſt thereby profited, as well as after thy hearing of
the word preached. Here likewiſe that manner of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vſed amongſt the Papiſts in a ſtrange and vnknowne
tongue; as alſo that kinde of ſinging Pſalmes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the words and ſentences are broken and diuided,
which hinders the edification of the hearers, is not
iuſtifiable.</p>
            <p>Thus we haue ſeene the rules propounded to vs:
What now remaines, but that a watchfull care be had
that they be put in practiſe by vs; and the rather for that
amongſt all the exerciſes belonging to a Chriſtian, God
is moſt diſhonoured by this: For few ſing, but (as it
may well be feared) take Gods name in vaine in ſinging,
becauſe they doe not ſo performe it as Gods word en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynes.
The more ſubiect then this dutie is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
amiſſe, the more cauſe haue we of care for the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23164:27"/>
right performance of it, when euer we ſet vpon this
holy exerciſe.</p>

denie him by their workes? Should we make a ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion,

When the leſſer ſtarres be eclipſed, none takes

looketh to be ſanctified, is more grieuous to him than
the groſſer ſinnes of other men: To ſuch he will one

to ſay that he hath beene Gods inſtrument to bring one
ſoule to the obedience of Chriſt; yet for him to ayme at
his owne vaine-glory, euen in gaining of ſoules to Gods
kingdome, ſuits not with that ſincere affection which

any part of the repute or honour of any of our labors

Yea let euery one, of what calling or condition ſoeuer, ſo

               <hi>Then hath God alſo vnto

likewiſe to reioyce at our owne well-doing, becauſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thereby redounds to the name of God; ſo ſaith

               <hi>Moſes</hi> as ſiſters,

<hi>perfect Loue caſteth out Feare</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 18.</note>, as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh; but
that is meant of a <hi>ſlauiſh</hi> and <hi>ſeruile feare,</hi> not of this
<hi>ſonne-like</hi> and <hi>filiall feare,</hi> for it doth eſtabliſh it. <hi>Moſes</hi>
in one verſe ſheweth both theſe kindes of feares:<note n="t" place="margin">Exod. 20. 20.</note>. <hi>Feare
not</hi> (ſaith he to Iſrael) <hi>for God is come to proue you, and
that his feare may be before your faces, that you ſinne not.</hi>
He bids them not to <hi>feare,</hi> viz. with that <hi>ſlauiſh-feare;</hi>
and yet chargeth them to <hi>feare,</hi> viz. with this godly and
<hi>child-like</hi> feare. By this latter feare then, we need not
feare to try our loue: For without queſtion, he that
truly loues God is afraid to diſpleaſe God by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the leaſt ſinne, for feare leſt it ſhould make a

               <hi>He
was grieued for Dauid becauſe his father had done him

Thus Gods ſeruants, whoſe hearts haue beene inflamed

and patiently vnderwent the heauieſt trials, eſpecially
when it hath beene for their Sauiours ſake, taking grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pleaſure in their iron fetters, than the proudeſt

did the like, as largely appeareth in their ſtories. And
ſurely, if we loued the Lord, it could not bee, but wee
would be zealous for the Lord. It is a cold loue that is
not heated with this fire. When men can diſgeſt oathes

And as loue maketh vs thus obedient and dutifull,

Of ſo franke a diſpoſition is loue, that it will bee prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall

No Spikenard<note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 12. 3.</note> ſhall bee too coſtly for his head whom

ſhee might haue done her ſelfe much good? Yet
ſhee had rather beſtow it on her Sauiour than on her
ſelfe, becauſe ſhee loued her Sauiour more than her
ſelfe. Thus loue will bee content to bee at coſt for
Chriſt, and thinkes nothing too much that is done to
him or for him.</p>
            <p>As that <hi>renowned</hi> Maſter <hi>Fox,</hi> of whom it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that hee would neuer deny Beggar that asked in
Gods name: Thus by our obeying of him, and coſt for
him, our loue may ſoone be ſeene: our workes indeed
doe not iuſtifie, yet they teſtifie. As in a clocke, though
the ſinger of the Dyall makes not the clocke to goe, but
the clocke it, yet the finger without ſhewes how the
clocke within doth ſtirre; ſo here. And therefore what
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeakes of Faith,<note n="m" place="margin">Iames 2. 18.</note>

So ſay I by loue: <hi>Shew mee thy loue by thy workes, for
that loue that is without workes is dead.</hi> Ye loue your
backes, and ſpare not to cloathe them; you loue your
children, and therefore doe much for them; you loue
your beaſts, and therefore beſtow largely on them: and
can you ſay you loue the Lord, and deale ſo pinching<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and illiberally with him? It cannot be: For looke
as the loue of God is the fountaine of all his benefits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
vnto man; ſo is loue in man the cauſe of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and ſeruice to his God. God hath loued vs firſt to
doe vs good; and we loue him next that wee may doe
him ſeruice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus wee haue done with the markes of triall,
whereby (if wee take any tolerable paines in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of our ſelues) it would ſoone be ſeene what
loue to God we beare, and (as I feare) it would appeare,
that albeit the greateſt number profeſſe they loue the
Lord, yet the feweſt number would bee found to loue
him in ſincerity.</hi> And Lord thou ſeeſt and knoweſt it:
For how little art thou deſired or ſought for? How ſmall
is that Ioy which men take in thee or thine? Who ſets thy
feare before their eyes, and when thou hideſt thy face what
man is troubled? Where is our patience in ſuffring for thy
ſake, when one houre in thy houſe of praiſe cannot be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
without an ache in our bones? and of what are we ſo ſoone
weary as of well-doing? As for our zeale, where is it,
while we ſit ſtill and ſee thee diſhonoured, hauing no cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
for thy truth? And doe not our tongues condemne
vs while they are for all purpoſes except thy glory? If
they ſhould iuſtifie vs, would not our workes and actions
teſtifie againſt vs? We call thee Lord, but wheres thine
honour? The title onely, and no more thou getteſt of vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Or if thou doeſt, it is but the dregs and off all, the very
worſt of all; and yet we grudge when wee haue not the beſt
from thee. O bleſſed Sauiour, ſhed abroad thy loue in our
hearts, that we may loue thee better.</p>
            <p>And this is the firſt vſe which I would haue made of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23164:37"/>
this: let our ſecond be for <hi>Exhortation,</hi> that we would
loue the Lord,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> yea preferre him in our loue aboue all
other welbeloueds. Let our <hi>Affections</hi> be ſet vpon him
and be enflamed towards him. Let our <hi>tongues</hi> be mute
to all vanities, and eloquent only vnto him and for him,
who gaue man his tongue and ſpeech; and whileſt other
mens diſcourſes are taken vp about trifles, let ours be
ſpent in ſetting forth his praiſes. Let our <hi>Actions</hi> bee
ſuch as may be pleaſing to him, and let vs not dare to
venture vpon any thing that may offend him. And how
euer we cannot <hi>perfectly,</hi> yet let vs all pray for grace,
that we may loue him yet more <hi>feruently,</hi> and leſſe <hi>fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly,</hi>

we may not againe iudge him; if he chide vs, we muſt
be patient; if he command, we muſt obey: But in that

we haue the Church committed to our care, and are ſo

               <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent his ſeruant to ſetch a wife for his ſonne

We are the Lords ſeruants, ſent to fetch a wife for Ieſus
Chriſt the Sonne of God; O let vs be as faithfull to
God the Father and to Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne, as that
good ſeruant was to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac:</hi> Let vs doe
our meſſage with diligence, and execute our charge
with faithfulneſſe and prayer: Let vs ſpeake of Chriſt,
and only of Chriſt, making him the ſcope and ſubiect
of all our preaching: And (as is the old Embleme of
<hi>S. Chriſtopher,</hi> vnder which our ancient <hi>Mythologiſts</hi>
haue deſcribed the good Paſtor) wade through the ſea
of this world, ſtaying on the ſtaffe of faith and lifting vp
Chriſt aloft to be ſeene of men,<note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 3. 14.</note> as the brazen ſerpent
was on a pole to be ſeene of the Iſraelites who were
ſtung. Let vs ſo ſpeake of him, as that the daughters of
Ieruſalem may fall in loue with him: working firſt vpon
the <hi>vnderſtanding</hi> of our people, bringing them to a
through knowledge of this Chriſt, whom we tender
vnto them as an husband; for this is requiſite in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
<hi>Error perſonae</hi> makes a nullitie. And then ſecondly
vpon their <hi>affections,</hi> that they may take liking of him.
To further which, we muſt ſpeake earneſtly and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
not coldly, careleſly; vſing the beſt of our skill
with arguments and motiues to winne them to his loue.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23164:40"/>
What a ſhame then is it for a Miniſter either to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of this Chriſt, whom he ſhould commend for a
husband to the Church (for what wiſe man will ſpeake
for a ſtranger, of whom he hath no knowledge?) Or
knowing him, yet be dumbe or ſilent, neuer ſpeaking
to the Church in his praiſe and commendations. Or if
he doth, yet then to ſpeake either idly and fooliſhly (as
alas too many doe) whereby many are diſcouraged and
driuen further off from Chriſt; or elſe vnfaithfully
ſpeaking two words for themſelues, and one for him,
deſiring<note n="o" place="margin">Acts 20. 30.</note> to draw diſciples rather after them, than
winne ſoules to God. Oh let not theſe things, my

to ſuch honour, let vs be inſtant in preaching, holy in
liuing, earneſt in perſwading, carefull in admoniſhing,
giuing to Gods people the golden bracelets of Gods
truth; that ſo as<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 32. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Iacob</hi> returned with many more

eare from harkning to ſuch a motion, and ſay nay to
ſuch a perſonage ſeeking and ſuing to her, would ſhee
not be iudged (and that iuſtly) to be a fooliſh woman?
And yet thus it is with vs: the Sonne and heire of the

would be but an eaſie ſuit, and that Gods Miniſters
ſhould not need to ſpend much breath before they haue
obtained; and yet they with all their perſwaſions and
intreaties cannot ſo farre preuaile with vs, as to make vs
hearken to it: Euery ſuitor ſhall haue <hi>hearing,</hi> yea and
<hi>ſpeeding</hi> too before Chriſt Ieſus. The <hi>Deuill</hi> though he
comes euer maſqu'd, and neuer dares ſhew his face (as
well knowing if he did appeare in his owne colours, no
ſoule could then affect him) yet becauſe his promiſes are
great and large (as<note n="q" place="margin">Matth. 4. 9.</note> they were to our bleſſed Sauiour,
when he offered to ioynture him in many kingdomes,
if he would loue him, and fall downe and worſhip him)
is ſoone heard and anſwered. The <hi>World</hi> though it be
a warped, aged and decrepit ſuitor; exceeding old,
blinde and lame; hauing ſore eyes, bleare and raw with
cares; ſwolne leggs diſeaſed with ſurfets, and but a few
minutes more to liue (all as bad qualities in a ſuitor as
may be) yet promiſing large ioynture, good mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
wealth at will, honours and preferments, with

though as<note n="r" place="margin">Iude 23.</note> 
               <hi>S. Iude</hi> ſpeaketh, it be ſpotted all ouer like
an vncleane Leper, or vlcerous Moore, yet becauſe it is
(as it were) a homebred childe, and pleads more than
familiaritie with vs, promiſing all pleaſure and content
vnto vs, as ſoone ſpeeds as either of the former: But as
for Chriſt who is beſt worthy, he hath but a cold ſuit of
it. But beloued be more wiſe; giue not, oh giue not, thy

and ſo thou wilt finde him in the end if thou doſt
truſt him. And for the <hi>world;</hi> it hath but a weake te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
of all that it poſſeſſeth, and can aſſure thee of no

without being ſatisfied. As for that other ſuiter the
<hi>Fleſh,</hi> he is leaſt worthy the hearkning to of any. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
he is an ill wooer that wanteth words, they are
the cheapeſt chaffer a man can part withall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no wonder if he doth ſeeke to inſinuate himſelfe by
promiſes; but paſſe not for them, nay ſtop your eares
againſt them, and in this point be like the <hi>Adder,</hi>

               <hi>For in him are hid all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures

If the houſe of this world be ſo excellent, as

Theſe things being well conſidered, I hope thou wilt
forbeare to ſet thy loue vpon any other Suiter, and now

We are <hi>Chriſts Embaſſadors,</hi> and in his ſtead, ſaith

He may not adde nor alter, chop and change, inuent
or deuiſe any thing of his owne: No way is hee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from what is giuen in charge, but he muſt be found
faithfull in the execution of his office: and ſo ſee we be.
Beware wee, oh beware wee of propounding any ſuch
Doctrine as tendeth either to the <hi>infecting</hi> of the <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
with <hi>error,</hi> or <hi>tainting</hi> the <hi>life</hi> with <hi>vncleanneſſe.</hi>
Take heed how wee dare to broach any new conceit

godly edifying; ſtill remembring, that it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction
of the conſcience, the information of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
the reſolution of the iudgement, the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the affections, the redreſſe of the life that ſhould
be our aime in diſpenſing of the Word. Now as for
trickes and crankles, Grammaticall and Rhetoricall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcant,
ends of gold and ſiluer, what helpe they to this

To the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi>

of God of old) <hi>If they ſpeake not according to this
Word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> This is the
touch by which all Doctrine muſt be tried. If we haue
authority of Scripture for our propounded points (it
being rightly vnderſtood) then we haue authority from
God himſelfe for the deliuery of it, elſe not. Too to
blame then are our ouer-credulous multitude, who
hand ouer head admit and receiue for <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
is propounded vnto them by their teachers; and
thinke this is a ſufficient warrant for any point they
hold; Our Miniſter ſaid it, or ſuch a Preacher deliuered
it in a Pulpit.<note place="margin">Ier. 23. 16.</note> As if there were not ſome who runne
before they are ſent, and publiſh the viſions of their
owne braine, propheſying that which God neuer ſpake.
In matters ciuill we are more cautelous and wary; no
gold (almoſt) we take before wee haue tried it by the
touch, or weighed it in the ballance; and whats the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
becauſe there is much of it light and naught; yea
hardly we will take a groat without bowing, bending,
rubbing it, and the like, being therein oftentimes ouer-curious:
But in religious matters which concerne our
ſaith and ſoules ſaluation, wee are ouer-careleſſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
we are forewarned<note n="p" place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 1.</note> of many falſe Prophets that
are gone into the world, and therefore willd not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
euery ſpirit, but to try the ſpirits whether they be

            <p>The <hi>Matter Subiect</hi> of this <hi>Song</hi> is the laſt thing to

obſerue we:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The good of Gods Church is the ſubiect of a Preachers

               <note place="margin">Doctr. Miniſters ought to ſpend their paines e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for the Churches good.</note> that is it whereupon he muſt eſpecially attend,
as did our Prophet, whoſe Art, wit, learning, time, and

make for the welfare of Gods Vineyard.</p>
            <p>Hereunto tends that exhortation of the Apoſtle,<note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 12. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>Let
vs wait on our miniſtring:</hi> he <hi>that teacheth, on teaching:
or he that exhorteth, on exhortation:</hi> with which dutie
he ſtraightly chargeth <hi>Timothie,</hi> and vs in him,<note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13, 14, 15.</note>

to this Doctrine was his and the other Apoſtles
practice, who would not admit any other charge to be
ioined to their Miniſterie, no not the Office of <hi>Deacons,</hi>
but laid the charge of prouiding for the poore on
others;<note place="margin">Acts 6. 2.</note> thinking it not fit to leaue the word of God to
ſerue tables.</p>
            <p>And did we but conſider the weightineſſe of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<note place="margin">Reaſ.</note> we would ſoon confeſſe a Miniſter had little need to
employ himſelfe in any by-affaires: For as it is an <hi>honor,</hi>
ſo it is a <hi>burden,</hi> and ſuch a burden as is too much for
halfe a man,<note place="margin">

ſaith the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> 
               <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exerciſed a manuall occupation and
became a Tent-maker,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> labouring with his hands, and
that after he was called to his Apoſtleſhip. And ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23164:44"/>
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and others were fiſhers and followed
fiſhing.</p>
            <p>I grant,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the Apoſtles did ſo, but it was only in caſe of
neceſſitie, in time of the Churches wants and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to the end they might ſupport the need and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
of it, as alſo, that they might cut away all occaſion
from them who watched for an occaſion, whereby they
might diſgrace them and winne credit to themſelues.
And thus for a Miniſter to ioine another calling to his
calling, when he is not able to maintaine his charge, and
in the generall want and pouertie of the Church, it not
being able to maintaine him and his, cannot be thought
vnlawfull: But where there is a Church well eſtabliſhed
and reformed, this cannot be allowable.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine likewiſe (like <hi>Rebeckaes</hi> wombe) doth
twinne:<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> it affords a double vſe, one to vs who are the
Lords warriers, <hi>that</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>we entangle not our ſelues with the
things of this life.</hi> The Lord hath laid a heauy burden
vpon thy ſhoulders, couch not downe with <hi>Iſachars</hi>
Aſſe to receiue any other load. What aſhame is it for
to ſee a Miniſter to turne <hi>Farmer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Graſier, Phyſitian,</hi> or
the like, and all for a little pelfe? ſo loading his minde
with the burden of cares and couetouſneſſe, as if he were
exonerated of the burden of the Goſpell? May we not
well wonder with <hi>Syneſius</hi> how he comes to gaine ſo
much leiſure as to ſerue two Maſters,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 57.</note> 
               <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Choro,</hi> and

any</hi> (without exception) <hi>that prouideth not for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
he denieth the faith, and is worſe than an Infidell.</hi>
But theſe things muſt not hinder our conſtant care for
the welfare of Gods Vineyard. Neither doe I thinke
it a thing vnlawfull for a Miniſter to ſtudie <hi>Phyſicke,</hi> or
haue to doe with ſome other calling; for (beſides in
the forenamed caſes) ſo it be at ſpare houres,<note place="margin">Horis ſucciſiuis.</note> and vſed

yet ſtill <hi>Diuinitie</hi> muſt be our moſt and maineſt ſtudie,<note place="margin">Maior pars vitae atque ingenij huc ſtet.</note>
that we may ſaue and winne ſoules to God. Let vs then
that are Miniſters of Gods word, neither be idle nor ill

belongs not to our calling, then remember we the

I doubt not but you will ſubſcribe to what hath now

and yet if our tale of bricke be not made vp, we

are cried out vpon for being idle. But God heares our

So then by all theſe compariſons it is euident, that there

none ſo amiable, none ſo louely, none ſo deare, none ſo

generall we haue ſeene what excellent proportion and
congruity there is between them, and how liuely by a
Vine-yard the nature and condition of the Church viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is ſet forth. Now (more particularly) if we compare
the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Vine</hi> it ſelfe together, we ſhall finde
the reſemblances manifold, either in reſpect of the <hi>Root,</hi>
or of the <hi>Branches,</hi> or of the <hi>Barke,</hi> or of the <hi>Wood,</hi> or
of the <hi>Leaues,</hi> or of the <hi>Fruit,</hi> there being no property

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23164:49"/>
forth fruit, and vnleſſe they continue in the root, they
can neuer thriue nor proſper, for thence it is whence
they haue their moiſture: Thus the Church and euery
true member of it receiueth the life and ſappe of grace
from <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>root,</hi> and into whom the
multitude of true beleeuers are engrafted, whereby they
grow and bring forth fruit to God. So that vnleſſe they
<hi>continue in him</hi> they cannot proſper, but muſt needs
fade and wither, according to our Sauiours ſpeech:
<note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 15. 4.</note> 
               <hi>As the branch cannot beare fruit of it ſelfe except it abide
in the Vine;</hi>

               <hi>no more can ye except ye abide in mee. I am
the Vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I
in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit: for without

               <hi>If a man abide not in me, hee

            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Branches</hi> there is great reſemblance diuers
wayes.</p>
            <p>1. There are many branches in the root, yet all
make but one Vine: ſo all the faithfull in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and all the congregations of the faithfull in the
whole world make but one only Church. And albeit
there are<note n="k" place="margin">Cant. 6. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>threeſcore Queenes and foureſcore Concubines,

And ſo witneſſeth <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Now are they many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
yet but one bodie: One,</hi> as ſucking ſap from <hi>one</hi> and
the <hi>ſame root;</hi> liuing by <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame ſpirit</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 4.</note>, and
ruled by <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame head,</hi> Chriſt, bleſſed for euer.
But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>2. All the branches of a Vine (though they ſeeme to
ſtand alike in the ſtocke) are not alike fruitfull, neither
doe they all draw ſap and moyſture from the root; for
as ſome are fruitfull and flouriſh, ſo ſome againe are
barren and wither, which are cut off and caſt into the
fire: Thus is it in the Church viſible; all the members
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:23164:49"/>
thereof are not alike incorporated into the root, through
the inuiſible bonds of the ſpirit, neither doe they<note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 15.</note> 
               <hi>bring
forth fruit in him.</hi> Some there are who are onely <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
engrafted;</hi> others there are who are alſo <hi>internally.</hi>
The former ſort are ſuch members of the Church viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
who by externall baptiſme haue giuen their names
to Chriſt, and ſo entred into the profeſſion; yet indeed
are not Chriſts, becauſe they haue not the Spirit of
Chriſt: for though they are baptized with <hi>water,</hi> yet
they are not with the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> They haue <hi>Iohns bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi>
but not <hi>Chriſts baptiſme.</hi> This kinde of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
engrafting will ſuffer a cutting off<note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 15. 2.</note>, becauſe
they haue not the ſap of grace miniſtred vnto them from
the ſtocke of life, but are as dead trees and branches.
The other ſort are they who beſides the outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting
are alſo inwardly engrafted by the holy Ghoſt
into the ſtocke Chriſt Ieſus, and doe liue in him, and
grow in him, and bring forth fruit to the praiſe of his
name. Notwithſtanding both theſe ſorts as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
together in the outward bonds of one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
as they viſibly continue together like one viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
body vpon that one root Chriſt Ieſus, on whom
they all outwardly profeſſe that they depend, as on the
fountaine of their ſap and life, ſo they both together
make this viſible Vineyard and Church on earth.</p>
            <p>3. There is no branch of any tree that exceedeth it,<note place="margin">Sine modo creſcunt.</note>
in growing and ſpreading forth it ſelfe: in one weeke, yea
night,<note place="margin">Plinie.</note> how exceedingly is it ſhot? So the true members
of the Church exceed all others in growth, in grace;
they are ſtill ſpreading forth their branches, growing
from one degree of grace vnto another. They are all
for <hi>Addition</hi> and <hi>Multiplication,</hi> nothing for <hi>Diuiſion</hi> or
<hi>Subſtraction</hi> (except in euill.)<note place="margin">Virtutes Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anae ſunt copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuae.</note> They ſing the ſong

but like the <hi>new</hi> euer in her <hi>increaſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The branches of the Vine grow the better for
their pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ewer:
Thus the Church, and true members of the Church,
the more they bee afflicted the more they flouriſh, as
<note n="q" place="margin">Exod. 1. 2.</note> the people of Iſrael vnder <hi>Pharaohs</hi> tyranny, the more
they were oppreſſed, the more they multiplied and
grew. Thus the Church of God euer riſeth in its
ruine,<note place="margin">Sanguis marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt ſemen Eccleſiae.</note> proſpereth in its perſecution. The bloud of
Martyrs is but the ſeed of it, and the chopping off their
heads but as the pruning of this Vine. And as <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
ſaid, ſo may euery true Chriſtian ſay; <hi>The Lord hath
made me fruitfull in the Land of my affliction.</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 5. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now in the <hi>Barke</hi> or <hi>Rinde</hi> let vs compare them: we
ſee that the Barke of the Vine ſeemeth more withered &amp;
dry than the Rinde or Barke of any other Tree whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
yet it hath plenty of ſap and abundance of moiſture
vnder it. Thus the Church of God ſeemes blacke and
deformed outwardly to the worlds eye (which onely
beholdeth and iudgeth the Rinde) by reaſon of the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
heat of perſecution; yet ſhe is inwardly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and beautifull, for there the inuiſible graces of

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23164:50"/>
but the Vine ſo weake that it cannot beare vp it ſelfe
without a ſtay or prop. Thus the Church of any ſociety
is leaſt able to helpe it ſelfe, it cannot ſtand againſt a

of her naturall weakneſſe. It is<note n="u" place="margin">Iſay 33.</note>

to be vnder their ſhade, and that no leaues could
ſo well keepe off a ſtorme of vengeance as theſe leaues
could. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> though he were baniſhed in peace,
yet he was ſent for home in warre. And ſo the godly,
though they bee paſſed ouer in the dayes of pride, yet
when the ſhowres of Gods wrath ſhall fall, then they
and their ſhadow ſhall be more regarded.</p>
            <p>2. The leaues of the Vine are good for <hi>medicine,</hi> they
are very profitable and of excellent vſe, for healing
<hi>wounds,</hi> cleanſing ſores, if they be taken and applied.
<hi>The fruit thereof ſhall be for meat,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <hi>and the leafe thereof for medicine.</hi>
Thus the very outward profeſſion of a Chriſtian, the
very leaues and outward carriage of the godly is for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable
vſe; hereby many haue beene healed, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
haue beene wonne to<note n="k" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 12.</note> a loue and liking of the
truth. Thus <hi>Lucianus</hi> an ancient Martyr, perſwaded
many Gentiles vnto the faith by his graue countenance
and modeſt diſpoſition, inſomuch that (as it is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
<hi>Maximinus</hi> that perſecuting Emperour durſt not
looke him in the face for feare he ſhould turne <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
And ſo mention is made by <hi>Beda</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Eng. Hiſt. lib. 1. cap. 7.</note>, of one <hi>Albane,</hi> who
receiuing a poore perſecuted Chriſtian into his houſe,
and ſeeing his holy deuotion and ſweet carriage, was
ſo much affected with the ſame, as that hee became an
earneſt profeſſor of the faith, and in the end a glorious
<hi>Martyr</hi> for the faith. And ſo their words, they haue a
healing quality with them if they were applied, they

               <hi>The mouth of the righteous will ſpeake of wiſdome</hi> (ſaith

            <p>Now laſtly for their fruits; and firſt for the quantity,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
then for the quality of it: The Vine we know beareth

               <hi>without partiality

of righteouſneſſe</hi> (as he further ſpeaketh) <hi>is ſowne in peace
of them that make peace.</hi> Thus they bring forth Grapes
in cluſters, vnited in the bond of peace and loue.</p>
            <p>2. The Vine beareth <hi>Pleaſant fruit:</hi> no fruit more

ſo the fruit of Chriſtians: How doe their workes of

            <p>In diuers other particulars the compariſon might be

which he hath choſen: And if in caſe (for the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
thereof) he ſhould forſake it for a time (as hee did
this people Iſrael) yet it would bee but for a time, and
not perpetuall: in the end he will returne againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his owne. And thus much briefly for this point.</p>
            <p>Now further, in that the Prophet ſpeaketh in the
Preſent tenſe, <hi>My beloued [hath] a Vineyard:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
the whole Church of Iſrael and Iudah was at
this time ſo generally corrupted, as that from the
Crowne of the head to the ſole of the foot, there was
nothing found but wounds, ſwellings and ſores, full of
corruption (<note n="z" place="margin">Cap. 1. ver. 5.</note> as he had before teſtified) wee doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue,
that</p>
            <p>Albeit a Church bee corrupted with error and idolatry,<note place="margin">Doct. A true Church may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror &amp; idolatry.</note>
yet it is ſtill to be accounted Gods Church, till he haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced
and forſaken her.</p>
            <p>Thus in the daies of <hi>Ely</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 24. 29.</note> Iſrael was called Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and ſo his Church, albeit they were not then ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from all falſe waies, and <hi>Elyes</hi> ſonnes (ſons of <hi>Belial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
ſaith the text,<note n="b" place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> who knew not the Lord) remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them. So <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth Iſrael Gods people
<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 32. 11.</note> when he was vpon the Mount, &amp; yet at that time they
were in the very act of their Idolatry, which was not
vnknowne to <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 7, 8.</note> for God himſelfe enformed him
thereof. So in this our Prophets time,<note n="d" place="margin">Iſay 1. 21, 22, 29. <hi>&amp; 2. 6, 8. &amp;</hi> 65. 11. Cap. 1. 3.</note> albeit this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were ſunke deepe in rebellion and idolatry, yet for
all that God himſelfe doth call them his people, Iſrael
doth not know, <hi>My people doth not conſider.</hi> Turne wee
our eyes from the eſtate of the Church in theſe times to
after times, as it was vnder the Goſpell, and we ſhall ſee
the truth of the point propounded. Looke vpon Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23164:59"/>
in our Sauiour Chriſts time<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 23. 37.</note>, and we ſhall ſee the
eleuen Tribes were become Apoſtates, and the Church
amongſt them was wonderfully corrupted both in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and manners, as appeareth<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 5. 21.</note> by our Sauiour
Chriſts ſeuere reproofe of both; yea the Temple it ſelfe
<note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 2. 14.</note> was almoſt become a den of theeues, full of buyers

God, elſe the Euangeliſt would neuer haue called it<note n="h" place="margin">

ſome of them were in an hereſie;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 20, 21.</note> others in inceſt, and
otherſome that had not repented of their filthineſſe.
Such was the eſtate of the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi>

                  <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2. &amp; 3.</note>, yet the
title of true Churches were giuen to them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe therefore that condemne the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
for a No-church,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> and make a ſeparation from it in
regard of the errours and corruptions that are in it, are
farre from the ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi>
who neuer made any ſchiſmaticall and bodily
ſeparation from any true Church, for the corruptions
(though groſſe) that were therein found. I deny
not but blemiſhes are in euery Church; (for what
Church euer breathed in ſo pure an aire, as that it might
not iuſtly complaine of ſome thicke and vnwholſome
euaporations of error and ſinne?) but becauſe our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wants ſome beauty, hath ſhe loſt her face? Becauſe
ſhe is blacke, hath ſhe no comelineſſe at all? What is
it they charge vs with, but<note n="l" place="margin">See a little booke ſet forth by the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith.</note> with corruptions? (for fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall

in a man make a falſe man; or a corrupt man?
So that though they make the worſt they can of our
Church, they can make it but a corrupt Church, and
not a falſe Church. We haue the <hi>true Word of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</hi>

conuerted with the true Church: wee maintaine
euery point of the moſt ancient Creeds: we ouerthrow
not the foundation by any conſequence. And as yet we
haue not receiued a bill of diuorcement. As for <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
(the want whereof they charge vs with) our
Church is not deſtitute of it altogether: I would wee
had the execution of ſo much as our Church alloweth.
Neither doe we deny but therein there may be ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
and wants, as appeares by thoſe words in the
Booke of common Prayer:<note n="n" place="margin">In the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> 
               <hi>vntill the ſaid diſcipline may
be reſtored.</hi> But doth it follow hereupon, that becauſe
Diſcipline is wanting, the Church is fading, and that
the infirmity of the one maketh a nullity of the other?
That this is neceſſary for the well-being of a Church
I grant; that it is neceſſary to the eſſence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Church I vtterly deny: Neither will they
euer be able to proue it by euidence of Gods Word.
The Church of the Iewes thus ſaith of the Church

had a wall though not of ſiluer, and a doore though not
of Cedar. So is our Church a ſiſter to all reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
though ſhe may haue ſome ſpots in externall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
And our hope is, that her wall ſhall be made more
coſtly, and ſiluer-like, and her doore of Cedar, in Gods
good time. In the Interim,<note n="p" place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

Before I end this point,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> ſome haply may demand,
what may be thought of the Church of Rome; whether
is it to be accounted Gods Church, it being ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Idolatry as it is?</p>
            <p>For anſwer whereto a diſtinction muſt be made:<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
Errors and corruptions in a Church are of two ſorts;
either ſuch as concernes <hi>Manners,</hi> or ſuch as concerne
<hi>Doctrine:</hi> As for corruption in <hi>Manners,</hi> they make
not no Church, but a bad Church; and therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of them, they are not to be forſaken by vs, neither
to be accounted of, as no Church of God. For corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in <hi>Doctrine;</hi> they are either ſuch as are <hi>citra funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi>
beſides the foundation; and theſe <hi>trouble:</hi> or
<hi>circa fundamentum,</hi> about the foundation; and theſe
<hi>ſhake:</hi> or <hi>contra fundamentum,</hi> againſt the foundation;
and theſe <hi>ouerturne</hi> all. The two former are <hi>weakning</hi>
errors, and doe not debarre them from being the true
Church of God; being but the<note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12.</note> building of hay and
ſtubble on the foundation; the ſtubble burnt (I meane
not in their fire of Purgatorie) their ſoules may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
The latter are <hi>deſtroying</hi> errors; and in theſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
muſt be had, whether a Church erreth of
<hi>weakneſſe,</hi> or of <hi>malice:</hi> If it be of <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> then are we
not peremptorily to conclude againſt ſuch a Church;
for <hi>S. Paul</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Gal. 1. 2.</note> writes to the <hi>Galatians</hi> as a Church of God,
though they were peruerted to another doctrine, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
a fundamentall errour of iuſtification by works.
But if it be of malice or affected ignorance, like<note n="ſ" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Iannes
and Iambres that withſtood Moſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſiſting the truth;</hi>
then doth ſuch a Church ceaſe to be a Church, neither
is it any longer to be reputed as a Church. Thus the
Church of Rome doth wilfully and obſtinately deſtroy
the foundation it ſelfe, and therefore may be concluded
for no Church of God. And ſo much briefly for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Queſtion, with which anſwer we end this
point, and come vnto another.</p>
            <p>The Prophet doth not only ſpeake in the preſent

S. Paul;<note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12.</note> As the bodie is one, and hath many members,
and all the members of that one bodie being many, are one

ſheepe I haue which are not of this fold; them alſo muſt I
bring, and they ſhall heare my voice; and there ſhall be one
fold and one ſhepherd.</p>
            <p>True it is, this one Church may haue many parts:
As the Ocean Sea is but one, yet diſtinguiſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Regions vpon which it lies: And ſo there is
the <hi>Germane</hi> Ocean; the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ocean; the <hi>Engliſh</hi>

is a Church in <hi>Geneua;</hi> a Church in <hi>France;</hi> a Church
in <hi>Scotland;</hi> a Church in <hi>England;</hi> and yet but one
militant Church vpon the earth.</p>
            <p>For as a Kingdome diuided into many Shires,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> and
more Townes and Villages, is called one, becauſe it hath
one and the ſame King, one and the ſame Law: So the
Church is one, becauſe it liueth by one and the ſame

one and the ſame faith; hath one and the ſame

ought to be helpfull to its fellow-members, &amp; willingly

according to that of <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>As euery man hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

the welfare of the Church, when we thus ſhew ourſelues

Firſt, <hi>Enuie</hi> or repining at the gifts of others; a ſinne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
too common, and yet vnnaturall: for doth the foot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
at the head, becauſe it is preferd before it, as more
honourable? Or is it diſcontented, becauſe it is clad
in leather, when it may be there is a chaine of gold
about the necke, or a pretious ſtone vpon the finger?
Each member is apparelled and decked with ſuch orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and veſtures as are moſt ſeemely for it: A garter
is vnſeemely about the necke; and ſo is a chaine about
the leg. A foule fault then it muſt needs be, to enuie any
in higher place, for that credit, honour, and reſpect
which they haue aboue vs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>arrogancie</hi> and <hi>highmindedneſſe</hi> for any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
gift that is in vs aboue our brethren. The eie is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with that neceſſary and noble ſenſe of ſeeing; and
ſo is the eare with that worthy and needfull ſenſe of

in that profitable and vſefull ſenſe of ſmelling: Thus
he that taketh place before all in ſome things, muſt be
content to giue place and come behinde others in ſome
things elſe. Let this cauſe thee to contemne none that

nor the eare with ſeeing, nor the foot with either
of them both, but each member knowes its owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and that it lookes to: So arrogate not to thy ſelfe
any thing out of thy owne calling, but containe thy
ſelfe within thy owne bounds and limits. If a more
ſhould fall into the eie, were the foot a fit member to
be thruſt into the eie to plucke it out? No, for though
the foot be ſenſible of the trouble, yet it leaues the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of it to the hand. It is neither fit nor comely for
the people to meddle with the office of Magiſtrates,

of Miniſters, teaching them how to preach. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>His paines, coſt, and care, for this his Vineyards

<hi>ſituation</hi> of it; for it grew, 1. vpon a <hi>Hill,</hi> 2. vpon a

            <p>Thirdly, in the <hi>Elapidation</hi> or <hi>Cleanſing</hi> of it: caſting

            <p>Sixtly and laſtly, in the <hi>erection</hi> and ſetting vp a <hi>Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe</hi>
in it, as being deſirous to ſupply all things that
might be vſefull for it: So that by all theſe he teſtified,
that his care for its good was very great. Before I come
to ſpeake of theſe particulars, in generall obſerue we,</p>
            <p>God is no way wanting or defectiue in any one point of good
huſbandry towards his Church and Vineyard.<note place="margin">Doctr. God is no way wanting in any point of good husbandrie for his Churches good.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Is any thing wanting in it? that he ſupplies: Is any
thing hurtfull in it? that he remoues: Is any violence
offered to it? that he withſtands: No husbandman ſhall
ſo labour his ground as God will doe it.</p>
            <p>And thus doth God ſpeake of himſelfe, profeſſing
his prouident care for the good of it;<note n="f" place="margin">Iſay 27. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>In that day ſing ye

               <note place="margin">Calu. &amp; Muſc. in loc.</note> 
               <hi>leſt any hurt it: I will keepe

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:23164:63"/>
whatſoeuer belongs to the dreſſing and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of it; ſo that no dutie ſhall be left vnperformed,
whereby the good thereof might be procured. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this he addeth <hi>vigilancie:</hi> for what would it auaile
to husband a Vine with great paines and labour, if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it ſhould be left open for theeues and beaſts to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in and waſte it at their pleaſures? therefore he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
withall, that he will keepe it ſo that no hurt ſhall
be done vnto it, but the fruits ſhal haue time to ripen, ſo
that afterwards they may be reaped in their ſeaſon. So
our Sauiour<note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 15. 2.</note> hauing compared his Father to an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
ſets out his great care in trimming and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of his Vine, by taking away thoſe branches which
were barren, and purging thoſe which were fruitfull,
ſo that they might become more fruitfull; omitting no
part of his skill, neither to the one or other. The like
care is<note n="h" place="margin">Luke 13. 8.</note> ſhewed in that Parable propounded by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of the fruitleſſe figge tree; And in that which the
Apoſtle propounds<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 6. 7.</note> of the good and bad ſoile; in both
which the great and conſtant paines of this husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is declared.</p>
            <p>And no wonder:<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> For firſt God loues his Vineyard
dearely, as hath beene before ſhewed: now we ſee, that
field which a man takes moſt pleaſure in, he takes moſt
paines about: no man will beſtow ſuch coſt and labour
vpon a tenement he holds but from yeare to yeare, as
he will vpon his owne inheritance. This may be one
reaſon why he ſo husbands it, to make it pleaſant and
fruitfull, becauſe his loue is ſet vpon it, and his delight
is in it.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> the Churches fructifying, is Gods glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as our Sauiour telleth his Diſciples,<note n="k" place="margin">Iohn 15. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Herein is my
Father glorified, that you beare much fruit:</hi> For looke as
it tends<note n="l" place="margin">Matth. 5. 16.</note> to that husbandmans praiſe, whoſe field ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
the fields of other men in fruitfull crops; So we
being Gods Vineyard, ſet and planted by his right
hand, doe then commend his husbandrie, and ſet forth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23164:63"/>
his praiſe, when we are laden with the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
<note n="l" place="margin">Phil. 1. 11.</note> as the Apoſtle ſheweth. No wonder then if
God be ſo diligent in his husbanding of his Church,
ſeeing the fruitfulneſſe of the Church brings praiſe and
honour to his name; which is the maine end he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to himſelfe in all his actions (as hath beene before
proued.)</p>
            <p>And is God ſo carefull a husband man of his Church?<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</note>
hath he ſo prouident a care for the good of it, as that if
any thing be wanting he ſupplies it; or if any thing be
hurtfull in it he remoues it? Then may all wicked ones
hence take out a leſſon, to their griefe and terror: For
woe to them who are in the Church of God but as
thornes and briars: hurtfull and noxious to the<note n="m" place="margin">Cant. 2. 2.</note> Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
God is a better husbandman than to ſuffer theſe
for euer: A day will come when he will view his field
and ſtub vp all winding and wounding briars; all ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and ranckling thornes that fetch away the clothes,
yea skinne and fleſh too from off the Lambs of Chriſt
with their entanglements. It may be God may ſuffer
theſe for a while as he did the Canaanites in Iſrael, leſt
the wilde beaſts ſhould breake in vpon them: and as a
wiſe husbandman permits ſuch to lie in the hedge for
a yeare or two, and makes them ſeruiceable for the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of a gap or ſome ſuch purpoſe: but in the end
when they are feare and rotten in their ſinnes, then he
will haue them to the fire, for thats their portion.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> it ſhould admoniſh all to looke vnto their
growth that it be good and kindly: if the roots of trees
run too deepe into the earth, they muſt be cut off ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
if the branches of a Vine ſpread too farre, they muſt
be pruned neere; and if the canker once eat into, or
cleaue vnto our trees we ſet, we burne them, ſmoake
them, or the like: And ſo if we be too much rooted by
our affections in things below, or ſuffer them to ſpread
abroad too farre; or let the canker of ſin to eat into our
ſoules (be we what we wil be) God will giue vs many a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23164:64"/>
cutting, pruning, ſmoaking, that if it be poſſible we
may be brought into better caſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> this may comfort ſuch as are euermore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
their little growth in grace; maruellous defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue
they are in virtues of all kindes; as in <hi>faith, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
patience, thankefulneſſe, heauenly-mindedneſſe,</hi> and
the like; and albeit they haue ſome good deſires and
vnfained purpoſes and reſolutions to bring forth fruit
to God; yet withall they finde ſuch ſtrong corruptions
in themſelues, as <hi>pride, vaine-glory, worldlineſſe, lust,
paſſion, reuengefulneſſe,</hi> with ſuch like; as that they be
euen out of hope, and know not what to iudge of their
owne eſtate, but feare they belong not vnto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are no better husbanded: Now let me ſpeake
a word to the ſoules of theſe, and let my words be to
them as<note n="n" place="margin">Deut. 32. 2.</note> 
               <hi>the raine to the new-mowen graſſe:</hi> Doſt thou
not ſee the Husbandman ſuffer his ground to lie as
though he had forſaken it? and for a time to endure to
haue weeds and thiſtles grow thereon, euen when he
hath a purpoſe to breake it vp with his plough, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
much coſt thereon? yea and after he hath turned
it vp, to let it lie, as if he were a weary of his paines;
when notwithſtanding he comes with his plow againe,
and giues it another tilth or two, &amp; then ſowes his ſeed;
being all the while before but a preparing of the ſoyle
for the receiuing of it. The like is Gods dealing with his
deareſt ſeruants; he many times ſuffers them to bring
forth the weedes of ſinne, and to lie in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
for a time (as we ſee in <hi>Dauid, Peter,</hi> and ſome
others) as if he had caſt them off; but it is for no other
end but to mellow their hard hearts by humiliation and
godly ſorrow, and to teach them to diſtaſte their pride,
and not to truſt to their owne ſtrength hereafter: But
notwithſtanding, in due ſeaſon he doth returne, reſtore,
and lift them vp againe. And therefore wait thou a
while. Is thy heart hard and ſtonie? why in his due time
he will mollifie and mellow it, and make it fit for the ſeed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:23164:64"/>
of grace, by bringing downe all high hils of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and making deepe and long furrowes of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in it: Hath he begun to ſcatter the ſeeds of grace
within thy ſoule? Why then he will follow thee, and
ſo husband the leaſt dram thereof, be it but<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 13. 31, 32.</note> a graine
of muſtard ſeed, as that it ſhall ſhoot vp to ripeneſſe, and
become as a mighty tree, ſo that the birds of the aire
ſhall come and lodge in the branches of it. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as thy heart is as apt to bring forth ſinne vpon
the leaſt temptation, as the beſt and fatteſt ground is to
bring forth weeds vpon the ſweeteſt Aprill ſhowre;
God will daily looke vnto thee, and no ſooner ſhall a
weed peepe out, but he will with his weeding hooke
haue it vp; nor a ſuperfluous twig ſprout forth, but he
will with his pruning knife cut it off; according to that
which our Sauiour teacheth,<note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 15. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Euery branch that brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
forth fruit he purgeth, that it may bring forth more
fruit.</hi> And therefore diſcourage not thy ſelfe, for thy
ſoule is the field not of the ſluggard, but of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
husbandman, who will ſo follow thee, as that
thou ſhalt euery day grow more fruitfull in grace and
goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>And laſtly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> hence let good Miniſters (who are Gods
Deputies to husband this his Vineyard) learne diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to follow their vocation, omitting no manner of
paines that may tend to the fructifying of the Church,
ſeeing God himſelfe omits none. Let vs obſerue our

and not mans; and he is able to recompence the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and puniſh the vnfaithfull: which ſhould make vs
to be the more circumſpect and laborious in our calling,

how will God alledge his owne example againſt ſuch

chiding and vnpleaſant voice; Away thou diſloyall and
vnprofitable ſeruant into vtter darkneſſe?</p>
            <p>This in generall: Come we now to the particulars,
wherein this good Husbandman ſhewed his great care
for his Vineyards good. In handling of which I would
be loth to be found too curious: I confeſſe I am of their

            <p>The firſt <hi>particular</hi> wherein God commends his loue

               <hi>Thou haſt made a hedge about him, and about

truth of this I will endeuour to ſhew in ſundrie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>For firſt; the <hi>vnreaſonable creatures</hi> are as a hedge
and defence vnto them; God many times ſends armies

burne. Thus the curſed Canaanites ſhall remaine a

not bee deſtroyed at once, but by little and little; as
Gods people got more and more ſtrength, that the wild
beaſts of the field might not breake in vpon them or

            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>godly</hi> as an holy armie doe riſe vp in
their defence to helpe them; ſometimes by making
<hi>Apologie</hi> for them; otherwhiles by ſending <hi>aid</hi> and
<hi>ſuccour</hi> to them; and continually by their <hi>praiers</hi>

very many, who vſe all their wit and wealth, power and

and ouerthrowing of Gods Church and people.
Yet the flocke of Chriſt ſtill remaines, and euer ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine;
all the power and policy of men and deuils
ſhall neuer be able to ſubdue them. For albeit wee are
harder aſſaulted, yet not any are better protected; their
gariſon is ſtrong and mighty; God himſelfe is their
rocke and fortreſſe, their ſhield and bucler: and vntill
that be broken or ſmitten thorow, they ſhall neuer be
wounded. Let then all <hi>Atheiſts, Papiſts,</hi> and all other,

hurtfull or pernicious to any of Gods children; for if
they doe, let them be well aſſured their labour will bee

How groſly then are ſuch deceiued as thinke godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

is to grow graceleſſe and ſinfull? For, can any

fit Mine to digge out a good eſtimation; or that the
puddle water of vanity will make a man ſeeme beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

ſweet is to tumble in a iakes? Certainly figgs grow not

tumults and inſurrections, and the greateſt enemies of

he was a peſtilent fellow, a mouer of ſedition amongſt

in the time of the tenne firſt perſecutions, if there were
any publike plague or calamitie fallen on citie or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
the heathen would ſtraight cry out vpon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
accuſing them to be the authors and cauſers of it:
If <hi>Nilus</hi> ouer-flowed not her bankes; if the clouds
with-held their raine; if the earth quaked; if famine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed;
if the ſword ſpoiled; if peſtilence continued;
by and by the poore Chriſtians, as the ſheepe of Chriſt,
were caſt vnto the Lions: They were charged to make

But as the <hi>Wolfe</hi> in the fable (oh that it were but a fable)
when he ſees the <hi>Lambe</hi> drinking at the poole, comes
blundring into the water and troubles it, then quarrels
with the Lambe for troubling the water; <hi>Sic nocet inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuo

the <hi>Wolfe</hi> troubles all <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 18. 17, 18.</note> yet <hi>Eliah</hi> the <hi>Lambe</hi> ſhall

            <p>The ſixt and laſt particular followes, and that is the
erection and ſetting vp of a Winepreſſe in it, for the
preſſing of the grapes and ſauing of the Wine. And
this (ſaith one) ſhewes what hope the Vinitor concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of the fertilitie of his Vineyard: as if the Prophet
ſhould ſay; He nothing doubting of the fruitfulneſſe
thereof, made a Winepreſſe therein.</p>
            <p>About which Winepreſſe our Expoſitors are very
various in their iudgements: and yet the opinions of
the moſt of them haue ſome probable ground: amongſt
all, theirs ſeemeth probableſt who vnderſtand thereby
the <hi>Word</hi> and diſcipline. But for as much as we haue
not here ſo ſure footing as we haue had in the former (in
that we want Scripture for the ſeconding ſuch an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition)
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:23164:76"/>
I will content my ſelfe with this generall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:</p>
            <p>God hath his Winepreſſe for the preſſing,<note place="margin">Doct. God hath his Winepreſſe for the preſſing of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyards grapes.</note> pruning and
diſcouering of his Vineyards fruit.</p>
            <p>The truth of this I will endeuour to proue by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>Word preached</hi> is an excellent <hi>Winepreſſe</hi>
for this end: This diſcouers what is in a man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is compared to an<note n="l" place="margin">Matth. 3. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Axe</hi> put to the root of the tree,
becauſe it diſcouers who are ſound and vnſound, as the
<hi>Axe</hi> doth: For albeit by the <hi>eie</hi> it is not ſo ſoone percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
what trees are good and what naught (for many a
one there may be which is ſtrait without, hauing a
goodly top, and faire rinde, and yet rotten and hollow
within) yet when the <hi>Axe</hi> is brought and laid to the
root, and it felled, then what was before vnknowne, is
manifeſtly ſeene. In the ſame reſpect it is compared to
a<note n="m" place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Fanne</hi> in Chriſts hand, whereby he doth purge his
floore. Chaffe and Corne, good and bad, lie together
vpon an heape a while; but when the <hi>Goſpell</hi> comes (it
being preached with power and a good conſcience) it
blowes ſo mightily, as with the guſt thereof hypocrites
are ſcattered, and the faithfulneſſe of ſuch, as with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and good hearts embrace it, is reuealed and made
knowne. After the ſame manner is the Word compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto<note n="n" place="margin">Ierem. 23. 29.</note> 
               <hi>fire,</hi> which hath a double effect; to waſte ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and droſſe, and to purifie that which is refineable,
as gold and ſiluer: It enflames ſome mens hearts with a
zealous loue to God and his glory; and ſetteth others
on fire to perſecute and impugne it: And to a<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Sword</hi>
with two edges, which cutteth both waies, and diuides
betweene the ioints and the ſinewes, and the marrow
and the bones; it doth anatomize the hearts of men,
and diſcouer the ſoundneſſe or vnſoundneſſe of them:
And to<note n="p" place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Light,</hi> which maketh all things cleare and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
which before lying in the darke could not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
nor diſcouered. Thus we ſee the nature of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:23164:77"/>
Word, which like a Winepreſſe will make knowne what
is within; laying open the poiſon that lurked in the
wicked, and the grace and goodneſſe that lay hid in the
boſome of the godly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Croſſes</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> wherewith God
exerciſeth his Church, are as Gods <hi>Winepreſſe,</hi> By theſe
he doth diſcouer what is in his people that profeſſe his
name. Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid<note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 8. 2.</note> he led his people Iſrael fortie
yeares in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>For to humble them, and proue
them, to know</hi> (that is, to make knowne) <hi>what was in
their hearts.</hi> And ſo God ſpeaking of the remainder
of his people, whom he did not vtterly cut off in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſaith thus:<note n="r" place="margin">Zach. 13. 9.</note> 
               <hi>I will bring the third part thorow the
fire, and will refine them as ſiluer is refined, and will try them
as gold is tried:</hi> And <hi>S. Peter</hi> comforting the faithfull
in their afflictions, ſpeaketh after this manner;<note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Dearely
beloued, thinke it not ſtrange concerning the fierie triall
which is amongst you to proue you, as though ſome ſtrange
thing were come vnto you, &amp;c.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> after the
ſame manner calleth afflictions trials, and<note n="t" place="margin">Iames 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>temptations,</hi>
becauſe they ſerue to trie vs what is in vs, and make it
knowne. And indeed afflictions are blabs and tell-tales
(as one faith well) they will not conceale the truth, but
make it knowne: they preſſe out of the godly that ſap
and iuice of grace which is within them; yea the more
they are preſſed, the more the liquor of grace diſtilleth
from them; the more abundant they are in <hi>praier, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſior,
humiliation, &amp;c.</hi> But from the wicked they can
preſſe nothing but noiſome, ſtinking putrifaction; all
they ſend forth in the day of trouble, is railing, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and impatiencie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Diſcipline</hi> or the Spirituall <hi>cenſures of the
Church,</hi> executed againſt ſuch members of the Church
as haue fallen into any ſcandalous offence, the higheſt
degree whereof is <hi>Excommunication,</hi> and debarring
from the publike ordinances of God, and ſocietie of the
faithfull, both publike and priuate, are as a <hi>Winepreſſe.</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:23164:77"/>
And though it be not abſolutely of the eſſence of the
Church, no more than the <hi>Winepreſſe</hi> is eſſentiall to the
<hi>Vineyard,</hi> yet it cannot well be wanting in the Church,
no more than a <hi>Winepreſſe</hi> can be wanting in a <hi>Vineyard.</hi>
By and in the true vſe whereof, the ſinner becomes

wherein the great care &amp; diligence of this Vinitor did

            <p>
               <hi>Hee looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes,</hi>

            <p>His hope and expectation was to finde <hi>grapes in the

deceiued the hope and expectation of the Lord, and
(like a degenerated plant) brought forth wilde grapes:

<hi>ſtinking</hi> and <hi>bitter fruit;</hi> ſuch a kinde of fruit, as in <hi>ſmell</hi>

            <p>Two things then are here to bee conſidered:<note place="margin">Part 1.</note> Firſt,
<hi>What God expected,</hi> for his coſt and paines, <hi>[He looked

            <p>Before I come to any obſeruation,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> let me make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

            <p>The anſwer is,<note place="margin">Anſwer. Zanch. de natura Dei. c. 2. quaeſt. 13.</note> Gods knowledge is abſolute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,

and it is moſt certaine, and cannot any way bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
all things being knowne of him as they are, and
all things are as they are knowne of him. The future
degeneration and ingratitude of this people, the Lord

very treacherouſly with him<note n="i" place="margin">Iſay 48. 8.</note> This then is not ſpoken,
as if Gods hope and expectation were vncertaine, or

            <p>Now to ſome <hi>Inſtructions:</hi> and firſt from Gods <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</hi>
this we note:</p>
            <p>Where God hath taken paines in planting and husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<note place="margin">Doctr. Where God hath taken paines, hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects fruit.</note> there he iuſtlie expects fruit ſomewhat anſwerable

               <hi>I went downe into the

thriue and proſper, expecting in conuenient time ſome

doth propound<note n="m" place="margin">Matth. 21. 34.</note> of the Vineyard let out to vnthankfull
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23164:79"/>
husbandmen, is a pregnant proofe: for when the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
came and time of fruit drew neere, that great
Houſholder ſends out his ſeruants to thoſe husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that they might receiue the fruits: And in the
application of that Parable wee reade, that <hi>Hee will let
out his Vineyard to other husbandmen, who ſhould render

vs<note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 15. 2.</note> of his Fathers purging and pruning of the Vine,
he withall ſheweth vs what is his aime and ſcope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
namely, that Chriſtians ſhould bee abundant in

            <p>There is good <hi>Reaſon</hi> for it:<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> For<note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 7.</note>

What husbandman beſtowes his ſeed and paines vpon
his land, and doth not expect a good crop therefrom?
And is it not then iuſt and equall, that the Lord ſhould
looke for ſome anſwerable returne for all his paines?</p>
            <p>Let this then ſerue for our <hi>Inſtruction,</hi>

Let vs remember the end of all his coſt and labour, and

ſo many bleſſings from him: Let vs ſet before our

then ſay, whether hee hath not beene as carefull a <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman</hi>
for <hi>England,</hi> as euer he was for <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Hath
hee not taken vs out of the <hi>Romiſh Aegypt,</hi> where wee
grew not well, and planted vs in a <hi>very fruitfull
Hill;</hi> in a Land flowing with milke and hony?
Hath he not <hi>fenced vs</hi> about with his mighty protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Remember 88. and 1605.</note> and defended vs from many dangers and deuilliſh
plots, deuiſed againſt vs by the enemies of the truth:
So that neither <hi>Boare</hi> nor <hi>Beare, Wolfe</hi> nor <hi>Foxe, Turke</hi>
nor <hi>Pope,</hi> could yet inuade vs, or preuaile againſt vs?
Hath hee not rooted out and expelled, thoſe ranckling
<hi>thornes</hi> and renting <hi>brambles,</hi> (I meane the <hi>Papiſts)</hi>
and caſt out of this his Vineyard, the ſtumbling <hi>ſtones</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:23164:79"/>
of ſuperſtition, and baggage of mans traditions, with
the relikes of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> hammering and beating downe
the Popiſh Dagon? And hath hee not planted <hi>choiſe
plants</hi> in this his Vineyard, giuing vs ſuch Princes as
may bee compared with the beſt Princes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and
<hi>Iudah,</hi> vnder whom wee haue a long time enioyed the
<hi>Goſpell,</hi> with the fruits of the Goſpell, <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi>
ſo that wee may ſit vnder our owne Vines and Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,
conferring of the waies of God, and quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying
our goods and earthly happineſſe? No Church
vnder heauen more enriched with treaſures and gifts
from God than ours is. What could he haue done more
for this his Vineyard than hee hath done? And what
can he expect leſſe from this his Vineyard than he now
doth, abundance of ſweet grapes and good fruits?
Yea, in <hi>particular</hi> let euery one conſider this, and make
application of it to himſelfe. Hath not the Lord cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
thee aboue many thouſands in the world, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
vnto thee ſuch meanes, as hee hath not granted
vnto many, who by nature are as good as thy ſelfe art?
Hath he not ſent his ſeruants vnto thee earely and late
to call vpon thee, that thou ſhouldeſt bring forth fruit
worthy amendment of life? Hath hee not often trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
thee with his pruning-hooke of afflictions and
croſſes; ſometimes in thy friends, at other times in thy
goods; ſometimes one way, at other times another?
and to what end hath all this beene, but that thou
ſhouldeſt bee fruitfull? Thus ſhould euery one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
with his ſoule, and put the queſtion to himſelfe,
what God meant in being at ſuch paines and coſt with
him; that ſo thoſe fruits may be ſound in vs, which the
hand of God lookes to gather from vs: For <hi>to whom
much is giuen of them much ſhall bee required.</hi> Oh! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
then that thou deceiueſt not Gods hope; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
fruit of thee, let him finde it in thee.</p>
            <p>This point (though plaine) I finde ſo needfull to be

All which are neceſſary points to be handled in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting

            <p>To begin with the <hi>Motiues:</hi>

that only man ſhould remaine vnfruitfull; his faculties

Shall not euery creature be a witneſſe againſt man, and

            <p>Fourthly, The circumſtance of time cals vpon vs to

rather three times twentie yeares, than three yeares ſince
the Lord hath ſpared vs, as he ſpared the Fig-tree? For
as much then as he hath yeare by yeare, for ſo long ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion

it is now high time to looke about vs, and bring forth

and haue that ſentence paſſed againſt vs, which was

Much more might be ſaid for the preſſing of this ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie

ſo without the <hi>word</hi> no hope of this benefit. And this
that hath beene ſaid ouerthrowes a point of naturall and

perſons already iuſtified;<note place="margin">Non praecedunt iuſtificandum, ſed ſequuntur iuſtificatum. Auguſt.</note> and that which followes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the cauſe of that which went before. The fruit
cannot make the tree to be good, it doth only declare
and manifeſt that it is good, according to that ſpeech of
our Sauiour,<note n="r" place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The tree is knowne by his fruit.</hi>

            <p>In the ſecond place, that thou maiſt be fruitfull, ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
thou <hi>plant thy ſelfe by the running brookes:</hi> Seat thy

and increaſe, and make vs<note n="t" place="margin">Iſay 44. 4.</note> 
               <hi>ſpring vp as amongst the

Church as it was planted in a fruitfull field; ſo was it
likewiſe placed by<note n="u" place="margin">Ezek. 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>great waters,</hi> inſomuch that <hi>it grew

planted by the riuers of waters,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 1. 3.</note> 
               <hi>brought forth his
fruit in due ſeaſon.</hi> Is it then the true deſire of thy ſoule
to fructifie and bring forth fruit? See then that thou
frequent the Sanctuarie of the Lord.<note n="x" place="margin">Iob 8. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Can the ruſh grow
vp without mire? or can the flag grow vp without water?</hi>
Is it poſſible that thou ſhouldſt increaſe in grace and
goodneſſe, and yet neuer drinke of the waters of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loah?</hi>
It cannot be. If therefore thou haſt not in thy
owne fountaine, ſeeke to thy neighbours, and carry thy
pitcher with thee; for nothing can more dangerouſly
or vncomfortably be wanting to thy ſoule.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſee <hi>thou labour for humilitie and tenderneſſe</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>of heart.</hi> The ground which is hard and ſtonie is vnfit
for fruit, as our Sauiour hath manifeſted in that parable
of the ſeed<note n="y" place="margin">Luke 8. 6.</note>. For neither can the ſeed ſowen take any
root, neither will it drinke in the raine that the heart of
it might be moiſtned. It may be the outſide may be a
little waſhie, but it gets not in to prepare it to fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Thus hardneſſe of heart keeps the ſoule dry and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:23164:84"/>
barren. And ſurely here is the reaſon, why after ſo long
time of preaching, there doth ſo little fruit appeare:
Much water hath beene powred on vs, many a gratious
Sermon hath beene preached to vs, but what are we the
better? The inuincible hardneſſe of our hearts will not
ſuffer one drop of theſe heauenly deawes to ſinke into
our ſoules. How many handfuls of good ſeed doe Gods
Seeds-men daily caſt amongſt vs; and can they ſay with
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> that they haue reaped an hundred fold, as he did
in the land? Alas! So farre are they from ſeeing ſuch
an increaſe, as that they would be heart-glad of thirty;
nay of ten: Yea, let me tell you, many Miniſters would
be glad, if they could ſee their ſeed againe: and what
is the reaſon but this, that mens hearts are ſo ſtonie,
flintie? Labour then for greater tenderneſſe of heart,
if thou wouldſt bring forth more fruit in thy life; and
ſee thou retaine the waters,<note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 6. 7.</note> and drinke in the raine:
hold faſt what thou heareſt by conſcionable medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>thou must beware of ouerſhadowing thy
heart by any ſinfull lust,</hi> whereby the warme beames
of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe is kept from it. Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
haue euermore a great care of this, and will
not by any meanes endure to haue their young nurſeries
ouerſhadowed by any bough or tree; but ſo plant
them, as that they may enioy the benefit of the <hi>Sunne-beames:</hi>
for no ground or plant will euer proue good,
which hath not a fauourable aſpect from the heauens:
And thus our hearts are made fruitfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the heauens
anſwering the earth,<note n="a" place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 21.</note> as <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaketh (though in

and fauour vpon our ſoules; warming and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<hi>Pauls planting,</hi> and <hi>Apolloes watering,</hi> with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of his grace: for without him we can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 15. 5.</note>, nor haue any life in vs. And therefore beware
leſt through <hi>ſuperfluitie of luſts,</hi> or <hi>inordinate deſires;</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:23164:84"/>
through <hi>worldlineſſe</hi> and <hi>couetouſneſſe,</hi> or any other ſuch
like ſinne, thy ſoule be ſo ſhaded, as that this Sunne of
righteouſneſſe cannot ſhine vpon it, if thou wouldſt
grow fruitfull.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>a ſpeciall care must be had to the root, that that</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>grow well,</hi> if we would bring forth fruit abundantly.
Now <hi>faith</hi> is that ſame radicall grace, which muſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
be regarded: if that thriue not, no other grace
can proſper. Fooliſh then and prepoſterous is their care,
who ſeeke and ſtudie how to be laden with the other
fruits of Gods bleſſed Spirit, as with <hi>Loue, Ioy, Peace,
Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſſe, Goodneſſe, Meekneſſe, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi>
and the like, and yet neglect the looking to this
grace of faith. This is no otherwiſe (ſaith one<note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Wards</hi> Life of Faith.</note>) than
if a man ſhould water all the branches of a tree, and not

            <p>Sixtly and laſtly, <hi>we muſt be earneſt with the Lord, that</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               <hi>he would make vs fruitfull,</hi> and giue vs wiſdome from

and not only ſo, but withall ſeeke the prayers of Gods
<hi>Vine-dreſſers</hi> his <hi>Miniſters;</hi> and deſire them to be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
with God for you, that you may be fruitfull: for
how euer this vngratefull world contemneth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth
theſe; yet the truth is, they can preuaile much
with God<note n="e" place="margin">Luke 13. 6, 7.</note>, and if they ſhould not oftentimes riſe vp
and ſtand in the gap, woe would be to thouſands for the
barrenneſſe of their liues.</p>
            <p>And thus I haue ſhewed you the way, how of barren
you may become fruitfull. If then any amongſt you,
that heare me this day, doe hereafter continue barren
and fruitleſſe, it muſt needs be becauſe they are <hi>wilfull,</hi>
or <hi>ſlothfull,</hi> or both: for put in practiſe what now you
haue been taught, and I dare paſſe my word and pawne
my credit, that in a ſhort time, the barrenneſt profeſſor
in this congregation, will bud, and bloſſome, and bring
forth fruit abundantly. For what ſhould hinder? Is
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:23164:85"/>
there any fault in the Husbandman to be found? Surely
no: for we haue heard it before proued, that he is no
way wanting, nor defectiue; and therefore cannot iuſtly
be charged with the barrenneſſe of any mans heart or
life, as hereafter ſhall be cleared. Where then lies the
fault? Is it in the ſtocke or root? No neither: for we
haue lately heard how liuely and full of iuyce it is; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that whoſoeuer is ſet into it, doth incontinently
fructifie and bring forth fruit. If then there be any want,
it muſt be in thy ſelfe, in not vſing the meanes that hath
beene now preſcribed. Oh that men would now at
length be brought to looke about them; and ſuffer
themſelues to be ſo farre preuailed with, as to make
tryall of theſe meanes in vprightneſſe and ſinceritie of
heart. Conſider, I beſeech thee, with thy ſelfe, how
exceedingly hitherto thou haſt fruſtrated the Lords
hopes and expectations: as likewiſe in what a wofull
eſtate and condition thou haſt liued; and ſtill liueſt in,

vpon your <hi>Miniſter</hi> to preach for himſelfe; vpon your

your <hi>Captaine</hi> to leade his company for himſelfe: and
therefore let me call vpon you to doe good duties by
your ſelues, and for your ſelues: Let not <hi>great men</hi>
thinke to goe to heauen by their <hi>Chaplaines,</hi> nor <hi>Wiues</hi>

               <hi>ſeruants</hi> by their <hi>Maſters;</hi> by whom (vſually) they are
religious here, and thinke to be glorious hereafter. Let
me craue your patience a little in hearing a Storie, which
though in it ſelfe it be idle and fained, yet may be of
good vſe to ſet forth a truth vnfained: There was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
man (ſaith the Legend) which would neuer goe
to Church himſelfe; but euer when he heard the <hi>Saints
bell</hi> ring, would ſay to his wife, <hi>Goe thou to Church and
pray for thee and me:</hi> one night he dreamt that both he &amp;
his wife were dead, &amp; that they knocked together at hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

                  </gap>.</note> telling him thus; <hi>She is entered in both for her ſelfe
&amp; thee: For as ſhe went to Church for thee, ſo ſhe is gone to
heauen for thee:</hi> This is the <hi>Fable.</hi> The <hi>Morall</hi> is good,
and inſtructs euery one to haue a <hi>perſonality</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi>
and <hi>proprietie</hi> of <hi>fruit;</hi> that himſelfe ſeruing God, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
may be bleſſed of God: So willeth the Apoſtle,
<note n="l" place="margin">Gal. 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Haue reioicing in thy ſelfe alone, and not in another.</hi> It is

workes that he muſt giue an account of: For at the laſt
day the queſtion will not be, what hath he done? but,
what haſt thou done? And therefore let thy <hi>grand care</hi>
be to prouide an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to that <hi>Queſtion</hi> which will put
the greateſt part of the world to a <hi>Nonplus.</hi> See then that
thou <hi>preach</hi> for thy ſelf (if thou haue a calling thereunto)
<hi>pray</hi> for thy ſelfe, <hi>giue thankes</hi> for thy ſelfe, <hi>ſerue God</hi> for
thy ſelfe, and thus make the Prouerbe good (which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
is deuilliſh) <hi>Euery man for himſelf, &amp; God for al.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet to auoid all ſcruples,<note place="margin">Preuention.</note> I would not ſo be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
as if we might not ioine with others in holy
duties; for that we may, yea muſt: or that we are not to
pray for others, or haue others pray for vs; for this
ought to be: only we are not to content our ſelues with
what is done by them, vnleſſe we ioine in heart, and
doe the like our ſelues: Neither doe I thinke it a thing
vnlawfull, but fitting, if a <hi>Samuel</hi> be in preſence, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23164:86"/>
he ſhould performe theſe holy duties, be it in any fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and bleſſe the meat be it at any mans table (for at
ſuch a time, the Lord and Maſter of that houſe or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
(how great ſoeuer) ſhould giue way) But as for
children to giue thankes at their Fathers board (except
in caſe before that they are Prophets) I thinke it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.
Sure I am, Chriſt neuer put his Diſciples to it,
though they were men growne vp, and of ripe yeares,
but euer gaue thankes himſelfe. And therefore the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of many parents is too too childiſh, who make
their children their chaplaines; and if they be out of the
houſe, grace ſhall be out of the parlour, as if it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming
their worthineſſe, to call vpon God for a
bleſſing vpon what they eat.</p>
            <p>Secondly, our fruit it muſt be <hi>kindly fruit:</hi> For no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

the fruit God expecteth from thee, muſt be <hi>kindly,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the <hi>Author,</hi> which is the <hi>Spirit of grace;</hi> and

               <hi>As for fornication, vncleanneſſe, couetouſneſſe,

let it not be once named amongst you</hi> (ſaith the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle)

not a Saint once to name theſe things; much

what is that to thee? And what if many (it may
be the greateſt in your countrie, <hi>Maſter Iuſtice,</hi> or thy
<hi>Land-lord)</hi> will drinke till they be drunken; ſweare,
lye, and breake Gods Sabbaths? wilt thou imitate and
follow them in their lewdneſſe? It beſeemes thee not:
learne more manners than to doe as ſuch great ones
doe. The conſideration of whom I am ſhould teach me
what a one I ſhould be. Thinke then thus with thy ſelfe;
I am a tree of righteouſneſſe; a branch of the true Vine;
the planting of the Lord, whoſe heart hath beene ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with pure ſeed; and ſhall I bring forth ſuch fruit?
will ſuch workes become me? Good <hi>Nehemiah</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Nehem. 6. 11.</note> being
perſwaded to flie and ſaue his life, would not, but
ſaid to him that perſwaded him vnto it, <hi>Should ſuch
a man as I flie? and who is there that being as I am
would goe into the Temple to ſaue his life? I will not goe
in:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ 9.</note> 
               <hi>Now therefore O God ſtrengthen my hands.</hi> So ſay
thou when thou art entiſed vnto lewdneſſe; Should
ſuch a one as I doe thus? Shall I ſweare, ſwagger, drinke
to be drunke, or the like? I will not doe it: For who is
there being as I am; what heart hauing been ſowed with
ſuch ſeed as mine hath beene, would bring forth ſuch
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23164:87"/>
fruit ſo vnanſwerable thereunto? Now therefore O Lord
ſtrengthen my hands; giue grace to withſtand, for I will
not doe thus.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, our fruit if acceptable, muſt be <hi>timely and</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>ſeaſonable.</hi> This is a commendable property in our
grounds, trees, plants, that they bring forth their fruit
in due ſeaſon, as it is ſaid of that tree which was planted
by the riuers of water<note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 1. 3.</note>, whereto the godly bleſſed man
was reſembled. If our corne ſhould not eare vntill har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
was paſt; nor our trees bud vntill after Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer;
men might looke to haue but ſmall ſtore of
fruit, and to reape but a ſorrie and ſlender crop. Thus
the grace of our fruit is the ſeaſonableneſſe of it. God
himſelfe for our example hath<note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 3. 1.</note> an <hi>appointed time</hi> and
fit ſeaſon for all his workes.</p>
            <p>But is any time vnſeaſonable for the bringing forth
of fruit?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Yes: A good worke may be vnſeaſonable,
as well as fiſh or fleſh. For the clearing this wee are
to know, there is a difference of good things to bee
performed by vs: Some good things are as continuall
acts to be performed by all perſons, at all times, and in
all places; from the doing whereof no part of our life
is exempted, becauſe they reach to all times of this life
(and yet only to this life.) As for example, the exerciſe of
<hi>Faith, Repentance, Mortification, Amendment</hi> of life,
<hi>working out our ſaluation with feare and trembling, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
reconciliation with God</hi> (and ſuch like;) theſe are
daily and hourely to be performed by euery of vs: and
yet for theſe there are ſometimes and ſeaſons more fit,
(though all be fit) wherein if they be done they will
be more acceptable: As to repent in the day of our
youth, and to remember our Creator before our old
yeeres come<note n="x" place="margin">Eccleſ. 12. 1.</note>. Who will not confeſſe that young age
is a fitter time to learne the <hi>Horne-booke</hi> or <hi>Primmer</hi> in,
than old? yet it is better for a man of three ſcore to
learne his <hi>A. B. C.</hi> than die a dunſe: ſo for repentance.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:23164:88"/>
God takes no delight to pledge the deuill, and drinke
thoſe ſnuffes and dregs that he hath left.</p>
            <p>Other good duties we are bound to doe, that reach
not to all times and places, but are limited to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
place, time, and ſeaſon. As <hi>hearing, reading, ſet
and ſolemne Prayer, Singing, Conference, Almes-deeds,</hi>
and the like: and theſe are they that may vnſeaſonably
be performed. Take an inſtance. In time of publike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
while the Miniſter is <hi>preaching,</hi> here is not fit time
for any perſon to fall a <hi>praying,</hi> otherwiſe than by eia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
or lifting vp the ſoule to God: for hee is now
Gods mouth, and by him the Lord is ſpeaking vnto vs;
now it is no point of good manners to ſpeake to our
betters before they haue made an end of ſpeaking. And
ſo while the Miniſter is <hi>praying,</hi> for a man then to fall a
<hi>reading</hi> is vnſeaſonable: for he is now the voice of the
people to the Lord, and all muſt ioyne with the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
in that dutie. And let not this ſeeme ſtrange to
any: for it is an old policie that the deuill hath, to iuſtle
out a greater good by a leſſe. He can be well content,
that we ſhould doe duties for <hi>matter</hi> good, ſo we diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God in the ſinfull <hi>manner</hi> of performance of them.
Neither let any thinke I ſpeake againſt theſe duties (for
my deſire is that men would <hi>pray</hi> more, <hi>reade</hi> oftner,
&amp;c.) but only againſt the <hi>vnſeaſonableneſſe</hi> in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of them, which maketh our beſt ſeruice in
Gods eſteeme, no better than the <hi>ſacrifice of fooles</hi>
               <note n="y" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 1.</note>.
Wiſely then obſerue thy time, and bring forth fruit in
the right <hi>Quando,</hi> in the due ſeaſon: For know it for
a truth, all duties done vnſeaſonably are <hi>hopeleſſe,
fruitleſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, our fruit muſt be <hi>ripe fruit,</hi> if commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Would a husbandman reſpect that tree which eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
yeare doth bud and bloſſome (like many of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh
plants) but neuer bring any fruit to its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
And yet if haply he ſhould delight in it and nouriſh
it in his Orchard, becauſe of the ſweetneſſe of the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:23164:88"/>
or faireneſſe of the leafe, or flower, which may
yeeld a comfortable ſhade in the heat of Summer: yet
God will neuer. He knowes not how to intreat ſuch
<hi>whoſe goodneſſe is but as the morning dew</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 4.</note>, and whoſe

good purpoſes and motions in their minds, and ſo
begin to bloſſome; but within a ſhort ſpace ſuffer all to
fade. See then thou bring thy actions to perfection; let
thy reſolutions bee brought to execution, and ſuffer
them not to periſh like an abortiue birth. Thou haſt a
purpoſe to leaue thy vngodly courſe of life and ſinfull
trade, and take a new courſe, &amp;c. Thou bloſſomeſt very
faire, what a pitty is it if the froſt ſhould nip theſe in the
head?</p>
            <p>Many make their <hi>purpoſes</hi> like our <hi>Eeues,</hi> and their
<hi>performances</hi> like our <hi>Holy-daies:</hi> Seruants worke hard
vpon the one, that they may haue the more liberty to
play vpon the other: So doe they labour hard vpon
their purpoſes, but are idle and play vpon their <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</hi>
But purpoſe without performance is like a
<hi>Cloud</hi> without <hi>Raine;</hi> and not vnlike to <hi>Hereules</hi> club
in the tragedie, of a great bulke, but the ſtuffing is moſſe
and rubbiſh. Would ſuch bloſſomes bring a man to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<hi>Baalam</hi> and many other wicked wretches (who
are now in torments) would haue gotten thither long
agoe. The fiue fooliſh Virgins intended to goe in
with the bridegroome; but before the time their lights
dropt out. If a bare <hi>Intention</hi> would ſerue the turne,
<hi>Gods Church</hi> on earth would be fuller of <hi>Saints,</hi> and his
<hi>Court</hi> in heauen fuller of <hi>Soules.</hi> Good motions and
reſolutions are to be reſpected, but thou muſt <hi>vp and be
doing,</hi> elſe God diſtaſts them.</p>
            <p>A fift property of good fruit is <hi>vniuerſalitie;</hi> It muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

our obedience muſt reach to Gods whole reuealed will.
Euery Chriſtian duty thou muſt make account belongs
to thee as well as to any other: and therefore as a man
that is to plant an Orchard, will be ſure to get of euery
good fruit ſome: ſo, doe not heare of any fruit that good

the Lord for his many mercies; reſting onely in the

abundance of <hi>dead ground</hi> is there in the world, which
brings forth iuſt nothing? They thinke it will proue
ſomewhat a troubleſome iourney to goe towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and therefore they ſit them downe, and fall faſt

               <hi>damnation ſleepe not.</hi>
And what abundance of <hi>ground</hi> is there, that for all
Gods care and paines, returne but <hi>leaues,</hi> which are as
good as nothing? Numbers of <hi>carnall goſpellers,</hi> who
content themſelues with the forme of godlineſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the power thereof; boaſting much of this, that
they are harmeleſſe men, and no drunkards, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters,

All this is well; and I would to God, all you that heare
me this day could ſo boaſt Oh! how would it beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this Aſſembly? But all this is not enough. <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Diuinitie</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianitic</hi> which is ſo riſe, and
growes almoſt in euery hedge, is not the fruit that muſt
anſwer Gods hopes. The Parable<note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> dams the euill ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
for not doing good with his talent, though hee
miſ-ſpent it not: and <hi>Diues</hi> for not helping <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
though hee hurt him not. It is not enough that thou
canſt ſay, I bring forth no euill fruit, I beare faire leaues,
&amp;c. For thou deceiueſt Gods expectation, if thou
bringeſt forth no good; and what euer thou thinkeſt

And therefore, be more wiſe than to truſt to theſe faire
leaues and ſhewes, wherewith thou art richly decked,
and makeſt a goodly ſhew, as the figge-tree did; for
they cannot ſaue thee from the curſe. And yet a worſe

my Text ſpeakes of, which in ſtead of grapes brings
forth wilde grapes; that brings forth hedge fruit like

before ſhewed.) Howeuer theſe haue in them many
weakneſſes and corruptions, yet allowing and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning none, let them aſſure, and ſecure themſelues,
againſt all the feares of their owne hearts, and cauils of
Satan, or this wicked world, that they are truly fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and in ſome good meaſure anſwer the Lords hopes
and expectation. The husbandman (as we ſee) though
hee receiue not a crop of an hundred fold, yet hee will
thinke it well, and count his ground for good, and his
labour well beſtowed, if he might receiue ſixty or thirty
fold: So though wee be not the beſt ground, yet wee
may be good ground; as he may be a good ſeruant, that
is not beſt of all. And it is not good ground that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected:
it is onely the bad and barren, that God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

We ſee the fruitfulleſt tree that groweth, loſeth many
of her buds and bloſſomes; ſome are ſmitten with
blaſting; ſome are nipped with froſts, and bitten with
the cold and dry Eaſt-winde; and ſome againe are eaten
vp with wormes and caterpillers; and if the tithe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
come to perfection, wee thinke it well. Thus our
<hi>buds</hi> and <hi>bloſſomes,</hi> holy purpoſes and reſolutions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
periſh, ſometimes in the very thought, and goe no
further; ſometimes they come to words; we talke and
tell what our purpoſe is, and there it reſts: much adoe
there is to bring them into workes; the Deuill, the
world, and fleſh, ſo nip vs with their temptations; and
if we (when wee haue done all wee can) can ſaue the
tithe, nay the tithe of the tithe of our <hi>reſolutions,</hi> and
bring them to <hi>execution,</hi> wee haue done well. Looke
more therefore to the <hi>quality</hi> than to the <hi>quantity</hi> of
thy fruit, (though looke to both) and ſee it bee not
counterfait nor fained; let that bee thy chiefeſt care:
that as men ſay of their plums, and peares, &amp;c. Here is

<hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the <hi>Creatures,</hi> yea

Lake of Sodome, or the ſalt, or dead Sea; wherein there
is not any fiſh, or other liuing creature, (though it be
more than twenty miles of length) neither will it admit
any thing into it that hath life, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> a Iew borne,
relates<note n="b" place="margin">Ioſeph. de bello Iudaic.</note>; which relation is ſeconded by ſome of the
<note n="c" place="margin">Auguſt. de Civ. Dei. Hieron. in Ezech.</note> Fathers, and by all ſuch as haue trauelled in thoſe
parts. The report whereof ſeemed ſo ſtrange vnto the
Romanes, that when <hi>Vespaſian</hi> beſieged <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he
would needs goe thither to make a triall; and taking
ſix men that could not ſwim, he bound their hands and

but all ſwam like leaues. This <hi>Ioſephus</hi> witneſſeth he

him. Round about the brinkes of this Lake there grow
ſtore of vines, and fruit trees of all ſorts, which beare
grapes and fruit moſt pleaſant to the eye, as euidences
of the former fertilitie and fruitfulneſſe of that place; but
take thoſe grapes and fruits, and breake or bruiſe them

               <hi>he delighted not
in the bloud of bullocks, nor of lambes, nor of he-goats:
their Incenſe was an abomination vnto him; their new
Moones, and Sabbaths, and calling of Aſſemblies, he
could not away with; for it is iniquitie euen their ſolemne
meetings. Their new Moones and appointed Feaſts his
ſoule hated; they were a trouble to him; he was weary to
beare them. And when they ſpread forth their hands, he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:23164:97"/>
would hide his eyes; and when they make many prayers, he
would not heare; for their hands were full of bloud.</hi> The
<hi>Scripture</hi> for our vnderſtanding aſcribes <hi>ſenſes</hi> to God:
and here wee finde euery <hi>ſenſe</hi> diſpleaſed with their

            <p>1. They were offenſiue to his <hi>Taſting:</hi> for their burnt
offerings of Rams, with the fat of Lambes, &amp;c. he could
not reliſh; they <hi>delighted</hi> him not, they were ſowre to
his palate.</p>
            <p>2. They were offenſiue to his <hi>Smelling:</hi> for he tells
them that their Incenſe was an <hi>abomination</hi> vnto him;
that pretious perfume<note n="e" place="margin">Exo. 30. 34, 35.</note> which was made with ſo many
ſweet ſpices and pure frankincenſe, did ſtinke in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils,
the ſent thereof he could not abide.</p>
            <p>3. They were offenſiue to his <hi>Feeling:</hi> for their new
Moones and appointed Feaſts were a <hi>burden</hi> vnto him;
he was a weary to beare them: And though he be not
weary of bearing the whole world, yet he is a weary of
this burden; ſo heauy is it to his ſenſe, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
<note n="f" place="margin">Amos 2. 13.</note> he is <hi>preſſed vnder it as a cart is preſſed that is
full of ſheaues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. They were offenſiue to his <hi>Seeing;</hi> and therefore
he tells them, though they ſpread forth their hands, he
will <hi>hide his eyes.</hi> His pure eyes cannot<note n="g" place="margin">Hab. 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>behold euill.</hi>
nor endure to looke vpon iniquitie, and therefore he
muſt turne away his face from them.</p>
            <p>5. They were offenſiue to his <hi>Hearing:</hi> for when
they make many prayers <hi>he will not heare.</hi> Their prayers
were as iarring in his eares, as if diuers diſtracted Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
ſhould play vpon diuers bad inſtruments, ſo many
ſeuerall tunes at one time.</p>
            <p>Neither were their ſinnes only diſpleaſing to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but alſo grieuous to his <hi>minde,</hi> and therefore he tells
them, Their new Moones and appointed Feaſts his <hi>ſoule
did hate;</hi> which is an Emphaticall ſpeech, and an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods hearty deteſtation. Now<note n="h" place="margin">Iſay 7. 13.</note>

For <hi>caſuall defilements</hi> there is hope; but
for <hi>wilfull pollutions</hi> there is little. How can God dwell
or abide with vs, if we be ſwearers, drunkards, vſurers,

            <p>Herein let vs be followers of God, as deare children,
in manifeſting this notable fruit of the Spirit, when we
haue to deale with ſinners; which hath in it the very
pith of loue, which when it accompanieth a reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or obiurgation, it is as that ſame <hi>pretious oile</hi>

               <hi>which

to deale with their hearers; intreating, exhorting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching,
euen then when they may lawfully command.
In things of this life, ſee how men are faine to intreat
and ſue hard for that which is their owne; and heart-glad
they are if by any ſuch courſe they can gather vp
their debts. How glad then may we be, if by any ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
perſwaſion or faire intreatie we can gather vp the
debt of obedience, which our people owe vnto the
Lord? I will neuer thinke much to ſpeake faire and
friendly, ſo that may follow thereupon. And thus the

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:23164:100"/>
And ſurely when Miniſters ſpeake thus to ſinfull men,
and proceed after this manner with them, <hi>I beſeech thee
by the mercies of God;</hi> I pray thee that thou wouldeſt
leaue thy drunkenneſſe, profanation of Gods Sabbaths,
ſwearing, &amp;c. and be reconciled vnto God; it muſt needs
ſtrike deep into their hearts, if they be not ſealed vp with
hardneſſe &amp; vnbeleefe. Let <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> hence learne to
ſhew mercy &amp; compaſſion, and all tokens &amp; teſtimonies
of loue towards malefactors, euen then when Iuſtice is
to be executed, and puniſhment inflicted, that offenders
may ſee it is not malice, but Iuſtice that inflicteth that
puniſhment vpon them: and that it is not their bloud,
but their good and the good of others which is ſought.
And thus dealt <hi>Ioſhua</hi> with <hi>Achan</hi> after he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

For albeit he executed the iudgements of the

offending perſons, let vs vſe all moderation and
meekneſſe, endeuouring in the quieteſt &amp; mildeſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

obedience to Gods commands, which require vs<note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> to

to be iudged and arraigned) vſually to be heard in the

How can we ſee we imitate God like good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when

if we be alittle moued? Alas for vs! oh that we

with the veſſels of his wrath, &amp; learne more mildneſſe.</p>
            <p>But are we to deale thus mildly with all,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> may ſome

            <p>Surely,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> much patience and lenitie muſt be vſed euen

ſuch, who by milde intreaties will not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
And thus our bleſſed Sauiour, though in his firſt

               <hi>Bleſſings,</hi> yet in his other he

to doe that which tends only to the profit of him
with whom he dealeth? If a man of himſelfe cannot ſee
what maketh for his owne good, and doe it of his owne
accord, we thinke him well worthy to ſmart for his
owne folly. But here ſee Gods dealing with vs the ſons
of men, who deſireth and intreateth vs to ſit in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt our ſelues; and why? ſurely for this end,
that he might not iudge vs: for as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,
<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 31.</note> 
               <hi>If we would iudge our ſelues, we ſhould not be iudged of the

ſhould our hearts relent? how ſhould we be ouercome
with this kindneſſe of the Lord, who ſo graciouſly &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
requeſteth &amp; intreateth vs for our own welfare?</p>
            <p>And laſtly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> is God ſo milde euen when he hath to
deale with ſinners? and doth he proceed in ſuch quiet
and peaceable termes, euen with wicked and vngodly
ones? then let this ſtay the hearts of Gods people; for
aſſuredly with them he will not be rigorous nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme:
If theſe fare ſo well, certainly Gods children
ſhall fare farre better. Lift vp then thy deiected ſpirit,
and cheare vp thy diſquieted and perplexed conſcience,
thou poore one who trembleſt vnder Gods hand for
thy manifold infirmities, as the childe doth vnder the
rod, and be not out of heart or hope.<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 103. 8.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

            <p>In the firſt Chapter of this Propheſie, we reade how

willing them to plead the cauſe with him, as it were at

True;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> for though God be content to offer it, for the

yet it is ouer-great-boldneſſe and ſawcineſſe, for any

againſt himſelfe, there being none elſe to doe it:
Beſides many other, of whom mention is made in
Scripture, whoſe mouthes, haue beene opened to reade
their owne doome, to the iuſtifying of the Lord, and
condemning of themſelues. Hereunto tends the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
ſpeech when hee telleth vs, that the ſinner is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
and ſinneth,<note n="h" place="margin">Tit. 3. 11.</note> being <hi>ſelfe-condemned.</hi> Thus,
God loues to haue a ſinner accuſe himſelfe, before hee
accuſe him; condemne himſelfe, before hee condemne
him.</p>
            <p>See then here the vſe of conſcience,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> and what good
ſeruice it will doe: The Lord God hath ſet it as his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty
in the breſt of man; which though it bee often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a neuter, when the act is doing, and while ſinne
is a commiting; yet afterwards it will proue a friend
and faithfull witneſſe for the Lord, but an aduerſary
againſt man. Oh that the wicked would thinke of this!
who ſinne in hope of ſecrecie; why who ſees them?
who can witneſſe any thing againſt them? who can
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:23164:103"/>
condemne them, for ſuch or ſuch an action? Alas
poore ſoule! There is a conſcience within thee that
ſees thee, and will condemne thee; thy ſelfe ſhall paſſe
ſentence againſt thy ſelfe: Now thou canſt hide, couer,
and cloake thy ſinne, and plead in the defenſe thereof;
but when God ſhall cite thy conſcience to giue in eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<note place="margin">Conſcientia mille teſtes.</note> that ſhall bee as a thouſand witneſſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
thee for thy moſt ſecret ſinnes. Though thou
doe eſcape all apprehenſion and accuſation in this
world, yet thy owne conſcience will arreſt thee and
hale thee vnto iudgement: And albeit thou eſcape
mans iudgement, yet the iudgement of thy owne
conſcience thou ſhalt neuer eſcape. Neither thinke, that
what thou thy ſelfe knoweſt ſhall euer bee concealed:
thou art priuy to thy owne lewdneſſe, and knoweſt of
thy <hi>drunkenneſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quid tibi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt non habere conſcium habenti conſcientiam?</note> 
               <hi>adultery, theft, &amp;c.</hi> What art thou
the better then, in that no body elſe is priuy to them, ſo
long as thou haſt a conſcience within thee? Neither
thinke thou, that becauſe thy conſcience is now aſleepe,
or feared, and benummed, through a continuance in
the cuſtome of ſinne, that it will neuer be awakened, or
that this is nothing ſo: For as the poize of a clocke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
downe, all motion ceaſeth; the wheeles ſtirre not;
but being would vp, all is ſet on going: So albeit now,
while thy conſcience is downe, there is no noiſe nor
mouing in thy heart, all is quiet; yet when it is wound
vp by the iuſtice of God, (as one day aſſuredly it ſhall)
it will ſet all the wheeles on working; thy <hi>tongue,</hi> to
<hi>confeſſe</hi> and ſay, <hi>guilty,</hi> Lord, <hi>guilty,</hi> thy <hi>eies,</hi> to <hi>weepe;</hi>
thy <hi>hands,</hi> to <hi>wring;</hi> thy <hi>voice,</hi> to <hi>cry;</hi> thy <hi>heart,</hi> to <hi>ake;</hi>
and yet all in vaine. Bee watchfull therefore, and euer
remember <hi>Conſcience:</hi> Beware of hypocriſie, and ſecret
ſinnes, for though thou canſt hide them from men and
Deuils, yet not from it: And looke thou neglect not
the checks of conſcience. Doth it now checke thee,
and reproue thee, for thy waies? know the time
commeth, when that conſcience which doth now
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:23164:104"/>
checke thee, ſhall iudge thee and condemne thee; and
that which doth now reproue thee, ſhall hereafter tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thee in endleſſe woe, if thou repent not.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing this is ſo that <hi>Man ſhall iudge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

               <hi>iudge our

an eſpeciall meanes to preuent future condemnation;
and the more ſpeedily we ſet vpon the worke, the more
mercifully will the Lord deale with vs. It is recorded
of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, ſometimes King of this land,<note n="k" place="margin">Acts and Monum.</note> that
being croſſed by a ſeruant of his in the ſport of Hawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

made vnto the Kings threatnings (telling him it was
well there was a riuer betweene them) ſpurd his horſe
into the depth of the riuer, not without great danger
of his life (the water being deepe, and the bankes too
high and ſteepe for his aſcending) Yet at laſt recouering
land, purſues his ſeruant with his drawne ſword. The
ſeruant finding himſelfe too ill horſed to outride the
King, and ſeeing no way to eſcape his fury, lights from
his horſe, and on his knees expoſed his necke to the
blow of the Kings ſword: The King ſeeing this, puts vp
his ſword, and would not touch him. Behold how
humble ſubmiſſion and ſelfe-iudging ſoone pacifles
him, whom a dangerous water could not with-hold
from violence.</p>
            <p>Whiles men ſtand out againſt God, iuſt fying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
ſtubbornly flying from him, he that rides vpon

then will his wrath be ſoone appeaſed towards vs.</p>

of men, who oftentimes complaine of themſelues,

            <p>For anſwer hereunto: Firſt, we are to know, that God
here ſpeaketh of the ſufficiencie of the outward meanes,
and not of inward grace: That was done to this wicked
Vineyard, which if it had beene good, would haue
brought forth the fruit of repentance and new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The Raine fals, the Sunne ſhines vpon the earth;
the garden hereupon brings forth herbes, the deſart
thornes; whence is this, but from the nature of the
ground? there is as much done to make one fruitfull
as the other. Thus God had done enough, the meanes
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:23164:108"/>
he vſed were ſufficient, had not this people been of ſuch
a peeuiſh and froward diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly,<note place="margin">Resp. 2.</note> God ſpeaketh not here of his abſolute
power, whereby he can doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him:
(he could make iron ſwim, and cauſe ſtonie rocks to
yeeld forth ſtreames of water: he could raiſe vp of ſtones
children vnto <hi>Abraham;</hi> and giue Chriſt more than
twelue Legions of Angels to deliuer him) but he denies
that he was bound to doe any more for them than he
did. And therefore that cauill would haue beene but
friuolous (ſaith <hi>Caluin)</hi> for their conſciences pricked
them in ſuch wiſe, as that they could not eſcape by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fault vpon another. For albeit God doe not
pierce with efficacie into the hearts of men by his holy
Spirit to make them teachable; yet it will be in vaine
for any notwithſtanding to mutter that this was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to them, ſeeing that their externall vocation
doth ſufficiently cut off all pretext and ſhew of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
whatſoeuer. And now let vs come to ſome ſuch
Inſtructions as the text will naturally afford: And firſt
we ſee how</p>
            <p>God is altogether out of fault,<note place="margin">Doctr. God cannot any way be charged with mans barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> and can no way be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the ſinfulneſſe and barrenneſſe of mens hearts
and liues.</p>
            <p>In another place of this propheſie we finde the Lord
complaining,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Iſai. 65. 2.</note> that he <hi>had held out his hands all the day
long to a gainſaying and rebellious people.</hi> His armes were
ſtretched out, he ready to receiue, but they did gaineſay
and rebell, and refuſed to come into his armes. And by
the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> he telleth the people, how<note n="t" place="margin">Ier. 44. 4, 5.</note> he
ſent all his ſeruants the Prophets vnto them, riſing ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſending them, ſaying, <hi>Oh doe not ſuch abominable
things which I hate. But they harkned not, nor enclined
their eares to turne from their wickedneſſe.</hi> And by the
Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> he thus ſpeaketh;<note n="u" place="margin">Hoſ. 12. 10.</note> 
               <hi>I haue ſpoken vnto
them by the Prophets, and I haue multiplied viſions, and
vſed ſimilitudes by the miniſterie of the Prophets.</hi> The
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:23164:108"/>
meaning is, that he had declared his will, and made
knowne his minde vnto them ſo plainly, as that they
could not plead ignorance, or any way charge him with
fault. And our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt complaines thus;
<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 23. 37.</note> 
               <hi>O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets,
and ſtoneſt them which are ſent vnto thee; how often
would I haue gathered thy children together, euen as a
Hen gathereth her chickens, and yee would not.</hi> Where
we ſee clearely how God would their conuerſion (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

that not <hi>once.</hi> but <hi>often; How often would I haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</hi>
Often by the mouth of his ſeruants; often by his
owne ſelfe; as the louing Hen is alwaies caring for her
chickens; alwaies clucking and calling them, if they
wander out of her ſight neuer ſo little, that ſhee may
gather them and guard them from the miſchiefe of all
vermine: But they <hi>would not;</hi> they themſelues gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.
Where then lay the fault? And ſo <hi>S. Stephen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
of the Iewes; yea telleth them to their faces,
that they were<note n="z" place="margin">Acts 7. 51.</note> 
               <hi>ſtiffe-necked, and of vncircumciſed hearts
and eares, and did alwaies reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is,
the worke of the Holy Ghoſt in the miniſterie of the
word, and would not be wrought vpon.</p>
            <p>But the Scripture ſpeaketh of Gods hardning<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 7. 3. &amp; 10. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>

vnto him: And God himſelf commandeth <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to
preach vnto the people, that they may be hardned<note n="b" place="margin">Iſai. 6. 10. &amp; 63. 17.</note>, and
ſo not conuerted.</p>
            <p>True;<note place="margin">Resp. 1.</note> and yet in all this God cannot be charged
with any fault or blame. For it is a iuſt and righteous
thing with God to puniſh ſinne with ſinne:<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 81. 12.</note> 
               <hi>My peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none
of me: ſo I gaue them vp vnto their owne hearts luſts,
and they walked in their owne counſels.</hi> Thus then God
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:23164:109"/>
doth this for a puniſhment of ſuch as withſtand and
contemne thoſe gratious meanes hee offers them for
their good.<note place="margin">Pharaoh ſeipſum indurauit libero arbitrio: Deus indurauit Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem iuſto iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio. Aug.</note> If <hi>Pharaoh</hi> harden his heart againſt the

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And ſecondly, God doth not harden<note n="d" place="margin">Non inducen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do malitiam, ſed ſubtrahendo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam. Aquin.</note> by <hi>infuſing

haue laid vpon vs, in giuing out that we teach directly
or by conſequence, that God is the author of ſinne, and
only cauſe thereof. Now whether this be true or no,
iudge you. You now heare it taught, that he is out of
fault, and may no way be charged with the leaſt ſpot of
ſinne; he is moſt holy, iuſt, and pure in all his waies and
workes. Now therefore the Lord be Iudge betweene
them and vs.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſee how damnable and excuſeleſſe
ſhall the careleſneſſe of the moſt be in the matter of their
ſaluation: to excuſe and leſſen their owne ſinne, they
will not ſticke to lay the fault on God himſelfe; and
charge their Maker with their damnation: They ſweare,
ſwagger, drinke to drunkenneſſe, defile forbidden beds,
ſhoot at heauen with their blaſphemous oathes, and
then fetch from Gods decree and purpoſe excuſes for
theſe their outragious wickedneſſes. And why ſhould
fault be found with them? If God would it ſhould
be otherwiſe;<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 9. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath euer reſisted his will? and why
doth he yet finde fault?</hi> He hath decreed it, and his
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:23164:109"/>
decree muſt ſtand: If the Deuils in hell ſhould ſpeake,
what could they ſay more? We haue fallen, and God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it. Wicked and fearefull thoughts! When <hi>Adam</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 3. 12.</note> he blamed his wife; and <hi>ſhee, God</hi> himſelfe; and
we haue ſucked the ſame milke: but as it would not
ſerue <hi>Adams</hi> turne, no more will it ſerue ours. Ceaſe
then thou fooliſh one from charging God, or drawing
him in as an acceſſarie to thy prophaneneſſe; God would
haue thee ſaued, but thou wilt not: He labours to make
thee good, and dareſt thou lay to his charge thy owne
voluntarie badneſſe? Behold, God is ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guilty of thy miſerie, as that he giueth thee his
Word, his Sacraments, and affordeth thee all good helps
to mollifie thy heart, iuſtifying himſelfe by theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd
meanes of thy ſaluation, that he hath no deſire
nor delight in thy deſtruction; and dareſt thou charge
him with thy damnation?</p>
            <p>Thou ſaiſt,<note place="margin">Obiect. 1.</note> 
               <hi>If God would, it ſhould be otherwiſe:</hi> if he

thee to the end without thy vſing of thoſe meanes
which tend vnto the end: for that is the ordinarie
courſe which he hath decreed to vſe, and which he will

ſicke, and weake, &amp;c. becauſe if he would he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
health and ſtrength vnto thee without theſe helps;
I am ſure that all men would condemne thee; nay that

               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:23164:110"/>
Thou pleadeſt further Gods <hi>decree;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> for albeit thou
vſe the meanes, yet the end is already decreed, and who
can alter it?</p>
            <p>But ſecret things belong vnto the Lord;<note place="margin">Resp.</note> leaue them
to him: It is not for thee to pry into that Arke which is
couered with a curtaine of holy ſecrecie; not to be
drawne aſide vntill that day comes, wherein we ſhall
know as we are knowne. That ſigned and reuealed will,
written in Tables, publiſhed with trumpets, is it to
which thou ſtandeſt bound. Neither doth the neceſſitie
of this <hi>Decree</hi> excuſe: for God doth not by his <hi>Decree</hi>
force thee vnto euill; but he findes thee euill, and prone
only vnto it of thy ſelfe: He decrees that thou ſhalt be
ſo or ſo; and knoweth that thou wouldſt be ſo, had he
neuer decreed it: but ſeeing thou knoweſt not what this
his decree is, vſe the meanes, and condemne not God.</p>
            <p>Thus learne to chamber thy tongue, vaine man: for
God cannot be charged, nor any way blamed with thy
ſinfulneſſe and barrenneſſe. Lay thy hand vpon thy
mouth, and condemne thy ſelfe: for<note n="h" place="margin">Hoſ. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Thy deſtruction
is of thy ſelfe, oh Iſrael.</hi> Say not, what can I remedie
it, if God will not ſaue me; for what can God doe more
than he hath done for thee? God raines vpon thee his
holy deawes, and is not wanting in his purging and
pruning thee with his corrections. He hath giuen thee
ſtrange and excellent meanes; ſo that it is only thou
that art wanting to thy ſelfe: Heauen is good, but thy
ground is naught. A cunning Caruer can cut the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
of any creature; yet not on a rotten ſticke: where
lies the fault? Surely in the rottenneſſe of the wood, and
not in the Caruers cunning: that thou art not wrought
vpon, the fault is thy owne, and not the Lords. Thy caſe
is that of Ieruſalem; How often would I haue gathered
thee, and thou wouldſt not. If then thou ſmarteſt for
thy ſinfull and barren life, thanke thy ſelfe; for thou
art the cauſe, God only the auenger; thy bloud then be
vpon thy owne head, that which will die let it die. And
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23164:110"/>
thus much for the firſt point. A ſecond followes: and I
propound it thus:</p>
            <p>The wicked will ſtill continue wicked,<note place="margin">Doct. The wicked will ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue wicked, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all means to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</note> although God vſe
all good meanes that can be vſed to bring them vnto good,
and make them better. <hi>God had done what might be
done, and yet his Vineyard is as bad, nay worſe than
euer: A pregnant proofe this our Prophet giues vs,
when he ſaith,</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Iſay 26. 10.</note> Let fauour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet
will he not learne righteouſneſſe: in the land of vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
will he deale vniuſtly, and will not behold the Maieſtie
of the Lord. <hi>Such is the vile and curſed nature of them,
as that no mercy nor fauour can worke with them to
doe well; nay in the land of vprightneſſe, amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
occaſions and meanes of good, they will doe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly.
And thus</hi> Ieremiah <hi>to the ſame purpoſe;</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Ier. 2. 30, 31.</note> In vain
I haue ſmitten your children, they receiued no correction,

               <note n="l" place="margin">Cap. 5. 3.</note> O Lord, are not thine eies vpon the

and the like meanes which God affordeth vs for our
good, let vs profit by, and by no meanes ſinne againſt
them; for if we doe, aſſuredly God will require it of vs;
for good turnes aggrauate vnkindneſſes, and our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are increaſed with out obligations: Of all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
meanes he affords vs, he keepes a reckoning.
The ſundry afflictions<note n="a" place="margin">Amos 4. 6. 11.</note> wherewith his people were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
are by him remembred; and ſo the Sermons

likewiſe by him recorded. Since therefore God keepes
ſuch a preciſe account of the meanes he vouchſafeth to
vs, let it ſtir vp all to make better account &amp; vſe of thoſe
meanes: for otherwiſe they will be reckoned for no
other end, but to make our reckoning the heauier. So
many meanes will the Lord one day ſay I haue afforded
you; ſo many Miniſters haue liued amongſt you, and
warned you; ſo many hundred Sermons you haue
heard, and loſt. We reade that he tooke account of how
many men were won by a<note n="c" place="margin">Acts 2. 41.</note> Sermon; and ſhall we then
thinke he doth not take an account of how many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

            <p>Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes,<note place="margin">Text.</note>

            <p>Whether we take this ſecond member, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
made by God againſt himſelfe, for that he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
fruit from ſo bad a Vineyard, as (we noted before)
ſome doe: or elſe as a complaint made by him againſt
them, for nor profiting by the meanes; it is not much
materiall. From either of them both we may collect,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God takes it grieuouſly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doct. God grieues when the meanes of mans good is deſpiſed.</note>

and proceedeth (as it were) from a grieued heart and

            <p>To proue this point, remember what is ſaid of the

I cannot but mourne to ſee you ſo rebellious. And thus

Hee conſidering the obſtinacie and ſtubbornneſſe of

comming on, to come on with cheerefulneſſe? But if

we will not, then aſſuredly he will deſtroy vs, though

               <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 80. 13.</note> The Boare out of

            <p>

here alludeth to the manner of wilde beaſts breaking
into a Vineyard, which doe not only eat and deuoure,
but tread downe and ſpoile. And this notes a higher
degree of wrath than the former did. The enemies of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:23164:115"/>
this people ſhould not only trouble them and afflict
them, but ouercome them and enter into their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and not only carry away, but alſo make ſtrip and
waſte; hauocke and ſpoile what they leaue behinde.
This alſo ſets out vnto vs the rage and furie of the
wicked againſt Gods Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will lay it waſte]</hi> or, <hi>make it a deſolation;</hi> ſo
that it ſhall become as a vaſt deſart without any to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
it. And here we haue a higher degree than either
of the former: for though the enemie might ouercome
them and ſpoile their country, yet there might remaine
ſome Citie: and albeit ſome Cities might be aſſailed
and deſtroyed; yet ſome houſes in thoſe Cities might
ſtill continue: Or ſay it ſhould ſo fall out, that all their
Cities, and houſes in their Cities ſhould be laid leuell
with the ground; yet ſome men might haply eſcape by
flight, and afterwards returne, and build new houſes,
Cities, and erect new lawes and gouernment. But in
that he threatens to <hi>lay it waſte,</hi> and <hi>make it a deſolation,</hi>
all hope is gone. This is that which the Lord ſpeaketh
in the next chapter, where he ſeemeth to comment vpon
theſe words,<note n="y" place="margin">Iſa. 6. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>The Cities ſhall be waſted without inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant;
and the houſes without man, and the land be vtterly
deſolate. And the Lord will remoue men farre away, and
there ſhall be a great forſaking in the midſt of the land.</hi>
All which befell this people at their carrying away into
Babylon: and much more fully and compleatly was it
fulfilled after Chriſts time, when Ieruſalem was vtterly
deſtroyed, ſo that <hi>one ſtone was not left vpon another.</hi> To

            <p>To draw towards a concluſion of this point; let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one in particular, yea thou that heareſt and readeſt

thee, as well as to any other, and demandeth of thee
how thou haſt profited by theſe or the like warnings.

For hath he not often by the miniſtery of his ſeruants
come ſo home vnto thy conſcience, as that thou haſt
beene perſwaded and enforced to confeſſe thou art the
man he meaneth, and at whom he aimeth. And what
drunkard, or prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> is there here amongſt vs,
who hath not been at ſometimes or other told by them,
that if they repent not they ſhall be damned? Beſides,
haue not thine eies ſeene his ſignes and wonders in the

beene told of ſuch a childe, borne without a mouth, or
with two heads, or with one eye, &amp;c. why; take thou
warning, this is meant to thee, as well as to any other.
And hath not the Lord ſmote thee (hitherto) with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

And once againe I will demand of thee; anſwer mee:
Haſt thou not beene depriued of ſome faithfull friend;
it may be of a godly husband, a religious wife, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
and carefull parent, a gratious childe, a faithfull
Shepherd, or a true hearted brother? If it be ſo, take it
as the ſhaking of the rod, and as a warning from God
vnto thee, that thou mend thy manners. Remember

Be thou that wiſeman, not this foole, but foreſee the
danger, and preuent it before it fall. Oh happie man,
to heare this word, <hi>before it fall,</hi> ſound in thine eares.
As for many thouſands, it is fallen irrecouerably vpon
them alreadie; to thoſe poore ſoules it cannot be ſaid,
as now it is to thee, Preuent it by repentance <hi>before it
fall:</hi> for iudgement hath alreadie ſeized vpon them; but
how happie art thou, if thou kneweſt thy happineſſe in
that thy day is yet to come? And therefore I ſay to thee,
take warning by theſe things, and preuent the euill <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Euen ſo, O Lord open our eies, that we may ſo ſee

prophaners of his Sabbaths, contemners of his word,
and giuen ouer to the committing of all ſinne with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe,
and yet are ſuffered to runne on without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
which cauſeth matter of wonderment often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<note n="*" place="margin">Ierem. 12. 1.</note> in the hearts of Gods children. But ſee here the
reaſon;<note place="margin">Non ille amiſit prouidentiam, aut amiſit potentiam, ſed patentiam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercet ſuam, dum poenitentiam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectat tuam. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</note> 
               <hi>God is of a patient and forbearing nature:</hi> the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
thinke it is<note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> becauſe God <hi>is like them,</hi> a louer and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of ſinne: but be not thou deluded, learne the cauſe.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Admire</hi> the richneſſe of Gods grace in bearing ſo
long with rebellious ſinners. For God to beare
with his owne children when they prouoke him
is very much; but to ſuffer his enemies, and beare ſo
long with the veſſels of his wrath;<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> to ſuffer drunkards,
whoremongers, Sabbath-breakers, to runne on in a
courſe of ſinne, liuing day after day, weeke after weeke,
yeere after yeere, and neuer in all that time to ſeeke his
fauour, but to waxe the worſe becauſe they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,
this muſt needes argue an infinite perfection.
Oh, how can we ſufficiently magnifie ſuch a God as this!
how can we enough admire his goodneſſe, or ſet forth
his praiſe? Here is mercy, patience, goodneſſe, paſt the
comprehenſion of all finite ſpirits, and only to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by him whoſe it is.</p>
            <p>And thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> if this bee ſo, that God is of ſuch a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and forbearing nature, ſee what an odious contempt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23164:122"/>
of Gods grace it is to take occaſion by this patience, to
continue and increaſe in ſinne. In things of this life,
we hold it deteſtable if a ſeruant ſhould thus reaſon from
his maſters bounty; Hee dealeth thus and thus grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie
with me, therefore I care not how I prouoke him
and diſpleaſe him. And yet this is the reaſoning of
thouſands in the world: for thus ſay ſome (and farre
more thinke) <hi>I haue liued in ſuch or ſuch a courſe (as
I heare Preachers ſay of ſinning) for many yeeres, but I
ſee that God hath bleſſed me as well as the preciſeſt of them
all; I liue ſtill and thriue well (God I thanke thee) and
therefore I purpoſe to hold on as I haue begunne, talke theſ.
Preachers what they pleaſe, I paſſe not.</hi> And thus,<note n="y" place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 11.</note> 
               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſentence is not ſpeedily executed, vngodly men take
courage to offend:</hi> Dealing with God as birds doe with
the ſcarcrow, at firſt they are afraid; but ſeeing it not to
ſtirre, at length they come neere it and ſit vpon it: So
theſe, at firſt they are ſomewhat fearefull to offend, but
through impunity they harden themſelues to commit
iniquity: And yet (ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi>
               <note n="z" place="margin">Verſe 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Though a ſinner
doe euill an hundred times and God prolong his daies, yet
ſurely I know that it ſhall be well with them that feare the
Lord, which feare before him. But it ſhall not be well with
the wicked, neither ſhall he prolong his daies which are as
a ſhadow, becauſe he feareth not before God.</hi> Vnderſtand
therefore, oh yee vnwiſe amongſt the people; all is not
well becauſe God forbeares to puniſh: His patience
and longanimity, is no good argument of mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.
It may bee by the praiers of the Vinedreſſers
<note n="a" place="margin">Luke 13. 6.</note> reſpit hath beene obtained for thee for a while before
thy cutting downe, as was for that barren figge-tree:
Or elſe it may bee thy ſinnes (though hainous enough

Or haply, God thus forbeares thee, to ſhew his loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to deſtroy. How euer his patience alwaies tends
not to countenance receiued courſes, but to giue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to alter our accuſtomed euils. And what though
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23164:122"/>
his wrath comes ſlowly, yet in the end hee will make
amends for his delay with the weight of vengeance.<note place="margin">Lento gradu ad vindictam ſui.</note>
His mill grindes ſlow, but yet ſure and ſmall. And this
while he beares, he is but a fetching of the blow; and
the higher he lifts, the heauier it lights. Now hee is
preparing his deadly arrowes, this time he takes to fit
them to the ſtring, and becauſe hee meanes not to miſſe
the marke, he ſtands long at leuell, and drawes far, euen
to the head, that his arrowes may pierce deepe euen to
the ſoule. Take <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for an enſample, and ſet that
famous Citie before thine eyes; Did euer any people
taſte more of Gods patience, or drinke deeper of the cup
of his mercifull forbearance, than <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> famous
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did? How long did he ſpare them? how
many wayes did he forewarne them? And when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

we ſee in<note n="i" place="margin">Iob 1. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Iobs</hi> example. For as Sathan at firſt could not

good;<note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> 
               <hi>All things working together for their beſt.</hi>
Thus <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaid of his ſelling into Egypt,<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 50. 20.</note> 
               <hi>God dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it to good,</hi> though it was euill which his brethren in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt him. Thus the <hi>Caldeans</hi> ſteale <hi>Iobs</hi>
wealth to enrich themſelues; the Deuill afflicts his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in his hatred to mankinde; God ſuffers all this for
the triall of his patience: Man for couetouſneſſe; the
Deuill for malice; God for the probation of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteds
conſtancie, and aduancing his owne glory. The
couetous Extortioner, or griping Vſurer, ſpoiles thee of
thy goods; God in wiſdome raiſeth profit from it, and
by thy pouertie in purſe, helps thee to the riches of his
grace, and ſuffers theſe ſnares to be taken from thee to
ſaue thy ſoule; yet no thanks to them. Thus we haue
ſeene how God hath a hand in ſuch euils as are inflicted
on vs by wicked inſtruments.</p>
            <p>Now hence againe it may be queſtioned,<note place="margin">Queſt. 1.</note> why God
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:23164:125"/>
doth not rather correct his ſeruants by his owne hand,
and let his chaſtiſements come purely from himſelfe,
or by the meanes of righteous and iuſt men, than by
ſuch wicked inſtruments, who infuſe into thoſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the poyſon of their malitiouſneſſe and ſpleene.</p>
            <p>The execution of puniſhment,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> in it ſelfe, is a baſe and
ſeruile thing, and doth not ſo fitly agree with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the moſt High, who being the chiefe goodneſſe,
taketh his chiefe delight in doing good. Now becauſe it
is not familiar and delightfull to his nature, he doth it
not by himſelfe, nor yet by the godly, but commonly
allotteth it to the Deuill and wicked ones, as being fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
for ſuch a ſeruice. For doe we not ſee a Carpenter
hath diuers kindes of tooles? ſome are courſe, which
he vſeth about ſtones or grauell; others are choiſe,
which he vſeth about finer worke. Thus when God
hath ſome baſe worke to effect, he hath ſome reprobate
at hand, about which he is employed: but if a more
honourable peece of ſeruice, then he vſually fetcheth a
toole of a purer metall and finer making, one of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
ſhall be ſent for. He will not vſe the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi>
or ſuch choice peeces, but a <hi>Iudas,</hi> a <hi>Caiphas,</hi> a <hi>Pilate,</hi>
and ſuch like as they, if Chriſt is to be crucified.</p>
            <p>But how can it ſtand with Gods iuſtice,<note place="margin">Queſt. 2.</note> to puniſh the
wicked for afflicting of his Church and people, ſeeing
they are but his inſtruments in executing of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and doe no other than that whereabout he ſets
them?</p>
            <p>Know we that the <hi>will</hi> of God is <hi>ſecret</hi> or <hi>reuealed.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note>
The former was neuer propounded as a rule for vs to
conforme our actions vnto; but the latter, which wee
finde written in his Law, vnto which he requireth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
and obedience; and by it we are enioyned <hi>to
loue our neighbour as our ſelues,</hi> and by all good meanes
to ſeeke the good and aduancement of our brethren:
now thoug they doe the <hi>ſecret will</hi> of God (which the
Deuill and all reprobates doe, and cannot otherwiſe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:23164:125"/>
chuſe but muſt doe, will they nill they) yet becauſe they
runnefull <hi>butt</hi> againſt Gods <hi>reuealed will,</hi> the rule and
ſquare of all their actions, their condemnation is
moſt iuſt.</p>
            <p>Againe, they aime not therein at the glory of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
and neuer thinke of the effecting of his counſels and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
will, but only aime at, and labour for the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of their owne hearts luſts, deſiring to glut their
crueltie, and to aduance themſelues out of the ruine of
Gods ſeruants. See an excellent example hereof in that
Aſſyrian King, whom God ſent in his ſecret counſell
againſt his people to afflict them for their ſinnes:<note n="o" place="margin">Iſai. 10. 7.</note> 
               <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit</hi>
(ſaith the text) <hi>he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his
heart thinke ſo.</hi> His intent and purpoſe was to deſtroy
and cut off not a few Nations; that he might make all
his Princes <hi>Kings,</hi> and ſo himſelfe a mighty <hi>Monarch.</hi>
This then ſerueth not for their excuſe, that they are but
inſtruments, ſeeing they are ſuch inſtruments. Now we
come to apply the point vnto our ſelues. And firſt.</p>
            <p>Seeing it is ſo,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> that all afflictions and viſitations that
befall vs come from God, and are inflicted by him; it
confuteth and taxeth vs for a vanitie at leaſt (I had
almoſt ſaid a blaſphemie) deeply rooted and ſetled
amongſt vs: when any calamitie doth befall vs, wee
ſtraight cry out, <hi>Bad lucke, bad fortune.</hi> If any loſſe or
croſſe betide vs, oh (ſay we) what lucke and fortune was
this. In euery miſery, blinde fortune is complained of:
And ſo <hi>è contra,</hi> when any good thing happens, <hi>Lucke</hi>
and <hi>Fortune</hi> muſt be thanked for it; thus walking after

                  </expan> locamus. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Satyr. 10.</note> who held Fortune as a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe,
and aſſigned her a place in heauen; repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her by a woman ſitting vpon a ball; as if the whole
world were at her command; hauing with her a raſor,
as if ſhee could at her pleaſure cut off and end mans hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe;
bearing in her right hand the ſterne of a ſhip,
as if ſhee could turne about all things at her pleaſure;
and in her left hand, the horne of abundance, as though
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:23164:126"/>
all plenty came from her. Which palpable Idolatry that
was amongſt them, ſhould be renounced and abhorred
by vs Chriſtians. Yea ſo farre ſhould it be had in deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the very name of <hi>Fortune</hi> ſhould not once be
named amongſt vs, and much leſſe any thing aſcribed to
it, whereof we ſee not an apparent cauſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> ſeeing afflictions are inflicted by the hand
of God, this ſhould teach vs patience, as it did <hi>Dauid</hi>
when <hi>Abſolon</hi> roſe vp againſt him;<note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 39. 10.</note> 
               <hi>I was dumbe, I
opened not my mouth, becauſe thou diddeſt it.</hi> It muſt
needs be a bold audacious impudencie to murmur in
afflictions, conſidering God is the author and inflicter.
If our inferiour ſtrike vs, we reuenge it treble: if an
equall, we requite it: if a ſuperiour, we haue learned
this wiſdome not to repine; or if we mutter, yet not to
vtter our diſcontent. Thinke whoſe hand ſtrikes: It is
Gods, who-euer be the inſtrument; the blow was his,
whatſoeuer was the weapon. It is vſually ſeene, that in
corrections comming immediatly from Gods hand, we
are not ordinarily ſo impatient, as in thoſe which come
by meanes of wicked inſtruments; and what is the
cauſe but this? we doe not ſo apparently behold Gods
holy hand ſtriking vs in theſe latter as in the former:
Did we but ſeriouſly conſider, that it is God that ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
vs by them, we would be then aſhamed of our folly
in being angry at the rod without any regard of the ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
in ſnarling like dogs at the ſtone, neuer conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the flinger. Doe we not ſee how patiently Lords
and Nobles condemned to die, ſuffer the ſtroke of death
at the hands of the baſe hangman, ſhewing therein their
ſubiection and obedience to their Prince? Euen ſo
ſhould we, quietly and patiently endure all the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
that are offered vnto vs by wicked worldly men,
therein giuing teſtimonie of our obedience to God, who
vſeth them as inſtruments of his iuſtice to correct vs.
See then that thou doſt ſo: neuer ſeuer the croſſe from
Gods hand, though there be neuer ſo many inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:23164:126"/>
but <hi>Heare the rod, &amp; who hath appointed it;</hi> ſo ſhalt
thou with patience and meekneſſe beare that affliction
that is inflicted. But if otherwiſe; if when the croſſe
comes, thou art willing to ſee any thing rather than
God, running vpon inferiour cauſes, gazing on men, or
meanes, regarding more the ſtaffe wherewith thou art
ſmitten, than the hand mouing and ruling it; it will then
be intolerable, and thou muſt needs breake the bounds
of patience.</p>
            <p>But may we not haue an eye vpon ſecond cauſes?<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Are
we vtterly to neglect the inſtruments of our afflictions?</p>
            <p>In all afflictions,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> we are to conſider not only the <hi>action</hi>
and <hi>worke,</hi> as it is ſimply <hi>naturall,</hi> and the diſpoſition of
them to the manifeſtation of Gods glory and our good,
in which reſpect God is the chiefe author of them; but
alſo an <hi>accidentall confuſion</hi> and <hi>malignitie</hi> of the <hi>action,</hi>
which is wholly to be aſcribed to mans corruption, by
whom it is performed; in regard of which malignitie
and ſinne, we are to haue ſome reſpect vnto them, that
we may hate and flie that euill and iniuſtice that is in
them, and vſe all good and lawfull meanes whereby we
may croſſe them in their wicked purpoſes, and free our
ſelues from their iniuries and oppreſſions; hauing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the word of God for warrant, which enioyneth vs to
vſe all honeſt courſes, that ſpirituall wiſdome can ſuggeſt
vnto vs for our preſeruation and ſafetie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vſe 3.</note> if God be the author of affliction, this may
ſerue for <hi>direction</hi> vnto vs, what courſe to take in time
of danger, euen that which is giuen vs by the Prophet

               <hi>come and returne vnto the Lord;</hi> for it is he

ſeekes to the executioner and not vnto the Iudge: &amp; yet

            </p>
            <p>And laſtly,<note place="margin">Vſe 4.</note> ſeeing God hath a hand in all afflictions
that befall, this may afford great <hi>comfort</hi> to the godly,
in that they are not left into the hands of their cruell
and crafty enemies, but are in the hands of ſo gratious
and mercifull a God and louing Father; through whoſe
ſweet hand the ſharpeſt and bittereſt afflictions doe
paſſe. As for our aduerſaries, they are but as the rod in
the hand of him that ſmites: As therefore the rod can
of it ſelfe doe nothing, further than the force of the
hand vſing it, giues ſtrength vnto it; no more can they
doe any thing vnto vs further than they haue<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 19.</note> 
               <hi>power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them from aboue.</hi> Boiſterous <hi>Tubeco</hi> may haply diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may
vs with his thundering ſpeeches; but let vs know
there is an ouer-ruling hand to moderate and reſtraine
him. The ſwinging rod the childe ſees in his fathers
hand, may ſomewhat terrifie him; yet the childe may
certainly perſwade himſelfe, his father will ſo vſe it, as it
ſhall doe him no more harme than a ſmaller one would
doe. Let the wicked ſtorme, and fiet, and breathe out
threatnings againſt Gods Church and people; this we
know aſſuredly, they may doe what they can, but they
cannot doe what they would. And thus much for the
firſt circumſtance which concerneth the <hi>Auther</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicter

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:23164:127"/>

Gods lawes, let them looke for ſtripes. God loueth his
like a wiſe Father, aiming at their good; and chuſeth
rather to profit, than to pleaſe: and not fondly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminatly
like ſome fooliſh mother, who giues her ſelfe
to follow the fooliſh luſts and appetite of her childe: he
hath his rod lie by him, and will diſcipline vs; and if we

he is ſafe, becauſe he hath ſome aſſurance of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore cannot be depriued of ſaluation. For
though thou beeſt in the ſtate of happineſſe for the life
to come, yet thou maiſt fall into great miſery in this life
preſent. <hi>Dauid</hi> was as well elected as thy ſelfe, and as
ſafe from being condemned as thou art, or canſt be; and
yet ſuch calamities befell him, as made him<note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 30. 4.</note> 
               <hi>groane and
crie, yea roare,</hi> ſo that his <hi>bloud was dried vp, and his moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
was like vnto the drought in Summer:</hi> yea he felt as
great anguiſh, as if his bones had beene broken, or all
out of ioynt: and therefore be not high minded, but
feare. For it is not the vertues that thou haſt, that can be
a warrant to thee to fall in vice, nor yet thy profeſſion or
religion, no nor yet election that will keepe the rod
from off thy backe, if thou paly the foole in committing
folly. I confeſſe God will not wipe out thoſe, whoſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:23164:130"/>
names he hath written in the booke of life, nor damne
any of his elect which are in Chriſt; yet if they or any
of them wax wanton, hee will whip them to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
and make them tame. The Magiſtrate wee know
hath many puniſhments for offenders, beſides <hi>death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

beſides damnation; hee hath his <hi>ſtocks,</hi> his <hi>whip,</hi> his
<hi>little-eaſe,</hi> his <hi>purgatory,</hi> for his owne in this world:
though hee doe not reprobate them, yet hee may ſo
hide his face and coneale their pardon from them, as
that they may finde little difference betwixt a reprobate
and themſelues.<note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note>

               <hi>If the Lord be with vs, why then is all

But wee ſhall reade,<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 11. 36, 37.</note> that none out of the

               <hi>whom he loueth he doth chaſtiſe;</hi>
and neereſt to God, fulleſt of ſorrowes, as one ſaith<note n="y" place="margin">Clem. Alexand.</note>

this ſort;<note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 12. 5,—13.</note> 
               <hi>My ſonne deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the

whom the Lord loueth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth euery
ſonne whom he receiueth. If you endure chaſtening, God
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:23164:130"/>
dealeth with you as with ſonnes: For what ſonne is hee
whom the father chaſteneth not? But if you be without
chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, then are you ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards
and not ſonnes. Furthermore, we haue had fathers
of our fleſh which corrected vs, and wee gaue them reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
ſhall we not much rather be in ſubiection vnto the
Father of ſpirits and liue? For they verily for a few daies
chaſtened vs after their owne pleaſure; but he for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
that wee might be partakers of his holineſſe. Now no
chaſtening for the preſent ſeemth to bee ioyous, but grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous:
neuertheleſſe afterwards it yeeldeth the peaceable
fruit of righteouſneſſe, vnto them which are exerciſed
thereby. Wherefore lift vp the hands which hang downe,
and the feeble knees.</hi> See how large our Apoſtle is in
his comfortable exhortation: Surely hee full well
knew how hardly the very beſt are perſwaded that God
is with them in the day of trouble, and how apt the
godly are to make hard concluſions againſt themſelues
in the day of their calamity, and therefore is he ſo large
in his comforts. Faine would the Deuill<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 4. 6.</note> haue had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
Chriſt that hee was none of Gods becauſe hee
was afflicted with hunger; and the ſame would hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
perſwade thee of: but remember thou the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
conſolation, and relinquiſh not thy hope of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
in heauen, becauſe thou art recompenced with
iudgements here on earth; for in ſo doing thou wilt
but adde to thy owne ſorrow, and needleſly encreaſe
the weight of thy owne burden. And thus much for
this vſe, as alſo for this ſecond circumſtance: The third

<hi>Euill things ſhall be impoſed</hi> and inflicted on them; for

            <p>Before wee come to the particulars let vs obſerue in

cauſeth the Lord to depriue a people of them, and to bring
vpon them the contrary euils.</p>
            <p>This is that which is here threatned to this people,
becauſe in ſtead of the ſweet grapes of righteouſneſſe,
it brought forth nothing but the ſowre grapes of ſinne,
after all his paines beſtowed about it, he would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

breake downe the wall, and lay it waſte, ſo that the

by this <hi>hedge</hi> and <hi>wall;</hi> namely, the <hi>diuine protection of
the Almighty,</hi> wherewith they were compaſſed about,
ſo that their enemies could not once touch them to hurt
them; of this they ſhould be now depriued, ſo that
there ſhould be a gap made for their enemies to enter in
vpon them. Hence we inferre:</p>
            <p>Sinne depriueth man of the protection of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Sinne depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth man of Gods prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and laieth him open to the rage and furie of the
enemie.</p>
            <p>When the people of Iſrael had committed Idolatry,
in making them gods to goe before them, the text ſaith,
<note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 32. 25.</note> 
               <hi>they were naked amongst their enemies;</hi> whereby hee
meanes that they wanted Gods fauour and protection,
which is as the cloathing of his children. So when <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi>
the ſonne of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him,
had forſaken the Lord, the Prophet is ſent vnto him
with this meſſage,<note n="i" place="margin">2 Chro. 12. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Yee haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me, therefore haue I left you in the hands of Shiſhak.</hi>
The like we reade in the booke of <hi>Iudges;</hi> no ſooner
had <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell to Idolatry, in worſhipping <hi>Baal</hi> and
<hi>Aſhtaroth,</hi> and ſuch other Idols as the Nations ſerued
who dwelt about them;<note n="k" place="margin">Iudg. 2. 13, 14. &amp; 10. 6.</note> but God as ſoone left them,
and deliuered them into the hands of ſpoilers that ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them, and ſold them into the hands of their enemies
round about, ſo that they could not any longer ſtand
before their enemies. In the booke of <hi>Ioſua</hi> likewiſe we
reade, that<note n="l" place="margin">Ioſ. 7. 12.</note> when <hi>Achan</hi> had taken of the accurſed
thing, and tranſgreſſed Gods couenant, in ſtealing that
Babyloniſh garment, the ſhekels of ſiluer, and the
wedge of gold, they could not ſtand before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but turned their backs before them, and all becauſe
God was not with them with his protection, by reaſon
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:23164:132"/>
of that offence committed, neither would God be with
them any more, except that accurſed thing were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
from amongſt them. Hitherto tends that alſo
of this our Prophet,<note n="m" place="margin">Eſay 59. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Behold the Lords hand is not ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that it cannot ſaue; neither is his eare heauy, that it
cannot heare; but your ſinnes haue ſeparated betwixt you
and your God; and your ſinnes haue hid his face from you,
that he will not heare.</hi> And thus is the point made good,
that <hi>Sinne depriueth a people of Gods protection:</hi> It
breaketh downe the hedge and wall of their defence,
and layeth them open to the furie of their enemies.</p>
            <p>And no wonder,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> ſeeing <hi>ſinne is a breach of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made betwixt God and vs.</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I am God all-ſufficient;
walke before me and be vpright.</hi> Where the promiſe on
Gods part is to be an <hi>all-ſufficient God,</hi> to bleſſe, ſaue,
protect and defend vs; the condition required on our
part, is <hi>vpright walking</hi> before the Lord, in all faithfull,
conſtant, cheerefull, and vniuerſall obedience: if then
the latter be not performed, the former cannot be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
for God is not bound vnto vs further than wee
keepe the promiſe which hath beene made by vs. And
this is the ground of my propounded point, why ſinne
ſhould depriue vs of Gods protection.</p>

Wickedneſſe hath ſtrucke vp the drum, and wee may

altogether perſwade our ſelues, there is ſome ſecret euill

it were tumble downe the wall of our protection, and
ſeeme to leaue vs to our ſelues. Our great iniquities
hearten our aduerſaries: they profeſſe to build all their

            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</note> here is a <hi>commination</hi> againſt the wicked:
For if this be ſo, that ſinne depriues man of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Almighty, then woe to them who harbour
ſinne: How open doe they lie in euery part to the rage
and furie of their aduerſaries, Satan, Death, and Hell?
yea euery creature is aduerſarie to them, whom God
hath forſaken; and therefore they are not ſafe from the
rage of any. Oh the wofull and fearefull condition of
ſuch as theſe, who haue not God for their defence! In
what perpetuall perill and danger of deſtruction liue
they in! Can they ſay, they are ſafe in any <hi>Fort,</hi> in any
<hi>Caſtle,</hi> in any <hi>Tower?</hi> Can any place or any power
vpon the earth, or in the earth, or aboue the earth, keep
backe the ſtroke of death and deſtruction, hell and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?
Can any wicked man ſay with warrant, I am
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:23164:134"/>
here free from the dart of death: I ſhall ſurely carry my
ſelfe from hence; iudgement ſhall not ſeize on me in
this place? Can any of them ſay at any repaſt or recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I ſhall continue out this feaſt, or game, or ſport, to
the end, before my fall or ruine? This delight ſhall not
be interrupted and broken off by feare and torment
before it be fully finiſhed? Alas they cannot: for euill
ſhall<note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 140. 11.</note> hunt the wicked to deſtruction, and<note n="q" place="margin">Prou. 13. 21.</note> purſue
him, and in the end<note n="r" place="margin">Deut. 28. 45.</note> ouertake him, and ſeize vpon him.
So that as the Hare runneth in hazard and ieopardie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Greyhound, and is at laſt ſnatcht vp; ſo is it
with the wicked whoſe damnation ſleepeth not.</p>
            <p>True it is, no mens eſtates ſeeme to be more happie,
nor no mens ſtayes more ſtrong; and who more ſecure
than theſe men are? But all is not gold that gliſters:
Their hope is as the Spiders web, their ſtaffe they leane
on, is but an Egyptian reed, that will in the end breake,
runne into their ſhoulders, and lay them flat along the
earth. Their ſecuritie is but ſenſeleſneſſe and blockiſh
ſtupiditie, and well compared to that of <hi>Ionahs,</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ionah 1.</note> who
ſlept moſt ſoundly when hee had moſt cauſe to watch
and pray. The Lord is purſuing him as a vagrant and
fugitue: The officers of God are about him to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
him; the winde rageth, the waues of the ſea roare
and beat againſt the ſhip, wherein he was, and roule with
violence againſt the Barke, refuſing all other ſatisfaction
offered by the Mariners; ſo that all the company that
be with him are afraid, and compelled to crie euery man
vnto his god; yet <hi>Ionah</hi> is ſtill ſleeping vnder hatches:
Thus fareth it with the wicked. The Lord ſtands offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with them; the heauens aboue are cloſed vpon
them; Hell beneath is open to receiue them; Gods
fearefull iudgements are ready to lay hands vpon them;
the Deuill is at hand waiting when they ſhall be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

And thus are thouſands deluded by the Deuill, yea

For firſt we are to know,<note place="margin">Reaſons. 1</note> that the Deuill hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

of the Almightie hath ſo chained and bridled him vp,
as that he cannot plucke off a fether from the wing of a

him from God. It followes then, that he at his pleaſure
cannot doe the leaſt harme to man or beaſt to gratifie a

watchfull of himſelfe to doe miſchiefe. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
there is no more, nor leſſe hurt done than would
be done, if there were no Witches: for as the Deuill can
doe nothing to hurt the pooreſt creature, before he haue
power granted vnto him from the Lord; ſo when he is
permitted and hath his power granted, he is not ſo ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
as not to execute his power, except ſome Witch doe
ſend him: true it is, if he can, he will doe it, as intreated
and ſent by Witches (ſo cunning and craftie is hee) that
hee may doe the more harme, vſing them but for a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to drawon worſer matters.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3</note> the Deuill is the commander, the Witch is
but his drudge and ſeruant. He is the god of this world,
and ruleth with power in the hearts of the children of
diſobedience, ſhee is but his ſlaue and ſubiect, to ſerue
him, and not command him; and vſing her as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
hee wholly directeth her heart vnto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.
And therefore, whereas there be many natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
cauſes in the bodies of men and beaſts, of tortures,
lameneſſe, and of death it ſelfe; which though the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:23164:136"/>
and moſt expert Phyſitian cannot eſpie; yet hee
can ſee and know, and can coniecture very neere the
time when they will take effect; he plyeth it with the
Witch and enflameth her minde with malice, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
her to ſend him againſt that partie, vpon which
ſending, the man or beaſt ſuddenly and ſtrangely are
tormented, fall lame and die; and then hee telleth her
that he did it vpon her ſending and command; when
indeed ſhee obeyeth him, being led by his ſuggeſtion,
and not he her. The like is his practiſe when God giues
him libertie to ſtrike with bodily plagues any of the
godly, for the triall of their faith and patience; hee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uets,
if hee can, to bring it thus about: So that wee ſee
ſhee is but his drudge, and not he her ſeruant. Let vs
not then bee ſo deluded by this deceiuer, neither ſtand

            <p>True,<note place="margin">Resp.</note> yet this commeth not to paſſe through the

the ſtorme driueth him to his den and harbour,
but when it is ouer hee commeth forth, and is in danger
to bee taken of the hunter. Thus in trouble the godly
flie vnto the clefts of their Rocke, and get vnder the
wing of their Protector; but when troubles are ouer
they are in greater danger to be enſnared. Wee know
raine and thunder are many times better for corne and
graſſe than faire ſunne-ſhine: ſo here.</p>
            <p>Againe, God hath promiſed not to defend vs from

yet we be not forſaken; though ſlaine, yet not

doe we ouercome our enemies. Though we beare away
the blowes, and are ſlaine by them, yet God ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues
vs, and we obtaine a noble victorie<note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 8. 37.</note>. Excellent
was that ſpeech, which ſometimes <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> vſed,

putteth his right hand vnder their heads, and giues
them grace ſufficient, proportioning their ſtrength to
the burden; mitigating their ſorrowes, making them
poſſeſſe their ſoules in patience, yea to reioyce in

friends, to giue ſome token when hee was in the flames,
whether the paine were tolerable or no, for their further
confirmation) after his eies were ſtarted out of his head,
his fingers conſumed with the fire, and when euery one
thought him dead, and did expect the fall of his body,
ſuddenly lifts vp his ſtumps, and thrice (as a famous
conquerer) claps them ouer his head in token of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.
Thus the faithfull famouſly conquer when they

as much for Gods glory to preſerue vs in our ſuffering,
as to preſerue vs altogether from ſuffering.</p>
            <p>Thus then we ſee that our enemies could not ſo farre
preuaile, did not God permit them: neither would he
ſuffer them ſo farre to preuaile, did it any way tend to
his diſhonour or our dammage. Our God is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,

ſhall I preſerue thee? for whom ſhall I ſaue thee aliue?
If thou liue, thou muſt be a ſlaue vnto the Romanes; but
famine preuents thy ſeruitude: yea and the mutinous
Iewes are more cruell, than either the Romans, or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
Be thou therefore meat to me; a furie to the muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
and euen a mocke of the life of man.</hi> And when ſhee
had thus ſpoken, ſhee kild it, and boyled the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

for another time.</p>
            <p>The mutinous Iewes drawne by the ſent and ſauour

to ſlay her, if ſhee bring it not forth vnto them. Shee
tels them ſhee hath meat indeed, but ſhee had reſerued it
for her ſelfe, neuertheleſſe ſeeing they did ſo vrge her,
ſhee would bring it to them. So ſhee brings them the
reliques of her ſonne; at which ſight they ſtanding
amazed, and ſhrinking backe with feare and horrour;
the mother ſaid thus vnto them: <hi>This meat you ſee is
indeed part of my owne ſonne; it was my deed to kill it; eat
yee of it, for I haue eaten. Will you be more tender than a
woman? more pitifull than a mother? Eat, I ſay, for

his mother.</hi> Oh <hi>fearefull, horrid, inhumane</hi> act!</p>
            <p>The famine ſtill continuing, they are compelled to
begin to iſſue out of their Citie gates, and no ſooner
were they out, but they were ſtill taken and crucified
vpon Croſſes and Gibbets ſet vp before the walls, that
they who were within might by beholding of this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle,
be moued to giue ouer; but yet they continued
obſtinate and would not. Fiue hundred a day were thus
hanged vp, till there were neither trees to be gotten,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:23164:142"/>
nor any more ſpace left to ſet them in: and deſire being
made to know the number of dead carkaſſes which were
carried out of the Citie for want of buriall to bee
throwne in ditches as dung vpon the earth, they found
the number to be numberleſſe, ſo that no way could it
certainly be knowne; but out of one Gate the keeper
had noted an hundred and fifty thouſand dead bodies
to be carried out. And thus what with the extremitie of
the famine, what with the furie of the ſword, and what
with ſickneſſe during the time of this warre, there peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in Ieruſalem, and the Prouince adioyning, as ſome
credible<note n="m" place="margin">Euſeb. in Chro. Oroſius lib. 7.</note> Authors affirme, about ſix hundred thouſand

beſides others taken captiue to the number of
ninety ſeuen thouſand.</p>
            <p>The Iewes thus dead and ſcattered, what became now
of their glorious Citie? Their holy Temple it was
burnt; their ſtrong and high walls were throwne
downe; all the Citie became waſte and deſolate, and ſo
it remaines to this day. And thus we ſee what <hi>Moſes</hi>
there threatned, is here fulfilled to the vtmoſt: both
which proue my doctrine and make it good, <hi>That albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it

and there we ſhall finde that the mercies of warre

it feedeth vpon and deſtroyeth the people, as the fire
conſumeth ſtraw or wood: or like as an hungry man,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:23164:143"/>
who ſnatcheth at the right hand and at the left, and is
not ſatisfied, ſuch is the vnſatiable hungrie deſire of

            <p>

meanes of their good, and giue them ouer to their owne
wicked courſes, and hearts luſts, and ſuffer them to fall
headlong, as well into the euill of ſinne, as into the euill of
puniſhment.</hi> So wee ſee here dealt he with this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
he depriueth them of the meanes, with-holding
his paines, in pruning, digging, and the like: as alſo the
raine from falling on them any more, and ſo ſuffers
them to bring forth thornes and briers; noyſome ſinnes
and luſts, euen to their owne ruine and perdition. Thus
in the firſt chapter of this propheſie we may reade, how
that after God had beſtowed many and great fauours
vpon his people, notwithſtanding all which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
obſtinate and rebellious, and neither by mercy
nor miſery would be reclaimed nor reformed, but
would ſtill deſperately perſeuere in their defection; he
tels them plainly he would ſmite them no more, ſeeing
it was ſo that they were ſet vpon euill, and had as it were
ſold themſelues to worke wickedneſſe;<note n="l" place="margin">Iſai. 1. 5.</note>

(ſaith he) <hi>ſhould you be ſtricken any more; ſeeing you will

more correct you? for full well I ſee that you become
worſe after you are afflicted than you were before; and
therefore I will with-hold my hand, and leaue you to

               <hi>I will

would not be amended, he would lay the reines vpon
their necks, and with-hold the meanes whereby they

thus wee ſee it to bee true, That God will remoue and

            <p>But is it iuſt with God to ſuffer ſuch as are growne

            <p>I anſwer firſt,<note place="margin">Resp. 1.</note> wee are not to vnderſtand what hath
formerly beene ſpoken, generally and abſolute, as
though he would inflict vpon ſuch no kinde of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but more ſpecially he would not lay vpon them
that kinde of puniſhment which is called chaſtiſement

            <p>Secondly I anſwer, They are puniſhed euen while
they are ſpared, and that moſt fearefully: For what
greater puniſhment can bee inflicted, than to bee giuen
vp to ones owne hearts luſts, and ſo to haue ſinne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

            <p>And thirdly,<note place="margin">Philo. lib. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſ. ling.</note> wee are to know, that this world is

worke and ſeruice will God expect at our hands, and
the better. We doe not looke for nor expect ſo much
fruit of a tree that hath growen but a few yeeres in a
ground that is barren, as of that which hath growen
many yeeres in a ſoile that is fertile: and therefore it
concerneth ſuch as haue beene moſt and longeſt taught,
to ſhew themſelues moſt zealous, righteous, and
deuout.</p>
            <p>In regard of the meanes, you in this famous Citie

A ſinne and ſhame then it would bee for you to
come behinde others in your obedience. Looke then
to it, for aſſure your ſelues a leſſer and ſmaller meaſure
of knowledge, faith, obedience, &amp;c. will be accepted in
others, than will or can be in you, becauſe your meanes
are more. In this reſpect, Chriſt<note n="u" place="margin">Matth. 11. 21, 22.</note> deemeth the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

more meanes to make them good than the other had:
And ſo it will bee with you; for if you bring forth no

the faithfulleſt labourers, and workemen, are often
tongue-tied; and though they be <hi>Clouds</hi> thicke and
full, and likely enough to drop downe ſhowres: yet
when they come to the place of exerciſing this their

               <hi>It is required in ſtewards that

be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi> deliuering not for Doctrine
mens precepts, nor the fancies and inuentions of our
owne braines, which fill full of winde and not ſound
nouriſhment: And ſecondly, giue euery one their part
out of the wholeſome word of life; Comfort to whom
comfort belongs, and Iudgement to whom iudgement
belongs; making difference: not ſeruing all alike, nor
ſending that to the Maſters board, which was prouided
for the men (for there is no faithfulneſſe in this) but ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
before euery one what is fitteſt for him; giuing the
bread of conſolation to the childe, and the whip and

whereby holy doctrine is faſtened, as with nailes, by the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:23164:152"/>
Maſters of Aſſemblies. And the want of this is the
cauſe why many mens paines are ſo liueleſſe, fruitleſſe:
for as a rich man diſcourſing of bread to a hungrie beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
or a Phyſitian deſcribing his Patients diſeaſe, and
leauing him to himſelfe; ſo is a Preacher not applying.
Or as a whole loafe ſet before children would doe them
no good; for they might ſtarue well enough vnleſſe it
be diuided: So is a generall Doctrine amongſt our

not applied, it ſeldome is ſo to them. I end this Vſe with
a Meditation of a Worthy of our times:<note n="x" place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Halls</hi> Vowes and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, third Cent. Med. 35.</note> 
               <hi>Thoſe that
are all in Exhertation, no whit in Doctrine, are like to
them that ſnuffe the candle, but powre not in oyle. Thoſe
that are all in Doctrine, and nothing in Exhortation,
drowne the wike in oile, but light it not, making it fit for
vſe, if it had fire put to it; but as it is rather capable of
good, than profitable in preſent. Doctrine without Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
makes men all braine, no heart. Exhortation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Doctrine, makes the heart full, but leaues the braine
emptie. Both together makes a man: One makes him
wiſe, the other good: One ſerues that we may know our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
the other that we may performe it. In both which wee
muſt labour, and who can ſay in whether moſt? Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
practiſe vnleſſe they know; and in vaine they know, if
they practiſe not.</hi> Let none thinke I take vpon mee to

            <p>And now for <hi>Hearers,</hi>

meekneſſe the word to be brought home, and applied
cloſe vnto their conſciences, and quietly to receiue that
which is their appointment. In theſe miſiudging daies
(ſaith one) it is a hard matter to ouerreach the Deuill:
if we let ſinne alone, his kingdome flouriſheth; if wee
ſtrike at him, and hit not the bough he ſits on, we moue
him not: if we hit him, by taking the very ſinne on the
head, then we are iudged partial, perſonall, and wreakers

we ſhould pleaſe you well enough; but becauſe we

if it were profitable for you, it were peaceable for
vs to ſhoot at Rouers, and ſpeake at randome; but both
our dutie and your neceſſitie cals for particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Art thou a blaſphemer, a Sabbath-breaker, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
vſurer, or ſuch like? Why then thou haſt thy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appointed thee, and that is brimſtone and fire: it is
ſomewhat hot indeed; but this is the portion of thy
cup<note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 11. 6.</note>, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh; this is appointed for thee
to drinke. Art thou angry with thy Miniſter for telling
thee this? If thou beeſt, thou haſt little reaſon for it:
For where is the fault, in thee or him? I pray thee hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
repent, and amend thy life, and ſuch things ſhall
not be ſpoken to thee: become a childe, and thou ſhalt
haue a childs part, the <hi>bread</hi> of <hi>conſolation.</hi> But while
thou continueſt thus <hi>profane</hi> and diſſolute, looke for no
other than the <hi>whip</hi> of <hi>reprehenſion;</hi> and content thy

            <p>Yea let euery one helpe the Miniſter in this his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
and learne to apply what is taught, to their owne
conſciences, <hi>accuſing</hi> or <hi>excuſing.</hi> We vſually heare the
word, as we doe newes out of forraigne Countries, as
not pertaining to our ſelues; and come to heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as women come to coſtly banquets, to pocket vp
and carry away for others that are at home, more than
for themſelues: or as they doe at Feaſts, laying libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
on their neighbours trenchers, letting their owne
lie empty. Thus when we heare any ſinne threatned,
or diſgraced, we can poſt it off to others; <hi>Oh ſuch a
one is met withall, and that is for him.</hi> But heare not ſo
idly: the Lord ſpeakes to thee, and intends that <hi>exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
or <hi>reprehenſion</hi> to thy ſoule; take it then as ſpoken
to thy ſelfe. Is it <hi>comfort? Repent</hi> and <hi>beleeue,</hi> and it
is meant to thee. Is it <hi>Iudgement?</hi> If thou <hi>repenteſt not,</hi>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:23164:153"/>
it is to thee as ſurely as if he had named thee. And this is
the way to heare ſauingly. So much in generall.</p>

               <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 6. 13.</note> that kingdome,

the wicked make him ſo, ſuffering him to rule ouer

Satans power that makes him a God, but mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

obedience, which moſt giue him, make againſt what is
now taught: for we may not meaſure and eſteeme of
ſoueraigntie and authoritie by the obedience or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of ſubiects, but by the right of authoritie which
any hath ouer a land or people. What if moſt men ſhould
not obey their Prince, but his enemie; would it follow
hereupon, that he ſhould not be their Lord, but that

they beware of ouer-raſh cenſuring of parents, for the
looſe cariage of their children; we haue ſeene it cleared
by a cloud of witneſſes, that reformed men haue had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed
children, as circumciſed parents begot chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which were vncircumciſed. And though it be true
amongſt irrationall creatures, that they euer bring forth

as vnlike a diſpoſition. To condemne then the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
vpon this ground, for that the childe is diſſolute, is
too too raſh; for in ſo doing we may condemne the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of the iuſt. And thus much for this firſt point:
now a ſecond followes.</p>
            <p>Theſe people, as we ſee, were called by the name of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah;</hi> good names both, and honourable:
one ſignifieth a <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Preuailer</hi> with God; and the
other ſignifieth <hi>Confeſſion</hi> or <hi>Praiſe:</hi> and yet this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were retchleſſe, diſſolute. Hence learne we,</p>
            <p>Good names and titles profit nothing at all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Good names and titles no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth without grace.</note> if our liues
be not conformable to thoſe names and titles that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caine,</hi> a good name, ſignifying a <hi>poſſeſſion;</hi> but what
is he the better for it, when he is a <hi>Murderer</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 4. 8.</note>? So <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom</hi>
which made warre againſt his father, had the name
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:23164:158"/>
and made goodlieſt ſhew to be <hi>his fathers peace,</hi> and yet
he proued to be his greateſt<note n="n" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 33.</note> heart ſmart. <hi>Iudas</hi> his
name was good, and proclaimed him to be a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi>
but what doth that auaile him, when by his deeds he
ſhewed himſelfe a deuill<note n="o" place="margin">Iohn 6. 70.</note>? Thus the Iewes bragged,
they were<note n="p" place="margin">Iohn 8. 33.</note> 
               <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; but alas, will it profit them
when they are the ſeruants of ſinne? ſurely it cannot
profit them at all.</p>
            <p>And no wonder,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> for God reſpecteth truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, and not outward titles; he regardeth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
more than ſhadowes.</p>
            <p>This being ſo;<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> let none content themſelues with
their good names, or outward titles of honour that are
giuen them; but let them vſe them as a ſpurre, to ſtirre
them vp to imitate ſuch good men as haue beene before
ſo named; and ſurely this was one reaſon why this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were thus called by the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they
might hereby be put in minde of their pedegree, and ſo
of their predeceſſors pietie; and conſequently to make
them aſhamed of their owne apoſtacie; who were ſo far
degenerated from thoſe religious men of whom they
were deſcended. Neither content thy ſelfe with that
honorable title of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or of a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> or of a
<hi>Proteſtant,</hi> vnleſſe thou makeſt good thoſe names by a
holy and godly life. Tell me then thou that art thus
called; haſt thou thoſe gifts and graces which thoſe
names import? haſt thou receiued an ointment from
that holy one? hath he opened thy eies, quickened thy
dead heart, ſanctified thy vncleane affections? If it be
thus, then indeed theſe names and titles are well befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thee: but if it be otherwiſe with thee; if thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt
looſely and prophanely, thou maiſt bluſh ſo often as
thou heareſt thy ſelfe called <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> or the
like: for thou art nick-named and miſcalled: It is as if
a <hi>Cobler</hi> ſhould be called <hi>worſhipfull;</hi> or a <hi>Carr-man, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable:</hi>
and who could away with that? Nay more,
it is a kinde of ſacriledge, vnder thoſe holy names to
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:23164:158"/>
liue an vnholy life. <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> ſinned againſt God by
exceſſe and intemperancie in his eating and drinking:
but in that he abuſed the holy veſſels of the houſe of
God, to ſerue him to ſuch prophane and vnholy vſes,
was a ſinne more fearefull, and ſacriledge moſt horrible.
Thus for thee, as thou art a <hi>man,</hi> to ſinne, prouokes Gods
wrath, and deſerues damnation: but to ſinne vnder the
<hi>Chriſtian name,</hi> and commit wickedneſſe, as thou art a
<hi>Goſpeller,</hi> it is with <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> to abuſe and prophane
the holy veſſels of Gods houſe; and this muſt needs
plunge thee into the hotteſt fire of hell.<note place="margin">Mountaignes</note> To conclude
this vſe,<note place="margin">Eſſaies.</note> let me tell you what I haue read of a libidinous
Gentleman; who ſporting with a Curtezan in a houſe
of ſinne, happened to aske her name, which ſhe ſaid was
<hi>Mary:</hi> whereat he was ſtricken with ſuch a remorſe and
reuerence, that he inſtantly, not only caſt off the harlot,
but amended his future life. Art thou called a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and yet followeſt drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, &amp;c. let
that very name cauſe thee to be aſhamed of thy folly.
Let all apply what I forbeare to amplifie.</p>
            <p>Further, in that theſe people haue theſe titles, <hi>Iſrael,
Iudah,</hi> (the names of their forefathers) giuen them as
titles of honour, and names of excellency, we learne
a third leſſon: And obſerue another note, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

no whit at all diſgrace their children by their pietie and
godlineſſe, but much countenance and grace them by it,
inſomuch that it is an honour for poſteritie to deſcend
from ſuch worthie Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomons</hi> Prouerbe may be a ſufficient proofe hereof:
<note n="r" place="margin">Pro. 17. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Childrens children are the crowne of the elders, and the

that might be brought, for the confirming of this
truth; as of <hi>Abraham,</hi> what an honourable title was it
accounted to be called the ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and childe

               <hi>They were Abrahams ſeed, and they had Abraham to

in his ſteps, and were like him in grace. And ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in <hi>Dauid,</hi> what an excellent prerogatiue was it
accounted to be, to deſcend from him and be of his
Family?</p>
            <p>For ſuch are the ſeed of Princes and linage of Kings;<note place="margin">Reaſ.</note>
for thus hath God aduanced the godly to be<note n="t" place="margin">Reuel. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Kings,
Prieſts and Prophets</hi> vnto himſelfe: they come of the
nobleſt Houſe and Family that is, whoſe originall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not out of ſome corner of the earth; but they
ſpring of Chriſt, of whom all the Families in heauen and
earth are called. And this is right and proper Nobilitie
indeed.</p>
            <p>This being ſo,<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> it firſt <hi>reproueth</hi> ſuch Parents, as hope
to bring credit and renowne to their poſterities, by their
lewd and ſinfull courſes; they liue miſerably and deale
vniuſtly, and open the mouths of all to crie out vpon
their falſhood and deceit, their couetouſneſſe and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and yet thinke to raiſe vp their houſes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
their names, and adorne their children with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and eſtimation. But this truth may diſcouer vnto
ſuch parents, their folly and great madneſſe; for, this is
not the way to bring credit, but diſgrace to their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities;
yea when they are dead and rotten, their euill
courſes will be caſt as dung in the faces of ſuch as they
leaue behinde, as experience makes good: Such a man
(ſaith one) was this childes father; What, that Vſurer,
that Worldling, that Extortioner, that Drunkard, that
Whore-maſter, ſaith another? How can thy childe ſtand
by and heare this without red cheekes?<note place="margin">Firſt ſtep to Heauen. 42.</note> it muſt needs
be matter of ſhame and griefe vnto him. Wouldſt thou
indeed be an ornament to thy childe, and childs childe
after thee? then ſee thou be righteous and religious,
and ſo thy name ſhal be remembred in them when thou
art dead. Oh what a credit is it now accounted, to be of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:23164:159"/>
the poſteritie of <hi>Latimer, Bradford, Ridley,</hi> and other of
thoſe men of God, who ſuffered for the truth? How are
ſuch eſteemed and accounted of amongſt all? Let ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
make thee wiſe: and ſo liue thou, that thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
alſo may account it their honour, not their ſhame,
to name thee when thou attraked vp in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</note> let <hi>Children</hi> who haue had, or haue, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and religious parents, be thankfull for them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their Gentry more in their forefathers vertues that
they had, than in their great lands and reuenewes that
they poſſeſſed; eſteeming them the worthieſt of all
their Anceſtors, who were the godlieſt, rather than they
who were the wealthieſt. And withall, let ſuch be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp to tread in their fathers ſteps: for all that hath
beene ſaid is with this <hi>prouiſo,</hi> that we their children be
adorned with their gifts and vertues. For though wee
deſcend from godly and worthy Anceſtors, yet if wee
<note n="u" place="margin">Ezek. 18. 10. 13.</note> degenerate from them, as a baſe and baſtard brood, it
can be no honour, credit, comfort nor commendation
to vs. Put caſe a man haue a thouſand pound land a
yeere left him by his friends, and he ſpend it all (like the
Prodigall)<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 15.</note> in riotous and voluptuous liuing; what
credit is it for him to brag that ſuch an eſtate was left
him? nay is it not a ſhame? So if the vertues of thy
parents liue in thee, it is then a grace vnto thee, that
thou deſcendedſt from their loynes; otherwiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
The very Heathen<note n="x" place="margin">Ouid. Metam. lib. 13.</note> haue rather chooſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
of vnnoble parents,<note place="margin">Juuenal. Sat. 8.</note> ſo themſelues were noble and
renowned through vertue, than to come of worthy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and progenitors, and themſelues to grow baſe
and degenerate out of kinde. So it is better to be reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and the ſonne of wicked parents, than being the
ſonne of godly parents to be wicked. <hi>Cain, Cham, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>
and <hi>Eſau</hi> might boaſt of <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham,
Iſaac,</hi> the nobleſt parents; who on the other ſide might
bluſh and grieue at ſuch degenerate iſſues. Walke then
in the ſteps of thy godly parents, and ſpeake not of thy

bloud,<note place="margin">Non genus, ſed genius: non gens, ſed mens.</note> but of thy good; not of thy parents vertues, but
of thy owne (for what hath a coward to doe to glorie
in the valour of his father?) And I would that Papiſts
would conſider of this, who brag that their <hi>Pope</hi> and
<hi>Biſhops</hi> are the Succeſſours of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the

vs how they ſucceed them in their gifts and graces? If
they cannot (as all the world may ſee they cannot) their
perſonall ſucceſſion is nothing worth, and they brag of
an emptie title without honour.</p>

               <hi>Seeke iudgement, releeue the oppreſſed,

ſaid vnto them; You offer multitudes of ſacrifices, and
obſerue ſolemne daies and Feaſts; the new Moones and
Sabbaths, and the like, and are not wanting in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
duties of the firſt Table: But I eſpecially reſpect
the duties of the ſecond; wherein you haue beene wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
and therefore labour to finde out what is right,
and ſeeke after that iuſtice that God requires in his Law,
dealing with others, as you would be dealt withall: giue
ouer your crueltie, exerciſe mercie, and ſtretch forth
your helping hand for the releeuing and defending of
ſuch as are in need. And in the 58. of this Propheſie, we
may reade how God reiects their<note n="b" place="margin">Iſay 58. 6, 7.</note> prayers and faſtings,
becauſe they regarded not to ſhew mercy and kindneſſe
vnto the poore and needie: and withall ſhewes them
what manner of Faſt it was that he required, namely, to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:23164:161"/>
               <hi>looſe the bands of wickedneſſe, to vndoe the heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and to let the ppreſſed goe free. To deale bread vnto
the hungrie; to bring the poore that are caſt out vnto their
houſes; to cloath the naked, and the like.</hi> This was the
Faſt that God did eſpecially reſpect. In the Propheſie
of <hi>Micah</hi> we may reade what large proffers the wicked
make:<note n="c" place="margin">Micah 6. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>They will come with burnt offerings and calues
of a yeere old; they will offer thouſands of Rammes, and ten
thouſand riuers of oile; they would giue their firſt borne for
their tranſgreſſion, the fruit of their bodie for the ſinne of
their ſoule;</hi> ſo that God would be pleaſed herewith.
But yet all this would not pleaſe him:<note n="d" place="margin">

               <hi>He hath ſhewed

Certainly the religion of theſe men is in vaine; their

He iudged the cauſe of the poore and needy, then it was
well with him: But thine eies and thy heart are not but
for thy couetouſneſſe, and for to ſhed innocent bloud, and
for oppreſſion, and for violence, to doe it. Therefore thus
ſaith the Lord concerning Iehoiakim the ſonne of Ioſiah
King of Iudah, They ſhall not lament for him ſaying, ah

of ſacred things, who prey vpon their patrimonie

we might not be deceiued in the perſons, he deſcribes
them to vs by their words:<note n="y" place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> They are thoſe that ſay,

what right or title the very name of <hi>Impropriations</hi> doth

vſe, they hauing once beene paſſed ouer to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated

I doe not denie but it may be in the power of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

it is a great a ſinne to defraud the Miniſter of his

ordinarie labourer; yea farre greater: and yet <hi>S. Iames</hi>
ſaith, that is a ſinne<note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 5. 4.</note> that cryeth loud in the eares of
God for vengeance. How many thouſands then in this
Land ſtand obnoxious in an high degree to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

our people, and blemiſh of our Church. Some there are
who rob God of his maine tithes, yet are content to
leaue him ſtill the leſſer; they plucke our fleeces, and
leaue vs the taglocks, poore Vicaridge tithes, whilſt
themſelues and children are kept warme in our wooll,
the Parſonage. And others yet more iniurious, who
thinke that too much, would the law but allow them a
paire of ſheeres, they would clip the very taglocks off.
Theſe (with the deceitfull Taylor) are not content to
ſhrinke the whole and faire broad-cloth of the Church
to a dozen of buttons; but they muſt likewiſe take part
of them away, and nimme the very ſhreds, which only
we haue left. After they haue full gorged themſelues

ſtole from the Altar, wherewith ſhe fired her neſt, and
burnt vp her ſelfe and young ones. Had it not beene
for this, it may be thought many a faire Family had at
this day ſtood, which is now ruinated. God is as iuſt as
euer, and deteſteth this ſinne as much as euer he did: and
therefore, let ſuch as will not leaue it and repent of it,
aſſure themſelues, that they ſhall ſpeed as others haue
done before them. To you then that haue any <hi>Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations</hi>

Thou haſt taken away the Churches dowrie, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

For with what face canſt thou expect an inheritance

ſatisfaction in our Miniſterie, vntill our ſtate found it
ſelfe, either better enabled or more ſtraitly tied in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

haue Impropriations in their hands be hereby moued
to make ſome reſtitution, in whole or part, as their
eſtates may beare, as ſome already haue done to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdening
of their conſciences, and good example of

late to bed, eateth the bread of carefulneſſe, and
ſitteth with many a hungrie meale, not being able to
ſpare a morſell of bread to others, nay hardly able to
giue food vnto his family; and all that he does or can
doe, is but as a prey to his greedie Landlord. <hi>Good words,</hi>

make a dearth without a ſcarcitie. I deny not but it is
lawfull to buy the ouerplus of any commoditie, and
when mens turnes are ſerued in times of plentie, to take
the reſidue (as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did) that in time of dearth he may
haue to helpe the Common-wealth, with ſome good
and moderate gaine to himſelfe alſo: But theſe in ſtead of
laying vp to preuent a dearth, doe hoard vp to procure
one; which time is the <hi>Ingroſſers day,</hi> wherein he doth

that we may ſet forth wheat, and make the Epha ſmall,
and the ſhekell great, and falſifie the waights by deceit?
and buy the poore for ſiluer, and the needie for ſhooes; yea
and ſell the refuſe of the wheat?</hi> They had long (as
it may ſeeme) kept vp the come for this purpoſe, that
it might grow deare; and now they had a time to ſerue
their turne in, and they muſt ſet it to ſale in all haſte, ſo
that they thought the new moone and the Sabbath
daies appointed for Gods owne ſeruice, too long vntill
they were a ſelling: And now they intend to prey vpon
the poore, for they will ſell little for much; leſſening
the meaſure, and enhancing the price. The poore ſhall
buy the refuſe <hi>deare,</hi> which is little worth, and ſell
themſelues <hi>cheape,</hi> euen in a manner for old ſhooes to

               <hi>A father
of the fatherleſſe, and a Iudge of the widow is God in

them into his protection; he is become their Iudge;

               <note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note> and the <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</hi>
As for <hi>oppreſſors,</hi> they had need be well aduiſed
what they doe: for if they continue in their cruelty,
the poore muſt needs ſigh and cry, and God will heare
them; which if he doe, he will cauſe their oppreſſors to

               <hi>He will iudge the fatherleſſe, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,

and oppreſſe them, rather than putting vp any bill
of complaint to God againſt them; yet the ſinne it ſelfe
will cry, though they be ſilent.
<q>
                  <l>Clamitat in coelum vox ſanguinis &amp; Sodomorum,</l>
                  <l>Vox oppreſſorum, merces retent a laborum.</l>
               </q>
Euery ſinne indeed hath its voice to diſcouer it ſelfe to
God (ſaith one<note n="h" place="margin">Omnis namque iniquitas apud ſecreta Dei iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia habet voces ſuas. Greg. Mor. 5. cap. 8.</note>:) and not a voice only, but feet alſo,
yea and wings too, to make way and ſpeed into heauen
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:23164:170"/>
for vengeance: but yet there are foure ſinnes, and but
foure (as is obſerued<note n="i" place="margin">Aquin. in Iac. 5. 4.</note>) mentioned in Scripture, that are
ſaid to cry. The firſt is <hi>Homicide,</hi> murther or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,
whereof Almighty God thus ſpeaketh vnto
<hi>Cain,</hi>
               <note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>The voice of thy brothers bloud crieth vnto mee
from off the earth.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>Sodomie,</hi> a ſinne againſt
nature, whereof the Lord ſpeaketh thus vnto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 18. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe the cry of Sodome and Gomorrha is great,
and becauſe their ſinne is exceeding grieuous, I will goe
downe now and ſee whether they haue done altogether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the cry which is come vnto me.</hi> The third is this
of <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> as the places before quoted ſhew; as alſo
that of <hi>Habakkuk</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Hab. 2. 11, 12.</note> where the very timber and ſtone
from the building that is founded vpon falſhood and
oppreſſion, is ſaid to cry for vengeance from heauen.
The fourth is, <hi>The keeping backe of the labourers hire,</hi>
as that place euen now brought out of <hi>S. Iames</hi>
               <note n="n" place="margin">Iam. 5. 4.</note> for the
proofe of our point, witneſſeth. Theſe ſinnes are not
only <hi>vocall,</hi> but <hi>importunate,</hi> they will haue no nay, but
hale downe iudgements vpon the heads of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
authors, and wretched actors of them. So then it is
impoſſible for oppreſſors to eſcape vnpuniſhed: and
howeuer vengeance may ſeeme limpingly to purſue
them, yet it will ouertake them in the end without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
hinder.</p>
            <p>As for the poore oppreſſed,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> this may ſerue for their
<hi>comfort;</hi> and it may teach them patience. He that is
ouerſwayed with might againſt equitie &amp; right in ſome
one Court, yet is not out of heart nor hope ſo long as he
may appeale to ſome other that is higher; eſpecially if
he be perſwaded of the integritie and vprightneſſe of
that Iudge to whom he makes <hi>Appeale.</hi> Art thou then
wronged and iniured by the mighty? yet be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
for though thou canſt haue no helpe at mans
hand, yet there is a higher to whom thou maiſt appeale,
euen God in his holy habitation, who beholds thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
heares thy ſighes, bottles vp thy teares, is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:23164:171"/>
with all thy griefes, and will right thy wrongs:<note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 12. 5.</note> 
               <hi>For
the oppreſſion of the poore, for the ſighing of the needy,
now will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord, I will ſet him at libertie
from him that puffeth at him.</hi> Heare this you fatherleſſe
and widowes, you poore and needy ones: and albeit
theſe mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> ride <hi>ouer your heads,</hi>
               <note n="p" place="margin">Pſal. 66. 12.</note> and <hi>plow
vpon your backs, making long furrowes there,</hi> and thus
wound your fleſh, yet let them not wound your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
but<note n="q" place="margin">Iſai. 35. 3.</note> 
               <hi>let your weake hands be ſtrengthned, and
your feeble knees confirmed: for behold your God will
come with vengeance, your God will come with recompence.</hi>
Commit therefore your cauſe to him who iudgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly;
and ſee you aſſwage your griefe and ſorrow
when you are thus oppreſſed. He will come, he will
come aſſuredly in due time; he will come and deliuer
you from out the pawes of the bloud-thirſtie and cruell
man. Though <hi>Paſſion</hi> therefore poſſeſſe your bodies,
yet let<note n="r" place="margin">Luke 21.</note> 
               <hi>Patience poſſeſſe your ſoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now for the <hi>Ecce,</hi> which is here twice vſed,
<hi>Behold</hi> oppreſſion, <hi>Behold</hi> a cry: once vſing it is not

matters of great moment, worthy of our deepeſt and
