            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I ſay, <hi>Some have endeavoured to promote,</hi> &amp;c. But you, as your uſual manner is, drop what is not for your purpoſe, and leave out <hi>Endeavoured,</hi> alſo many other words, whereby the ſenſe is altered, for there is great difference between doing and endeavouring to do a thing; for that may be endeavoured which is never done, but I will ſhew you what I mean by Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to compel, conſtrain, or impoſe: I take to impart much one <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Paul to Peter, Why compelleſt thou the</hi> Gentiles? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — <hi>and they conſtrain you to be Circumciſed:</hi> now <hi>Peter</hi> had no power to compel them, but by Preaching to them, <hi>That except they were Circumciſed and kept the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>they could not be ſaved; as Acts</hi> 15. This is by <hi>Paul</hi> termed <hi>Compelling,</hi> or <hi>Conſtraining,</hi> and by him withſtood and teſtified againſt, although promoted by <hi>Peter</hi> the Eldeſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, and <hi>Peter</hi> &amp;c. had more to ſay for themſelves and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, than you have for <hi>G.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46716:2"/>
to inforce Laws) reſolved on the Queſtion; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> need not obſerve <hi>Moſes</hi> his Laws: yet we find in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that the Apoſtle permitted the Practice of ſome things to ſome, that were conſcious of them; as <hi>Days, Meats,</hi> &amp;c. and ſaid, <hi>Let every one be fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his own Mind.

F</hi>'s Laws, and what Sons of Perdition you render them that cannot ſo reverence them; if it do not amount to what was by <hi>Paul</hi> termed <hi>Compelling</hi> or <hi>Conſtraining:</hi> for you in effect ſay, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs you will be Circumciſed with</hi> G.

And I ſhall rather chooſe to be at the kindneſs of ſome now in power, than ſome of you, now the Ruling Party, who I term <hi>G. F</hi>'s Party, who are exalting the greateſt and higheſt Myſtery of Iniquity that hath appeared ſome Ages, which you are ſetting up above all that is called God, <hi>viz.</hi> G. F<hi>'s Laws. For what was commanded in Scripture muſt not be practiſed unleſs required by the ſame Spirit:</hi> but if we <hi>have not Unity with your Womens Meetings,</hi> &amp;c. Idolizing <hi>G. F.</hi> his Laws <hi>then the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Spirit cannot receive, but are erred from our meaſures, but you have <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity with the leaſt meaſure:</hi> therefore they that cannot ſo do, have not the leaſt meaſure. Whereby it ſeems that <hi>G. F.</hi> &amp;c. have put a <hi>Lock</hi> on Heaven, and given the <hi>Key</hi> to the <hi>Womens Meeting.</hi> Alſo in <hi>page</hi> 8. <hi>Hyp. Proudly ſaying, away with calling your ſelves the People of God, and judge others:</hi> Here you again diſhoneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pick out words, for in <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>T. C.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Away with calling your ſelves the People of God, as a Body of People,</hi> &amp;c. but them words, <hi>as a Body of People,</hi> you diſhoneſtly leave out and skip ſeveral lines, then take <hi>and Judge others,</hi> where again you leave out <hi>all,</hi> for my words are, <hi>Judge all others,</hi> and you wrong the ſenſe, and pervert my words by leaving out words, and ye be guilty of that you blame me for, <hi>viz. Harſh Judging,</hi> for it is that proud Imagination, <hi>that you are the People of God, and none elſe</hi> (as ſome have ſaid, and that <hi>You be the Body of Chriſt</hi>) that I am againſt. And in <hi>p.</hi> 9 ſaith, <hi>Art not thou a</hi> Ranter, <hi>who ſaith in thy Title-page</hi> You Quakers. That word was for ſecreſy, not for reproach, but your Term <hi>Ranter,</hi> gives greater cauſe to ſuſpect you be not <hi>Chriſtian-Quakers,</hi> and I wiſh for your own Sakes, you were as free from the Spirit that luſteth to Envy and Lordſhip over your Brethren as <hi>T. C.</hi> is from indulging any fleſhly eaſe, or ſinful Liberty, and ill were it for <hi>T. C.</hi> if you had ſuch Proofs of his <hi>Rantiſm</hi> and <hi>Looſeneſs,</hi> as he hath of your <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions:</hi> but I do believe <hi>Iſ. P</hi>'s Teſtimonies, and if that he with you <hi>Rantiſin,</hi> I am content to be vile, with ſuch, knowing it is the ſame Spirit as called Chriſt Devil; and ſeeing you will be my <hi>Father-Confeſſors,</hi> I fear you are of that Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Chriſt forbad to pull up the <hi>Tares</hi> for fear they ſhould ſpoil the <hi>Wheat,</hi> for you under pretence of fear of <hi>fleſhly Liberty,</hi> will deſtroy <hi>Liberty of Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> only ye exceed them, for they ſtaid until there was <hi>Tares,</hi> but you for fear

We rather plead a fear—they'l be ſo confuſed — that they are in danger to let up a Libertin Spirit.</hi> What Impoſitions and Severities might not, or may not be Juſtifiable, that hath been, or may be exerciſed towards <hi>Conſcientious Diſſenters,</hi> if ſuch Arguments my be admitted: but for all this golden Head full of gilded good Names, it ſtands but on Legs of Iron and Clay, which are ſmitten, and in the Lords time it will fall; and in that day the God of Heaven will ſet up a Kingdom, although you do what you can to hinder the Exaltation thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As ſome in the Apoſtles days, becauſe he magnified the Grace of God, ſaying, <hi>As Sin hath abounded, ſo hath Grace much more?</hi> therefore they would infer that might do evil, that good might come of it, but he ſaid, <hi>God forbid:</hi> ſo it may be ſaid to you who ſay, <hi>If People muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves by ſaying, they muſt ſtay until they be convinced,</hi> then any ſlothful or diſobedient ones will pretend they be not convinced; but it may be ſaid, God forbid the Liberty of the Goſpel ſhould be ſo abuſed; but if any ſuch ſhould be, their Conformity is not more acceptable than the Excuſe; therefore I cannot ſee what you get by your Impoſing but <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> but a great number of <hi>Conformiſts</hi> pleaſe <hi>G. F</hi>'s Univerſal Spirit: but if all Power be committed to the Son, he is able to preſerve in Truth, (as to bring to it) and to keep out of <hi>fleſhly Liberty:</hi> but when I conſider how eaſily Scriptures may be leaped over, and <hi>G. F</hi>'s Laws und undiſpenſibly muſt be obſerved and bowed to, it ſeems, as you would have them the only Girdle of Truth, and whole Armour of God, thereby placing more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in them, then in <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Johns,</hi> or any Miniſtration; <hi>for they muſt not be practiſed, but as Garments the Goſpel appeared in, and ſince the Harlot hath dreſſed her ſelf therewith, therefore not worn by the true Spouſe:</hi> but ſome bad enough have, and now are dreſſed in <hi>G. F</hi>'s comly Order exactly, and Maintainers thereof, and yet accepted. Alſo in <hi>p.</hi> 8. <hi>Hyp. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity is good, and to be deſired, and the Intent and Work of the Miniſtry is to bring into <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, which being kept in, will come into <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity at length.</hi> Here you curtail by your own Rule, for in <hi>p.</hi> 7. you take ſix words, but leap over ſeveral lines, and then take a few more words, and then again skip ſeveral Lines, and add a few more words: but <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> goes on and ſays, <hi>To ſtrive to bring to a fleſhly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, which inſnares and overbears the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſcience, that is not good.</hi> And <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Miniſters are to bring to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, as People are able to follow, and not force into one Practice.</hi> And much more that you skip, that is againſt your compelling, or placing Chriſtian Unity in Forms; but this Unity that <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> here pleads for, <hi>T. C.</hi> is not againſt. Alſo in <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> ſays <hi>The Church was Clothed appearing in the beautiful and glorious dreſs the Lord himſelf put on her.</hi> But <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> alſo goes on and ſays, <hi>Another while ſhe ſtripped of her Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Garments, and the Harlot dreſſed therewith;</hi> and more that you loave out, as not being for your turn. And in <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>Hyp. If you ſeek to take away Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Order from the Church of Chriſt, is not this to take away from her Glory.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you further manifeſt your compelling Spirit, being that in Revelations that would compel all; for it is only that <hi>T. C.</hi> is againſt, and this you term the Churches Glory, manifeſting your ſelves to mind Earthly things whoſe glory is their Shame. Chriſt ſayed, <hi>The Glory thou haſt given me, I have given them.</hi> This Glory
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46716:3"/>
was not <hi>G. F</hi>'s Laws, yet the Church had Glory: but your Glory can be but the Outward Court which was given to the <hi>Gentils,</hi> and it is but the <hi>Gentile Nature</hi> that glories in Lording over their Brethren, and giving Laws to their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for if <hi>G. F.</hi> ſhould ſay, he is moved to ſet up <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Romiſh Ceremonies,</hi> and 66. in a <hi>London Metting,</hi> ſay, <hi>It is Chriſts great Ordinance;</hi> as ſuch he may find, ſome who may be ſo blind as to deny their own Light, although they think it true to obey <hi>G. F.</hi> but ſuch a Submiſſion once coſt a Prophet dear, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not to dance about the <hi>Calf,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Theſe be thy Gods,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no leſs Man than <hi>Aaron</hi> was concerned. And in <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>Hyp. There are Outward Forms that God ownes and ſtays in.</hi> But theſe words of <hi>I. N.</hi> by you ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are much perverted, to make them ſpeak for compelling or conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without or againſt Conviction, but are quite contrary, and are thus; <hi>p.</hi> 27. <hi>Teſt. Who have Spiritual Worſhip, can no longer ſtay in any Form than God ſtays therein, but by his Spirit are led into whatſoever he goes, and out of whatever he departs.</hi> Here is no Outward Limitation to <hi>G. F</hi>'s Laws. And <hi>Hyp.</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>We do own the Power of God, and the Form</hi> which he hath led us into. But would you but do as you would be done by, which is the Duty of all Chriſts Diſciples, then you would allow others the ſame Liberty as you take, for what proof give you, only you ſay ſo, but if thoſe you call Apoſtates ſay ſo, then Rotten Heart, and joyned to the Son of Perdition, as in <hi>p.</hi> 9. of <hi>Hyp.</hi> you will have all Judgment, and be ſure to acquit your ſelves; and condemn others; but the difference is not about what you own, but that you would compel others to own the ſame: Would you but allow others their Liberty to enjoy their Faith in God, and his Law in their Hearts, as you do yours in <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Laws; I know not of any great difference, only you will manifeſt your ſelves to be ſome of the <hi>Lo heres:</hi> (come to <hi>G. F</hi>'s comely Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) but Chriſt ſaid, <hi>go not forth:</hi> the Lord knows who be his, and needs hot <hi>G. E</hi>'s Livery to be known by, that will not prove the <hi>Wedding Garment</hi> when the Muſter views his Gueſts. And in <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>Hyp. What</hi> Iſ. P. E. B. <hi>and</hi> W. P. <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to falſe Churches concerning Outward Orders, that you apply to</hi> G. F. <hi>and Friends in Truth.</hi> Compelling and Imitation without Inward Conviction is as falſe among you as any, and more deteſtable, and <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> due from you of any People, becauſe that was the Foundation of your gathering every one to know the Light in his own Heart.</p>
            <p>Theſe following be your falſe and unrighteous Accuſations and Aſſertions.</p>
            <p>1ſt. p. 3., <hi>Thou ſaist, in thy Title, You are Gods Iſrael, and all that oppoſe you,</hi> Pharaohs Task-maſters. 2. <hi>And in the</hi> Poſt-ſcript, <hi>You are followers of the Lamb, all others worſhippers of the Beaſt.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> p. 8. <hi>Thou accountest all that oppoſe thee and your ſide have the Beasts Mark.</hi> 4. p. <hi>Thou ſaist, Thou hast the Saints Seal, and and others the Beasts Mark.</hi> 5<hi>ly.</hi> p. 9. <hi>Thou dost not only diſown the good Order of Truth, but the Language of Truth.</hi> 6th. p. 4. <hi>Thou ſaist is</hi> Iſ.

G.</hi> his Laws and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Chriſts Doctrine, and all theſe Accuſations of yours, thou ſayeſt, or thou doſt, be falſe, and you have not, nor cannot prove them; for <hi>T. C.</hi> doth no where ſay ſo, nor believe ſo, as the <hi>Preface</hi> makes appear; that I am againſt Judging others for difference in Judgment or Practice, and that God hath ſome ſealed ones among you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 13th. p. 4. <hi>A perverting, and not</hi> Iſ. P<hi>'s Teſtimony,</hi> See p. 10: <hi>T. L.</hi> ſayeth a little of that <hi>T. C.</hi> cites, is <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> his Teſtimony. 14th. p. 9. <hi>More might be ſaid to</hi> T. C<hi>'s stollen words:</hi> 15th: p. 5: <hi>T. C. mingles, and perverts</hi> Iſ. P's <hi>Sence and Meaning.</hi> By mingle you muſt mean, put in other words among <hi>Iſ. P</hi>'s which be not his; which is falſe, and for perverting, let Truth in all Judge whether thoſe Teſtimonyes of <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> cited by <hi>T. C.</hi> be for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience,</hi> or compelling all to an <hi>Outward Form.</hi> 16th. p. 5. <hi>Thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest ill uſe of his</hi> words (i.e. Iſ. P.) <hi>to uphold a bad Cauſe.</hi> I do make no other uſe of <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> words but to maintain <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> againſt <hi>Impoſitiou</hi>) which once you thought a good Cauſe; but now having aſſumed to your ſelves Power and Rule, change your Judgments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid, of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not the word. 17th. p. 6. <hi>Thy Writings are obſcure and dark Counſel by words without Knowledge, and plainly prove that your Side is joyned to the Man of Sin, and Son of Perdition.</hi> If <hi>T. C.</hi> his Writings be obſcure, it is becauſe you have given up all your Judgment alſo to <hi>G. F.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i.e.</hi> as the <hi>Barbadoes Church did,</hi> and therefóre cannot diſcern. 18th. p. 7. <hi>And yet you own Perſons going up and down preaching, which is falſe and Contradiction.</hi> But the Apoſtles to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> then were falſe and contradicted; for they ſaid in latter days God would write his Law in the Heart, and ſhould not need any to teach, but yet taught. 19th. p. 11. <hi>Erroneous and Schiſmatical Doctrines broached by thee and ſuch as thou art.</hi> Theſe words follow in anſwer to <hi>G. B.</hi> his <hi>Test.</hi> p. 11. <hi>Seek not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue that to which you were ſent to Minister.</hi> Which words of <hi>G. B.</hi> be ſound, for <hi>G. B.</hi> meanes not that they preach to, or Miniſter to Chriſt, but to turn to the meaſure of Chriſts Light in their own Hearts, <hi>as the Seed is come — to turn unto, or for the good of which the Miniſtry was ſent.</hi> It is plain he meanes to turn People to the ſeed, and not that Chriſt was in want of, or bettered by the Creature. Therefore thou haſt not, nor canſt not prove <hi>G. B</hi>'s Erroneous and Schiſmatical, but your ſelves Falſe Accuſers. 20th. <hi>Thy Copy is falſe ſubſcribed, the chief words left out, and other mords put in diſhoneſty to ſerve thy turn, as thy uſual manner hath been through thy Book.</hi> If it had been all the Judgment, why ſhould <hi>T. C.</hi> call it an <hi>Abridgment,</hi> but there are no words left out that wrong the ſenſe of them cited, nor any words added, therefore that is falſe, and why did you not cite what thoſe added words were; but that you could not, for there was none. Theſe afore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned be about 20 falſe and unrighteous Accuſations and Aſſertions, in your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46716:4"/>
               <hi>Hyp.</hi> And here follows ſome of your Contradictions. In <hi>p.</hi> 4. of <hi>Hyp.</hi> you ſay, <hi>Here is a Perverſion, but not</hi> Iſ. P<hi>'s Testimony:</hi> which contain 4 pages and a half, in <hi>T. C</hi>'s and not one word added, only ſome words left out for brevity, but not to alter the ſenſe. but in p. 10. you having cited a few words from <hi>T. C.</hi> and from four ſeveral pages, and very imperfectly too, and added and diminiſhed to the altering the Senſe, and pervert the meaniug, and yet you ſay, this is <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> his. Teſtimony of them, few pieces of Sentences, and have affirmed falſe, and contradicted your ſelves: alſo you ſcoff <hi>T. C. What, cannot he preach without a</hi> Text, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 9. <hi>T. C. his stollen words, and</hi> W. R. <hi>his Book is the foundation of</hi> T. C<hi>'s;</hi> all is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved falſe; your ſelves do the ſame, you take your <hi>Text</hi> from <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> and therefore take back to your ſelves what you wrongfully charge <hi>T. C.</hi> with; <hi>What, canst not preach without a</hi> Text? p. 5. <hi>Bluſh for ſhame and own your Condemnation before your Hearts be wholly hardened.</hi> Theſe following be the Quotations from <hi>T. C.</hi> by <hi>T. L.</hi> in his <hi>Hyp.</hi> Thoſe words that be of a different character, were by them left out, and the Senſe thereby altered: they have twice added to <hi>G. B.</hi> his words, in <hi>p.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Perſons,</hi> and <hi>withou reſpect of Perſons;</hi> and in ſeveral other places have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded words, which be here omitted, and in <hi>p.</hi> 10. they ſay, <hi>thou ſayeſt, declaring and ſpeaking is not in the diſpoſition of Perſons, and the Form was once true, until the Dragon entred;</hi> and cite <hi>p.</hi> 19. but I cannot find the Sentences in all that page. p. 3. <hi>Hyp.</hi> Thou ſaiſt, <hi>the Seed is come, and <hi>The Heir is many,</hi> who is not to be under Tutors and Gevernours <hi>which muſt</hi> not be limited.</hi> Here they leave out <hi>in many,</hi> and ſo render the Sentence general, when it is reſtrictive. Some have <hi>of late acted far contrary, and have endeavoured</hi> to promote Government and Orders, even to the compelling others before Convincement: here they leave out many words; but that word endeavoured doth manifeſtly alter the Senſe. And you ſay in <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>Away with calling your ſelves the People of God, <hi>as a Body of</hi> People; <hi>It is not hereby meant, but that God hath of your Tribe, many ſealed ones but not more for being only of your Tribe, let none boaſt, and think themſelves the only People of God,</hi> and Judge <hi>all</hi> others:</hi> they leave out the chief Scope of the Sentence, and mangle them in pieces, and take but 8 words in the beginning, and two at the latter end, and put to them, and leave out <hi>all,</hi> between <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> and ſo pervert the ſenſe.</p>
            <q>Let none boaſt and think themſelves the only people of God, <hi>and Iudge all others,</hi> but rather eſteem others better than your ſelves; Here they leave out, <hi>Iudge all others,</hi> in the midſt, and take a word, <hi>numbers,</hi> from another page, and add to theſe.</q>
            <p>And <hi>Page</hi> 12, the Kingdom of Heaven <hi>is within,</hi> and conſiſts in <hi>Righteouſneſs, Joy and Peace in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and not in ſpeaking one ſort of ſpech or language, and conformihg to Orders and Preſcriptions from without. There alſo they leave out, in the middle, what the Kingdom conſiſts in, and is the material Part of the Sentence. Again, <hi>Pag.</hi> 12. Hath not <hi>God</hi> ſaid by ſome of you, <hi>He</hi> will teach his People himſelf, now <hi>according to Scripture, and you alſo have declared he is come and known, yet you will not like good <hi>Joſhua</hi> fall down and give way,</hi> but ſtill hold the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or limit them by your Orders and Directions. Here by leaving out the middle and putting both ends together, they jumble and miſplace the words alſo. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46716:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
again <hi>Pag.</hi> 7. you ſay, Uniformity is good &amp; to be deſired, <hi>but to ſtrive to bring to<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> fleſhly Vniformity, which inſnares, and overbears the tender Conſcience is not good nor Chriſtian: the Apoſtle did not bid force another into one Mind, but bids walk together as they had attained, and where any were otherwiſe minded, God ſhould reveal.</hi> The work of the Miniſtry, is to bring into the Unity, <hi>as Perſons are able to follow, and not force into one Practiſe, that is the way to deſtroy Faith, &amp;c.</hi> Here you may ſee they leap over all the chief of the Matter wherein the Unity is, and of what it conſiſts, and add nine words of another Sentence that ſtand near 20 lines from them, and add them to them in the beginning of the Sentence, but all that treat of any Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in difference of Practice that they leap over. 30th. We do approve of <hi>Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Quarterly Meetings <hi>for the neceſſary Service of the Truth, ſo we further ſay, as this or any other Meetings of Friends in Truth ſhall be continued to anſwer theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices we believe as it now is:</hi>
               </hi> It alſo will become our Duty to be at Unity with our Brethren in the Service thereof. Here they leave out, <hi>the Services,</hi> for which they approve of Meetings, and apply the Approbation to the Forms and Times of thoſe Meetings, <hi>Viz. Monthly</hi> and <hi>Quarterly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Friends, Who are the approvers of that <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> conſider your work. I preſent you with about <hi>twenty</hi> falſe Accuſations or Aſſertions, and about <hi>ten</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in every one you have added or diminiſhed words; in ſome to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion of the ſenſe: alſo conſider how diſingenious you have been in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to ſay, <hi>Thou ſaiſt,</hi> yet quotes not, nor referreſt to what <hi>page;</hi> thereby giving much trouble to find from whence you take your words. And tho you reflect in the begining of your <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It this thy gentle beginning?</hi> Yet prove no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentleneſs, but proceed to ſcoff at <hi>T. C.</hi> and declare him joyned to the <hi>Son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Rotten hearted, a painted Sepulchre, Stolen words.</hi> And in pag. 9. &amp; 14. <hi>Words putting in diſhonestly;</hi> yet cannot prove any words ſo put in, but have done that you wrogfully charge me with, <hi>viz.</hi> added, diminiſhed and curtailed, by picking out words; from ſeveral places, to the perverting the ſenſe much; which I ſhould not have noted ſo much, but to ſhew how contrary to Chriſts Rule you act, <hi>Do as you would be done by;</hi> for remember, <hi>What you mete, ſhall be mete unto you.</hi> Again p. 4. of <hi>Hip.</hi> you ſay <hi>T. C. abuſes I. Ps. words,</hi> when he cites them to the ſame occaſion as they were wrote to ſhew, that Compelling or Forcing to Unity, was, by Chriſt, excluded his Church, as the Title of that Book <hi>T. C.</hi> wrote them from ſhews. Alſo the words themſelves, and <hi>I. Ns.</hi> in, p. 27, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all againſt Imitation and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conformity without the Spirits leading thereto, and for Unity and Love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der different Practiſes. Therefore your ſaying, p 10, <hi>Hypoc. That they be quoted by T. C. against himſelf,</hi> is very perverſe, for he is not againſt outward Unity, if as <hi>Iſ. P.</hi> ſaith, <hi>It be by the Lord effected;</hi> yet notwithſtanding ſo many falſhoods in this little <hi>Hypocriſy</hi> of yours, in Pag. 4. you ſay, <hi>You deny all evil Opinions,</hi> and all that be in <hi>Truth</hi> be out of them; But theſe falſe Accuſations and Aſſertions fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned be evil Opinions, and that's another falſe Aſſertion. Therefore take your own ſaying, p. 8. <hi>Thou who condeninest another, and dost the ſame thing art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable:</hi> And if your own words be true, your <hi>are out of the Truth;</hi> Wherefore, as in your fifth Page, <hi>Bluſh for ſhame. I am weary of raking in ſuch dirty puddles.</hi> Pag. 9th.</p>
