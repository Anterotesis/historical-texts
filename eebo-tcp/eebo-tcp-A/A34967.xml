         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S soon as advice out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> came to me of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor done me by an unknown <hi>Person of Honour,</hi> in publickly declaring so inconsiderable a person fit to receive wounds from the <hi>Sword</hi> of so noble an <hi>Antagonist,</hi> I obtained from the Charity of a Friend to have your <hi>Book</hi> sent me by the <hi>Letter-Post:</hi> But partly to abate the charges, and likewise to disguise the shape of a <hi>Book,</hi> it was folded up in loose sheets, with all the <hi>Margins</hi> close pared to the very quick, that it might pass safely, as some <hi>Merchants Accounts.</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43420:3"/>
you should have found matter to fill a Book with <hi>Reprehensions.</hi> After the reading a few pages, I found my expectation fully satisfied. But withal, I perceived you had confounded <hi>S.

I might take leave to divide their causes, since I have no reason (having been discovered by your self) to be answerable for whatsoever can be laid to the charge of every <hi>Individuum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum,</hi> whose true or supposed names, begin with the two letters, <hi>S.

            <p n="3">3. In the first place therefore, I assure you, <hi>Noble Sir,</hi> that since you have so highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured me, as to declare your self my <hi>friend,</hi> and a friend (till of late) constantly the same, during the prodigious changes of the <hi>last fifty years,</hi> I am prepared to receive whatsoever <hi>Reprehensions</hi> come from such a Person, not only with patience, but gratulation: consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that in case they be just, it will be a happiness to receive my punishment, and confusion in this world: and if not well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, you have given me an opportunity to justifie my self, and thereby to obtain a return to your favour.</p>

               <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet</hi> severely condemned, but (more than the <hi>Title</hi> of your <hi>Book</hi> requir'd) a terrible <hi>Censure</hi> fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For how wide, think you, will the mouths of the populace and of <hi>Sectary Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> be opened against you?
<q>This <hi>Person of Honour,</hi> will they say, does not much approve of our burning the <hi>Pope in Effigie,</hi> and in all his <hi>Pontificals</hi>; neither will he be much pleased with our <hi>Witty Dialogue between the Pope and the Devil,</hi> &amp;c.

out of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and then into a Monastery.</hi> He, at the end of his Letter, kindly invited me into <hi>England, assuring me I should be provided of a convenient place to dwell in, and a sufficient subsistence to live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably; and withal, that not any one should molest me about my Religion and Conscience.</hi> I had reason to believe that this invitation was an effect of a cordial friendship, and I was also informed that he was well enabled to make good his promise, as having the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of great <hi>Charities,</hi> and being the most zealous Promoter of <hi>Alms-giving</hi> that lived in <hi>England</hi> since the <hi>Change</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi> Yet rendring such thanks as gratitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of me, I told him that I could not accept of so very kind an offer, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged almost by vow to leave all pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the world, and to embrace poverty for my portion.

at <hi>Doway</hi> a Letter from a Friend in <hi>England,</hi> signifying, that the Impression of that Book being spent, he was willing, if I thought good, to reprint it at his own cost. This <hi>Offer</hi> I was not unwilling to accept, and thereupon prepared and sent him about a Sheet full of <hi>Additions</hi> and <hi>Alterations.</hi> But I protest, as in the presence of <hi>God,</hi> that I cannot remember that one line of reproach against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was added by me: which if I had done in such a time when savage Beasts had left that <hi>Church</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate, would have been an act of most bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous inhumanity, for which I should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have forgiven my self: If therefore any such Additions be to be found, I do with a clear Conscience disclaim them. But truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I think there are none such; for I have employed Friends to examine, and compare the two Impressions, and they could not show me any. True it is, they have found several passages wherein my stile has been much sharpened, but those passages only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and other <hi>Sects,</hi> which insulted on a <hi>Church</hi> which they thought they had destroyed, and the Revenues of which they had sacrilegiously divided among themselves.

               <p n="72">72. NOW I come to the <hi>fatal Book</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet,</hi> touching <hi>Fanaticism,</hi> which forced you, <hi>Sir,</hi> to open a passage to all your indignation against me, for my reviling reproaches against the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Clergy of England.</hi> I fear now that no excuse of so great a crime will be admitted by you, and that to pretend to justifie my self would be taken for an affront. Yet, <hi>Sir,</hi> truth is bold, and I dare pretend not only to justifie my intention, and manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in such a stile, but my hope also that the said <hi>Book</hi> would deserve to be favourably accepted by the <hi>English Clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="73">73. Now the ground of my justification is a firm perswasion that the present <hi>Church
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43420:36"/>
of England</hi> is the very same that it was when both of us received our <hi>Baptism</hi> in it, by which <hi>Baptism</hi> we became <hi>Members</hi> (under favour not of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but) of that <hi>Holy Catholick, and Apostolick Church,</hi> of the belief of which our <hi>God-fathers,</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> made a publick <hi>Profession</hi> for us.</p>
               <p n="74">74. This perswasion therefore remaining still the same, I do confidently affirm (and I protest my intention to have been) that not any of those sharp phrases and <hi>Invectives,</hi> ought with any justice to be interpreted as meant against the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or the the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of it established by <hi>Law,</hi> but only against <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet's Church,</hi> which he desires indeed should pass for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but which really is removed from it at a greater distance and opposition, than is the <hi>Church of Geneva.</hi> And to demonstrute this, it will be sufficient to take a prospect first of the fabrick of <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet's English Church,</hi> framed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon <hi>Mr. Chillingworth's Authority</hi>: and next of the <hi>Church of England</hi> established by <hi>Law,</hi> as she represents her self in her <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Constitutions.</hi>

You are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the <hi>Declaration of the King of</hi> France <hi>his Independency,</hi> lately made by the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> importing, That <hi>Subjects owe to their King such Fidelity and Obedience, as that upon no pretence whatsoever they can be dispensed therefrom.</hi> You, <hi>Sir,</hi> judge this to be a sufficient engagement; and truly so it is: And can you suspect any <hi>English Catholick</hi> unwilling to subscribe to such a <hi>Declaration,</hi> if legally tendred to him?

easie to be understood, sufficient to give reasonable satisfaction, and which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>Catholicks</hi> will accept. A <hi>second</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why I will not take upon me (neither would I advise any other Catholick) to frame a <hi>Form</hi> of such a <hi>Profession,</hi> is because it may probably do much harm, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question will do no good.</p>

that they might think of contriving a <hi>New Oath of Allegiance,</hi> since the <hi>Papists</hi> were resolved to take that which was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:43420:67"/>
upon it:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 148</note> You say, Sir, That <hi>the Council of Trent is not yet received in</hi> France, <hi>and in many other Catholick Countries.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour, <hi>Honoured Sir,</hi> you will, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, grant, that the late famous and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Archbishop of Paris, Peter de Marca,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pet. de Marca, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>S.</hi> 6.</note> was better informed in the <hi>Ecclesiastical State of France,</hi> than your self a Stranger: Now in his Volume <hi>de Concordia Sacerdotii &amp; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii,</hi> he writes expresly, <hi>The Definitions of Faith of the Council of Trent were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Publick Edict made concerning the same matter in the year</hi> 1579. <hi>But the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees which regard Discipline are not received in France, because they are not ratified by the Law of the Prince: Although the chief Heads, which do not infringe the received Customs and ancient Rights of the Gallican Church, are comprehended in Regal Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, several times published concerning that matter. Which thing, how grateful and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable it was to Pope</hi> Clement <hi>the Eighth, is testified by the late King</hi> Henry <hi>the Great, in his Rescript of the year</hi> 1606. Besides <hi>de Marca,</hi> a late learned Writer <hi>Cabassutius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cabassut. Notitia Concil. in fine.</hi>
                  </note> an Oratorian, declares out of the <hi>Records,</hi> of the <hi>French Clergy,</hi> that in <hi>their General Assembly at</hi> Paris <hi>in the year</hi> 1615. <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Doctrine of the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>were unanimously received by the whole Clergy.</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:43420:67"/>
And long before that, even from the rising of the said <hi>Council,</hi> each particular <hi>Bishop</hi> had received it in their respective <hi>Diocesan Synods.</hi> Thus, Sir, you see a sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Faith delivered by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> both by Authority Episcopal and Regal.</p>
               <p n="133">133. Thus, <hi>Sir, God</hi> be thanked, I am come to an end of an <hi>Apology,</hi> perhaps as ungrateful to my self, as it can be to you: For were it not that many others, better than my self, were concerned in the Accusations, I should have been contented to have spared so much pains for declining the Worlds ill opinion of me: <hi>Non enim à vobis judicabor, aut ab humano die.</hi> And now all is done, I do not expect, nor so much as desire, to be esteemed by your self, <hi>Honoured Sir,</hi> or by any others, altogether innocent. Though my Reason tells me, that the imputing such horrible Crimes to the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> (not the <hi>Western</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) and our <hi>Accusers</hi> taking so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy a time, did deserve some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment:
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43420:68"/>
yet I am willing enough it should be believed, that such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment has been expressed with a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssion not too carefully moderated, and too long continued. But such is the nature of disquieting <hi>Passions,</hi> though Reason may put them first in motion, unless the same Reason be continually watchful over them, their motion natural<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y will become more and more violent and impetuous.</p>
               <p n="134">134. Another proof of this I beg leave with all due respect, <hi>Noble Sir,</hi> to borrow from your self. Your tender respect to the <hi>Church,</hi> of which you are a <hi>Member,</hi> suggested to you, that the boldness I had taken to give a homely and disrespectful <hi>Character</hi> to <hi>Dr. Stilling fleet</hi>'s <hi>Church,</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in my intention against the <hi>Church of England.</hi> This raised in your mind an Indignation against me, which you thought sit to make known to the World.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 5, 6.</note> In the beginning you assure your <hi>Readers,</hi> that <hi>whatever other faults they may find in your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversions,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43420:68"/>
yet they shall not find the same, of which you complain: For you will give no body ill words, nor provoke them by contemning their persons,</hi> &amp;c. And accordingly at the first you are even too calm, for in stead of <hi>Reprehensions,</hi> you heap on me far greater Commendations than I deserve, or dare acknowledge, for my <hi>Good Nature, Civility, Good Manners, Learning, Natural Parts, &amp;c.</hi> till I wrote that unhappy Book against Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>; And thereupon you promise to treat me with that candour that becomes an old, near fifty years continued, Friend. But, alas, this promise is quickly forgotten: For my <hi>Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives</hi> against Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> are only gentle, harmless stroakings, if compared with the keen Darts and Stings which through the rest of your whole <hi>Book</hi> are aimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me; and which in case they reach home, <hi>God have mercy on my Soul.</hi> For not content with the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43420:69"/>
subject mentioned in your <hi>Title Page,</hi> which is the censuring of my <hi>Book</hi> against the <hi>Doctor,</hi> you renew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the same, and some more dangerous Accusations against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I had formerly wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tten, in which you discover (what I could never see, and I am sure never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) a Criminal Disrespect to His <hi>MAIESTY,</hi> yea, strong suspicion of an intention to revoke my professed <hi>Fidelity</hi> to Him: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you (or some for you) find more reviling Reproaches, and those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed against the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Clergy,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> knows how much mischief more, all which joyned together, (especially against a Person, who, as you are pleased to say, but surely cannot le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally prove, has been <hi>Re-ordained in the Roman Church</hi>) will be more than sufficient to render me a Victim of <hi>Publick Iustice,</hi> unpitied by all. Now truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> if all this will not satisfie Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s utmost
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43420:69"/>
revenge against his petulant <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,</hi> certainly he has a <hi>Heart harder than the Nether Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="135">135. Yet after all this, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve sincerely, <hi>Honoured Sir,</hi> that with, and in the midst of all this sharpness, you have not quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten your <hi>Fifty Years</hi> Kindness, which you are pleased to call <hi>Friendship</hi>; that you gave a freer scope to your Indignation to the end to force me either to clear my self, or by begging pardon to be restored in some measure to your favour: And that you will be well pleased, if in this <hi>Defence</hi> I shall have alleadged any thing that may qualifie my supposed faults. As you truly judge that it was Zeal of the Honour of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> a <hi>Church</hi> not only contemned, but horribly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed by <hi>Doctor Stillingfleet,</hi> which urged me to an unusual way
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43420:70"/>
of Vindication of her; I have the same reason to judge that the like <hi>Motive</hi> produced a like effect in you, which therefore I cannot wholly condemn: And how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py should I think my self, if <hi>God</hi> would be graciously pleased to transfer your Zeal to the same <hi>Object</hi> with mine?</p>
               <p>I will conclude with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Request, That you would be pleased to depose one Opinion which you seem to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 240</note> That, <hi>because Catholicks have been taught from the beginning, That Salvation is only to be had in the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, therefore they cannot have a Cordial Friendship to those who are not in the same Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi> On the contrary, I do confidently assure you, That though there be one special sort of <hi>Alliance,</hi> called by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43420:70"/>
                  <hi>Philadelphia, a love of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> peculiar to good <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi> among themselves: yet true <hi>Christian Charity,</hi> the Noblest kind of Friendship, ought to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all, which Charity is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise warmed, with a Zealous Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of <hi>Compassion,</hi> towards Virtuous <hi>Protestants,</hi> our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Friends, considering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent danger we suppose them to be in; and such Compassion impells us, if we have any Piety, to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and servent <hi>Prayers</hi> for their Eternal Happiness.</p>
               <p>All which effects by <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> shall never be wanting in me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards such an Honourable (though as yet to me undiscovered) Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who has for so many years honoured so worthless a Creature with the <hi>Title of Friend.</hi>
