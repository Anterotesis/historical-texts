            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

upon a general <hi>Defection,</hi> and lack of <hi>good Faith</hi> at Home,

men ſtood at gaze, expecting <hi>Peace,</hi> (the
Event of their long <hi>Deſires</hi>) and <hi>Benefit,</hi> as the Iſſue
of their new <hi>Popes:</hi> Experience telling us, that, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Shift</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> there are very few either ſo Mean,
or ſo Inopinionative, as not to pleaſe themſelves with
ſome probable Object of <hi>Preferment.</hi> To content all,
(<hi>October</hi> 19. 1216.) a <hi>Child</hi> aſcends the Throne, Mild
and Gracious, but Eaſie of Nature, whoſe Innocency,
and natural Goodneſs, protected him throughout the
various Perils of his <hi>Father</hi>'s Reign. Happy was he in
his Uncle <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> (the Guide of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy;</hi>)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52928:7"/>
and no leſs fortunate, for thirty years after, whilſt
<hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> (Earl of <hi>Kent</hi>) that <hi>Faſt</hi> Servant of King
<hi>John</hi>'s againſt the <hi>French,</hi> both in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
together with <hi>Bygot</hi> Earl of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> of
like Gravity, and Abilities, had the management of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
Publick <hi>Distempers</hi> were then very few, and ſuch
only as are incident to all <hi>States,</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> greedy and
tenacious of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Rule:</hi> One vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<hi>Storm,</hi> 'tis true, was rais'd, by ſome old, conſtant
<hi>Followers</hi> of his Father; as <hi>Foulk de Brent,</hi> who (though
a <hi>Forreigner,</hi> yet) held at one time the Earldoms of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,
Oxford, Bedford</hi> and <hi>Buckingham; Brian de Liſle,</hi>
and ſome <hi>others.</hi> Theſe being men of turbulent Spirits,
and that could only Thrive by the <hi>Wars,</hi> were very ill at
eaſe in thoſe days of <hi>Sloth;</hi> (as they term'd that Calm of
King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Government.) Beſide that, the Juſtice of <hi>Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable
Times</hi> urg'd from them, to the lawful owners, ſuch
Lands and Caſtles, as the fury of <hi>War</hi> had unjuſtly given
them. Now perceiving by the <hi>Vprightneſs</hi> of the King,
that Power of <hi>Protection</hi> ſhould not be made a <hi>wrong-doer;</hi>
they broke forth into ſuch a <hi>Rebellion</hi> as ended not but
with their <hi>Lives;</hi> declaring that thoſe their Swords which
had ſet the <hi>Crown</hi> upon their Sovereign's <hi>Head</hi> when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Majesty</hi> could, ſhould now ſecure thoſe <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests</hi>
to their Maſters, when <hi>Majesty</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> would <hi>not.</hi>
Thus we ſee how dangerous are too great Benefits of <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
to their <hi>Princes;</hi> as rendring the <hi>Mind</hi> incapable of
any other ſenſe than that of <hi>Merit.</hi> This <hi>Blast</hi> being over,
the Government felt no other affliction than the Common
and Invidious Malevolence to Authority: Good and
Great Men may preſerve themſelves from <hi>Guilt,</hi> but not
from <hi>Envy;</hi> being ſtill ſhot at, by the <hi>Aſpiring</hi> of thoſe
that look upon themſelves as <hi>leſs</hi> in <hi>Employment</hi> than they
are in <hi>Deſert.</hi> Theſe Vapours, however, did ever vaniſh,
without much trouble, ſo long as the <hi>Helm</hi> was ſteered by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52928:7"/>
               <hi>Temperate Spirits,</hi> and the King ſquar'd his Actions by the
Rule of <hi>Good Counſel,</hi> and not of Young, Paſſionate, or

            </p>
            <p>Thirty years being now paſt and gone, and none of
the old Guides of the Kings <hi>Youth</hi> left alive, but <hi>de Burgh;</hi>
(a man in whom nothing of <hi>Worth</hi> was wanting, ſave
<hi>Moderation</hi>) his length of days gave him the advantage
of <hi>Sole Power,</hi> his Ambition furniſhing <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> to
keep out others. This drew upon him the implacable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of a great many, which was yet further augmented
by the freſh <hi>Honours;</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> that the King was then
pleas'd to confer upon him. Time had now wrought a
<hi>Revolution,</hi> as in it <hi>ſelf,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Hearts</hi> of the People,
who had forgotten the late <hi>Sufferings</hi> of their Fathers, and
labour'd under the ſurfeit of a <hi>long Peace;</hi> which having,
probably, let in ſome Abuſes, the Commons (to whom
the <hi>Preſent</hi> ſeems ever <hi>worſt</hi>) take the Alarm, fall to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the <hi>paſt Ages</hi> they never remembred, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
the <hi>Preſent;</hi> though equally ignorant of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe</hi>
of it, and of the <hi>Remedy.</hi> With theſe idle and uſual
<hi>Humours,</hi> ſtruck in ſome of the young <hi>Nobility,</hi> that were
warm and over weening, though altogether as <hi>unskilful</hi>
as the reſt: theſe fall to fullying the Wiſdom and Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Court-Officers,</hi> by magnifying each caſual miſhap
into a Crime, and expoſing every Blemiſh in Government;
and then having their Heads fill'd with certain <hi>Ideas</hi> and
Phantaſtick <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that they are able to mold any <hi>State</hi> according to theſe
<hi>general Rules,</hi> which in <hi>particular Application</hi> do ſtill appear
to be but idle and groſs Abſurdities. Being thus puft up in
Opinion of their own worth, they begin to caſt about
how to get into <hi>Employment,</hi> a thing they had long deſired,
and now do ſue for; and probable it is that the fartheſt of
their <hi>Aim,</hi> as yet, was to be quiet Inſtruments in ſerving
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52928:8"/>
the <hi>Crown,</hi> had they then been look'd upon as <hi>fit,</hi> and <hi>well
deſerving.</hi> But the King, having been tutor'd into a juſt
veneration for the Counſels of the <hi>Aged States-Men,</hi> and
reflecting that ſuch <hi>Green Heads</hi> were fitter for <hi>diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
than <hi>ſetling</hi> Affairs; either deny'd, or delay'd their
<hi>Requeſts:</hi> for Princes will ever chuſe their <hi>Miniſters, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual</hi>
to, not <hi>above</hi> their Buſineſs; <hi>Creatures</hi> that are <hi>only</hi>
theirs, out of meer <hi>Election;</hi> otherwiſe, without <hi>Friends</hi>
or <hi>Power.</hi> Amongſt this unequal <hi>Medly,</hi> there were, of
the <hi>Nobility,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Pembroke, Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
darlings of the <hi>Rabble;</hi> ſome of them upon the ſcore
of their Fathers Merits, whoſe memories were held <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,</hi>
as pretended Pillars of <hi>Publick Liberty,</hi> and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of <hi>encroaching Monarchy.</hi> Of the <hi>Gentry</hi> were <hi>Fitz-Geoffrey,
Bardolph, Griſley</hi> and <hi>Fitz-John;</hi> Spirits of as
much Arrogance, and Acrimony, as <hi>Camp, Court, Country,</hi>
(the places from whence they were Elected) could afford
any: <hi>Theſe</hi> were for attempting by <hi>open Force,</hi> what the
<hi>other</hi> ſought to effect by <hi>Artifice;</hi> but yet they were all
of them equally Impatient to behold their <hi>Ends</hi> thus fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and that ſo long as the King followed the Advice of
the Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> there would be no hopes of obtaining
their deſires. Wherefore they became frequent in their
<hi>Conſults</hi> and <hi>Gabals,</hi> day and night; and at laſt <hi>Sommery,</hi>
and <hi>Spencer,</hi> two that were far in Opinion with the reſt,
as being Gentlemen of <hi>Forreign Education,</hi> and better
qualifi'd than was uſual for men of thoſe times; gave it
as their Advice, that the ſureſt way to remove <hi>de Burgh</hi>
(that great, and good <hi>Obſtacle</hi>) out of the way of their
Advancement, would be, to pry narrowly into his Actions,
and ſide with his <hi>Oppoſite, Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter;</hi>
(an ill man, but in favour with the King) backing the
<hi>Motion</hi> with this ſuggeſtion, that the <hi>worthieſt</hi> being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out by the <hi>worſt,</hi> they ſhould be able either to mate
him with his own <hi>Vice,</hi> (which the higher he advanc'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52928:8"/>
would ſtill be the more viſible) and ſo remove him at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
or elſe, by ſuffering the King to deliver himſelf up
to ſuch bad <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as would loſe him the Hearts, and
Affections, of his People; they might thus plain the way
to their own <hi>Preferment:</hi> Thus they projected the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
of that by <hi>troubling</hi> the <hi>State,</hi> which, ſo long as it
was at <hi>quiet,</hi> they deſpair'd of obtaining; and ſo far did
the ſucceſs anſwer Expectation, that <hi>Spencer</hi> dy'd in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Rebellion, <hi>Juſticiarius Angliae,</hi> againſt his Maſter. This
advice now being approv'd, and put in Practice; the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and ambitious <hi>Biſhop</hi> is by money and addreſs eaſily
brought over to the <hi>Party;</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> are in all haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and preſented againſt the Earl; charging him with
waſting the Royal <hi>Treaſure,</hi> the ſale of <hi>Crown-Lands,</hi> and
(what theſe doubtful times held <hi>Capital</hi>) his allowing any
thing that might create a <hi>Rupture</hi> between <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
as his prevailing upon the King to revoke all <hi>Patents</hi>
granted in his <hi>Non-age,</hi> and enforcing the People not to
pay according to their Ability or the merit of the <hi>Grant,</hi>
but whatever the <hi>Miniſter</hi> himſelf ſhould think fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort.</p>

               <hi>De Burgh</hi> clear'd himſelf of all the Branches of this

this King is not wholly to be excuſed, that could ſo eaſily
give way to the blaſting the former Services of ſo faithful
an Officer, for <hi>that</hi> wherein himſelf was <hi>chief</hi> in
fault. But <hi>Princes</hi> are naturally more variable, and

many others) of <hi>Pembroke</hi> the Earl <hi>Marſhal,</hi> the
Common Rights of whoſe Office were unjuſtly with held
from him; would inevitably provoke <hi>Diſcontents,</hi> and
endanger the <hi>Weal</hi> of the Kingdom; the Rebellious <hi>Lords</hi>
had, queſtionleſs, gain'd their End, by exaſperating, and
emproving this <hi>Diſtemper</hi> into a <hi>Civil War. Denials</hi> of
Princes are ever to be ſuppli'd with gracious <hi>Uſage,</hi> thereby,
if not to cure the ſore, yet, at leaſt, to mitigate the <hi>Senſe</hi>

Thus now are the <hi>Strangers</hi> all remov'd and baniſh'd;
<hi>Rivallis</hi>'s Extortions examin'd, by many ſtrict Commiſſions
of <hi>Enquiry;</hi> the proud Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> (turn'd off

of all, and <hi>Precipitation.</hi> But the Lords finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſtill (by this <hi>Reformation</hi>) fruſtrated of their evil
Deſigns, began again to cheriſh the late grounds of the
Peoples <hi>Diſguſts,</hi> by ſcattering querulous and ambiguous

his <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> and <hi>Government;</hi> and ſeeking by all the

with the ſordid <hi>Rabble:</hi> Inſomuch that the King
(whoſe Nature was too mild for ſuch turbulent Spirits)
was oblig'd afreſh, to caſt himſelf upon the Advice and

            </p>
            <p>God, we know, governs the Hearts of <hi>Princes,</hi> and
ſends them ſuch <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as the quality of the Subject
meriteth: for <hi>Montford</hi> (a <hi>French-man</hi>) became the next
Object of the Kings Delight; being a Gentleman of choice
<hi>Blood, Education</hi> and <hi>Feature:</hi> And to ſo fond a degree
did the heady affection of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> dote upon him,
that, in his very Entrance into <hi>Grace,</hi> he made him Earl of
<hi>Leiceſter,</hi> to the general diſſatisfaction of the <hi>Nobility;</hi>
and gave him (to the no leſs offence of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating
the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>) his Vow'd, Vail'd <hi>Siſter,</hi>

<hi>Dependency</hi> the ſtrength of his <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> ſo <hi>Both</hi> at

of his Maſter; forgets <hi>Moderation; Diſcretion,</hi> in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52928:10"/>
Youth, ſeldom attending great and ſodain <hi>Fortunes.</hi> He
takes the manage of all <hi>Publick Affairs</hi> into his own hand,
and engroſſeth the diſpoſal of all <hi>Favours</hi> and <hi>Preferments;</hi>
ſo that all ſuites are addreſs'd to him, and the King becomes
(in effect) but as a <hi>Cipher</hi> ſet to add to this <hi>Figure</hi> the <hi>more</hi>
of <hi>Number.</hi> Great is the Errour of a Prince when the
<hi>Hope</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> comes to recognize it ſelf beholden to
the <hi>Servant,</hi> for <hi>that,</hi> which ought to be acknowledg'd as
the immediate Bounty and Goodneſs of himſelf: And
though they are not to be deny'd the privilege of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
above the reſt, ſome truſty <hi>Friend,</hi> to whom they
may communicate their neareſt <hi>Paſſions,</hi> yet ought they
ſo to temper the Current of <hi>Favour,</hi> as not to darken the
Luſtre of their <hi>Regalities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Great and Graveſt Men beholding the <hi>unworthy</hi>
thus to deal <hi>alone,</hi> in that which ought of Right, to have
paſs'd through <hi>their</hi> hands; and to ſtep over all their heads,
to the greateſt <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Offices;</hi> began to repine;
but upon ſecond thoughts, they ran along with the riſing
Grace of the Kings <hi>Half-Brethren,</hi> though <hi>Strangers,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
by this way of proceeding, to <hi>divide</hi> that Power
which, otherwiſe, they ſaw it impoſſible to <hi>Break.</hi> Yet
<hi>Leiceſter,</hi> being confident of his Maſters Love, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of bearing either <hi>Rival</hi> in Favour, or <hi>Partner</hi> in
Rule, oppoſeth them all: But he found, at length, in his
<hi>Ebb</hi> of kindneſs, the fortune of <hi>others;</hi> and that the King
could with as much eaſe transfer his <hi>Phanſie,</hi> as he had
ſettled his <hi>Affections.</hi> And in truth, extraordinary muſt
needs be the <hi>Artifice</hi> and <hi>Addreſs</hi> of that man, that is able
to keep himſelf aflote in the ſtream of a <hi>Monarchs</hi> good
Opinion; in regard that the change of his <hi>Will,</hi> (which
for the moſt part is ſtrongly influenc'd by Phanſie, and ſoon
cloyed) is hardly to be arreſted. To effect this, the <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
muſt ſolely attend the Honour and Service of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52928:10"/>
and (abandoning all other Conſiderations) inſinuate
himſelf into his <hi>inward Inclinations;</hi> winding into a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of <hi>Employment,</hi> by diſcharging the <hi>Offices</hi> of moſt
<hi>Secrecy,</hi> in reference either to <hi>publick Service,</hi> or the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
peculiar <hi>Pleaſures:</hi> He muſt alſo be careful to ſuppreſs
<hi>Competitors,</hi> by the hands of <hi>others,</hi> conceal in <hi>Publick,</hi>
his own <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> by counterfeit Affectations of <hi>Humility;</hi>
and in his perſute of <hi>Authority,</hi> he is to caſt a ſhew as if
his <hi>Promotions</hi> were the work of <hi>others,</hi> or of <hi>Conveniency,</hi>
rather than of any great <hi>Ambition</hi> of his own.</p>
            <p>But now, upon this Advantage, the Reines of Rule were
poſſeſſ'd by the ambitious <hi>Lords</hi> and entruſted (as <hi>Henry
Knighton</hi> ſays) in the hands of the Kings <hi>Half-Brethren,
Adam, Guido, Godfrey,</hi> and <hi>William;</hi> the King contenting
himſelf (being left to act his own part, as before) with
the <hi>Shadow</hi> only, and <hi>Licenſe</hi> of a great <hi>Fortune.</hi> And to
ſay the truth, he was ever <hi>Wyer-drawn,</hi> when he was ſo
happy as to have about him ſuch worthy Servants as would
urge and ſuggeſt things that were for his Honour. But
theſe <hi>Maſters,</hi> on the contrary, being puff'd up with the
conceit of having no <hi>Superiour;</hi> made it their buſineſs by
gentle Words and Flatteries, to ſeduce the unſteady mind
of the King from the Path of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> thereby to gain to
themſelves the privilege of doing what they liſt. So that
they fell immediately to filling the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and
<hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Truſt,</hi> with their own <hi>Country-men;</hi> exacting of
<hi>whom, how,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> they would; waſting the <hi>Publick Frea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
and <hi>Crown Lands,</hi> to the enriching of themſelves, and
dependents; ſetting Prices upon all <hi>Offences;</hi> and ſquaring
the <hi>Law</hi> according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of their own <hi>Breaſts:</hi> And
upon any Complaint of the <hi>Subject</hi> the uſual <hi>Reply</hi> of
their Servants was, <hi>How'le ye help your ſelf; for the Kings
Pleaſure's in my Maſters Pocket?</hi> Nay to ſo inſupportable a
degree of Licentiouſneſs did theſe <hi>Strangers</hi> proceed; that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52928:11"/>
they ſeem'd rather to have entr'd the <hi>Land</hi> by <hi>Conqueſt,</hi>
than upon <hi>Invitation:</hi> they enforc'd upon the great men
not <hi>Obedience</hi> only, but <hi>Servitude</hi> and reduced the meaner
ſort to ſo wretched a degree of <hi>Poverty,</hi> that they might
juſtly ſay they <hi>had nothing.</hi> Yet leſt the Groanes of his
<hi>People,</hi> and the wickedneſs of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſhould come
to the King's Ear, by the means of good and able Men;
they deny all ſuch the leaſt Acceſs: <hi>Suſpicion</hi> (being the
beſt preſerver of her own <hi>Deſerts</hi>) ſtill keeps a ſtrict eye
upon thoſe that have a due ſenſe of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Virtue;</hi>
as fearing <hi>them</hi> moſt. Thus by the <hi>Inhability</hi> of the Prince,
the Government becomes a Prey to theſe <hi>Lawleſs Minions;</hi>
which occaſions infinite Corruptions and Diſorders in all
the <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>State;</hi> all preſuming upon <hi>his</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
do endeavour to graſp at an <hi>Arbitrary Authority,</hi> that
they may make <hi>Profit</hi> of it, and eaſily permit the encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of <hi>Ill,</hi> as the ready way to make their own <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Confuſions</hi> were uſher'd in by a <hi>Famine,</hi> and <hi>that</hi>
ſo violent an one, that the king is forc'd to direct <hi>Writs</hi>
to the ſeveral Counties, to bury their Dead, they were
ſo Numerous: The <hi>Dearth</hi> continues, and then fell the
<hi>Sword</hi> to raging ſo terribly, that no man durſt walk abroad
without <hi>Arms;</hi> all the <hi>Villages</hi> being left as a Prey to the
tumultuous <hi>Rabble;</hi> who raving up and down, by the
<hi>Connivance</hi> of ſuch as ought to have ſuppreſs'd them;
it plainly appear'd, that the Factious <hi>Lords,</hi> whom the
King ſuſpected, had fomented and given Life to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion;</hi>
Seditious <hi>Peers</hi> ever bringing <hi>Fewel</hi> to ſuch <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Fires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither was the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf without a buſie Part in
this <hi>Tragical Scene:</hi> For the Biſhops of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and
<hi>Lincoln</hi> (being well-wiſhers to <hi>Montford</hi> and his <hi>Faction</hi>)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52928:11"/>
were far engaged. In ſuch Deſigns <hi>Church-men</hi> are never
wanting; and the diſtaſt of the <hi>establiſh'd Government</hi> as
well <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> as <hi>Civil,</hi> will ever be a <hi>Knot</hi> of <hi>Strength</hi>
for ſuch unquiet Spirits, who are as greedy after <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
in the <hi>Church,</hi> as in the <hi>State;</hi> and ever crying up ſome
new <hi>Model</hi> of <hi>Policy</hi> or <hi>other;</hi> ſuch as is moſt reliſhing to
the <hi>giddy Multitude,</hi> who (at this time) were mightily
offended (and not without reaſon neither) at the <hi>new Courts</hi>
of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> their <hi>Pomp, Rapaciouſneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of the <hi>Pope.</hi> This was a fair pretext for the factious
part of the <hi>Clergy</hi> ſo far to perſue the <hi>Orders, Ceremonies</hi>
and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> with bitter <hi>Speeches</hi> and
<hi>Invectives;</hi> that ſome of them incur'd the ſentence of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Treaſon</hi> at <hi>Home:</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning
the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> as he tendered his <hi>Salvation,</hi>
to maintain the <hi>Cauſe</hi> (meaning his <hi>Rebellion</hi>) to the very
Death; and aſſerting, that the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Church</hi>
was never to be eſtabliſh'd but by the <hi>Material Sword.</hi> But
that could never (ſurely) be the ſoundeſt <hi>Doctrine</hi> (what
ever might be pretended) which was only to be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Licence;</hi> ſeeing the <hi>firſt Church</hi> (contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)
grew up, by <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> True <hi>Piety</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
the Subject to <hi>deſire</hi> a <hi>Good</hi> Sovereign, but to <hi>bear</hi> with
a <hi>Bad</hi> one; and take the Burthen of <hi>Princes</hi> with a bended
Knee; ſo, in time, to deſerve <hi>Abatement;</hi> rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<hi>Authority. Church-men</hi> ought not always, therefore,
to be our <hi>Oracles,</hi> as to matters of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Allegeance,</hi>
they may ſafely inform us of our Duty in difficult Poynts
of <hi>Religion;</hi> and where an humble ignorance is a ſecure
knowledge, we may rely upon them; but they are not to
be harken'd to in their clamorous <hi>Harangues</hi> againſt
<hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to remedy all theſe Confuſions, and ſupply the
Kings neceſſities, a <hi>Parliament</hi> was call'd at laſt; much to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52928:12"/>
the liking of thoſe Lords, who as little meant to <hi>Relieve</hi>
the <hi>King,</hi> as they did to <hi>Heal</hi> the <hi>State;</hi> their End, at that
time, being only to lay open, at <hi>Home,</hi> the <hi>Poverty</hi> of
their <hi>Maſter;</hi> leſſen his Reputation, <hi>Abroad;</hi> and in thoſe
times of <hi>Privilege,</hi> to breath out their <hi>Paſſions</hi> freely. Here
they began to twit him with the <hi>Wrong</hi> he had done to the
<hi>Publick,</hi> in engroſſing the choyce of the <hi>Chief Juſtice,
Chancellor,</hi> and <hi>Treaſurer;</hi> who ought not (they ſaid) to
have been Elected, but by the <hi>Common Counſel</hi> of the <hi>Realm;</hi>
highly applauding the Reſolution of the Biſhop of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
in refuſing to ſurrender the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> but in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
where he receiv'd it. Then they charge him with
having conferr'd all the places of <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> in his
diſpoſal, upon <hi>Forreigners;</hi> and leaving his <hi>Engliſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
unrewarded; with having ruin'd the <hi>Merchants</hi> Trade
by the introducing of <hi>Maletolts,</hi> and impoſing of <hi>Heavy
Cuſtoms;</hi> with having violated the <hi>Common Liberty,</hi> by
<hi>Non obſtantes</hi> in his <hi>Patents,</hi> thereby to ſecure <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
for his private <hi>Favorites;</hi> with having taken the <hi>Bread</hi>
out of the Peoples mouths, and forced away their <hi>Horſes</hi>
from the very Plow; with ſending his Juſtices into the
Country, to oppreſs and fleece the <hi>People,</hi> by <hi>fob'd Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and falſe <hi>Accuſations;</hi> telling him that Sr. <hi>Robert de
Purſloe</hi> had extorted great Summs of money from the <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers</hi>
of his <hi>Forreſts,</hi> upon pretence of <hi>Encroachments.</hi>
So that they were amazed (they ſaid) to hear, that he
ſhould now demand <hi>Relief</hi> of them; ſince the <hi>Commonalty</hi>
was ſo miſerably pill'd, pol'd, and empoveriſh'd, by the
multitude of former <hi>Contributions,</hi> that they were incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of making any ſort of ſupply. And therefore they
ſuggeſted to him, that, they being able to prove his need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Expences, ſince the Kingdom began to be oppreſs'd,
to have amounted to above eight hundred thouſand pound;
it was but fitting that he ſhould call to account, and pluck
from his <hi>Favorites;</hi> who had gleaned the <hi>Treaſure</hi> of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52928:12"/>
               <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and ſhared the old <hi>Crown-Lands</hi> amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
Several of them having, in a ſhort ſpace, from the
Inheritance of an <hi>Acre</hi> advanced into the Poſſeſſion of an
<hi>Earldom;</hi> inſtancing in the Caſe of one <hi>Manſel</hi> (an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<hi>Clerk</hi>) who roſe from <hi>Nothing,</hi> to ſpend at the rate
of four thouſand Marks (beſide fifty <hi>Promotions</hi> that he
had engroſs'd, in the <hi>Church</hi>) in <hi>annual Revenue;</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Opinion,</hi> that more moderate <hi>Fees</hi> ought to have
contented a <hi>Pen-man</hi> that was no better qualified than with
the ordinary fruits of a <hi>Writing-School.</hi> Yet they aſſured
his Majeſty after all, that if a <hi>Reaſonable Supply</hi> would ſuit
with his Occaſions; they were ready ſo far to teſtifie their
Obedience in that particular, as his Behaviour ſhould fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
merit: ſetting a day (ſays <hi>Matt. Paris</hi>) by which the
King was to redreſs the <hi>Abuſes</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> of his <hi>Court,</hi>
and work into the good Opinion of the <hi>Nobles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time being come, and he having ratified afreſh the
<hi>Great Charter,</hi> admitted into his <hi>Councel</hi> ſome perſons of
the Commons <hi>Election,</hi> and promiſed for the future to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himſelf for Counſel to <hi>Natives,</hi> not Forreigners;
they at length granted him ſuch an <hi>Allowance</hi> as left him
at their <hi>Devotion</hi> for a <hi>further Supply.</hi> Thus <hi>Parliaments,</hi>
that (<hi>Before</hi>) were ever a Medicine to heal up any <hi>Rupture</hi>
in the Princes <hi>Fortunes,</hi> grew (<hi>now</hi>) to be worſe than the
<hi>Diſeaſe;</hi> malignant <hi>Humours</hi> being more predominant in
them than well-compoſed <hi>Tempers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having by this, fully diſcovered the <hi>Drift</hi> of
his rebellious <hi>Lords;</hi> and finding that they took advantage
of his <hi>Neceſſities,</hi> to enſlave him; begins now to act the
good <hi>Husband,</hi> cloſeth his hand of <hi>Waſte,</hi> and reſolves
(though too late) to bear himſelf upon his own <hi>Legs.</hi>
But this Experience is ſtill pernicious to the <hi>Private,</hi> and
dangerous to the <hi>Publick Weal</hi> of a <hi>State;</hi> as not being
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52928:13"/>
able to <hi>do,</hi> but by <hi>undoing,</hi> nor to diſcern <hi>Order,</hi> till <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order</hi>
ſhews it. And yet ſtill Alas! ſuch was his eaſineſs
and flexibility, when he came to be preſt hard by his
<hi>French Minions;</hi> that he was not capable of witholding
his hand from their inſatiable <hi>Deſires,</hi> and endleſs <hi>ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings:</hi>
Inſomuch that it then became a <hi>By-word, Our
Inheritance is poſſeſs'd by</hi> Aliens, <hi>and our Houſes by</hi> Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
Dependents upon a King that is exceſſive in <hi>Largeſſes,</hi>
become exorbitant in their <hi>Demands;</hi> meaſuring them not
by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but example: <hi>Paſt favours</hi> are never reckon'd
upon, nor any Bounty valued but what is purely <hi>Future;</hi>
and look how much a Prince diſables himſelf by <hi>Giving,</hi>
ſo much the poorer he is of <hi>True Friends:</hi> ſuch <hi>Prodigality,</hi>
in a <hi>Sovereign,</hi> ever concluding in the Spoyl and Plunder
of his <hi>Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before the King would again ſubmit himſelf to ſo
many bold and ſtrict <hi>Inquiries</hi> of his Diſloyal Subjects,
as he had endured the laſt <hi>Parliament;</hi> he reſolves to try
and undergo all ſhifts, and extremities, that neceſſity and
a great mind, could impoſe upon him. Firſt therefore, he
expoſes the <hi>Crown-Lands,</hi> then his <hi>Jewels,</hi> to ſale; pawns
<hi>Gaſcoyn;</hi> and after <hi>That,</hi> his <hi>Imperial Crown:</hi> And when
his <hi>Credit</hi> would ſerve him no longer, (having ſo often
fail'd of his word) nor any thing of his <hi>own</hi> left to raiſe mony
upon; he then pawns the <hi>Jewels</hi> and <hi>Ornaments</hi> of St.
<hi>Edwards Shrine;</hi> and at the long run, (being deſtitute of
means to defray the Charge of his <hi>Court</hi>) was forced to
break up houſe, and with his Queen and Children to
preſs upon the <hi>Charity</hi> of his Subjects for his <hi>Daily
Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus, by <hi>Improvidence,</hi> again reduced himſelf
to this low <hi>Ebb;</hi> the Rebellious <hi>Lords</hi> grew more and more
intractable, in Confidence that the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> would,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52928:13"/>
now at laſt, inevitably fall a prey to their ambitious <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations;</hi>
which, that it might the ſooner come to paſs,
they coveted nothing more paſſionately, than to drive the
King into <hi>Want,</hi> that ſo they might conſtrain him to call
a <hi>Parliament;</hi> as phanſying to themſelves that <hi>Subjects,</hi>
at ſuch times, ſeem <hi>more</hi> than they ſhould be, <hi>Princes, leſs.</hi>
In order hereunto, they take a great deal of pains to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
falſe and ſeditious Rumours of the Kings intention
to repair his broken <hi>Fortunes</hi> by the Ruine of thoſe of his
<hi>Subjects;</hi> and that having nothing left of his own, he might
and intended to force from <hi>others;</hi> further inſinuating,
that Princes will never <hi>Want,</hi> ſo long as the people has
the means of <hi>ſupplying</hi> them. This ſcandalous <hi>Aſperſion</hi>
had the wiſhed for Effect; for it troubled the <hi>State;</hi> and
the flame would queſtionleſs have advanced <hi>Higher,</hi> had
not the King, aſſwag'd it, by <hi>Proclamations;</hi> wherein he
declared, that he was not inſenſible of the evil Arts that
had been made uſe of to ſeduce his Liege People into an
ill Opinion of his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> by falſe and
groundleſs Suggeſtions and Surmiſes, of his deſigning to
oppreſs them in their juſt <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Proprieties;</hi> by
ſuch undue practiſes (he ſaid) they laboured to withdraw
them from their Duty and Allegeance: He caution'd them
to give no heed to, and beware of ſuch malicious Diſturbers
of the <hi>Publick Peace;</hi> and aſſured them, that he had made
his Letters <hi>Patent</hi> purely to the end that they might be
ſatisfied as to his readineſs and reſolution to defend them
from the oppreſſion of the <hi>Great Lords,</hi> and inviolably to
maintain to them their lawful <hi>Cuſtoms, Privileges</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,</hi>
in every Branch of them. But for all this
yet, he found that <hi>Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> were not to
be kept aflote, without <hi>Purſe</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> and that
himſelf wanted ſo much of <hi>Both,</hi> as was requiſite for
ſtopping the Breach in his own <hi>Revenue,</hi> and his
Subjects <hi>Loyalty:</hi> Wherefore he betakes himſelf, at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52928:14"/>
length to the Boſom of his People for <hi>Relief</hi> and <hi>Counſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He called a <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Oxford;</hi> where his neceſſities
encountered ſo many undutiful Demands, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſurrender to their rebellious <hi>Will</hi> his <hi>Royal Power.</hi>
For the <hi>Commons,</hi> looking upon themſelves as the Patrons
of the peoples <hi>Liberties,</hi> preſs'd the King to give way to the
entruſting the Manage of the <hi>State</hi> in the hands of <hi>four
and twenty; twelve</hi> of them to be of their <hi>own</hi> Election,
and the <hi>reſt</hi> to be choſen by <hi>himſelf;</hi> who, in all things elſe,
was left a meer <hi>Cypher:</hi> Nay, and even in <hi>this</hi> Caſe, either
through <hi>Fear</hi> or <hi>Negligence</hi> he fill'd up his number with
<hi>Montford, Gloceſter</hi> and <hi>Spencer;</hi> which errour, over and
above the weakening of his own <hi>Party,</hi> won to thoſe his
late <hi>Oppoſites</hi> an Opinion of having got a great <hi>Intereſt</hi> in
his Favour. This <hi>Parliament</hi> it ſhould ſeem, never dreamt
of a <hi>Perpetuation;</hi> for otherwiſe, they might, probably, have
had it for the asking. But yet they got what ſerved their
Turn; for by this one <hi>Act</hi> he parted with his Right of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting</hi>
either <hi>publick Officer</hi> or <hi>private Servant;</hi> and brought
himſelf under a neceſſity of diſpoyling his <hi>Half-Brethren</hi>
and their <hi>Followers,</hi> baniſhing them the Realm by an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi>
under his own hand; and of commanding his
Writ <hi>pro Tranſportatione Fratrum ſuorum</hi> to be directed to
the Earles of <hi>Hartford</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> to prohibit their carrying
on Board with them either <hi>Mony, Arms,</hi> or <hi>Ornaments,</hi>
other than in the manner preſcribed. After their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
he ordered the men of <hi>Briſtol</hi> not to ſuffer any
<hi>Strangers,</hi> or <hi>Kinſmen</hi> of his, to land in their <hi>Port,</hi> but
ſo to demean themſelves in this particular, as they would
anſwer it to his <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>him.</hi> Thus we may ſee how
eaſily mens Eſtates do change in an Inſtant; and how
difficult a thing it is to enjoy <hi>quietly</hi> what was gotten <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly.</hi>
And now <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of
the <hi>Romans,</hi> (King <hi>Henrie's</hi> own Brother) being at this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52928:14"/>
time beyond the Seas, is by Letter tamper'd with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
to make a ſhew of Ratifying, by <hi>Oath,</hi> and <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Conſent,</hi> thoſe former <hi>Reſtrictions</hi> of <hi>Regal Power:</hi>
which, though he ſubmitted to, yet would not the <hi>Lords</hi>
ſuffer either the <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>him</hi> to enter <hi>Dover Caſtle;</hi>
(the Key of the Kingdom) they having furniſh'd it and
moſt of the other <hi>Forts</hi> of Reputation and Strength in
the Nation with <hi>Governours</hi> of their own <hi>Election,</hi> and
<hi>Sworn</hi> reſpectively to the <hi>State.</hi> The like aſſurance did
they alſo exact of all <hi>Sheriffs, Coroners, Bayliffs,</hi> and
other <hi>Publick Miniſters;</hi> examining the Behaviour of
many, by ſtrict Commiſſion upon <hi>Oath;</hi> hereby to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Favour with the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> who groaned under their
late Extortions. But their Chief end in all this, was no
other, (as it afterwards appear'd) than by diſplacing the
faithful <hi>Servants</hi> of the King, upon pretence of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
teinted with <hi>Malignancy,</hi> to open a way for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
of their own <hi>Dependents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus changed the <hi>Sole</hi> Power into the Rule of
<hi>many,</hi> and thoſe by <hi>popular Election</hi> too; they perſwaded
themſelves, that by eſtabliſhing this Form of <hi>limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi>
they had wholly ſuppreſt all thoughts of hankering
afreſh after the whimſical humours of <hi>licentious Soveraignty.</hi>
But it fell out quite otherwiſe; for now every man began
to value himſelf upon his own <hi>Abilities,</hi> and to crack his
Skull upon any Deſign that might probably enlarge the
Boundarys of his <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Command.</hi> The <hi>Grandees</hi>
alſo fell to rending and lopping off from the <hi>Revenues</hi> and
<hi>Segniories</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> all ſuch <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Manours</hi>
as bordered upon any of their own <hi>Seats;</hi> preſſing upon
the Kings Subjects, and Tenants, to a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable
degree of Servitude. Inſomuch that by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<hi>petite Annuities</hi> into great <hi>Honours,</hi> and tearing aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Royal Prerogative;</hi> they made themſelves, (of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52928:15"/>
               <hi>Subjects,</hi> whilſt they kept within the bounds of Duty,)
ſo many <hi>Tyrants,</hi> upon the loſs of their <hi>Loyalty;</hi> involving
the people in an extremity of <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion:</hi> And
yet they bore all with <hi>Patience;</hi> for <hi>Cuſtom</hi> being the only
eaſe of Exceſs of <hi>Miſery,</hi> men were contented to lay the
foundation of <hi>Servitude</hi> by the length of <hi>Sufferance;</hi> which
found neither End nor Abatement, until the <hi>quiet part</hi> of
the Kings <hi>Reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Montford, Gloceſter,</hi> and <hi>Spencer</hi> (the <hi>Heads of</hi>
this <hi>Conſpiracy</hi>) having, by the late Proviſions, drawn into
the hands of the <hi>twenty four Tribunes of the People,</hi> the
entire management of all Affairs; and finding this <hi>Power</hi>
to be yet too much diſpers'd, to anſwer their Expectations;
compelled the King to call another <hi>Parliament;</hi> where
they got the authority of the <hi>Twenty four</hi> aſſigned over
to <hi>themſelves,</hi> and erected a <hi>Triumvirate</hi> for their own
ends only, and not for reforming Abuſes, and ſettling the
Nation, as they at firſt gave out. And thus by the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of theſe <hi>Private</hi> Intereſts, the <hi>Publick</hi> was ſtaid,
for a time: But yet all this <hi>Juggle</hi> and <hi>Artifice,</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make the way the ſmoother for one of them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>perpetual Dictator. Ambition</hi> is never ſo high, but that
it ſtill labours to advance a ſtep further; and that Station
which lately ſeemed <hi>Inacceſſible,</hi> is now lookt upon but as a
<hi>Cocks-Stride;</hi> that which was <hi>Great,</hi> in the <hi>Perſute,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Inconſiderable,</hi> in the <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi> Theſe <hi>Three</hi> Elect <hi>nine
Counſellours (Three</hi> of them at leaſt to make a <hi>Quorum</hi>) who
were to diſpoſe of and fortifie <hi>Caſtles,</hi> and tranſact other
Affairs of the <hi>Realm.</hi> But the <hi>Chief Juſtice, Chancellour,
Treaſurer,</hi> and all other <hi>Officers,</hi> greater or leſs, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Choice of to <hi>themſelves:</hi> binding the King ſo
very ſtrictly to this hard <hi>Bargain,</hi> that he ſubmits to paſs
an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> to them under the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> and <hi>Oath,</hi>
whereby he actually diſcharged them from their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52928:15"/>
when ever he ſhould attempt to aſſume to himſelf the
<hi>Royal Dignity;</hi> declaring it to be lawful (in ſuch Caſe)
for the whole <hi>Nation</hi> to riſe up as one man, and, (having
no <hi>Obligation</hi> to him) by force to reduce him into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>And yet not long after; this <hi>Prodigy</hi> of <hi>Fortune</hi> (whom
ſhe had made a wretched <hi>Example</hi> of her <hi>Inconſtancy</hi>)
finding no part of his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> left him, but the bare <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi>
and even <hi>that</hi> precarious too; craves Aid of <hi>Pope Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,</hi>
the fourth, againſt his diſloyal <hi>Subjects;</hi> who arm'd
him with <hi>Excommunications</hi> againſt all that ſhould
not forthwith return to their Duty; and Cancell'd his
<hi>Oath,</hi> and <hi>Contract;</hi> in regard that it was made when he
could not properly ſay that he was at <hi>Liberty; Force</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no power to create a <hi>juſt Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Lords,</hi> having now imp'd their wings with <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi>
Feathers, and liking no <hi>Game</hi> but what was rak'd out
of the Aſhes of <hi>Monarchy;</hi> boldly make head againſt
their <hi>Soveraign:</hi> And that they might be the better able
to cope with him, call in the <hi>French</hi> to their Aſſiſtance.
Thus again did the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> turn her Sword againſt
her own Breaſt; and invite her antient Enemy to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of her <hi>Liberty;</hi> ſo that it was a great <hi>Providence</hi>
that ſhe fell not, at this time, under a <hi>Forreign Yoke.</hi> Now
though theſe men were much more apprehenſive of their
own <hi>Diſgrace</hi> than of others <hi>Miſeries;</hi> yet could they
find no better <hi>Pretext</hi> for <hi>private</hi> Intereſt, than that of
the <hi>Publick.</hi> Wherefore at the entry of this Rebellion
they cryed out for <hi>Liberty;</hi> though when it drew near an
end, they never ſpoke <hi>word</hi> of it. Well! at <hi>Lewis</hi>
the Armies met, and the King endeavours a <hi>Reconciliation,</hi>
but in vain; for Arguments are ever unprofitable, when
Juſtice is inferiour to Force. Wherefore the Sword de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52928:16"/>
the <hi>Controverſie,</hi> and makes the two <hi>Kings</hi> and their
eldeſt <hi>Sons,</hi> Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſon</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> being now both of them in
the hands of <hi>Montford</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> found no other
means of <hi>Security,</hi> or expectation of <hi>Liberty,</hi> than what
the emulous <hi>Competition</hi> of <hi>Greatneſs</hi> (which began to break
forth between theſe two mighty <hi>Rivals</hi>) gave hope of:
For <hi>Leiceſter</hi> deſigning, (by engroſſing from his <hi>Partner</hi>
the Perſon of the <hi>King,</hi> and ſecuring to his <hi>Followers</hi> the
beſt part of the <hi>Spoil</hi>) to draw more fruit from this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
than, in <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> it could yield, diſſolv'd the
Knot of all their <hi>Amity.</hi> Thus we may obſerve that <hi>equal
Authority,</hi> with the <hi>ſame Power,</hi> is ever fatal to all great
Actions; for to reduce minds to ſo even a pitch that they
ſhould not have ſome ſtrings of <hi>Diſagreement,</hi> is abſolutely
impoſſible. <hi>Montford</hi> having thus broken all faith with
his <hi>Confederates,</hi> as well as <hi>Duty</hi> to his <hi>Sovereign;</hi> left the
Path of <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to approach the King
by that of <hi>Haughtineſs</hi> and <hi>Diſtruſt;</hi> plying him with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
that his <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> were evermore directed to
the good of the <hi>Publick,</hi> and the eaſe of the <hi>People;</hi> that
in all <hi>this</hi> he entertain'd no private Paſſion, in oppoſition
to the ſenſe of his Allegiance; but was capable of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
his <hi>Deſires</hi> according to his juſt <hi>Power,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to his Majeſties <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> in caſe he would be
rul'd; that is to ſay, (as he explain'd himſelf) command
the <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Caſtles</hi> of his now <hi>Oppoſite, Gloceſter,</hi> and
the reſt, to be deliver'd up into his hands. It was no eaſie
matter, we may well imagine, for the King thus to be tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor'd
by his inferiour, and Vaſſal: But <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> in ſuch
Caſes, commonly bears down before it all <hi>Formalities:</hi>
And therefore this poor Prince who (lying at the <hi>Victors</hi>
Diſcretion) ſeem'd to have been rais'd, only to ſhew the
<hi>Inconſtancy</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and the <hi>Vanity</hi> of man; ſuited
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52928:16"/>
himſelf with incomparable <hi>Wiſdom</hi> according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igences
of the <hi>Times:</hi> Neither could <hi>Humility</hi> injure <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi>
when the only means to contein Spirits ſo inſolent
within due bounds, was <hi>Diſſimulation.</hi> Wherefore he
ſummons, in Perſon, the <hi>Forts</hi> of his faithfulleſt <hi>Friends</hi>
to yield to his greateſt <hi>Enemies;</hi> entering them, in ſhew
as his <hi>Lodging,</hi> but, in effect, as his <hi>Priſon;</hi> and ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
forc'd to take <hi>Law</hi> from him, to whom he lately
thought to have given it. <hi>Leiceſter</hi> is now become the
<hi>Darling</hi> of the <hi>Rabble,</hi> who eaſily crouch and change to
every new <hi>Maſter;</hi> but yet the Sober and conſidering
part of the Nation durſt not venture to ſayl along with
his <hi>Fortune,</hi> by the Light of his <hi>Glory;</hi> as knowing well
that <hi>Cryſtal,</hi> though it fairly glitters, yet is ſoon broken;
and that as the <hi>Aſcent</hi> of <hi>Uſurpation</hi> is ſlippery, ſo the <hi>Top</hi>
is tottering, and the <hi>Fall</hi> dreadful. To account this man
therefore at the very height of his falſe Felicity to be truly
<hi>Happy,</hi> was but to give the name of the <hi>Image</hi> to the <hi>Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
that was not yet molten: For by <hi>this</hi> time the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
<hi>Prince</hi> had made an Eſcape, and was faſt aſſur'd of
<hi>Gloceſter</hi> upon the ty of his <hi>great Mind,</hi> and <hi>Diſcontent.</hi>
Wherefore they both of them united with the ſhattered
<hi>Remnant</hi> of the <hi>Loyal Army,</hi> and, by a ſpeedy march,
<hi>arriv'd</hi> unlookt for, upon the banks of the unarmed Troop
of the ſecure Rebels quartering about <hi>Eveſham;</hi> whom
they inſtantly aſſayl'd; as knowing it to be no fit ſeaſon
to give time, when no <hi>time</hi> could aſſure ſo much as <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition</hi>
promis'd. <hi>Spencer,</hi> and other <hi>Lords</hi> of that <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
made toward the King for <hi>Mercy;</hi> but could not get
clear of the Preſs, being hurry'd along the Stream, and
periſhed in the Confuſion. We are to conſider that <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Motion depends in a great meaſure upon the Conduct
of <hi>Fortune, Private</hi> on our <hi>own</hi> Carriage: And we muſt
take heed how we run down <hi>ſteep</hi> Hills with <hi>heavy</hi> Bodieſ
which being once in motion, are hurry'd on by their own
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52928:17"/>
weight, and Stops are then no longer <hi>Voluntary.</hi> Now
<hi>Leiceſter</hi> being at that inſtant with the King, and out of
the <hi>Storm,</hi> might have got away; if his <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
had not encreas'd his <hi>Reſolution</hi> with his <hi>Misfortune:</hi>
He could neither abandon his <hi>Followers,</hi> nor his <hi>Ambition;</hi>
ſo that improving <hi>Adverſity</hi> into an exerciſe of <hi>Virtue,</hi> he
<hi>came,</hi> and <hi>fell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being by this ſuccesful <hi>Turn</hi> freed and obey'd;
began to enquire into the ground of his former <hi>Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;</hi>
and why that <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> which had ſo
long ſettled and ſupported the <hi>Engliſh, Empire</hi> in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Luſtre and Reputation, throughout the Reign of his
Glorious <hi>Anceſtors;</hi> ſhould now turn tail upon Him, and
Confederate with his <hi>Enemies;</hi> to the almoſt abſolute
deſtruction of the <hi>State,</hi> and as if her <hi>Genius</hi> had quite
ſorſook her: Upon due <hi>ſearch,</hi> he finds his <hi>ſquandering
hand</hi> to have made too bold with the <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi>
of his People; and that the rapacious Exorbitances of his
<hi>Civil Ministers,</hi> the Licentiouſneſs of his <hi>Martial Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
his own harſh <hi>Demeanour</hi> and <hi>Inacceſſibleneſs,</hi> and his
neglect of keeping his <hi>Word,</hi> had loſt him his <hi>Nobility</hi> at
home: And that his <hi>Neceſſities,</hi> which forc'd him to make
Merchandize of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> as his laſt Refuge; and
to put himſelf into the power of Perſons <hi>doubtful</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd;</hi>
together with his giving himſelf up to a <hi>ſenſual Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,</hi>
and entruſting with the management of the <hi>State,</hi>
baſe, griping and unworthy <hi>Officers,</hi> whoſe Counſels were
ever more <hi>ſubtle</hi> than <hi>Subſtantial,</hi> had wounded his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi>
abroad, and thrown down thoſe Pillars of <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
Credit</hi> and <hi>Veneration.</hi> Wherefore he enters upon
his regain'd <hi>Authority</hi> with <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> and <hi>Clemency;</hi> whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paſſing over the faults of <hi>moſt</hi> of the <hi>Rebels:</hi> (A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
kind of pardoning, not ſo much as to take notice of
the Offence!) and ſo forgot the <hi>Reſt,</hi> that they might live,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52928:17"/>
but to the Glory of his <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> for the <hi>fewer</hi> kill'd, the
<hi>more</hi> remain to adorn the <hi>Trophy. Tyrants</hi> indeed ſhed
Blood for <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> but <hi>Kings,</hi> out of <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> And yet
leſt his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> might ſuffer too much, by his
<hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> ſome <hi>few</hi> he puniſh'd with eaſie <hi>Fines,
others,</hi> by Exile; as the two Guiltleſs, yet unpity'd Sons
of the Arch-Traytor <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> So odious (we ſee) is
<hi>Treaſon</hi> in the <hi>Head,</hi> that it involveth the innocent <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
in an everlaſting <hi>Diſtruſt;</hi> and that which in others
is but <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> in them is <hi>Guilt.</hi> Then he proceeds to
confer upon the conſtant adherers to his broken Fortunes,
the <hi>Forfeitures</hi> of his Enemies; but with much more
<hi>Warineſs</hi> than before: as having found (by Experience)
<hi>immoderate Liberality</hi> to be but a weak means to win <hi>Love;</hi>
becauſe it loſt more in the <hi>Gathering</hi> than it gain'd in the
<hi>Giving.</hi> A <hi>Bounty</hi> plac'd without <hi>Reſpect,</hi> is taken with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
<hi>Gratitude;</hi> diſcredits the <hi>Receiver,</hi> and detracts from
the judgment of the <hi>Beſtower;</hi> blunting the <hi>Appetites</hi> of
ſuch a draw their Hopes of Preferment from meaſures
of Fidelity and Service. Thus at laſt he learn'd that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
and <hi>Reprehenſion</hi> diſcreetly temper'd, do Ballance
<hi>Government;</hi> and that it much importeth a Prince to keep
that Hand <hi>ſteady</hi> and <hi>equal,</hi> that holds the <hi>Scale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place he appli'd himſelf to the correcting of
his own <hi>natural Infirmities:</hi> Wiſely judging, that though
the Princes <hi>Manners</hi> are only a <hi>mute Law,</hi> yet have they
more of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> in them, than thoſe of <hi>Letters.</hi>
So that though he might now and then touch upon the
skirts of <hi>Vice,</hi> yet was he ever after cautious of entering
the <hi>Circle.</hi> And whereas the Crimes and Enormities of the
great Men of his <hi>Court</hi> were, at this this time, become ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly
numerous, that they were drawn into <hi>Example</hi>
and <hi>Imitation:</hi> He purg'd <hi>this</hi> likewiſe with ſingular ex
actitude of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Severity;</hi> knowing full well
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52928:18"/>
that it was <hi>it</hi> that gave life to the <hi>Moderation</hi> or <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>He reduc'd the Expences of his <hi>Houſe</hi> to the juſt Rule
of his proper <hi>Revenue;</hi> and was often heard to ſay that
<hi>his former exceſſive ſquanderings had torn open an Iſſue of his
Subjects Blood.</hi> The Fury and Inſolence of the <hi>Soldiery</hi>
(now become <hi>Licentious,</hi> by means of the <hi>Civil Wars</hi>)
he ſpent and corrected by forreign <hi>Expeditions:</hi> which
he was the rather induc'd to do, upon finding that the
<hi>peaceable</hi> (only) bore the Burthen of all the late <hi>Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi>
and that the <hi>other</hi> were never ſatisfi'd, but in the
miſeries of the Innocent; being as ready as ever, if they
ſhould find no Enemies <hi>abroad,</hi> to ſeek out ſome at <hi>Home.</hi>
Neither did he forget to examine or redreſs, by ſtrict <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
the Rigour and Corruption of his <hi>Judicial Officers;</hi> as
apprehending, that the ſenſe of their <hi>Severity</hi> would raiſe
a murmur of his own <hi>Cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He fill'd up the ſeats of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Councel</hi> with men
of Noble Extraction. For ſuch do with leſs offence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
