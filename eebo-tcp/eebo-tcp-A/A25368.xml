            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all Ingenious Persons that are imployed in, and love the Use of <hi>Great Artillery.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HOW the <hi>French</hi> Engineers and Gunners come to be so skilful, to do such Service with their <hi>Great Artillery</hi> by Sea and Land, may be seen at <hi>Prop.</hi> IV. hereof.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>English</hi> Engineers and Gunners may learn to be more skilful with their Artillery (at Sea, at <hi>Prop.</hi> I. hereof; and by Land, in a Treatise <hi>To Hit a Mark,</hi> lately publish'd) than the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our <hi>English</hi> Engineers say, That it is so much of Art that they cannot use it, the Answer is, Then they must be foyl'd by them that will learn Art and use it. If they say they can do it without Art, 'tis true; but that will require much more Time and Charge before they can come near the Mark, <hi>And because some do not know Art, therefore others must not practise Art.</hi> Not to say what might be said, but to bring Art into Practice: I freely offer, if it might please those <hi>Generous</hi> and <hi>Noble Souls</hi> whom it concerns, to command the Gunners, and the Gunners to be so kind to themselves and the Country that they serve, as to go with me to <hi>Wimbleton-Heath,</hi> where I have Guns mounted, fit for extraordinary Service, and have practised my self near 20 Years; there will I endeavour to teach them the Use of the Mortar and Long Gun, according to Art, which is much better than that absurd way which they now use.</p>
            <p>One thing I have for a long time wondered at, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Train of Artillery under all its Circumstances, being so very chargeable, and its Execution of so great importance, and yet the Practice thereof neglected in the greatest Extream.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105032:3"/>I hope no Man will count those things difficult, or too much of Art, which falls so necessary in his Way, to serve his King and Country. All ingenious Persons know, that Art at first seems difficult, yet with some Study and Practice becomes very easie.</p>
            <p>For when that great Mathematician <hi>Torricellius</hi> came to strike a Mark upon Ascents and Descents in the Parabola, he found it so difficult, that he himself confesses, That he had no Science to resolve it. <hi>De Motu Project. pag. 220.</hi> But being now resolved, is become wonderful easie to them that will consider it.</p>
            <p>Certainly, it may be taken for a General Rule, The more any Person is Mathematical, or knowing in the Mathematicks, the fitter he is for all the parts of Military Affairs; and likewise a Nation never receives greater Damage and Disgrace, than when ignorant and unfaithful Persons are put in Places of Trust, which I wish never to see in <hi>England</hi>

In <hi>Fig.</hi> Z, If RC be made equal to DE in <hi>Fig.</hi> Y, and CD in <hi>Fig.</hi> Z, be made equal to the double of the greatest Range, then CA will be a mean Proportion.

                  <p>GP = square of DC, and GrS / R = square of AC, also because the sine of GP is −, and GrS / R is +, therefore the square of AD is the difference of those Squares, 47.

               <p>IN the Year 1673.

For which Service the <hi>French</hi> King made Mons. <hi>Blondell</hi> Master de Camp and gave him about <hi>200l.</hi> sterl. a Year, as I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed.

               <p>But as I have been at some Pains and Charge to bring the Use of Great Artillery to a greater perfection than formerly, in my <hi>Genuine Use of the Gun,</hi> and in a Treatise <hi>To Hit a Mark,</hi> so now, I move forward, that ingenious Persons may be instructed in that Art, so they may be capable to serve, and to be an Honour to their King and Country.</p>
