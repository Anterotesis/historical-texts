            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>SAmuel Iohnson,</hi> having been Tryed and Convicted the last <hi>Term,</hi> for a <hi>High-Misdemeanor</hi> in writing the above-mentioned <hi>LIBELS</hi>; and being Convicted thereupon, he was (by Rule of Court) brought down to Receieve his Sentence, which is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Mr. <hi>Attorney General</hi> had moved for Judgment, Mr. <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> told the Court that he had moved for an Arrest of Judgment,
<pb facs="tcp:35887:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
forasmuch as he had several Exceptions to make, all of which, he urged in his own Defence, using several Evading and Extenuating Arguments, whereby to make the Court believe that he intended no Evil in the Consequence of his Writing; but to teach the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my their Duty to God and their Prince, and how they ought to behave themselves as they were English Men, with many other weak Arguments, all which prevailed nothing with the Court, but rather aggravated his Crime: In that he used some Texts of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in way of Comparison, which he would have insinuated to be his Meaning in the intent of the said <hi>LIBELS</hi>; and that he had said nothing but what was Lawful to say.</p>
            <p>But the Court told him that his Exceptions were but a kind of a Paraphrase, which did much aggravate his Crime, more than any way excuse him; and that he did abuse the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> yea, and himself too, in making such Scriptural Exceptions; and that it was a Crime of very Evil Consequence, that one in his Station should offer to be Guilty of so Heinous an offence, that did tend so much to incite and stir up the King's Subjects to Rebellion against him; and that he should pretend to Write to the Souldiers who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Command, and dare not Rebell; therefore it must be meant of others, yea, the main strength of it, <hi>viz.</hi> His intention in the <hi>LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BELS</hi> was against the King himself, and desired him to consider of what bad Example it was to others; and the great abuse of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and a discredit to the Clergy of this Kingdome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other aggravating Circumstances: All which, the Court said de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served very great Punishment; the more, in that the offence was Committed by such an Author, who should have been a Credit to Religion, and to all the Professors of it; and that his Fault was so apparent to the World, that no one could be so stupid, but to be sensible of it: Telling him also, that he should be degraded from his Ministerial Function and Preferment, which the Court was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sorry for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet must pronounce this following Sentence.</p>
            <p>And that is,</p>
            <p>That he pay a Fine of Five Hundred Marks.</p>
            <p>And that he stand in the <hi>Pillory</hi> three times, <hi>viz.</hi> On <hi>Monday</hi> next in the <hi>Pallace Yard</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi>; and on the <hi>Wednesday</hi> following at <hi>Charing-Cross</hi>; and on the <hi>Monday</hi> after that, at the <hi>Royal-Exchange</hi> in <hi>Cornhill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to be whipt from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and to stand Committed till all be performed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
