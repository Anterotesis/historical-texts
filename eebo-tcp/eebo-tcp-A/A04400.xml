            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <list>
               <item>1 That God did predeſtinate all men to be ſaued, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that they repent and beleeuè the Goſpell.</item>
               <item>2 That God did not elect before all time, to grace and life,
any particular perſons; but in time he doth elect qualities, as
faith and obedience; and then finding theſe qualities in men,
he doth elect their perſons for the qualities ſake.</item>
               <item>3 That all men haue free will in themſelues, as well
to repent of their ſinnes, to beleeue the Goſpell and obtaine
ſaluation, as they haue to remaine in hardneſſe of heart and
vnbeliefe, and in the eſtate of damnation.</item>
               <item>4 That the ſtedfaſtneſſe of mans iuſtification and ſaluation
doth depend vpon his owne will, in continuing in the act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
and works of righteouſneſſe; and that ſuch as haue
faith in Chriſt Ieſus, regenerate perſons hauing their names
written in the book of life, may fall away from all, may become
vnregenerate, and haue their names raſed out of the booke
of life againe, and periſh: and that God doth alter and change
his purpoſe and promiſe, and come to hate and reiect ſuch as he
hath formerly loued and iuſtified.</item>
               <item>5 That there is no Originall ſinne, but that all children of
all maner of people in the world, as well heathens, Infidels,
Idolaters, worſhippers of Diuels, all kind of blaſphemers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators,

are free from all pollution of ſinne, both in the conception and

of yeares onely, as haue attained to true repentance and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
faith, being both in the account of the Church and in
the ſight of God regenerate perſons: and that the baptiſme of

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas Beloued, there hath
riſen and ſprung vp from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
vs, many dangerous
and erronious opinions, in theſe
our laſt dayes, about the ſubiect
of Religion, let it not therefore
ſeeme ſtrange vnto you, being
the Spirit of God, did not onely
foreſee, but alſo foretold of the
ſame, long before they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
euery one being diuided into ſundry and ſeuerall facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
all pretending to worſhip the true and euerliuing God in
ſpirit and in truth, ſpeaking peace vnto themſelues, when as
the moſt of them do yet lie wallowing in the puddle of iniquity,
and cradle of ſecuritie, being not purged in heart: all which
doe riſe two ſundry wayes, being branches of one ſtocke, deriued
from one principall head, (namely) the ſpirit of error: The
firſt is, in that they contemne, or ſo little, or lightly eſteeme
that meanes, which by Gods prouidence is affoorded vnto vs
vnder our peaceable dread Soueraigne Lord the King. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they being ſelfe conceited, or as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes,
aduancing themſelues in thoſe things they neuer ſaw, raſhly
puft vp with carnall mindes, ſuppoſing they know ſome thing
more then others, vnderualuing all, and ouerualuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues;
the conceit whereof cauſeth them to fall to Schiſme,
and ſeperate from all others, when as indeed and in truth they
being examined, by the word and Spirit of God, it will appeare
<pb facs="tcp:8177:3"/>
to the godly wiſe, that as yet moſt of them know nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
or as they ought to know, if euer they expect the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their ſoules. For if they were but poſſeſſed with the
true knowledge an liue of God in Chriſt, and ſo were of a
ſound mind, at Saint <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts all to be, it would rather
cauſe humiliation, then exaltation, which would truly teach
euery one how to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>meane &amp; carry himſelfe, about ſo weighty
a ſubiect. The neglect hereof doth bring them into a labyrinth
of errors, following after a forme of godlineſſe, through the
wiſdome and knowledge of the braine onely, without the power
thereof, contenting themſelues in the out ſide of religion, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
themſelues in what they can doe, and meaſuring the loue
of God to themſelues by their owne doings, as of old, their
predeceſſors, the Scribes and Phariſes did: following ſhadows
inſteed of ſubſtances, dreaming of a kind of felicitie in this
forme and in that, ſeeking peace and reſt to their ſoules,
where it is not to be found; which condition of theirs, I cannot
but condole, deſiring with the Prophet, <hi>That my head were
water, and mine eyes a fountaine or well of teares, that
I might weepe day and night for their miſery.</hi> And in
ſpeciall for them, who are neere and deere vnto me, in the
bonds of nature. For poore ſoules, they couer their ſpirituall
miſery, with <hi>Adams</hi> fig tree leaues, or with the ſpiders web,
ſtriuing for an outward ſeparation in the fleſh, when alas it is
much to be feared, that with many of them there is litle or
no care at all for a ſeparation of the ſoule from ſin: challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and aſſuming vnto themſelues ſoundnes of religion, and
aſſurance of Gods loue, euer meaſuring themſelues by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and not by that eternall wiſdome, which is Iuſtified of
her children, being blinded through ſelfe-loue, not willing to
iudge themſelues, and ſo become low in their owne eyes, that
God might be all in all, but contrariwiſe iudging and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
all, but themſelues, after this maner doe they follow
the viſion of their owne hearts, deceiuing and being deceiued,
running and flitting from one opinion vnto another, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
in all their wayes. Which practiſe of theirs may well be
compared vnto certaine flies, feeding on the backe of a gald
<pb facs="tcp:8177:3"/>
horſe, which is euer flitting or remouing from one place to
another, vntill at laſt they come to ſucke ſo much venome
therefrom, whereby they burſt aſunder: ſo likewiſe doe all
ſuch perſons, who haue not their hearts eſtabliſhed with true
ſauing grace, but with ſundry meates (that is to ſay) with
ſundry ſtrange and different opinions, (I call them ſtrange,
becauſe they were neuer heard of in all the Scriptures, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
ſhall appeare,) running from one forme of religion vnto
another, vntill at laſt they come to ſucke and feed vpon that
poyſonable hereſie of the Familiſts, who are not worthy to haue
ſo much as the name or title of religion giuen vnto them, it
being not onely the laſt ſtraine or faction they commonly run
into, but alſo deſtroying and damnable, whereby the word of
God is by them blaſphemed, and the way of life and truth
euill ſpoken of, to the great diſhonour of the great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Ichouah, who will one day breake and teare them in peeces
(as with a rod of iron) when none ſhall be able to deliuer them,
as a iuſt recompence of reward for all ſuch as take pleaſure
therein. So then beloued brethren, friends or kindred, of what
ſex or condition ſoeuer, whether yong or old, rich or poore, be
exhorted and forewarned hereby, not giuing the leaſt heed
vnto any lying ſpirits, vnder what pretence ſoeuer they haue,
may, can or will preſent themſelues vnto you; but (on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary)
labour by the grace and power you haue, or ſhall receiue
of the Lord, to reſiſt and auoid them, euen as our Lord and
Maſter did that archſpirit and enemie of all mankind, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if the leaſt way be giuen, you will be in danger to be
inthralled and inſnared by their deceiuings. And although
ſome of them be more defectiue and more dangerous to infect
the ſoules of men then others be, as moſt certaine there are,
for there are degrees as well in difference of ſpirits, as of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and naturall parts, yet (I ſay) they which may conceiue
haue moſt ſoundneſſe in their opinion, it will be found vpon
due and iuſt triall, not to be that which they would ſeeme both
vnto themſelues and others to be, which hereafter will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
Of theſe things, my beloued, I can in ſome meaſure
beſt aduertiſe you, being through want of the true ſauing
<pb facs="tcp:8177:4"/>
knowledge and vnderstanding of God and his truth, caught
and intangled by ſome of them, wandring vp and downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the drie hils and mountaines, conceiuing comfort,
when alas I was far from it; and the farther I wandred vp
and downe in that Egyptian darkneſſe, the more intricate laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
of error and darkneſſe my ſoule was plunged into; like
vnto a blind man who hauing not his perfect ſight, goes on in
darkneſſe, vntill at laſt he falls into a pit of deſtruction, for
want of a guide to conduct and leade him; and eſpecially when
I walked with the Anabaptiſts, which way and practiſe of
theirs, ſhall euidently appeare to euery honeſt, true and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
heart, not onely to ouerturne and race the foundation
of all Chriſtian religion, but alſo (in as much as in them lieth)
to deſtroy the faith of Ieſus Chriſt: all which time, though
ſtrangely deluded, yet was I kept by the power and prouidence
of God from being ſeduced and led into that deſtroying and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerable
way of death before mentioned, namely, the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
though very nigh vnto it, hauing one foote entred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
whiles I walked with the people aforeſaid, vntill at laſt
the Lord in his appointed time was pleaſed to giue me a true
ſight of the miſery wherein I was plunged; one meanes whereof
being the rod of correction, which God had laid vpon me, it
draue me the more ſeriouſly to examine things, and to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with my ſelfe, whether the cauſe (for which I ſuffered)
would any whit auaile me vnto ſaluation, or whether it would
miniſter comfort vnto me in that great and teerible day of
the Lord. So vpon a more ſerious ſuruay of thoſe poſitions I
then maintained, I found them all too light, yea ſo light, as
they were not able to ſtand againſt thoſe truths which the holy
Scriptures teach and maintaine: whereupon immediatly I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
my former receiued opinions, as erronious and wicked;
ſo that I may ſay (and that truly) with that holy man <hi>Dauid,
It was good for me that I was corrected and chaſtiſed,
for till then I went aſtray.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding, though I
was cleane eſcaped therefrom, within a ſhort time after, I was
ſo far from hauing or enioying true peace and comfort, that
in ſtead thereof, my poore diſtreſſed ſoule was accompanied
<pb facs="tcp:8177:4"/>
with nothing but ſtrange feares, terrors and guiltineſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
crying out againſt me for nothing but vengeance; the
miſery whereof was ſuch, as cauſed me to lament the time
wherein I was borne, not regarding wife, children, or any
friends whatſoeuer that came to viſit me. The miſery wherein
I was, did depriue me of being ſenſible of the leaſt ioy, either in
heauen or on earth, being altogether benummed therewith,

in them.</p>
            <p>But his predeſtination was in this ſort:</p>
            <p>Firſt, God (before he created any thing) ſaw and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew
what would be the nature &amp; euent of all things;
how though he made as excellent creatures as could be
created, yet there would be weakneſſe and folly found
in them; becauſe to be abſolutely perfect and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,
is proper only to God the Creator. So that
it was impoſſible God ſhould make his creature equall
with himſelfe, to will all things that be good perfectly
and vnchangeably, and to do all things that ſuch a will
can deſire; for then he muſt be God, able to create,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8177:6"/>
which is impoſſible, becauſe there can be but one God,
which is the firſt beginner and Lord of all creatures.
This one God foreſeeing (I ſay) what would become
of the beſt creatures he could make; how though he
ſhould require nothing at their hands but that which
they might eaſily obſerue (and it was meet and very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
they ſhould acknowledge a dutie to him their
firſt beginner and Lord, in whoſe goodneſſe and power
their life and ſafetie did depend,) yet they would neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the ſame, and fall from him: he therefore of his
meere goodnes (hauing great reſpect vnto his creature
which he had reſolued to make; and being exceeding
willing, not for any thing he could foreſee in them, but
for his owne good pleaſure &amp; glorie ſake, to ſaue and
glorifie of the ſame,<note place="margin">Prou. 8. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</note> conſulting with himſelfe and with
his eternall Wiſedome which way and how he might
bring his deſire to paſſe) did determine, by election, in
and through the ſame his eternall Wiſedome, his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
and onely Sonne, which was before the depths
euer with him as his counſeller and hearts delight, to
ſuſtaine of the one ſort, I meane the Angels, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
of the other ſort, I meane mankind, ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
ſufficient companie of both,<note place="margin">Reuel. 5. 9.</note> as himſelfe pleaſed,
to be at his right hand, to behold his glorie, to miniſter
before him, &amp; to partake of his pleaſures for euermore.
And becauſe there was no way elſe, but by redemption
to ſaue mankind, by reaſon the firſt man being once
fallen, all the reſt then in his loines, who were to come
of him by generation, fell together with him; and that
there was not any one in heauen or in earth, that was
able to vndoe the workes of the diuell, and to deliuer
thoſe his elect from his ſeruitude and bondage, but
onely the ſame his eternall Wiſedom, the Word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he made the world; therefore as he had choſen them
in him, ſo did he decree to ſend him into the world,
and in a wonderfull maner to take mans nature and
fleſh on him, that therein he might accompliſh his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8177:6"/>
and bring his counſell and deſire to paſſe, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
his and their enemie, and purchaſing redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for them by his death and reſurrection. And as he
did determine before the world was,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 30.</note> to ſend him; ſo did
he predeſtinate them (whom he had choſen in him and
foreknew) to be conformed to his image, that he might
be the firſt borne among many brethren; the reſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
to leaue,<note place="margin">Prou. 1. 31.</note> and to reward them with the fruite of
their owne wayes.</p>
            <p>Thus God foreſaw all things, thus did he by his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
find out a way to ſuſtaine and reſtore of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
this was his decree, and in this ſort did he prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate.
God did not, neither is he euer ſaid in Scripture
to predeſtinate any to do euill, nor to preordaine any
to condemnation, but vpon the foreſight of their folly
and wickedneſſe, as the cauſe and ground thereof: and
ſo the ſaluation of man is freely and onely in God, in
Chriſt; and the condemnation of man is meerly and
truly of himſelfe, without any ſecret reſeruation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer:
as it is written,<note place="margin">Hoſea 13. 9.</note> 
               <hi>O Iſrael, deſtruction is of thy ſelfe,

            <head>Their ſecond point. <hi>That God did not elect before all time, to grace and life,
any particular perſons; but in time he doth elect qualities, as
faith and obedience, and then finding theſe qualities in men,
he doth elect their perſons for the qualities ſake.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Anſw.</p>
            <p>TO affirme that God did not elect in Chriſt, before
all time, ſome particular perſons to grace, holineſſe
&amp; life eternal, is to denie Gods free &amp; vndeſerued loue;
and to ſay, that God doth elect qualities, is ſenſleſſe; and
to teach, that God doth elect perſons for qualities ſake,
is very erroneous and Antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>We ſay therefore, that Gods election is after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
Firſt, before men or qualities of any ſort were, God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8177:7"/>
of his meere loue did elect and chuſe in Chriſt, out of
the whole poſteritie and race of mankind, which he
foreſaw, and were before him, as if they had actually
been, a ſeed, a remnant, to be his people, to be his heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
to be holy and without blame before him in loue,
as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth teſtifie,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and
Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed vs with all

               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>according as
he hath choſen vs in him before the foundation of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 9. 11, 12, 13.</note>
               <hi>that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in loue;
hauing predeſtinated vs vnto the adoption of children by Ieſus
Chriſt to himſelfe, according to the good pleaſure of his owne
will, to the praiſe of the glorie of his grace.</hi> Whence it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that God did chuſe a people to himſelfe, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the foundation of the world, not for qualities ſake,
which then were not, but for his owne good pleaſure
ſake, and to the end that they ſhould be in time quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with ſpirituall and heauenly gifts, holy affections,
blameleſſe life and holy conuerſation, euen as he did
predeſtinate them alſo before the world vnto the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of children by Ieſus Chriſt, which was to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
fulfilled in time, that ſo all might be to the praiſe
of the glorie of his grace.</p>
            <p>And for further proofe, that election is before quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of faith and obedience, and not of qualities, but of
perſons to be qualified; ſee what Chriſt himſelfe ſaith,
(foretelling of the great abhomination of deſolation, &amp;
dayes of the tribulation of Antichriſt, which ſhould
come into the world, whereby the truth ſhould be caſt
to the ground, and the Saints of the moſt High conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
<hi>But for the elects ſake thoſe dayes ſhall be ſhortned:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 24. 22.</note>
Meaning by the elect, not qualities, nor perſons quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but perſons to be qualified, not then being, nor
to be till many hundred yeares after, euen till theſe
our times, as experience hath proued. For thoſe dayes
of deſolation were not then begun, neither did that
Man of ſinne riſe vp till neare foure hundred yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8177:7"/>
and thoſe elect were to be in the dayes of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 27.</note>
when his dayes of deſolation ſhould begin
to grow ſhort, as the text ſheweth, which time is now
at laſt come into the world. And although his time of
deſolation hath been long, and that his dayes of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
are not yet fully ended, yet neuertheleſſe both it
and they, are now well waſted and ſhortned, according
to the word of the Lord, and his Goſpel ſhineth in ſtead
thereof, not only in other kingdomes and parts abroad,
but chiefly in this our Land, bleſſed be his name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
which had it not been, had Antichriſt with his
dayes of deſolation continued ſtill in the full ſtrength
and height they were,<note place="margin">Reu. 19. 11, 12, 13.</note> had not he that ſitteth on the
white horſe, whoſe name is called <hi>the Word of God,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his owne cauſe in hand,<note place="margin">2. Theſſal. 2. 8.</note> and with the ſpirit of his
mouth conſumed and cut ſhort (as he daily doth) thoſe
abhominable dayes of the Man of ſin, queſtionleſſe, no
fleſh ſhould now in theſe laſt times haue bin ſaued, but
all had bin ouerwhelmed with his deceit,<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<hi>And except thoſe dayes ſhould be ſhortned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 22.</note> 
               <hi>there ſhould no fleſh
be ſaued; but for the elects ſake thoſe dayes ſhall be ſhortned:</hi>
nay they are ſhortned,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> the light of the Goſpel ſhineth, &amp;
the elect are thereby daily called, ſanctified and ſaued.</p>
            <p>Hence it is euident, that election is before calling and
iuſtification (euen as predeſtination is,<note place="margin">Epheſ 1. 4.</note>) ſeeing God
doth count and call them his elect, ſo long before they
are in being; and that election is to thoſe bleſſed ends,
whereof the Goſpell is the onely meanes.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And for further confirmation of this point, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
declareth, that all the ſeed which God did couenant
with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 7.</note> to call in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſaying, <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy

choſen of God in Chriſt, and knowne of him, before
either Chriſt or one thouſand part of that ſeede were
borne; being onely promiſed of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a
ſeed and generation ſpirituall, not of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
ofſpring onely, but of the Gentiles alſo, and were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8177:8"/>
to be deriued in a ſpirituall maner of that one ſeed the
Meſſias promiſed, in which <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeued, though
he were not to come into the world for many hundred
yeares after; in reſpect whereof God ſaid vnto him, <hi>I
haue made thee a father of many nations.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</note> This ſeed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth <hi>the children of promiſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 8.</note> becauſe
they are all borne by promiſe,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 29. and 4. 28.</note> as was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> being of that
one ſeed which is Chriſt, and part of that ſmall remnant
which he had reſerued in him before the foundation of
the world, but for whoſe ſake we had not continued till
now, but had been made like Sodome long before this
day. And that this ſeed and children of <hi>Abraham</hi> were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
choſen of God in Chriſt before they were borne, Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> further proueth it by the words ſpoken to <hi>Rebecca</hi>

               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 10, 11.</note> ſaying, <hi>And not onely this, but when
Rebecca alſo was conceiued by one, euen by our father Iſaac;
for the children being not yet borne, nor hauing done good or

               <hi>and Eſaw haue I hated.</hi> By this word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
concerning <hi>Iacob,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> proueth more fully
(I ſay) that which in ſubſtance he had declared before
by the word of promiſe, as touching <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſeed which God did promiſe <hi>Abraham</hi> to
call in <hi>Iſaac;</hi> namely that the purpoſe of God according
to election,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 3.</note> his free loue in chuſing vs firſt in Chriſt, is
the true ground and principall cauſe of all ſpirituall
bleſſings in heauenly things, which in time we come
to enjoy in him. For doubtleſſe there was no cauſe in
<hi>Iacob</hi> more then in <hi>Eſaw,</hi> why God ſhould haue this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
vnto him more then to <hi>Eſaw;</hi> the ſeed of euill was
ſowne in him alſo,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12, 14, 18.</note> and their natures were both corrupt,
euen from their conception, yea from <hi>Adam,</hi> in whoſe
loines both they and their parents were when he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.
And as the tree or plant, which for want of

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8177:8"/>
whereby it nature may be ſhewen,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> yet (being in nature
euill) the ſubſtance and root of euill is therein,<note place="margin">ver. 7.</note> and ſo
as without a replantation and coniunction with ſome
tree or plant of better nature, it can bring forth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
but euill fruit: ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> as well as <hi>Eſaw,</hi> his nature
being alſo corrupt and euill,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 6.</note> had not God intercepted
him,<note place="margin">Iob 14. 4.</note> and (as he had choſen him before in Chriſt) ſo by
a new birth or replantation changed his nature, his
heart I meane, he would haue brought forth no other

his laſt houre, and ſo haue periſhed together. Thus

that if God doth call and ſanctifie ſome in ſuch a

            <p>To anſwer them,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> put the caſe that there were two
yong men, that hauing receiued at their parents hands
their portions, haue through riot and leudneſſe ſpent
all, and brought themſelues into ſo great pouertie and
debt, as that they haue no way or meanes whereby (poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly)
they can recouer and raiſe themſelues againe, but
are both like to liue in miſerie to their dying dayes: tell
me, haue they not been (themſelues) the authors of this
their owne ruine and decay? and is not this miſery iuſt
vpon? I ſuppoſe (as little grace as thou haſt) thou wilt
anſwer, Yea. But admit there were a man of great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
who ſhould out of his owne bountie, freely, and
of his owne accord deliuer one of theſe yong men out
of his miſerie, pay his debts, and reſtore him to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
eſtate againe; Is this rich man, by his free bountie
to the one, become now the cauſe of the others miſery?
doeſt thou dare to affirme it?<note place="margin">Mat, 20. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> Muſt thine eye needs now
be euil, becauſe he is bountiful? Is it not lawful for him
to beſtow his owne where and on whom he pleaſeth?
Or doeſt thou meane,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> that his not doing the like for
the other, is the cauſe of his continuall miſerie. To
anſwer thee,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> did hee not bring himſelfe into it? and
was it not of it ſelfe, continuall and iuſt by thine owne
confeſſion? How then may the thing that neuer was
done, be the cauſe of that which is in being? Can the
effect be before the cauſe? I haue heard that the cauſe
is before the effect, but I neuer heard that the effect is
or can be before the cauſe. But if I ſhould admit of
thine opinion, that all men haue free will in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
to chuſe, as they haue to refuſe grace offered; to
ſee what the iſſue thereof will be, let me aske thee, what
is the reaſon then, that but ſome men do chuſe grace? is
it becauſe they haue a better, and more inclinable will
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8177:10"/>
in them by nature then their fellowes? If there be no
ſpeciall gift of grace to moue them, it muſt be ſome
ſpeciall gift or qualitie of nature. For ſuch a ſpeciall
differing effect, muſt haue a ſpeciall differing cauſe. Or
wilt thou ſay, it is by the operation or ſecret motion of
ſome planet (as ſome heatheniſhly conceiue:) if ſo, yet
it is in ſome ſort naturall. The effects we ſpeake of, are
the baptiſme of repentance, &amp; the purification of faith,
called in Scripture, the baptiſme or birth of water and
of the holy Ghoſt, which are the parts of our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
now can any gifts or qualities of nature, or opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of planets, produce or cauſe ſuch effects as theſe?
Nay doubleſſe; for cauſes are always greater then effects;
and greater things then theſe, are not to be found in the
natures of men or planets, but in God, who by the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
power and vertue of his holy Spirit, doth cauſe
theſe great effects,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 5.</note> doth worke and produce this new
and heauenly birth;<note place="margin">Iam. 1, 17, 18.</note> and therefore the perſons thus
qualified, are ſaid in Scripture to be borne of God, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi>
3. 9. If thou ſaiſt, that God put this difference in the
will of man by creation; then thou makeſt God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and cauſe of ſinne, which thou wouldeſt ſeeme to
auoid, by excluding his ſpeciall gifts of the Spirit, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
as if it led thee to it; whereas it is but thy groſſe
apprehenſion that makes thee feare; and by this meanes
thou runneſt thy ſelfe out of breath, thou knoweſt not
whither. So then to conclude this point with Saint

as at the firſt they were not iuſtified from their ſinnes
by their owne act of beleeuing, though their act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
were neceſſary vnto their iuſtification; nor yet
by their works of righteouſnes which followed, though
they were alſo neceſſary for the proofe and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Chriſt, miniſtred vnto them by his word and Spirit,
which their act of faith onely (in their hearts) doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine:
ſo neither doe they ſtand, or are vpholden, by
their act of beleeuing, though it be neceſſary alſo, for
their continuall comfort, that they ſhould be euermore
exerciſed, as in the word and promiſe of God, ſo in the
act of beleeuing, going on ſtill from ſtrength to

where is all fulneſſe of ioy,<note place="margin">Pſal. 16. 11.</note> and at whoſe right hand
there are pleaſures for euermore, (as aſſuredly one day

though it be likewiſe neceſſary, that they ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
walking in, and working the works of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
but the ſtedfaſtneſſe and certaintie of their eſtates

on the ſtedfaſtneſſe, certaintie and vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
of Gods purpoſe, promiſe, loue, and on the
loue and life of Chriſt their head, which was once dead,
but is now aliue, and liueth ſtill for euermore. And ſo
ſure and certaine as God purpoſeth, and it cometh to
paſſe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 1.</note> as he promiſeth and faileth not, loueth once,
and loueth to the end; ſo ſure as Chriſt which loueth
them liueth, ſhall they abide in him, liue by him, and
not die for euer;<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 56, 57.</note> as it is written, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8177:12"/>

eateth me, euen he ſhall liue by me.</hi> For he is the bread of
life;<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 47.</note> and euery one that beleeueth in him, doth (in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
maner) eate of him, and ſo liueth by him, and ſhal
haue euerlaſting life. For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoneth, <hi>If
when we were enemies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>we were reconciled to God by the death
of his Sonne; much more being reconciled, ſhall we be ſaued by
his life.</hi> So that he that is once iuſtified by the blood of
Chriſt, and reconciled to God through faith in him, his
eſtate is certain and permanent: and though the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
ſhall depart, and the hils be moued, yet ſhall not
the kindneſſe and loue of God in Chriſt depart, nor the
couenant of peace towards them in him, be euer remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
from them, as the Prophet teſtifieth. Nay what ſhall
or can poſſibly ſeparate them from the loue of Chriſt,
or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue of God the Father towards them in him?
<hi>Shall tribulation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39.</note> 
               <hi>or diſtreſſe, or perſecution, or famine, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
or perill, or ſword? As it is written, For thy ſake are
we killed all the day long, and are counted as ſheepe for the
ſlaughter.</hi> Nay ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, In all theſe things we are
more then conquerours through him that loued vs. For I am
perſwaded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that neither death nor life, nor Angels,
nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to
come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be
able to ſeparate vs from the loue of God, which is in Chriſt
Ieſus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, as God did predeſtinate, call, iuſtifie and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
them; ſo it is he that keepeth &amp; defendeth them;
and the ſtedfaſtnes of their eſtates in him, doth depend
vpon the ſtedfaſtnes and immutabilitie of his purpoſe,
promiſe, loue, and on the loue and life of Chriſt; and
all is free, without any reſpect of will, faith, or works of
ours, in him and of him; to whom be all power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
praiſe and thankſgiuing for euer. Amen.</p>
            <p>But ſome will obiect and ſay, What then meaneth
the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> which ſo often ſpeake of falling away
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8177:12"/>
from righteouſneſſe, from faith; from Chriſt, from God;
as where it ſaith,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 24.</note> 
               <hi>But when the righteous man turneth away
from his righteouſnes, and committeth iniquitie, and dieth
in them; for the iniquities that he hath done, ſhall be die.</hi>
And againe it is ſaid, that <hi>he which taketh the plough by the
hand and looketh behind him, is not meete for the kingdome
of God.</hi> And againe, <hi>When a ſoule ſpirit is caſt out of a man,
and he walking in drie places, findeth no rest, but returneth
to the houſe from whence he came out; and finding it ſwept
and garniſhed, entreth therein with ſeuen more worſe then
himſelfe; and the end of that man ſhall be worſe then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>
And again, ſome are ſaid to beleeue for a time,
to be offended when tribulation cometh. And ſome
branches are ſaid to be taken away from the vine. Others
to withdraw themſelues, and to depart away from the
liuing God: to be made partakers of the holy Ghoſt,
and to taſte of the good word of God and of the powers
of the world to come, and to fall away, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
againe by repentance. That a man may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by the blood of the teſtament, and afterwards
tread vnder foote the Son of God, and count the ſame
blood as an vnholy thing, and deſpight the Spirit of
grace. Some to be cleane eſcaped from the filthineſſe
of the world, and after this to be entangled againe,
whoſe end alſo is worſe then the beginning, likened
vnto the dog that returneth to his owne vomit, and
to the ſow that is waſhed, and turneth to wallow in the

and a good conſcience; with diuers other ſayings to this
purpoſe. Alſo theſe doubtfull ſpeeches: <hi>He that endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

if ye continue. He that ouercometh and keepeth my words vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of the liuing. I will take away his part out of the booke of life,
and out of the holy Citie.</hi> Theſe Scriptures ſeeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
all that is ſaid before, and to proue that there is
no eſtate to be attained vnto, but may be fallen from,

loſt and vndone againe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Scriptures may ſeeme (with men not inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

whatſoeuer; but with ſuch as God hath been pleaſed

becauſe you will not admit (as it were too groſſe yee

neuertheleſſe, the truth is, that ye are deceiued, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this, but in the other of your points, being (moſt
of them) of the ſame nature, but all tending to the
wrong marke.</p>
            <p>It is true, theſe Scriptures do plainly ſhew, that men
may attaine to many excellent graces and gifts of the
holy Ghoſt; they may receiue the word with ioy, take
the plough by the hand, be enlightned, beleeue and
be baptized; they may be branches in the vine; they
may haue a foule ſpirit caſt out of them, and be ſwept
and garniſhed; they may taſte of the heauenly gift, and
be made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and taſte of the
good word of God, and of the powers of the world to
come; they may be in ſome reſpects ſanctified by the
blood of the teſtament, and be cleane eſcaped from the
pollutions of the world; they may haue a kind of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes,
and be in ſome ſort termed righteous men;
they may haue faith to caſt out diuels, and doe many
great works: all this they may attaine vnto, and yet
come ſhort of the chiefe things, fall away from all, loſe
all, and Chriſt may (notwithſtanding all theſe things)
iuſtly and truly ſay vnto them (in the day of account)

               <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquitie, I neuer knew ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is as true, that there be greater and more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
things then all theſe, which whoſoeuer can attain,
ſhall as certainly abide in Chriſt and be ſaued, as Chriſt
abideth in the Father and liueth. But the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
lieth in this, to diſtinguiſh theſe things rightly
aſunder, according to the meaning of the Scriptures,
that ſo their true difference being diſcerned of vs, we
may not only auoide the great confuſion, which the
want thereof hath cauſed in the mindes of many, and
the ſundry errors, they through their ignorance haue
fallen into, but may be brought to examine and proue
our ſelues by the rule thereof, whether our eſtates be
yet ſuch as will abide the triall in the day of account, or
no. If we find that they be, we haue then great cauſe of
comfort: if not, then haue we great reaſon to feare, and
with all ſpeed to humble our ſoules before God, and

            <p>Now that we may rightly vnderſtand theſe things,

vnder heauen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 10. 15.</note> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh: ſo that there is not,
nor hath been a nation or people,<note place="margin">Math, 28. 19.</note> in any time or part of
the world, that can truly ſay, we haue not heard it; for
(as it is written) <hi>their ſound went forth throughout all the

               <note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and their words vnto the ends of the world;</hi> and ſo all
are left without excuſe, becauſe God hath not left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
without witneſſe. But the maner and meaſure of
Gods declaration of his Goſpell, hath been diuers: he
declared it vnto the nations of the Gentiles in former
times, yea and at this preſent doth in diuers parts of
the world,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 18.</note> onely by the workes which he hath created,
and benefits that he daily giueth them,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> as the heauens
and firmament,<note place="margin">Act. 14. 16, 17.</note> day and night, Sunne and raine, and in
that he giueth them fruitfull ſeaſons, filling their hearts
with food and gladneſſe, with many other bleſſings; all
which do (in their maner and kind) preach and declare
vnto them, that God is good and gracious to mankind,
and hath ſome ſpeciall reſpect vnto him, and doe alſo
call vpon them daily to ſeeke him that made all, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
all thoſe good things vnto them, and proueth
vnto them,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 27.</note> that if they had ſought, they might haue
found, in him, yet greater things, which ſome of them
(doubles) haue attained vnto, &amp; the reſt by this means
are left without excuſe. He ſhewed it to the nation
of the Hebrewes, not onely by his works and benefits,
which they (eſpecially had in great abundance,) but
in another more excellent maner, and in a far greater
meaſure,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1. 2.</note> as namely by the teſtimonies of the Fathers,
and by the miniſterie of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 19. 10, 21.</note> who
receiued it from God, and ſpake as they were moued
by the holy Ghoſt;<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 1. 2.</note> he ſtretched forth his hand all the
day long vnto that people, preaching his Goſpell (the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8177:14"/>
word of faith vnto them; ſo as that they of all other, had
leaſt reaſon to ſay in their hearts, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into
heauen for vs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10, 7, 8, ver. 6.</note> 
               <hi>to fetch it vs? or who ſhall go downe into the
deepe to bring it vs, that we may heare it and doe it? but the
word was nigh enough vnto them, euen in their mouthes and
in their hearts, </hi> and if the Gentiles were left without
excuſe, much more they.</p>
            <p>And now he hath ſpoken and declared it vnto vs in
theſe laſt times by his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb 1. 2.</note> that Seed
which was promiſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 14.</note> foretold by the Prophets, in whom, by
whom, and through whom, all bleſſings, all hope, all
grace, and life is granted, is purchaſed, is to be attained,
by him (I ſay) and by his holy Apoſtles, in the power
and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, he hath declared vnto vs
all things cleerly, many whereof being ſuch as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
former ages were not knowne: ſo that the earth
floweth with the knowledge of the Goſpell in theſe
dayes, aboue all thoſe other times paſt, and many haue
been enlightned through the preaching of it, by the
Spirit, and haue beleeued and giuen their aſſents vnto
the truth of it; many haue taſted of the heauenly gift,
and haue been made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, haue
taſted of the good word of God, and of the powers of
the world to come; many are able to preach and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
thereof in great and excellent meaſure; and if
the Hebrewes could at no time (truly ſay, we haue not
heard it) nor yet thoſe Gentiles that had not the Law,
to wit, thoſe Scriptures and ordinances of the Law,
which the Hebrewes had: what can we then ſay, who
haue not only had all the meanes and light which thoſe
Gentiles &amp; Hebrews had, but alſo the plaine reuelation
of the Goſpell, according as it was foretold to be in
theſe laſt times, confirmed by the death &amp; reſurrection
of Ieſus Chriſt, and left recorded vnto vs by his holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
in full meaſure; how can it be (I ſay) therefore,
but that the things which we haue heard and beleeued,
will be vnto vs the ſauour of death vnto death in a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8177:15"/>
and larger meaſure, then vnto any of them, ſeeing
we haue receiued a greater &amp; larger meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
if we obey not the Goſpell, if we attaine not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſpeciall grace and benefits thereof: for as the
Lord himſelfe teſtifieth, <hi>He that knoweth his maſters will,
and doth it not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 12. 47.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome will ſay, we haue not onely knowledge of
his will, but obedience alſo, we are not like vnto thoſe
ſtrange fornicators and idolaters of the Gentiles, nor
as the cruell, vnbeleeuing Hebrewes, which killed the
Prophets, and murdered the Lord of glorie; neither are
we of the common ſinners of the world, though we
haue been ſo heretofore; nay the power of the holy
Ghoſt, by the preaching of the word of God, hath alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vs, the foule ſpirit is now caſt out by a ſtronger
then he, we are now cleane eſcaped from the filthineſſe
of the world, our liues and actions are reformed, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our ſelues now to the hearing of the word, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
thereof, and reade it oft, we pray alſo oft, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Sacraments oft, we inſtruct our children and
our ſeruants in the principles of Chriſtian religion, we
keep the Sabbath, we diſtribute of our goods to the
poore, we neglect no dutie which we conceiue we
ought to performe; ſo that we are waſhed and ſanctified
by the blood of the teſtament.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, thou haſt here a kind of obedience, and
doeſt (in part) thy maſters will, and art ſo far forth ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
by the blood of the teſtament, for by it, all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and gifts of the Spirit are purchaſed, and thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
neuer haue attained to theſe things but by vertue
of it; yet I ſay, notwithſtanding all this, the chiefe thing
may be wanting in thee; for if this be to do thy maſters
will, according to our Sauiours meaning, then (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe)
the Scribes and Phariſes did his will as wel as thee;
they made cleane the outſide of the cup and platter,
they had ſuch a kind of beliefe,<note place="margin">Math. 23. 24, 24 25, 26, 27, 28.</note> and were as ſtrict in all
outward obſeruations as all this, and yet their inſides
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8177:15"/>
were foule, their hearts were full of rancor and malice;
and ſo may it be with thee for all this. Here is a faire
blade indeede, but where is the fruit? Doeſt thou not
know that except thy righteouſnes exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
of the Scribes and Phariſes,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note> thou ſhalt in no
wiſe enter into the kingdome of God? <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>Iohn</hi>
gladly, and did many things willingly; and <hi>Iudas</hi> no
doubt was faire in the leafe, but his heart was euer cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
as the Euangeliſt teſtifieth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 6.</note> ſaying, <hi>This he ſpake,
not that he had care of the poore, but that he was couetous,
and carried the bag.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 43.</note> How thinkeſt thou, can an euill tree
bring forth good fruit?<note place="margin">Iam. 3. 11. 12.</note> or can one and the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
bring forth ſweet waters, and bitter? Or can a
ſtincking polluted fountaine, bring forth ſweet waters?
The heart of man is the tree or fountaine, from whence
either good or euill commeth, as Chriſt himſelfe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth;
<hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of the heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 44.</note>
               <hi>bringeth forth that which is good; and an euill man out of the

               <note place="margin">ver. 45.</note> 
               <hi>bringeth forth that which is euill.</hi>
If thy heart be euill and vncleane, how canſt thou then
bring forth from thence any good fruit?<note place="margin">Acts. 8, 13.</note> Grant thou art
ſanctified outwardly,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 66.</note> thou haſt belieued and art bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
thou heareſt the word with ioy,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 20.</note> thou art all as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is ſpoken, yet if in heart thou beeſt hard and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant,
proud, puft vp, couetous, vnmercifull, one
that loueſt thy ſelfe and this preſent euill world, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to others, cruell, what will all thy beliefe and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
auaile thee? Nay, admit thou hadſt all faith,
ſo as thou couldeſt moue mountaines, and that thou
ſhouldſt giue all thy goods to the poore, and thy bodie
to be burned, and that no man could tax thy heart by
any euill fruit that yet appeared, nor thy ſelfe perceiue
thine owne heart to be euill;<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 8.</note> yet if thou haſt not that
faith which worketh by loue,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> that loue with her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
properties, which the Apoſtle deſcribeth, ſaying,
<hi>Loue ſuffereth long,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7.</note>

it ſeeketh not her own, it is not eaſily prouoked, it thinketh none
euill, it reioyceth not in iniquite, but it reioyceth in the truth;
It beareth all things, it belieueth all things, it hopeth all things,
it endureth all things.</hi> I ſay if thou haſt not that faith
which bringeth forth theſe effects, thou art nothing,
thou art but as a ſounding braſſe, and as a tinckling
Cimball, notwithſtanding all thy gifts of knowledge,
faith, propheſie, righteouſnes, or whatſoeuer, and ſhalt
be found to be, but either as the high waies ſide, or as
the ſtony ground,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 4. 5. 6. 7.</note> or thornie ground mentioned in the
Goſpell, which indured not, which neuer came to bring
forth goodfruit, neither in the greateſt, nor leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
(like vnto the good ground deſcribed after,<note place="margin">ver 8.</note>) and
thy end will be like that earth, which notwithſtanding
the raine commeth oft vpon it, bringeth forth nothing
but thornes and briars, and is therefore neere vnto cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
and as the tree,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 8.</note> which though it haue had much
dreſſing,<note place="margin">Mark. 11. 13. 14.</note> yet becauſe it bringeth not forth goodfruit,
is hewen downe and caſt into the fire. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what neede there is, that we ſhould dilligently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into theſe things, and ſee the difference betweene
theſe two eſtates, and that our care and ſtudy, might, and
dayly ſhould be to learne the beſt.</p>
            <p>Now touching the ſpeciall adminiſtration of the
Goſpell, and thoſe gifts of the Spirit, which are perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to afew, euen Gods elect onely.</p>
            <p>The ſpeciall adminiſtration of the Goſpell is this,<note place="margin">Luk. 4. 18.</note>
namely a particular application,<note place="margin">Act. 10. 36. 37. &amp; Act. 26. 18.</note> or preaching the word
of promiſe,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 11.</note> the glad tidings of peace, the forgiueneſſe
of ſins to the ſoule of a ſinner,<note place="margin">Eſa. 40. 20.</note> whereby he is truly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
of the grace &amp; loue of God in Ieſus Chriſt through
faith in him, and of the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes; And
this is neuer done but by a ſpeciall gift and power of
the holy Ghoſt. Now the courſe which God doth take
to effect and bring this thing to paſſe, is this; when and
after ſuch time, as God by the generall adminiſtration of
his Goſpell, hath made knowne, and by a common gift
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8177:16"/>
of the Spirit, hath cauſed them to beleeue, and aſſent
vnto, the ſumme, or neceſſary parts thereof, as namely,
that repentance and remiſſion of ſins is granted to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and ſaluation to all that can attaine thereto: then
doth he by a ſpecial &amp; more effectuall gift of the Spirit,
work vpon the hearts of his elect, whom he fore knew,
and had predeſtinate, calling them to repentance (that
is to ſay) turning them from all their ſinnes, and from
the wayes of all the fleſhly, and ſinfull pleaſures, wherein
their ſoules had formerly delighted, into a great feare
&amp; ſorrow for the ſame, and with many teares to lament
the time that euer they tooke pleaſure therein; and
falling downe before him, with humble and contrite
hearts, confeſſe their ſins vnto him, deſiring in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
maner, mercy and forgiueneſſe at his hands,
peace, loue, and reconciliation with him; which till
they obtaine, they can take no reſt, they haue no ioy,
they cannot be ſatiſfied, none of all their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
will afford them now any comfort; they ſtand
aloofe looking ſtrangely vpon them, like friends in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie,
finding them now no fit companions for them;
Nay, there is not any thing, that will, or can relieue
their poore diſtreſſed ſoules,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 21. 22.</note> or giue them their deſired
content,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> but onely the loue of God in Ieſus Chriſt, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in their hearts by his holy Spirit of promiſe. Theſe
are thoſe poore which the Scriptures ſpeake of, vnto
whom Chriſt was ſent to preach good tidings, the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and broken in heart,<note place="margin">Math. 11. 28.</note> them that labour ſore, and are
heauie laden, the ſicke, the loſt, the dead, which Chriſt
came to binde vp, to heale, to ſeeke out, to quicken
and raiſe to life; theſe I ſay, and none but theſe, are
they whom the Prophet ſpeaketh of, teſtifying of the
Sauiour, and of the ſpeciall adminiſtration of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of peace: ſaying,<note place="margin">Eſa. 61. 1. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is vpon me,
and he hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the poore,
he hath ſent me to binde vp the broken hearted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 4. 18. 19.</note> 
               <hi>to proclaime
liberty to the captiues, and the opening of the priſon to them
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8177:17"/>
that are bound, to proclaime the acceptable yeare of the Lord,
and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that
mourne, to appoint vnto them that mourne in Sion, to giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, beauty for aſhes, the oyle of ioy for mourning, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of praiſe for the ſpirit of heauineſſe, that they might be
called, Trees of righteouſnes, the plantation of the Lord, that
he may be glorifiea.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 22.</note> And theſe are the poore, of whom
Chriſt himſelfe ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 5.</note> ſaying, <hi>And the poore haue the
Goſpell preached vnto them;</hi> or <hi>receiue the Goſpell,</hi> as ſome
tranſlations haue it; for the word doth import ſuch a
preaching, as doth imply a receiuing of it, in the heart
of him to whom it is ſo preached, as alſo doth the words
of <hi>Eſay</hi> before mentioned. And although all haue it
preached vnto them in the former generall maner,
yet none haue it preached vnto them in this ſpeciall
peculiar ſort, but theſe poore repentant perſons onely,
who alone are capable of the receit thereof, by faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Iuſtification; (&amp; this is that effect of the holy Ghoſt
in the heart of man,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 26.</note>) which the Scriptures call, <hi>The bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
of Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the baptiſme of water, the baptiſme of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
the birth of water,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh 3. 5.</note> 
               <hi>the baptiſme which Iohn preached,
the preparation of the Goſpell of peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 15.</note> 
               <hi>repentance;</hi> which is,
the beginning of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 1.</note> the firſt
principall of the doctrine of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 5.</note> the beginning and
firſt part of regeneration, as the Scripture declareth it;
the labour and trauell in the birth, but not the full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the new birth,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> onely the ſoule of the ſinner
trauelleth readie to be deliuered; this is the ſecond
effect of the holy Ghoſt, but the firſt peculiar. Then
doth God in the third place, reach forth his hand, and
taketh hold of this poore labouring ſoule, and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpeciall effect, and power of the holy Ghoſt, doth
deliuer him, and bring him forth, waſheth him &amp; clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him from his bloud, wherein he lay polluted, his
ſinnes which cried out ſo iuſtly againſt him, and lay ſo
heauy vpon him, eaſeth him of all, and writeth in his
heart of fleſh,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 3.</note> his contrite repentant heart, his couenant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8177:17"/>
of mercie and loue, which it ſo much deſired, aſſuring
it,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 34.</note> that he is now reconciled with him, and that his ſins
are cleane forgiuen and forgotten,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 17.</note> neuer to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or remembred more;<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 38, 39. 40.</note> and that he hath loued him,
and doth loue him in Ieſus Chriſt, and will neuer put
him out of fauour, ſo long as Chriſt remains in fauour.</p>
            <p>This is the ſpecial adminiſtration of the word, and that
gift of the Spirit, whereby Chriſt is formed in the heart
of the poore repentant ſinner through faith, by which
he is iuſtified from all his ſinnes, and his heart ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and is the ſecond part and finiſhing of the new
birth; and theſe are alwayes together in the act of iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<hi>the word, the Spirit, and faith;</hi> ſo that a ſinner
cannot be ſaid to be actually iuſtified, till the couenant
of remiſſion of ſinnes, which God hath made to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant
ſinner, be applied by the Spirit to his broken
heart, and that he beleeueth in his heart that his ſinnes
be forgiuen, and that God loueth him in Ieſus Chriſt:
and this adminiſtation of the word, gift of the Spirit
and faith, are expreſſed in Scripture, and diſtinguiſhed
from all other adminiſtrations, of the word, gifts of the
Spirit, and kinds of faith whatſoeuer, by ſeuerall diſtinct
names.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As firſt, this adminiſtration of the word is called in
Scripture,</hi> The glad tidings of peace and good things, good
tidings, the binding vp of the broken heart, libertie to the
captiues, The opening of the priſon to them that are bound,
Comfort to the mourners, The reuiuing of the ſpirits of the
humble and contrite, The couenant of the remiſſion of ſinnes,
The couenant of life and peace, The kingdome of God; Eaſe,
Reſt to the ſoule. The word of his grace, The word preaching
peace by Ieſus Chriſt, The word of reconciliation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And it is ſo called in regard of the great and ſpeciall
benefit it bringeth, &amp; doth adminiſter vnto the ſoule of
the repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tant ſinner, by the applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Spirit. And
for that it is directed of God, and appointed to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to ſuch, and to no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> For though the Goſpell
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8177:18"/>
be preached to all, in a generall conſideration (as before
is ſhewed,) yet (as it is here intended) it belongeth to
none, nor is to be preached to any but the repentant
only. And repentance, though it be a part of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
as it is ſometimes in a generall maner propoſed, yea
the beginning and firſt principle thereof, and a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
gift of the Spirit, as before alſo is noted; yet (as it is
intended in theſe ſeuerall Scriptures) repentance is no
part, but onely the preparation thereunto, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ready the heart of a ſinner for the ſame; in which
conſideration, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and our Sauiour both
preached,<note place="margin">Math. 3. 2.</note> ſaying, <hi>Repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand:</hi>
where they make repentance to be one thing,<note place="margin">Math. 4. 17.</note> and the
kingdome of God (the glad tidings of the Goſpel) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
&amp; require repentance in the firſt place, as a thing
neceſſary to be effected in them, before they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
by faith the glad tidings of the Goſpell, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, which was at hand to follow after, and to
be preached vnto them thereupon. Which order was
alſo obſerued by the Prophets before; as <hi>Dauid, To day</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>if you will heare his voice, harden not your hearts,
&amp;c. leſt ye enter not into his reſt.</hi> In which words he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
plainly to the people, that if they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the promiſe of entrance into reſt, and ſo by faith
enter thereinto, they ſhould vnharden their hearts, that
is to ſay repent, otherwiſe there was no poſſibilitie of
beleeuing, of entrance.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, as the ſpeciall adminiſtration of the
word, which is ſo peculiar to the repentant, is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from all other common adminiſtrations; ſo is

doe ſeuer it from all outward appearances and ſhewes
which come neare vnto it, hauing the forme thereof,

bring foorth fruite meete for him their Lord, the
good husband-man, that hath planted &amp; dreſſed them.
Firſt, as they haue receiued mercie at the hands of God
by faith, and are aſſuredly perſwaded in their hearts of
the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes: ſo doe they now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly

when at any time they do but think thereon;

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that they are waſhed and redeemed with a great
price, euen with the blood of the Lamb of God, that
they ſhould now be holy, as their heauenly Father is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that hath choſen them. And though they finde the
law of their members to rebel and fight againſt the law
of their minds,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23.</note> enticing them night &amp; day, with ſtrong
motions and perſwaſions to regard and giue entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againe to their former luſts and pleaſures, yet they
remembring the day of their feare and great diſtreſſe,
ſigh and weepe in ſoule, to thinke that they ſhould yet
be conſtrained by the force of their owne fleſh &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
thereof to caſt but an eye, or once to thinke vpon
that which now their ſoules do loathe, and from which
they haue been ſo graciouſly deliuered. And therefore
remembring <hi>Lots</hi> wife, and the end of thoſe that hauing
taken the plough by the hand, looke behind them, by
whoſe examples their Lord hath forwarned them, dare
not preſume to turne aſide, and grieue the holy Spirit,
whereby they are ſealed vnto the day of redemption:
but if they ſhould (through the ſtrength of temptation
and their owne weakneſſe) fall, they go foorth and
weep bitterly, till they be reſtored by faith to ſtrength
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8177:19"/>
againe; and neuer fall or looke behind them ſo, as to
giue entertainment in ſoule, to their old delights of ſin
againe, or to embrace this preſent world, or pleaſures
thereof as aforetime: nay, though they be hated, reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and ſcorned of all men, and made a gazing ſtocke
both to men and Angells, yet ſtill they go on their way
out of the camp following their Lord, and willingly
bearing his reproach, counting his rebukes, greater
riches then all the pleaſures of the Egypt of this world,
which is now crucified to them, and they to it. And ſo
in patience poſſeſſe they their ſoules, hauing an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
hope, that though now they goe on their way
weeping, ſowing precious ſeed, yet there will come a
day wherein they ſhall returne with ioy,<note place="margin">Pſal. 126. 5. 6,</note> reape the fruit
of their labours, and bring their ſheaues with them.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 24.</note> as they doe hate ſin and mortifie the fleſh
with the affections and luſts thereof, and crucifie vnto
themſelues this preſent world and themſelues vnto it;
ſo doe they now, on the contrary part, loue God with
all their heart,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 19.</note> and with all their ſoule, and delight in
him and in his wayes:<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13. 14.</note> and this their loue vnto him is
cauſed by that loue wherewith he firſt loued them,
which he hath ſhed forth and ſealed in their hearts by
his holy Spirit, and wherEof they are now aſſuredlie
perſwaded,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4. 19.</note> as it is written, <hi>Wee loue him, becauſe he loued
vs firſt.</hi> And as to be beloued of God, is a bleſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all compariſon, a treaſure not to be vttered, ſo
their loue to him is a fruit, which no man is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the nature of, but they alone in whoſe hearts his
loue is firſt ſhed forth, and they certainly perſwaded
thereof.</p>
            <p>And as they loue God the Father, ſo doe they loue
Chriſt his Sonne, who hath redeemed them from the
thraldome of their ſinnes; and their loue to him is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
cauſed, by his loue which was firſt made knowne
to them,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8. 9. 10.</note> and is expreſt in this, that while they
were his enemies, he died for them, that they ſhould be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8177:20"/>
reconciled to God his Father,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 15.</note> and be made the Sonnes
of God by adoption in him. And greater loue then this
hath no man, that one ſhould die for his enemies (and
ſpecially ſuch a one) to bring them to ſo great
honour, therefore their loue to him is alſo vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>And as they loue God the Father, and Chriſt the
Redeemer, ſo loue they the children of God who are
borne of him, and made partakers with them of his
grace and loue in Chriſt; As it is written, <hi>He that loueth
him that begetteth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5. 1.</note> 
               <hi>loueth him alſo that is begotten of him.</hi>
And this their loue vnto the children of God, as it is not
now for naturall reſpects, though in that regard they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
loue them, but becauſe they are in grace and loue
with God, and do belong to Chriſt, whom they ſerue
and belong vnto: So their loue vnto them is heauenly
and ſpirituall, and ſuch as no man hath, nor can attaine
vnto,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 5,</note> vnleſſe he be borne from aboue of water and the
Spirit, as they are. For the children of this world who
are borne but of fleſh, as they know not the children of
God (that are borne &amp; begotten of him) becauſe they
know not him that hath begotten them, nor Chriſt
whom they ſerue and follow: ſo neither doe, nor can
they loue them for his ſake, nor haue part and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with them in their ſpirituall and heauenly commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
They pray together as children of one Father the
Lord of hoſts, and praiſe his name with one accord;
they ſuffer together as members of one bodie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 26. 27</note> euen
that body whereof Chriſt is the head;<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 15. 16.</note> they weepe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and they reioyce together, and are of like affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
one towards another; and if any of them haue
this worlds goods,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 9.</note> (called in Scripture the vnrighteous
Mammon, becauſe of the vnrighteous vſe which the
louers thereof doe applie them to,) they (according to
the commandement of their Lord, like vnto the vniuſt
Steward) make them friends therewith. If Chriſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
they feed him; If he thirſt, they giue him to drink;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8177:20"/>
If he be naked, they cloth him; If he be ſicke or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
they viſit him. And though he himſelfe be now
in heauen, &amp; they cannot do it to him, neither needeth
he as touching his owne perſon, yet in ſo much as they
do it to his brethren the children of God, they doe it to
him, and he and his Father both, will be their friends in
time of neede, and will receiue them into euerlaſting
habitation. Yea though they haue not the plentie of
this worlds goods, but ſhall out of their pennury caſt
into this his treaſurie, the leaſt mite, or ſhall giue to eate,
to any of the ſeruants of God, and bretheren of Chriſt,
out of their ſcarſitie, the leaſt portion of bread or oyle, or
but a cup of cold water to drinke, becauſe they belong
to Chriſt, they ſhall not loſe their reward, but in the
day when he ſhall come in his glory, and all his holy
Angells with him. And when he ſhall ſit in the Throne
of his glory, and that all, of all nations ſhalbe gathered
before him &amp; called to accompt, he will ſay vnto them,
<hi>Come yee bleſſed of my Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 34. 35 36.</note> 
               <hi>inherit the kingdome prepared
for you, from the foundation of the world; for I was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and yee fed me; I was a thriſt, and ye gaue me drinke; I
was naked, &amp; ye clothed me, &amp;c.</hi> And whereas on the other
ſide, he will ſay vnto all that haue not done any of theſe
things for his ſake.<note place="margin">ver. 41.</note> 
               <hi>Go ye curſed into euerlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Diuell and his Angells; for I was a hungry, and
ye gaue me no meate; I was a thirſt and ye gaue me no drinke;
I was naked, and ye clothed me not, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the loue that is ſhowed to the children of God,
the bretheren of Chriſt, becauſe they belong to him.
Of all the fruits and workes of righteouſnes, that can be
performed by man, to man, is of greateſt eſteeme with
God, and hath the promiſe of reward aboue them all,
not by reaſon of any worthines of deſert, that is therein,
but onely for his promiſe ſake, and becauſe it pleaſeth
him for his Sonne Chriſts ſake, ſo to accept of it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it. And therefore for this eſpecially ſhall all men
be called to accompt in the day of iudgement, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8177:21"/>
iudged according as they haue done, or haue not done
the ſame. And becauſe it is the chiefeſt fruit, whereby
the inward eſtate of the children of God is knowne and
diſcerned from the children of this world, in whom it is
not, but the contrary euills. Therefore doth the Lord
put vs in minde thereof afore hand, becauſe we ſhould
now in our life times before that day commeth, learne
to know the Lord, that we may alſo know the children
of God,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 14. 5. 2.</note> and loue them. <hi>Hereby we know that we are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
from Death to life, becauſe we loue the brethren. And
hereby we know that we loue the children of God, when we
loue God and keepe his Commaundements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſt of all this fruit of faith doth extend it ſelfe to
euery man elſe whatſoeuer, (onely ſuch excepted) as
doe hate God, and haue blaſphemed the holy Ghoſt,
whoſe ſinne ſhall neuer be forgiuen them, neither in
this world, nor in the world to come, who may not be
prayed for, but are to be held as execrable vnto the day
of the Lord. They loue (I ſay) all men as brethren, yea
euen their enemies, and knowing that they are both,
(as touching nature) deſcended of one ſtocke, and that
they themſelues were once far off, and ſtrangers from
the Common-wealth of Iſraell aſwell as they, and alſo
that God doth as freely inuite them, and call vpon them
to repent and belieue his Goſpell as he did them. And
becauſe no man can tell when, or to whom God will
giue repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes, therefore they
loue them as brethren, and do exhort and beſeech them
dayly that they would repent and turne vnto God, and
humbly confeſſe their ſinnes vnto him, and earneſtly
ſeeke and deſire grace &amp; mercie at his hands, declaring
vnto them what great things he hath done for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of man, and what grace and loue (they for
their parts) haue already found, who were by ſin as far
ſpent as they. Though they hate theſe, yet do they loue
them, and pray vnto God for them with many teares.
If they hunger fhey feed them, If they thirſt they giue
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8177:21"/>
them to drinke,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 20.</note> If they want clothing, or harbor, or be
in any other kind of diſtreſſe, they (according to that
portion God hath giuen them,) miniſter vnto them. If
they curſe them, yet they bleſſe them, If they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
and kill them,<note place="margin">ver. 14.</note> yet ſtill they loue them, and make
requeſt to God for them,<note place="margin">Act 7. 60.</note> that he would not lay their
ſinne to their charge,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 48.</note> but forgiue them. This is the
perfection which the Scriptures ſpeake of,<note place="margin">Ioh 7. 34. 35.</note> the new
commandement,<note place="margin">Reu. 7. 14.</note> the garment waſht white in the bloud
of the Lambe,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note> the righteouſnes of Saints, euen that
righteouſnes which exceedeth the righteouſnes of the

of all phariſaicall vnregenerate chriſtians, who
for a like kind of ſtricknes, in ſome ſuch outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations,
would faine be counted holy, though their
hearts were neuer ſanctified: This fruit, I ſay, doth far
ſurmount their blade alſo: This is the firſt reſurrection,
which the Spirit mentioneth,<note place="margin">Reu. 20. 6.</note> ſaying, <hi>Beſſed and holy is
he which hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, on ſuch the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
death ſhall haue no power.</hi> Theſe are they that be riſen
with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Col. 3 12.</note> and ſeeke thoſe things that are aboue
where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God, to whom
old things are paſt away,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 17.</note> and all things are become new,
theſe are not of the world,<note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 16.</note> neither doe they loue the
world, nor the things of the world,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 15.</note> but the loue of God
the Father is in their hearts,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> and the loue of Chriſt, their
conuerſation is in heauen, and they minde heauenly
things: the Lord their God is now their portion, he is
their refuge in all times of neede, in all their diſtreſſes
they flie to him for ſuccour, and from his hands onely
do they expect reliefe; therefore to him onely do they
pray as to their God and Father, on his name they call,
and on no other, earely in the morning, and late in the
euening with broaken and contrite hearts, (the ſacrifice
which he neuer did deſpiſe) come they before him, and
humbling themſelues, their ſoules and bodies at his
ſooteſtoole, confeſſe vnto him their great weaknes, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8177:22"/>
vnworthines, and knowing they haue no other God or
Father, in whom they may put their truſt, but him
alone: Therefore in ſure conſideration of his grace and
loue, being confounded in themſelues and aſhamed, as
touching their owne will and workes, and giuing all
praiſe and honour vnto his holy name, they do beſeech
him, (though they be not worthy the leaſt of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)
that he would be pleaſed (notwithſtanding) to
extend his grace and loue vnto them, and poure forth
his holy Spirit, the ruler and gouernour of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
here on earth, into their hearts, to comfort, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie,
and guide them in his truh, that being guided
and ſanctified thereby, they may euermore doe his will,
obey his commandements, and walke before him here
on earth, euen as his holy Angells and ſeruants doe in
heauen. And acknowledging his goodnes towards
them, his prouidence, and care, in feeding and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, and giuing them all other things which the
neceſſities of this their preſent life requires; do requeſt
him alſo, that he would dayly ſupply and continue the
ſame, with his continuall bleſſing thereon, receiuing
them alwayes with thankſgiuing, knowing that they
are all ſanctified by his word and prayer. And calling to
mind their manifold ſinnes and treſpaſſes, which they
in their fleſh and bodies of death doe dayly commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, poure out their ſoules in teares before him,
bewailing their wretchednes and miſſerie herein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
him for his Son Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, through
whom they haue now great confidence of his grace,
that he would not lay their ſinnes to their charge, but
forgiue them, hauing alſo a true teſtimonie in
their conſciences (which they likewiſe cleere before
him) that they are at peace with all men, and doe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
euen their enemies; and ſo withall doe earneſtly
intreate him, that he would vouchſafe them his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Fatherly perfection to ſuſtaine and keep them,
that no temptation may at any time preuaile againſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8177:22"/>
them, to leade, or any way to induce them to commit
euill in his ſight, but that they may by the power of his
grace and holy Spirit withſtand the ſame. And ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
their truſt and whole affiance in him, they reſt
in peace, knowing alſo, and acknowledging that the
kingdome and the power, and the glory is his for euer
and euer <hi>Amen.</hi> Thus theſe iuſt and ſanctified ſeruants
of God, goe one from ſtrength to ſtrength, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſpeaketh, and from faith to faith, neuer giuing
ouer, nor turning backe, nor falling away from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God, like thoſe that haue an euill heart and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull,
but ſtill ſtep forward, drawing neerer and
neerer vnto God, with a true and good heart in the full
aſſurance of faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> vntill they come to ſee his face in the
promiſed Ieruſalem. For the iuſt doe liue by faith, as it
is written,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 37. 38. 39.</note> 
               <hi>For yet a little while, and he that ſhall come will
come, and will not tarry. Now the iuſt ſhall liue by faith: But
if any draw backe, my Soule ſhall haue no pleaſure in them.
But</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>we are not of them, that draw backe
to perdition, but of them that follow faith, vnto the ſauing of

&amp; doth diſtinguiſh between them, whoſe hearts being
euill, and vnfaithfull, do turne backe to perdition, and
them whoſe hearts are true and iuſt, and who hauing
the full aſſurance of faith, doe perſeuere and continue
vnto the ſaluation of their ſoules. As if he ſhould haue
ſaid: There be ſome indeed (whoſe hearts were neuer
ſanctified by the faith of Gods elect, the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
But onely by a generall kind of faith, their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

which fall backe to deſtruction; (<hi>but we</hi>) meaning
himſelfe, and ſuch ſanctified ſoules with him, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
was, we are not of that ſort, but of another, euen
of them which doe beleeue after another maner, who
haue the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the faith of Gods elect, the
effectuall faith, the faith of Chriſt, the faith that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by loue, the faith which maketh a ſinner iuſt, the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8177:23"/>
faith by which the iuſt doe liue, and are ſaued. Which
very thing Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> alſo cleereth, ſpeaking of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts,
that were gone out from them. <hi>They went out
from vs</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but they were not of vs;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 19.</note> 
               <hi>If they had bin
of vs, they would no doubt, haue continued with vs; But
they went out from vs, that it might be made manifeſt, that
they were not all of vs.</hi> In which words he proueth plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if they had euer beene of the faithfull ſort,
(namely the ſanctified in heart) whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> was one,
they had neuer fallen back, but had (without all doubt)
continued, but by this their falling off, it was made
manifeſt (which was not ſo cleere before) that they
were neuer of them, what outward ſhewes ſoeuer they
made. The very ſame (againe) is manifeſt concerning
<hi>Iudas;</hi> for after he had plaid his treacherous part, that
he was diſcouered and burſt in peeces, the Spirit of God
taking notice of his former pretended charitie to the
poore, which he vttered in theſe words. <hi>Why was not
this oyntment ſold for three hundred pence,</hi>

               <note place="margin">ver. 6.</note> 
               <hi>not that he cared for
the poore, but becauſe he was a theefe, and had the bag, and
bare what was put therein.</hi> So that <hi>Iudas</hi> was neuer any of
the faithfull, his heart was neuer vpright from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
he belieued not in his heart vnto Iuſtification,
he had not the faith of the Saints, the faith that worketh
by loue, the faith of Chriſt, as Chriſt himſelfe teſtifieth
againſt him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.</note> ſaying, <hi>But there are ſome of you which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieueth
not,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> was one of them, and the ſpeciall
man aimed at, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the next wordes noteth,
ſaying,<note place="margin">ver. 64.</note> 
               <hi>For Ieſus knew from the beginning, who they were
that belieued not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 65.</note> 
               <hi>and who ſhould betray him. And Ieſus ſaid
vnto them, therefore ſaid I vnto you, that no man can come
vnto me, except it be giuen him of my Father.</hi> Meaning by
comming vnto him, belieuing in him vnto iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

               <note place="margin">ver. 66.</note> Therefore the text ſaith. <hi>From that time many
of his Diſciples went backe, and walked no more with him.</hi>
And <hi>Iudas</hi> though he taried after them (yet a while) it
was but to make vp the full meaſure of his ſinnes; For
his heart was then as euill, if not worſe then theirs, as
Chriſt teſtifieth to his face, in the preſence and hearing
of the other Apoſtles, ſaying,<note place="margin">ver. 70.</note> 
               <hi>Haue I not choſen you

and though he be here ſaid among the reſt to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
it is to be vnderſtood but of his outward office, and
in reſpect of the common guifts of the Spirit which he
had receiued.</p>
            <p>And although this was the caſe of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and of his
fellow diſciples, who could not reliſh the words of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life,<note place="margin">ver. 53. 54.</note> which Chriſt ſpake, ſaying, <hi>Except ye eate the
fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, ye haue no life
in you:</hi> and the caſe of thoſe Antichriſts, and of thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull
euill hearted draw-backs, as it hath been the
caſe of many thouſands more, and is ſtill at this day; yet
the caſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles
was far otherwiſe, as is now alſo the caſe of all regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
true hearted Chriſtians; they beleeue to the ſauing
of the ſoule; they eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man,
and drinke his blood, ſpiritually by faith, and haue
eternall life abiding in them; they dwell in Chriſt, and
Chriſt in them; they are borne of God, and therefore
draw not backe, ſinne not to perdition, for the ſeed
whereby they are begotten remaineth in them, neither
can they ſo ſinne, becauſe they are borne of God; nay,
they are ſealed (by the holy Spirit of promiſe) vnto the
day of redemption; they ouercome the world, endure
and keepe his words and works vnto the end; they are
the liuely ſtones of Gods temple, built vpon the chiefe
corner ſtone, who are made a ſpiritual houſe, to offer vp
ſpirituall ſacrifices acceptable to God by Ieſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 5. 6.</note>
his Church,<note place="margin">Math. 16. 18.</note> againſt which, the gates of hell ſhall not

preuaile; they are the good ground ſpoken of, the good
trees, which cannot bring forth euill fruit, but good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
the euill which they doe (at any time) is not their
fruit, becauſe it proceedeth not from their hearts, but
is done vnwillingly, through weakneſſe, for in their
hearts they ſerue the law of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 22.</note> The Scriptures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that to be a mans fruite, which cometh from his
heart, whether it be good or euill, becauſe thereby the
nature of the fountaine (which is the heart) is knowne,
as the nature of trees are by their fruite. So that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a good man (I meane that which is borne of the
Spirit, not his fleſhly nature) is now to bring foorth
good fruite only, as Chriſt teſtifieth, ſaying, <hi>A good man
out of the good treaſure of his heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 6. 45.</note>

               <hi>If ye hold faſt vuto the end. If ye continue. Him that

the different eſtates and conditions of Chriſtians; of
the danger of the one eſtate, and of the well being and
ſafetie of the other; that ſo we ſeeing the difference, and

but his meaning is, that ſuch deſperate and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

which they may receiue, and ſome alteration the word
of God may worke in them; yet) being neuer ſanctified
in heart, by the faith of the Sonne of God) in time they
diſcouer themſelues to be in heart euill, and aduerſaries

               <hi>And from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, euen
that which he ſeemeth to haue;</hi> which ſeemeth alſo to be
an improper ſpeech: for how can that which a man
hath not, be ſaid to be taken from him. He had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

the word with ioy, but not in deepeneſſe of root,

faith, like vnto his, that brought forth fruit, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
and had taſted of the good word of God, and
of the powers of the world to come; but he ſeemed and
made ſhew to haue more, he preſumed (no doubt) that
his name was written in the booke of life, which was
more then that he had receiued could warrant him.
This his pretended ſhew is now alſo taken from him,
and his name is (openly) by the iuſt ſentence of Gods
word, put out of all hope, of being, or euer to be written
in the book of life, and he is now (like the earth, which

ſecret to ſome? doubtleſſe, It is both Gods ſecret, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
decree or will, concerning ſuch as ſhal be ſaued;
by that which is reuealed, the ſecret is made knowne.
His ſecret decree, we haue in the firſt beginning of our
writing ſhewed, (which briefly is this:) That God (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the world was) foreſeeing the fall of mankind, did
chuſe in Chriſt a certaine number of them to life and
ſaluation, which were all foreſeen and knowne of him,
and recorded by his decree, in the roule of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were; his reuealed will or decree, (which we
haue before alſo at large expreſt) is (briefly this) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the ſpeciall promiſes and teſtimonies of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
which are moſt fully and often recorded, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
in the Scriptures of God, to, and concerning ſuch
perſons, in ſuch maner qualified, as we haue before (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scriptures) deſcribed. So that euery man
ſo qualified, may ſee and know, through the Spirit of
God, in and by the ſame records, his name, to wit, his
perſon, ſoule and body, decreed and recorded of God
in Chriſt, euen from the foundation of the world, to be
for life and ſaluation. This is the booke of life of the
Lamb ſlaine,<note place="margin">Reu. 17. 8.</note> for in him it was and is done, and of this
decree there is no alteration.<note place="margin">Reu. 13. 8.</note> And whereas it ſeemeth
to ſome,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note> that God doth alter his purpoſe, and change
his word, becauſe he ſometimes promiſeth bleſſings and
life to men, which (by reaſon they, on their parts, do not
that which he requireth) he performeth not; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
threatneth iudgement, which by reaſon men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8177:25"/>
he executeth not. The truth is, it doth but ſo ſeem
to ignorant men, who doe not rightly conceiue of the
power of God, nor vnderſtand the drift and ſcope of his
word. For God is not like vnto men, to purpoſe one
thing to day, and reſolue vpon another to morrow; but
whatſoeuer he hath decreed in his heart, ſhall ſurely
come to paſſe, though he ſometimes vſe to ſpeake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the maner of men, becauſe he knoweth they are but
men whom he ſpeaketh vnto. He publiſheth his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to all men in generall, and doth promiſe ſaluation
to all men that repent and beleeue, and he requireth
repentance and faith of all, yet (notwithſtanding) but
few do repent and beleeue, and ſo come to ſaluation;
doth God therefore alter his purpoſe, and change his
word? He alſo gaue a law to all men before, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
obedience thereunto, promiſing life likewiſe to all
that obeyed it, but no man euer kept it, and liued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;
did God therefore alter his purpoſe and change his
word? nay, God did neuer purpoſe in his heart, nor
promiſe, that any man ſhould here (in the fleſh) keepe
his law and liue by it, though the Familiſts ſay he did;
neither was it giuen to that end, though they affirme
it was. For if it had bene ſo, God would neuer haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the other; nay he knew, ſuch was mans miſerable
condition by his fall, and the fiery ſharpnes of that law
againſt him, that it was ſo farre impoſſible for him to
keepe the ſame, and liue thereby, as that it vtterly ſlue
him, and kept him off. Therefore God hauing decreed
in his heart to ſaue ſome, was pleaſed to giue the other:
if he had not done ſo, but ſhould haue proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all, for the breach of the firſt, ſhould he haue
done any man wrong? nay, who dare ſay ſo? And is he
now vniuſt in publiſhing his Goſpell to all, becauſe he
ſaueth not all? or dareſt thou ſay, he altereth his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and changeth his word; nay, let God be true and
vnchangeable, and all men liers and moueable. Men
are as backward and vnwilling, and haue as little power
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8177:26"/>
or ſtrength in themſelues to obey the Goſpell, as they
had to keepe the law; nay, ſuch is yet (naturally) the
pride and loftineſſe of mans heart (as lamentable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
hath long proued,) that he rather deſireth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
vnder the rule and command of the law, and ſo
ſeeke life by the works thereof, then to ſubiect his ſoule
to the rule and commandements of the Goſpell, (viz.)
to repent of his ſinnes from the bottome of his heart,
and ſeeke life by faith in the free grace of God in Ieſus
Chriſt, and follow Chriſt in the regeneration. But ſo it
is, I ſay, that before the world was, God did purpoſe and
decree in himſelfe, to ſaue (by the Goſpell of his Sonne
Ieſus Chriſt) a ſeed, a remnant, of the foreſeene fallen
poſteritie of mankind, which ſeed he reſerued from the
beginning, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended them in the promiſe, which
he firſt made to <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> (ſaying) <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhal
breake the Serpents head.</hi> Chriſt being the principall, and

from the ſeed of the Serpent,<note place="margin">ver. 15.</note> in theſe words, <hi>And I will

in theſe words,<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 3.</note> 
               <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all nations of the earth be

thoſe children which God made <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of:
as he ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I haue made thee a father of many nations;</hi> euen
they that were to haue the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>ſeed</hi>

in theſe words,<note place="margin">Gen. 21. 12.</note> 
               <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called.</hi> By all which
it is euident, that as Chriſt was promiſed, and ſeuered
from the ſeed of the ſerpent; ſo all the ſeed (betweene
whom, and the ſeed of the ſerpent, there was to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie)
were alſo promiſed, as Gods free people, meerly
giuen of him to life, and ſeuered by him alſo from them:
and as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was borne by promiſe, ſo are they. <hi>At this
time will I come</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and Sara ſhall haue a ſonne.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18 10.</note> So
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Now we (brethren) as Iſaac was, are the
children of promiſe.</hi> And that theſe children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8177:26"/>
(onely) are the children of God, and counted for
the ſeed,<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 8.</note> the ſame Apoſtle alſo in another place wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth,
in theſe words, <hi>They which are the children of the
fleſh, are not the children of God; but the children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
are counted for the ſeed.</hi> And they are called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, becauſe alſo they are borne of God, and
adopted through the Spirit of his Son: and therefore
God is not aſhamed to be called their God,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7. 8.</note> (as he ſaid
to <hi>Abraham, I will he thy God, and the God of thy ſeed) For
be hath prepared for them a citie.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now this ſeed, as God foreknew them all, and had
choſen them in Chriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
them to be conformed to his image and likeneſſe,
who are therefore ſaid to be written in the Lambs book
of life, from the foundation of the world. And as he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
them by promiſe from the ſeed of the Serpent:
ſo from time to time, hee calleth them, and
whom he calleth, hee iuſtifieth, and whom he iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
them alſo he glorifieth. He hath not done theſe
things to all. The ſeed of the Serpent neuer had any of
theſe priuiledges, God neuer choſe them in Chriſt, nor
predeſtinated them to be conformed to his image, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were they euer written in the Lambs booke of life
from the foundation of the world; neither did God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
promiſe to call, iuſtifie, and glorifie them, or any of
them: therefore God neuer altered his purpoſe, nor
changed his word or promiſe, as ſome ignorantly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
but there hath been euer enmitie betweene the
ſeed of the ſerpent and the ſeed of the woman, euen
from the dayes of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> to this preſent, and
ſhall be to the end, according to the word of the Lord;
though they be inlightned, and taſte as much of the
good word of God, as either <hi>Cain</hi> or the Iewes did. God
vſeth threatnings (oft times) to bring that ſeed (which
he promiſed to call) to repentance, he giueth them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
he promiſeth grace to the repentant, in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
particular maner, he giueth them faith alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8177:27"/>
it; he promiſeth likewiſe ſaluation (abſolutely)
to theſe beleeuers; he admoniſheth them, becauſe they
(of themſelues) are apt to fall, yea and would fall and
periſh, if they ſtood by their owne ſtrength, if God
did not ſuſtaine them, and had not ordered and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of all things for their ſafetie and wel being; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
them to watch and to pray, and he giueth
them his Spirit, which helpeth their infirmities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which they know not what to aske, and it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
requeſt vnto God for them with ſighs and grones
which cannot be expreſt; not becauſe they may yet pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
but becauſe they ſhould not periſh, and for that
they are weake and apt to fall, and grieue the Spirit. He
alſo chaſteneth them, not for their hurt, nor in his
wrath, but that they ſhould not be condemned with
the world. And becauſe God hath appointed them to
be holy, and ſo, to ſaluation; therefore he hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all theſe things. For as he (before the world was)
purpoſed to ſaue them, ſo likewiſe did he determine
of the way and meanes whereby to ſaue them, and
the meanes is as certaine as his decree.</p>
            <p>And Gods promiſes concerning life eternal (to ſpeake
properly) are not vpon any conditions, though he doth
ſeeme ſo to propoſe them to the world, but they are
abſolutely free, without any condition of our parts. It
is true, God will ſaue none, but ſuch as repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
his Goſpell, bring forth fruite, endure to the end,
&amp;c. yet theſe are not conditions, for God giueth all
theſe things to his elect, as freely as he gaue Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them,
he conformeth them hereby to the image of
Chriſt; elſe, grace and ſaluation were of due debt, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
which to teach, is erroneous and Antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>And although God did elect men in Chriſt from the
foundation of the world, yet did not the Elect fall from
their Election in the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> neither did <hi>Adam</hi>
himſelfe loſe his Election by his fall, (as they would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) for Gods Election was not of man,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8177:27"/>
conſidered in his innocencie, but of men, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> foreſeene
fallen; and therefore they are ſaid to be choſen in Chriſt,
who was to be a reconciler and mediator for ſinners, and
not for innocent perſons. So that the obiection of them,
which ſay, if the Elect cannot fall out of Gods fauour,
then did not all fall in <hi>Adam;</hi> If the elect cannot fall
from their election, then haue not all ſinned; is very
carnall and wicked, much like vnto that of the Saduces,
which ſaid, <hi>Whoſe wife ſhall ſhe be in the Reſurrection,</hi> who
like fooles, knew not that in the reſurrection, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
marry, nor giue in marraige: So they being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the wiſedome and foreknowledge of God, giue
out, If the elect cannot fall from their election, then
haue not all ſinned: And are as bould, and thinke
themſelues aſwell armed hereby againſt the certainty
and continuance of Gods election, as the Saduces
thought themſelues againſt the reſurrection, when
they came in ſcorne thereof to poſe Chriſt. But I omit
their friuolous obiections, as not hauing any collour of
reaſon, becauſe alſo we ſhall haue occaſion to cleere
thoſe things hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus as we haue ſaid, God firſt publiſheth his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and all doe enioy ſome benefit thereby, many are
inlightned by it, and are made partakers of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
gifts of the Spirit, but few are made partakers of
thoſe which are ſpeciall, and peculiar. And this is the
order which God doth vſe for the calling, ſanctifying,
and ſauing of his elect: Firſt, after they are inlightned
to know his truth, he calleth them in a ſpeciall maner
to repentance; then in the ſecond place by a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
gift of the Spirit, he iuſtifieth the repentant
ſoule from his ſinnes, and ſanctifieth his heart; and
then thirdly, they being now ingrafted into Chriſt
their head,<note place="margin">Eſa. 61. 3.</note> doe bring forth fruit in him, as before we
haue deſcribed. And theſe are the plantation of God,
the trees of righteouſnes which the Scriptures ſpeak of.
God is the husbandman,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 2.</note> and this is the maner of his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8177:28"/>
husbandry: And thus hath he ſeuered and diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
his plants, from all carnal vnregenerate Chriſtians,
vnder what name or title ſoeuer they paſſe, or in what
outward eſtate or Church ſoeuer they liue. And bleſſed
is that man that hath part with them in thoſe ſpeciall
gifts and treaſures of life, for on ſuch the ſecond death
ſhall haue no power.</p>
            <p>Thus haue we proued that whoſoeuer, is borne
from aboue of water and the Spirit, Iuſtified by faith in
Chriſt, whoſe names are written in the booke of life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the foundation of the world, ſhall neuer fall away, nor
haue their names razed out of the booke of life againe.
And that God doth neuer alter his purpoſe or promiſe,
but that all his decrees and promiſes ſhall ſurely come to
paſſe.</p>

to doe for themſelues, and for their children) then
to ſtand to diſpute the points, or once to queſtion,
whether it be ſo or no. Neuertheles to ſtop the mouthes
of ſuch as doe deny it, we ſay, that when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned,
all ſinned together with him, becauſe all mankind were
then in him; and therefore when God caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of
Paridice, he caſt all his poſteritie out of Paracice with
him; and when God curſed the earth, he curſed it not
to his perſon alone, but all that were to come of him,
as well yong as old; which proueth, that as the curſe

vnto them, and continueth from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in them; elſe the manifold miſſeries which were
vpon children (as well as vpon men of yeares) were
vniuſt. Why ſhould God ſhut them out of Paradice, and
not reſtore them thither againe, ſo ſoone as they were
borne, there to haue the ſame free liberty to eate of the
tree of life, as <hi>Adam</hi> had before he fell? why ſhould God
exact at their hands, firſt ſo ſoone as they haue any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie,
the perfect righteouſneſſe of the Law, vpon
paine of death (as ye confeſſe) if they had eaten with
<hi>Adam,</hi> of the tree of knowledge of good and euill? why
ſhould that fiery two edged ſword be ſet to keepe from
them alſo the way of the tree of life? and why are they
ſubiect to all the calamities that came vpon the earth,
by the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> if they fell not with him? why

in the birth, and ſome newly borne, if they had beene
cleane from all pollutions of ſinne? would not God
haue ſpared them, and the world for their ſakes? And
why did God then deſtroy the cities of Sodome and

to doe, if he found ten righteous their? If children
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8177:29"/>
be free from all pollution of ſinne, they are not vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

may be called righteous: <hi>Elſe were your children vncleane,</hi>
(ſaith <hi>Paul) but now are they holy.</hi> As alſo, if vnclean, then
polluted, as were the children of the Sodomites (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe)
aboue all the cities of the world. And ſo did God
(the Iudge of all the world) doe right, in rooting out
that wicked generation, as he did alſo the other of the
old world. When <hi>Adam</hi> fell, he did not only commit a
fault, but by the ſame his fault, he not only brought
vpon himſelfe death and wrath, but fell into a gulfe of
pollution and wickedneſſe, both ſoule and bodie. Nay,
when he receiued grace, it did not rid and free him of
that naturall corruption, whereinto the whole man
was plunged, inſomuch as he could not increaſe and

neceſſarily be of the ſame nature that he was, both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

God doth breath in euery perticular child of man, in the

earth, increaſeth to roote, and then to branches, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
bringeth forth fruit, or ſeed againe, nothing
differing from the ſeed that was firſt ſowne. And as an

came, was vncleane, how could he be cleane? That
which moued <hi>Dauid</hi> to call this to minde, was not ſo

the apprehenſion of his owne preſent ſinne he was faln
into, which he was now lamenting and confeſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, vrged him to call to mind his firſt beginning,
and in his confeſſion to charge himſelfe with ſin, euen
from the time that his mother firſt conceiued him, and
confeſſeth the ſame alſo to his owne ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
thereby to cut off all good opinion of himſelfe, as

naturall conception and firſt birth, the more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
vnto his ſoule the neceſſitie of the ſecond new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth

was fallen from his firſt integritie of nature and bleſſed

then was ſowne in the heart of <hi>Adam</hi>) hath brought
forth ſo great increaſe, that it hath polluted and made
vncleane the hearts and natures of all that come of him.
As alſo another teſtifieth,<note place="margin">4. Eſdras.</note> ſaying, <hi>The graine of euill ſeed
was ſowne in the heart of Adam from the beginning, and how
much vngodlineſſe hath it brought vp vnto this time? and how

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8177:30"/>
Ponder now with thy ſelfe, how great fruit of wickedneſſe, the
graine of euill ſeed hath brought forth; and when the eares
ſhall be cut downe, how great a floore ſhall they fill?</hi> In which
words this holy Prophet plainly ſheweth, that their firſt
graine, namely, the ſin which was firſt ſowne in <hi>Adams</hi>
heart, was, and is, the original root and firſt ground of all
ſin, that hath ſprung vp &amp; ſhall ſpring vp in the hearts
of all his poſteritie to the worlds end, and ſo of all their
miſery; and therefore he ſaith againe, <hi>Oh thou Adam,
what haſt thou done? for though it was thou that haſt ſinned,
thou art not falne alone, but we all that come of thee.</hi> The
very ſame alſo doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> affirme, (hauing ſpoken,
and being ſpeaking of the reconciliation, grace, and life
eternall, which is by the death and life of Chriſt onely
attainable) wherefore ſaith he,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</note>

ſhewing that as by one, euen <hi>Adam,</hi> ſinne entred into
the hearts of all men, and death is paſſed vpon them,
for that all (by that meanes) haue ſinned: ſo grace and
life, is by one, euen Chriſt, and none ſhall liue, but by
him. And that not any one man whatſoeuer, old or
yong, male or female, ſhall euer enter into life, except
he be changed from that he is by nature, by a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power of grace through the Spirit; Chriſt himſelfe

               <note place="margin">Iob. 3. 3.</note>

euery child of man, (without exception) of what age
or ſex ſoeuer, if he be one conceiued and borne of fleſh,

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8177:30"/>
with <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, euen from the conception, is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

his tender heart, and brings vnto it from God (in

that children are capable of this, in and from the womb,
let the babe which ſprang in his mothers wombe for
ioy, giue teſtimonie. And if any ſhall ſay, Chriſt doth
not call a child (new borne) <hi>a man;</hi> let him reade theſe
words of Chriſt: <hi>A woman when ſhe trauaileth hath ſorrow

               <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 21.</note> 
               <hi>but as ſoone as ſhe is deliuered of

is borne into the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If children dying before they commit actuall ſinne
are ſaued,<note place="margin">Abſurdities.</note> becauſe they haue no originall pollution of
ſinne, (as theſe ſilly men ſay;) then Chriſt died not for
children, neither was he promiſed vnto them, nor yet
are they ſaued by him, but by their owne innocencie;
and ſo this promiſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The Seed of the woman ſhall bruiſe

not to any of their children, becauſe they were to be
borne all innocents, without ſinne. Theſe, with many
other abſurdities will follow from this their doctrine.
But it is an error, as their other points are; and therefore
error muſt needs be the conſequence of it. If one ſhould
aske theſe men, at what age a child may commit an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
ſinne, whereby it doth loſe it innocencie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of nature; and then at what age it is capable of
the new birth; and alſo why the luſt or thought of euill
in the heart, as well as an act of euill, may not take their
innocencie and vertue of nature from them. It is
much to be maruelled, what anſwers they would make.
But to leaue them to better conderations, hoping they

beleeue Ieſus to be the Chriſt, and acknowledge him,
ſubmitting themſelues to be informed and guided by

they neither haue true repentance nor iuſtifying faith;
and that the children of all ſuch may be baptized.</p>
            <p>That ſuch as haue true repentance &amp; iuſtifying faith

               <hi>Cornelius, Lydia,</hi>
and the Eunuch, were true worſhippers of God, as the
Spirit teſtifieth of them, and therefore had both true
repentance &amp; iuſtifying faith before they knew Chriſt
to be come in the fleſh, yet theſe might not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
till they did know and acknowledge Chriſt to be
come in the fleſh, and that Ieſus Chriſt was he: but
Chriſt being manifeſted vnto them, the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him being vnfolded, and God opening their
hearts to attend vnto the ſame, and they beleeuing the
truth thereof, were baptized, being now (of all other)
the meeteſt perſons therefore. For we are to know, that
when Chriſt came into the world, he found the people
in ſeuerall conditions; ſome (though but few) very true
Iſraelites, who had both repentance and iuſtifying faith
before Chriſt, as touching his perſonall appearing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8177:31"/>
in the fleſh, was known vnto them as <hi>Simeon, Nathaniel,</hi>
thoſe before named and others; For the ſame way to
ſaluation that is now, was euer, euen from the dayes
of <hi>Abell,</hi> and ſhall be to the end; as repentance from
dead workes, and faith towards God &amp;c. And ſome
poore repentant ſinners and theſe were few alſo; which
had not yet Iuſtifying faith, but onely trauelling vnder
the burthen of their ſins, did much deſire to be releiued.
Such were thoſe poore, which are ſpoken of, the bruiſed
and heauy laden, Sicke, loſt, dead, &amp;c. And others
were they, that had neither repentance, nor faith, as the
multitudes of the Iewes, and of the whole world: and
to theſe ſeuerall ſorts of people, the Goſpell was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in ſeuerall maners.<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> To the firſt ſort, that Chriſt
was now come, euen the meſſenger of the couenant,
whom they deſired in their hearts to ſee and heare, as
one that did ſpiritually dwell in their hearts already,
theſe, beleeuing, were baptized. To the ſecond was
preached, that Chriſt is come, and alſo that the glad
tidings of peace, and reconciliation with God, in him,
did belong to them, in particular, and therefore Chriſt
calleth theſe, particularly, ſaying, <hi>Come vnto me all ye &amp;c.</hi>
Againe, <hi>The Sonne of man is come to ſeeke and ſaue that
which is loſt, &amp;c. The poore haue the Goſpell preached vnto
them:</hi> and theſe beleeuing and acknowledging Chriſt,
were baptized. And to the other third ſort, Chriſt was
not to be preached in any ſuch ſpecial peculiar manner,
as to the former, but more generally, as namely, that
Chriſt is come in the fleſh &amp;c: and that repentance and
remiſſion of ſinnes is granted in his name; ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
doth repent and beleeue the Goſpell, ſhalbe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Now they that did beleeue, and accknowledge
the truth of theſe things; as <hi>Iudas,</hi> the many diſciples
mentioned in the fourth and ſixt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the thornie
and ſtony ground, <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> with many others,
were, and might lawfully be baptized, though they
had not yet true repentance, nor iuſtifying faith. Nay
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8177:32"/>
it is manifeſt that neither Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, did
reiect any from the outward baptiſme, for the want
thereof, ſo as they did beleeue, and outwardly ſubmit
themſelues, to the doctrine of the Goſpell. Yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles,
Chriſt did not, neither did his holy Apoſtles,
therevpon Iuſtifie them; For then neither he, nor they,
would (ſo ſoone after) haue made ſuch exceptions,

(ſaith he) <hi>whether ye be in the faith, Proue your ſelues, know

and be baptized, and yet not be in the faith of
Chriſt, not know Chriſt to be in them, which (to
know) is the faith that Chriſtians muſt haue, if they
be not reprobates. Againe, ſome they charged with the
want of the knowledge of God; And ſome that denied
the reſurrection of the dead; And ſome that made their
belly their God, and minded earthly things; ſome to
be falſe Apoſtles, falſe teachers, ſuch as taught hereſies,
ſome falſe brethren; ſome couetous perſons, ſome hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites;
ſome that raiſed needleſſe queſtions about the
Law; ſome that taught circumciſion neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
and that Chriſtians muſt be circumciſed, or
they could not be ſaued; ſome were whiſperers, Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters;
ſome were louers of pleaſures, more then louers
of God, treacherous, high minded, yea, and what not;
And yet all beleeuers, and Lawfully baptized, and were
in the Churches, euen in the Apoſtles times, but not ſo
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8177:33"/>
approued of them, as ſome others were; They did not
account of all whom they baptized, to haue true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and Iuſtifying faith, neither before they bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
them, nor after, for they knew, that it neuer was,
nor could be ſo, ſome would proue falſe in heart, and
in ſome the grace of God did not yet appeare, vnto
iuſtification; therefore they ſenſured none, till they
ſaw iuſt cauſe, neither did they iuſtifie any, till they ſaw
proofe of their faith, but then they did, to both their
comforts and conſolations Nay, when they ſaw great
cauſe of feare and ſuſpition of many, yet they vſed
ſtrong arguments and perſwaſions to bring them to
repentance, as we ſee how they both ſpake, and write.
They did not eaſily reiect any, no not an Hereticke,
without twiſe or thriſe admonition; And when <hi>Simon
Magus</hi> diſcouered himſelfe, to be in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and that <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw his heart was not right in the
ſight of God, yet <hi>Peter</hi> caſt him not off, but ſaid vnto
him,<note place="margin">Act. 8. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Repent thy ſelfe therefore of thy wickednes, and pray
God, If perhaps the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiuen
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this was the eſtate of the Church in the dayes
of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, how may we thinke it can
be better now (nay) but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſtriue to make it better
we make it worſe. As concerning the inward eſtate, the
gifts of the Spirit, and power, that then were in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt, both in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the Adminiſtration of the word, grace of life
and peace, and workes of righteonſnes, I am ſure we all
come ſhort of: and ſhall we thinke to outſtrip them in
the outward? Nay, doubtles, I would we could (therein)
but compare with them, ſo we did alſo pertake of ſome
of their inward graces; otherwiſe the outward can doe
vs ſmall pleaſure. It is an euident ſigne, that where there
is much contending about the outward forme, externall
waſhings, and ſuch like, the inward purification of the
heart is little thought of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:8177:33"/>
So then, as concerning the outward eſtate of the
Church, we conclude, that as from the beginning
there was <hi>Cain,</hi> a beleeuer and ſacrificer, as was <hi>Abel,</hi>
though <hi>Abel</hi> had iuſtifying faith, and not <hi>Cain;</hi> and
as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was circumciſed as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>
might not inherite the heauenly promiſes as well
as <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and as in the Church of the Iewes from time
to time, all that acknowledge that true God and his
word, and did ſubmit themſelues to the outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of the law, were circumciſed, and were Iewes
outwardly, though but few were Iewes inwardly, and
circumciſed in heart: ſo was it in the dayes of Chriſt
and his Apoſtles, ſo is it now, and ſo ſhall it be to the
end; Chriſt himſelfe went neuer about to alter this,
but both he and his Apoſtles baptized thoſe that did
beleeue, and acknowledge him, and ſubmit themſelues
to be informed by his word, though they had not yet
either true repentance, or iuſtifying faith. For they
knew, that ſuch a beliefe and profeſſion, as made men
meet for outward baptiſme, might be, where iuſtifying
faith was not; and that both, that beliefe, profeſſion,
and baptiſme, did but make a Chriſtian outwardly, as
the outward profeſſion and circumciſion of the Iewes
did but make a Iew outwardly; and no better did they
iudge, or conclude of any, but when they ſaw better
cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the baptizing of children, (which
they ſay is no baptiſme at all, but do call it <hi>the marke
of the Beaſt,</hi>) we affirme that the children of all ſuch
beleeuers (as may themſelues be baptized) may alſo be
baptized, and that it is not, nor can be the marke of the
Beaſt ſpoken of, but is true outward baptiſme. Firſt, to
auoid many of their vaine and idle obiections, and that
we may come the more cleerer to the point, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that it is ſufficiently proued already, that all
haue ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and that death is paſſed on all,
for that all haue ſinned in him, being polluted from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8177:34"/>
their very conceptions; and that (therefore) there is a
neceſſitie of a new birth from aboue, of water and of
the Spirit, as wel to the yongeſt man of dayes or houres,
as to the eldeſt man of yeares. So that whoſoeuer is
borne of the fleſh, he muſt be borne again, from aboue
of the Spirit, either ſooner or later, if he be ſaued; and
that, although repentance and faith be the parts of this
new birth, and that repentance hath theſe parts (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is expreſt in men of yeares,) ſorrow for ſinne,
confeſſion of ſinne, and deſire of pardon, (as we haue
before defined;) and that iuſtifying faith (which is the
other part of this new birth) be an aſſurance or full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
wrought in the repentant heart by the Spirit,
of the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes and reconciliation with
God in Ieſus Chriſt, as we haue alſo defined it; I ſay, in
men of yeares, who alſo do confeſſe with the mouth,
as it is written, <hi>With the heart man beleeueth vnto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
and with the mouth confeſſion is made vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
yet (neuertheleſſe) the true nature of both theſe
parts of the new birth, may be in another maner defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſtill remaine the ſame in ſubſtance, as the firſt
part is called in Scripture, <hi>A heart of fleſh, an humble and
contrite heart, a broken heart;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it,
<hi>the fleſhly tables of the heart;</hi> in which regard it is called,
<hi>the baptiſme of water,</hi> and <hi>the birth of water;</hi> which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
thus, namely, that it is a ſpeciall effect or working
of the holy Ghoſt, whereby the heart (which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
hard and ſtubburne, euen from the birth) is made
ſoft and tender as water, or as fleſh is in compariſon of a
ſtone, that ſo it may receiue the impreſſion of the grace
and loue of God. The ſecond part, which is called <hi>the
baptiſme of the holy Ghoſt and the birth of the Spirit,</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine,
to be a ſpeciall gift of the Spirit alſo, but more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
which writeth and ſealeth in the ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heart of fleſh, grace and peace from God in
Chriſt, and filleth it with heauenly comfort and ioy,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8177:34"/>
like vnto that which is ſaid of <hi>Iohn</hi> (being in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
womb) when the voice of the ſalutation of <hi>Mary</hi>
ſounded in the eares of <hi>Elizabeth, The babe leaped in her
womb for ioy;</hi> which (doubtleſſe) was cauſed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Chriſt, in the ſoule of the child. Now in this ſort,
children are capable of both the parts, and ſo of the
whole new birth, which in them is no other in nature,
but the very ſame which is in men of yeares, (though
it be not outwardly ſo expreſt,) as we may perceiue
by the words of <hi>Paul</hi> to the faithfull of the Church
of Corinth: <hi>Foraſmuch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as ye are manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by vs, written
not with inke, but with the Spirit of the liuing God; not in
tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhly tables of the heart.</hi> For as the
law of death was written in tables of ſtone, and all the
hard and ſtonie hearts of the whole poſteritie of <hi>Adam,</hi>
not onely might, but alſo did, and doe receiue, euen in
their very conceptions, a deepe impreſſion thereof: ſo
on the contrary, the law of the Spirit of life, which is in
Chriſt Ieſus, euer was, is, and is to be, written in hearts
of fleſh, ſoft and tender hearts, and in no other. And
therefore it was, that God did promiſe to take away
from his elect the hard and ſtonie heart, and to giue
them a heart of fleſh, an humble and broken heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his pleaſure and promiſe is, to dwell with ſuch, to
reuiue and comfort them, and no other. And to ſpeake
plainly (howſoeuer perhaps ſome doe otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue)
it is not our act of beleeuing that doth iuſtifie vs,
but it is the free gift of grace, ſealed in our hearts by the
Spirit of Chriſt, whereby God iuſtifieth vs; which grace
and Spirit, is the cauſe of our act of beleeuing, or faith,
by which we are ſo often ſaid in Scripture, to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
where the effect is named for the cauſe, by reaſon
it is thereby made apparent vnto vs; as alſo (in another
ſenſe) we are ſaid to be iuſtified by works, becauſe works
do demonſtrate and make manifeſt our faith to others,

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:8177:36"/>
as it is ſaid of the primitiue Church of Rome, that <hi>their
faith had ſhined throughout the world,</hi> meaning by
works, which are the effects of faith. So that Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
calleth the faithfull <hi>the Epiſtle of Chriſt,</hi> not ſo much
for their act of beleeuing, as in reſpect of the grace of
God, which was written in their hearts by the Spirit of
Chriſt, by which they did now beleeue, and crie <hi>Abba,
Father,</hi> as it is written, <hi>He hath ſent forth the Spirit of his
Son into our hearts, which crieth Abba, Father.</hi> And for this
cauſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> the grace of the Goſpell is called, <hi>The law of the
Spirit of life which is in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſo, what ſhould now let, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
may not be baptized. Are they capable (as we ſee)
of regeneration, and are they not capable of the ſigne
thereof? May their hearts be ſanctified by the Spirit of
Chriſt, and may not the filth of their fleſh be waſhed off
with water? for the baptiſme of water, is bnt <hi>the doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of the filth of the fleſh,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh; euen
as outward circumciſion was but the cutting off the
fore-skin of the fleſh, repreſenting the cutting off the
ſinnes of the fleſh, the circumciſion of the heart, as alſo
baptiſme doth. For the circumciſion, which was the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off part of the fore-skin of the fleſh; and that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
or waſhing away the filth of the fleſh; we doe
not ſay, that the one was a type of the other, but
were both types of one truth, (namely) the baptiſme
or purification of the heart by faith. So then, if they
both aimed at one thing or end, (as ſhall appeare they
did;) then it will euidently appeare alſo, that by vertue
of what precept the one was practiſed, by vertue of the
ſame precept the other is to be performed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
It is alſo ſaid, that whoſoeuer did omit the practiſe
which that precept required, was to be cut off from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the people, that is to ſay, that ſuch a perſon
ought not to be acknowledged as one in the outward
eſtate of the Church then vnder the law: ſo proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
it will follow, that what perſon ſoeuer, yong or
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:8177:36"/>
old, that is not baptized, he is alſo to be cut off, (that is)
not to be accounted or numbred, in the outward
eſtate of Chriſtians, now vnder the Goſpell.
May ſuch beleeuers, as are not ſanctified in heart, be
baptized, (as before is proued) and may not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of beleeuers be baptized? Why are the children of
beleeuers ſaid to be holy? (the children of vnbeleeuers
throwout the whole Scriptures are neuer ſaid to be
holy) doubtleſſe it is becauſe they are in heart holy;
or elſe becauſe they being the children of the faithfull,
haue ſome promiſe (as touching the inheritance of life
belonging to them) as the children of the faithfull had
formerly; and ſo haue right to enter into the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
where the wayes of life are taught, as they then
by circumciſion, ſo theſe now by baptiſme, that they
may be informed in the wayes of the Lord; elſe would
there be no difference, betweene the children of the
faithfull, and the children of infidels. So that, to this
end, is the vnbeleeuing husband ſaid, to be ſanctified
to the beleeuing wife, and beleeuing wife to the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
husband; becauſe otherwiſe, if the vnbeleeuer
(in this regard) were not ſanctified to the beleeuer, then
were their children vncleane (that is to ſay) as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of infidels,<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> that haue no promiſe belonging to
them, but rather a curſe, and therefore are vncleane,
and may not enter. It is therefore meete, ſeeing God
hath put difference betweene the children of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and the children of infidels, that they ſhould be
diſtinguiſhed from them, by ſome outward ſigne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the ſame. And what can they haue leſſe then
baptiſme, which can giue to no man any more, then
the outward name of a Chriſtian, as circumciſion did
the outward name of a Iew. It doth neither confer, nor
confirme grace to the heart of any, no more then cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
did. It proueth that a man is a Chriſtian out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and it teacheth that he ſhould be ſo inwardly;
and ſo did circumciſion. It proue a man to be a Iew
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8177:37"/>
outwardly, and it taught that he ſhould be a Iew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly;<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note>
yea a Chriſtian inwardly, to ſpeake fully as the
truth is; for euery true inward Iew, was a true inward
Chriſtian. And to be circumciſed in heart, was to be
baptized or purified in heart, by faith through the
Spirit; as alſo to be baptized in heart, (by faith through
the Spirit) is to be circumciſed in heart; for ſo doth
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in plaine words affirme, writing to thoſe
Chriſtians, whoſe hearts were ſanctified by faith, ſaying,
<hi>And ye are compleate in him which is the head of all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and powers, In whom alſo yee are circumciſed with the
circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the
ſinnes of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt, buried with
him in baptiſme, wherein alſo ye are riſen with him through
the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him vp from
the dead.</hi> In which words (I ſay) he ſetteth downe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
that the baptiſme which ſaueth, the baptiſme
whereby we put on Chriſt, the baptiſme whereby our
hearts are purged and ſanctified, and the ſinnes of our
fleſh done away, whereby we are buried with Chriſt,
and doe riſe with him, euen that which is through the
faith and operation of the Spirit, is one and the ſame,
with the circumciſion of the heart, which he therefore
calleth, <hi>the circumciſion made without hands, the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Chriſt,</hi> whereby alſo it appeareth clearely, and
beyond all contradiction, that the circumciſion, or
the cutting off the foreskin of the fleſh, was a ſigne and
true repreſentation of the doing away of their ſinnes,
of the clenſing of the heart by faith (as now the doing
away of the filth of the fleſh with the baptiſme of water
is;) for which vſe and end, it was alſo giuen to <hi>Abraham</hi>
at the firſt, as this Apoſtle alſo declareth in an other
place, ſaying, <hi>And he receiued the ſigne of circumciſion, a
ſeale of the righteouſnes of the faith which he had, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed,
that he might be the Father of all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued,
though they be not circumciſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> 
               <hi>that righteouſnes
might be imputed to them alſo.</hi> Where he (I ſay) fully
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8177:37"/>
declareth, that the circumciſion of the fleſh was giuen,
not to that end and purpoſe, as the carnall corrupt Iews
imagined, to teach righteouſnes to be by the Law
(which was to make the promiſe voide, which is to be
attained onely by faith, and not by workes) but is
taught and directed to the righteouſnes which is by
faith, through the promiſe in the circumciſion of the
heart, which <hi>Abraham</hi> had, and which all their ſeed
(of whom God made him the Father) were to haue;
and that the circumciſion of the fleſh was a ſigne of, and
did teach the circumciſion of the heart (if any yet que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
it) the ſame Apoſtles words, (a little before) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
it, where he ſaith, <hi>For he is not a Iew which is one
outwardly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> 
               <hi>neither is that circumciſion which is outward in
the fleſh, but he is a Iew which is one within, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
is of the heart in the Spirit, not in letter; whoſe praiſe
is not of men, but of God.</hi> Where we ſee, that there was
a Iew outwardly, and a Iew inwardly; a circumciſion
outward in the fleſh, and a circumciſion inward of the
heart, in the ſpirit. The outward had but the name,
and did onely ſignifie and teach what ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in the heart; and that in the heart, was the
thing it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>All theſe things being now thus cleere, we reaſon
thus.</p>
            <p>That if children might once receiue the ſigne of circumciſion
of the heart, after the old forme of the Law, then may they
now after the new forme of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>But they might once, after the old forme of the Law.</p>
            <p>Therefore alſo now, after the new forme of the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>That they might once after the old forme, is paſt all
queſtion. And that they may now after the new forme,
we proue thus.</p>
            <p>That which was once for good ends in the time of the Law
appointed, and is not by the Goſpell diſanulled, it is lawfull ſtill.</p>
            <p>But it was appointed for good ends, that children ſhould
receiue the ſigne of the circumciſion of the heart; and it is not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:8177:38"/>
by the Goſpell any way diſanulled.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is lawfull now ſtill.</p>
            <p>But theſe men obiect and ſay, that there is no plaine
commandement, nor example, in the new teſtament
for baptiſing of children.</p>
            <p>I anſwere, It ſaith oft times, that whole houſholds
were baptized, without any exception of children; and
we haue ſmall reaſon to thinke, that beleeuers ſhould
be barren more then others. The naming of whole
houſholds without any exception, ſheweth plainely,
that the Spirit of truth neuer intended to exclude chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
If he had euer intended any ſuch thing, then
(doubtles) would he haue giuen ſome little touch, or
tittle, to that purpoſe, which he hath neuer done. And
to ſet downe in plaine words (particularly) that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were or might be baptized, there was then no
neede, becauſe there were none in thoſe dayes that
queſtioned it, as there might well, and would (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe)
haue beene, if the Apoſtles had not baptized
any, but refuſed them. If it might be concluded that
there were no children in thoſe mentioned Families, as
we haue ſmall reaſon to thinke, that Chriſtians belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
ſhould be more barren then Infidells, (yet) no
doubt, in all the Apoſtles times, ſome children were
offered (as we ſee ſome were brought to Chriſt, and not
refuſed of him) which if the Apoſtles had once reiected,
the Iewes (eſpecially) would haue taken exception
againſt them (as well they might) and haue enquired
what ſhould be the reaſon thereof; and alſo haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
why children might not aſwell be baptized, as
before they were circumciſed. And the Apoſtles would
haue giuen them anſwere, and ſo by that meanes your
queſtion had beene diſſolued long agoe. But becauſe
there were not then, in their dayes any ſuch queſtioners,
nor any cauſe of any ſuch queſtion, by them giuen:
therefore they tooke no care, either to ſet downe in
particular, that children were, or might be baptized,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:8177:38"/>
nor yet to ſhew any one the leaſt exception againſt it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for they knew it was not a matter of ſuch conſequence,
as you imagine. If they had either ſeene or foreſeene
any ſuch dangerous euill, as you conceiue, you ſee in it,
as that it was or would be the marke of the Beaſt, which
the Spirit ſpeaketh of, they would certainly haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
and forewarned the Church of it (as they haue
done of other things, which in your ſight is of leſſe
moment,) that ſo either it might not haue taken ſuch
great place as it hath, or elſe (at leaſt) that the people
of God might (without ſo great difficultie) haue ſeene
what a dangerous euill it was, or would come to, and
with conſtancie and comfort haue auoided and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
it; but they being guided by the holy Ghoſt,
haue done whatſoeuer was needfull. Againe, if there
muſt needs be a plaine word, either by ſome precept
or example, expreſt, for the proofe of whatſoeuer may
be practiſed among Chriſtians; then where finde we
any where written, that women (in particular) may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in the Sacrament of the Supper, though (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe)
it may be ſoundly prooued by argument from
Scripture, that women may partake therein, as we haue
already proued children may be baptized.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized himſelfe firſt, and then Mr. <hi>Helwis,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Morton,</hi> with the reſt.</note> If I ſhould
now demand of you your warrant, for a man to baptize
himſelfe; I much maruell where you would finde ſuch
a practiſe in all the new Teſtament of Chriſt; I am ſure
it would be a taske too hard for you to find. Well, to let
paſſe thoſe things, we will now go on. When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle

of the Apoſtles or pen-men of the Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when
they did ſet downe that whole houſholds were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
or at any other time, had but ſaid, except yong
children, it had been enough. And if they had ſo ſaid,

and obiect againſt it. Might they not haue reaſoned

againſt it thus: Doth Chriſt the meſſenger of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of peace, and Preacher of good tidings, deale more
hardly now (in this time of the plentie of grace) then
he did before in the time of the law? Might children
then be admitted by circumciſion into the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lord, and may they not now by baptiſme?
They were formerly called Iewes, and counted of the
ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whom a bleſſing by promiſe was to
be expected, as namely, that God would call a ſeed, out
of that ſtocke or ſeed, which ſhould inherite his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
whereof circumciſion was a ſigne vnto them; and
may they not now be allowed the name of a Chriſtian
through Baptiſme? They are the ſame that they were
then, and why ſhould not Chriſt (in whom the bleſſing
and promiſe reſteth) be the ſame?</p>
            <p>Thus they might haue argued, if it had been ſo, if
the caſe were now ſo altered, as touching children; if
Chriſt were not the ſame, that he then was: but it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
and Chriſt is the ſame, yea (and in regard of
the large bountie and plentie of grace, which he hath
now vouchſafed) he is more then the ſame; therefore
let not children be denied that which belongeth vnto
them.</p>
            <p>Chriſt was much diſpleaſed with thoſe diſciples that
rebuked them that brought little children vnto him,
that he ſhould touch them, and ſaid, <hi>Suffer little children
to come vnto me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 10. 13, 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God. Verily I ſay vnto you, whoſoeuer ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the kingdome of God as a little child, he ſhall not enter
therein.</hi> And (the text ſaith) <hi>he tooke them vp in his armes,
and layd his hands vpon them, and bleſſed them.</hi> Whence it is
euident, that little children ought by no meanes to be
denied baptiſme, becauſe they are ſuch true ſimilitudes
of regeneration, of which baptiſme is a ſigne; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(alſo) Chriſt maketh it an argument againſt thoſe
that would haue hindered them to be brought vnto
him, ſaying, <hi>for of ſuch is the kingdome of God:</hi> ſo that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8177:39"/>
it may be as rightly ſaid, Suffer little children to come
to baptiſme, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the
kingdome of God; of ſuch as be conuerted and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
like vnto little children, doth the Church of God
conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Whereas they further affirme, that infants baptiſme
is the marke of the Beaſt, and ſo muſt be caſt away, with
euery part thereof; becauſe whoſoeuer dieth with that
marke on them (without repentance) ſhall certainly
drinke of the cup of Gods wrath. Which marke of the
Beaſt, is thus deciphered by them: All maner of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
which are performed by the miniſtery of the
Church of England (being an Antichriſtian miniſtery,
whereof infants baptiſme is one) are none of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
but a marke of the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>From which obſerue what will follow againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>Euery action which is performed by the miniſtery of the
Church of England, is a marke of the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>But the mariage of the Anabaptiſts in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
is an action performed by the miniſtery of the Church
of England.<note place="margin">A retortion vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the mariage of the Anabaptiſts in the Church
of England, is a marke of the Beaſt.</p>
            <p>Whoſoeuer do retain the marke of the Beaſt, ſhall certainly
drinke of the cup of Gods wrath.</p>
            <p>But whatſoeuer Anabaptiſt do retaine the mariage of the

            <p>Therefore whatſoeuer Anabaptiſt do retaine the mariage

            <p>Euery mariage which is marke of the Beaſt, muſt be made

            <p>But euery mariage of the Anabaptiſts in the Church of

Therefore euery mariage of the Anabaptiſts in the Church

            <p>Which being true, then ceaſe they to be maried, as

            <p>That the baptiſme of children, neither is, nor can be

Church of Rome, whereof Antichriſt is head, may yet
(notwithſtanding) be a true Church, and they true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

            <p>It is not the outward ordination, which a Biſhop or
Miniſter hath (before his conuerſion) receiued of a falſe
Antichriſtan Church, that can either pollute him (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now
conuerted, and called of God) or make the Church
to which he miniſtreth, falſe or Antichriſtian: Neither
is it the bare outward ordination receiued of the beſt
Church that euer was in the world, and in the beſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8177:41"/>
it, a true faithfull Miniſter of God, or the

Chriſt; But he may be, both a falſe teacher, an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,
and his Church falſe and antichriſtian, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
Thoſe falſe teachers and Antichriſts, that were
in the Apoſtles times, had (no doubt) their firſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from the true Church of God, in as good an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
forme, as any is, or can be; and that Church or
people, that were led by them, could not chuſe but be
vnſound.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures (foretelling of falſe prophets, falſe
teachers, Antichriſts, and of the great Antichriſt which
ſhould ariſe, deſcribeth them to riſe, not from among
the heathen or Iewes (as ſome imagine the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt

            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> being neere his departure from his labors,

Moreouer of your owne ſelues ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
things to draw diſciples after them. Therefore watch and
remember.</hi> Theſe were ſuch as the holy Ghoſt had made
ouerſeers; ſo that their outward calling, ordination,
and ſucceſſion, could not be excepted againſt; and yet
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8177:41"/>
we ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> foretells, and forewarnes them of.
Againe, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaking of Antichriſts, that roſe in

in the ſides of the North, I will aſcend aboue the height of the

was to ſit, and doth ſit, euen in the Church, in the
Temple of God, in the place where (indeed) he ought
not to ſit. If then all theſe things be ſo, as theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
doe declare. If it be not the outward calling, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
or ſucceſſion in the offices and places of the
true Elders and Miniſters of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.</note> in the outward ſtate
of the Church of God, that can either make them true
faithfull Miniſters of God, ſuch as come by the doore,
as Chriſt ſpeaketh; Or the Church, of which they are
ouerſeers and miniſters, the true holy Church of Chriſt:
but that theſe Elders and Miniſters may yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
proue falſe Prophets, falſe teachers, grieuous raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8177:42"/>
wolues in ſheepes cloathing, Antichriſts &amp;c. And
the Churches be corrupted by them, robd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured,
both outwardly and inwardly, and become
euen heatheniſh and Antichriſtian. And that theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers
ſhall riſe in the Church of God, and be ſuch as
haue had their outward ordination and ſucceſſion, from
hand to hand (as it were) euen from the Apoſtles.
And that the great Antichriſt himſelfe ſhall ſit in the
holy place, in the temple of God, vpon the holy mount
of the congregation of God, aboue and beſides the
ſtarres of God. What reaſon haue we then to thinke, I
ſay (this being ſo) that the outward calling, or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
which the Elders, and Miniſters of the Church
of England receiued (at firſt) from the Church of
Rome, ſhould make either them, or the Church falſe
and Antichriſtian? It was not the outward ordination,
or ſucceſſion in the offices, and place of the Elders, that
did corrupt any of them before mentioned. (Nay) The
Biſhop of Rome himſelfe, might haue beene Biſhop of
Rome long enough, to this day, to the day of Chriſts
comming in the cloudes of heauen, and haue done his
maſter Chriſt good ſeruice, If he had kept the firſt faith,
If he had liued the firſt life, If he had ſucceſſed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and Elders, (in faith, in doctrine, in exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in patience, in temperance, in meekeneſſe, in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
in loue, in good workes, in feeding the flock
of Chriſt, and giuing them their meate in due ſeaſon)
as he did ſucceed them in outward place; he had then
beene a Scribe well taught in the kingdome of God;
A faithfull Biſhop, an Elder worthy of double honour,
and happy had that flock beene of which he had beene
an ouerſeer, and his maſter at his comming would haue
ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 46.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed be this ſeruant.</hi> But ſeeing he failed in all
theſe things, and did not ſucceed his Elders in this way,
and order of ſucceſſion, (as all their true ſucceſſors to
this day haue euer done) ſeeing his heart was euill and
vnfaithfull, ambitious, couetous, and loued pleaſures
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8177:42"/>
and voluptuouſneſſe more then God; and ſaid in his

            <p>The Church of Rome was once a glorious Church,
not in regard of any ſuch pomp and princely ſtate as ſhe
that now is, ſits in, which (poore virgin) ſhe was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
acquainted with, but in reſpect of the light and
brightneſſe of her faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 8.</note> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, which
(by reaſon of the fruite it did effect and bring forth in
her) ſhined, and made her face to ſhine throughout
the world. She was a ſiſter and daughter of that woman
which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw ſo wonderfully and heauenly deckt and
adorned, and which he deſcribeth, ſaying,<note place="margin">Reuel. 12. 1.</note> 
               <hi>And there
appeared a great wonder in heauen, a woman clothed with
the Sunne, and the Moone vnder her feete, and vpon her head
a crowne of twelue ſtarres:</hi> that is to ſay, ſhe had put on
Chriſt, he dwelt in her heart by faith, ſhe was clothed
with him, his righteouſneſſe couered her nakedneſſe
and all her defects, and made her beautifull within and
without; ſhe had the earth, and all earthly glorie, vnder
her feete, as tranſitorie and vaine; ſhe was mortified to
ſinne, and to the pleaſures thereof; and her ſoules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
was with her Lord in heauen, where he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
and yet remaineth; and her crowne of ſtate,
which ſhe had on her head in thoſe days, was the Lambs
twelue Apoſtles, whoſe doctrine and example of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
were her guide and patterne; and who, as they had
receiued of the Lamb the word of God, ſo they left it
with her, to be her light and leader in the deſart, when
her publique guides ſhould faile her, of which word
of truth (not ſo much the letter, as the ſpirituall true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
thereof) ſhe and her children (her true ſucceſſors)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8177:43"/>
haue been the ſuſtainers and pillars of, to this day.</p>
            <p>This was once (of a truth) the eſtate of the Church
of Rome, as alſo of other Churches elſewhere, but (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las)
it laſted but a while, it fared with her as with the
reſt: for by the bloody perſecution of the great red
Dragon,<note place="margin">Reuel. 12.</note> her outward beautie was defaced; ſhe was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed,
and forced to flie with them into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and then (after a while) when the ſtorme of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
was ouer, and that a calme began to be ſettled,
ſo as ſhe began to conceiue ſome hope of recouering
her firſt eſtate,<note place="margin">Arianiſme.</note> hereſies ſprang vp, and were maintained
with great force, on the one ſide, and carnall ſecuritie
grew on the other; and that iniquitie might be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
according as the Lord had foretold,<note place="margin">Math. 24. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the loue of many
waxed cold.</hi> The myſtery of iniquitie, which began to
worke in the Apoſtles times (they being departed) took
now faſter footing, according to their words, and ſtroue
daily to perfection; and at laſt, he that letted, was taken
away, and the man of ſinne (Antichriſt) was reuealed,
and ſet vp in the throne of the Dragon; and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
religion was by him and his, ſo commanded, and
commixt with the external profeſſion of the name and
religion of Chriſt, as that no man could partake of the
better, but he muſt partake of the worſe. For after that
the Biſhop of Rome had obtained at the Dragons ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
that his Church ſhould be the Mother of all other
Churches, and that all muſt crouch and bend to her,
and that he became Lord and maſter of all; then did he
(among the reſt of his requitals) entertaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ſuch part of the Dragons religion and Church-ſeruice,
as might giue him the beſt content, and moſt
aduance his owne temporall ſtate of glorie. So that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
once obtained the Dragons ſeate, and that all his
heads, hils and hornes were his, he thought he might
now do what he liſt, fell to deſolating of the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 5.</note> and to conſuming of the Saints of the moſt
high (the remnant of the true Spouſe, the children of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8177:43"/>
the woman, before deſcribed,) and pulled downe the
daily and ſpirituall ſacrifice, which they (the ſpirituall
houſe of God) offered vp acceptable to him by Ieſus
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Dan. 9. 27.</note> caſt the truth to the ground, as the Prophet
had foretold of him, brought in and ſet vp the abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
and moſt execrable religion of the heathen,
compounding it, and dignifying the parts, practiſe, and
practiſers of it (the more to delude the world) with the
names and titles of <hi>God, Chriſt, holy Spirit, the word of
God, his holy Church, his worſhip, Seruice, his holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Saints.</hi> And that he might haue all in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
made ſuch lawes, by the aduice of his priuie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
that whoſoeuer would not worſhip the Beaſt and
this image of the Beaſt (the idols and abhominations
of the heathen and pagans) ſhould by the executioners
of his will, be taken and killed. And becauſe he would
be ſure to know his own, and to find out all that would
not ſubmit, cauſed all, both ſmall and great, rich and
poore, free and bond,<note place="margin">Reue. 13. 16, 17</note> to receiue a marke in his right
hand or in his forehead; and that no man might buy
or ſell, ſaue he that had the marke, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now when once things were come to this paſſe, it
was no longer time (for any ſoule that would be ſaued)
to ſtay; and for this cauſe it was, that Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
ſaying,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18. 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of her ſinnes, and that ye receive not of her plagues: for
her ſins haue reached vnto heauen, and God hath remembred
her iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe were the very reaſons, why at the firſt the
Church of England ſeparated from her, and alſo why
ſo many of other nations did forſake her. When <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kliffe,
Huſſe, Tindal, Luther, Cranmer, Latimer,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
forſooke the Church of Rome, and came out of

calling or ordination they had receiued before of
the Church of Rome; but God hauing called them
now, by a more ſpeciall heauenly calling, to preach his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8177:44"/>
truth, they ſtaid not for, neither did they look after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Nay, if they had, the truth might haue lien hid, &amp;
we might haue ſat in darkneſſe vntill this day; but they
finding the approbation of God and his people, It was
enough.</p>
            <p>Let me aske? If God ſhould vouchſafe to call the
Biſhop of Rome, the Pope that now is, and that he
ſhould forſake all thoſe abhominations, which he now
liueth in, and become ſuch a Scribe, Biſhop, or Elder,
as (before) we haue deſcribed; who would condemne
him, or call him Antichriſt, for that he was once the
Pope of Rome, though he had neuer other outward
ordination, more then the approbation of God and his
people, or who would call the people that ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
him, Antichriſtians? doubtleſſe, not any of the
children of wiſdome.</p>
            <p>Agiane, preſuppoſe that the ſtate of all Europe were
now as it hath beene heretofore, all vnder Antichriſt
and his Church; and that God ſhould call one of the
Biſhops of that Church out from them, and in due him
with the knowledge of his truth, by his word &amp; Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that there be a neceſſitie as thou ſaiſt, that he muſt
haue another outward ordination, before he can Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the word of God vnto any people, ſo as to be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
or Elder vnto them; whither wouldeſt thou haue
him to goe for it, or where wilt thou finde an Elderſhip
to ordaine him? In Europe there be none, all are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians.
Wilt thou haue Apoſtles againe, to lay a
new foundation, and muſt they ordaine new Elders
before their can be a true conſtituted Church with her
offices and ordinances, as thou termeſt them? Is this
thy iudgement? It may be, if it be not; Nay, it muſt
be, if thou hold thee to thy former; It hath beene the
opinion of ſome of thy predeceſſors, that held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
as wiſe as thy ſelfe whatſoeuer thou art, as for
inſtance, there were (among others) three Brethren, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Separatiſts from the Church of England, liuing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8177:44"/>
ſometimes in the Cittie of London, their names were
<hi>Legat,</hi> theſe held it ſtifly, that their muſt be new Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
before their could be a true conſtituted Church,
and they drew it from this their ground, the one was
called <hi>Walter Legat,</hi> who about twenty yeares ſince
was drowned, being with one of his brethren waſhing
himſelfe in a riuer, called the Old Foord; Another of
them called <hi>Thomas Legat,</hi> died in Newgate about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares ſince, being laid there for the Hereſie of
<hi>Arius;</hi> The third called <hi>Bartholomew Legat,</hi> was burnt
in Smithfield about ten yeares ſince, being condemned
for the ſame Hereſie of <hi>Arius,</hi> for they all held, and
ſtood ſtoutly for the ſame alſo. Theſe <hi>Legats</hi> had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that their name did (as it were) foreſhew and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
them, to be the new Apoſtles, that muſt doe this
new worke; but you ſee what became of them. There
was alſo one <hi>Iohn Wilkinſon,</hi> another ancient ſtout Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſt,
who with diuers that followed him, held the ſame
likewiſe, drawing it from the ſame ground, as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
conſequence thereof, who alſo came to naught.
But if there be any yet that will needs haue new Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
as no doubt there be; for their carnall contentions
worke ſtill to that point; then let me aske thee, whence
muſt they come? who ſhall ſend them? Chriſt is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
and he doth not now appeare to call, and ſend
any, as he did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> and Apoſtles muſt be
ſuch as come from the preſence of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and haue
ſeene him; For which cauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his Apoſtleſhip,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Haue not I ſeene the Lord? &amp;c.</hi>
And he that was to be in <hi>Iudas</hi> his roome,<note place="margin">Act. 1. 21. 22.</note> muſt be one
that had bin conuerſant with the Apoſtles the time of
Chriſts being then on earth, an eye witnes to publiſh
that which he ſaw and beleeued. So that Apoſtles thou
canſt not vpon any good ground expect.</p>
            <p>If thou ſaiſt, the Church may ordaine n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Elders.</p>
            <p>I aske, whence came that Church? who plant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

can there be an Orchard of fruitfull trees, and was there
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8177:45"/>
not a husbandman that planted it? Can faith be without
preaching? or can there be a Church without faith? If
thou haſt found a true Church, find but out him that
planted it, that firſt preached the word of God vnto it,
whereby it beleeued, and became his Church, thou haſt
found an Elder, feare it not; thou needeſt not make
further enquiry from whence he came, or who ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; he could not doe ſuch a worke, except God
ſent him, though he came from Rome. If thou ſaiſt,
Euangeliſts may preach the Goſpell to the people, and
ordaine Elders, as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did. It is true; but
where be they who ſhall ordaine ſuch, and ſend them
to doe this? Apoſtles we haue none. If thou ſaiſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
may preach,<note place="margin">Luk. 10. 1.</note> as the ſeuentie did &amp;c. I aske ſtill,
who made thoſe diſciples? Didſt thou euer know a
field beare good wheate, that was neuer ſowne? If thou
haſt found good diſciples, doubtles, there was one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that did firſt informe them. So that thou mayſt ſee,
thou art ſtill in the ſame caſe thou wert in, and that of
neceſſitie it will follow, that if there can be no true
Church, till there be a new outward ordination, then
there will neuer be a true Church. Wherefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
againſt thee, and againſt all that are of thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
that as you erre greatly in all your former points,
ſo in this: and as many of the former do agree with the
ancient errors of the Antichriſtian Church of Rome; ſo
doth this; for they deny Gods predeſtination, and
election of ſome particular perſons in Chriſt, to grace
and life, from the foundation of the world, and ſo doe
you; They teach free will, and falling away from the
beſt grace, and that the certaintie of mans ſaluation
doth depend vpon his acts of faith, obedience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
therein, and ſo doe you; They teach that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ordination and ſucceſſion doth make, conſtitute,
and proue a true Church, and ſo ſay you in part, if not
in the whole. That whereas you charge others to be of
Antichriſt and his Church, it is euident, you are more
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8177:45"/>
neerely allied to her, by theſe deceitfull doctrines of
hers, then they can be, with the things ye charge them
with; Nay, they may notwithſtanding be free from
her, when you ſhall by this meanes be found children
of her.</p>
            <p>If outward ordination and ſucceſſion in that kind,
doe make, conſtitute, or be an Argument ſufficient to
to proue a true Church, a Church wherein Chriſt
dwelleth, againſt which the gates of hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
to which Chriſt hath giuen the keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 19.</note> and power to bind and to looſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and to retaine ſins, which is the pillar and ground
of truth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 25.</note> which hath the ſpirit of truth, which Chriſt
promiſed to be with vnto the end of the world; and
that whereſoeuer two or three of them ſhould be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together in my name,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 19.</note> he would be in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt;
(for all theſe treaſures, and many more do belong
to the true Church, which is the body and ſpouſe of
Chriſt;) then the Chuch of Rome hath as good ground
for the proofe, and confirmation of her ſelfe, to be the
ſame true Church, as any Church elſe whatſoeuer;
nay, better ground then any other can ſhew. And
therefore her children (which ſtands for her, and doe
pleade her cauſe) take this to be, and doe vſe it as the
ſtrongeſt and moſt inuincibleſt argument they haue
to proue their Church to be the onely true Church,
this day extant; and that all Churches and Chriſtians,
ought therefore to come vnder her gouernment, to be
taught and nurtured by her, to ſubmit to her counſels,
ordinances, canons, decrees, doctrines of faith, rules for
manners, ceremonies, cenſures, and whatſoeuer ſhe
ſhall impoſe, becauſe what ſuch a Church (which hath
thoſe forenamed priuiledges) ſhall agree vpon, teach
or command, is truth, and may not be queſtioned or
oppoſed,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 28.</note> and therefore it is ſaid, <hi>For it ſeemed good vnto
the holy Ghoſt and to vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we vtterly deny any ſuch ordination or ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8177:46"/>
to make, conſtiture, or to be an argument ſufficient
to proue ſuch a true Church; and affirme, that a Church
may be falſe and Antichriſtian, notwithſtanding the
ſame. For although there be ſuch an ordination and
ſucceſſion, a Church, againſt which the gates of hell
ſhall not preuaile, as the Lord himſelfe declareth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>And vpon this rocke will I build my Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 16. 18.</note> 
               <hi>and the
gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it;</hi> to which all thoſe
former priuiledges do belong, and are to continue with
vnto the end of the world; yet we denie that kinde of
ordination and ſucceſſion to be it, or to haue any of
thoſe priuiledges belonging thereunto, but that it may
be (notwithſtanding) an vtter aduerſary to the true
ſucceſſion, and to all thoſe her treaſures; which wee
proue thus:</p>
            <p>That kind of ordination and ſucceſſion, which haue
oppoſed the word and truth of God, that haue perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and murdered his ſeruants (from time to time) for
the preaching and maintaining of the ſame truth and
word of God, is not (nor can be) that ordination and
ſucceſſion, or church, againſt which the gates of hell
ſhall not preuaile, nor to which any of thoſe treaſures
do belong, but may be an aduerſary both to it &amp; them.
But the outward ordination and ſucceſſion in the
roomes, publique offices and ſeates of the true Elders
and Prieſts of God, (which is the beſt ordination and
ſucceſſion, the Church of Rome that now is, hath, or
can pleade for her ſelfe, and which the ſeparations doe
contend for) haue oppoſed the word and truth of God,
haue perſecuted and killed the ſeruants of God, which
preached and maintained the ſame his word and truth,
and for the ſame cauſe. Therefore the outward ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and ſucceſſion, in the roomes, publique offices
and ſeates of the true Elders and Prieſts of God, is not
(nor can be) that ordination and ſucceſſion, or church,
againſt which the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile, or to
which, any of her priuiledges do belong, but may be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8177:46"/>
an vtter aduerſary both to her and them.</p>
            <p>And that ſuch an ordination and ſucceſſion, as the
Church of Rome and our Separatiſts pleadeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
for, haue done, and may doe all theſe euils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the truth and true ſeruants of God, is euident
by thoſe Prieſts, Elders and Scribes of the Church of
the Iewes, who had their outward ordination and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
from the former Elders and Prieſts, yea from
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſate in their ſeates, and ſupplied
their places, and yet (neuertheleſſe) were the great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppoſers
of Gods word and truth, and the perſecuters
and murderers of the Prophets and righteous men of
God, which preached the ſame his word and truth from
time to time, as Chriſt himſelfe often affirmeth to their
faces,<note place="margin">Math. 21.</note> and foretelleth them in a parable, that they would
be the betrayers and murderers of him alſo, which
ſhortly after came to paſſe.</p>
            <p>And the Church of Rome (for her part) hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
herſelfe in enmitie to the truth, and bloody procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
againſt the maintainers thereof, (for aboue a
thouſand yeares) not onely to equall, but to out-ſtrip
Ieruſalem, and to be euen the perfection and full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
(as it were) of all abhominations &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties,
againſt the truth of God and his Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as Chriſt (by the miniſtery of his Angell vnto his
ſeruant <hi>Iohn</hi>) teſtifieth,<note place="margin">Reuel. 17. 5.</note> where he calleth he, <hi>The Mother
of Harlots and the abhominations of the earth;</hi> and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheweth
how drunke ſhe would be with the blood of
the Saints, and with the Martyrs of Ieſus. And as he laid
to the charge of the Scribes and Phariſees of his time,
the blood of the righteous that had been ſlaine,<note place="margin">Math. 23. 35.</note> from
<hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zecharias;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 18. 24.</note> ſo he chargeth theſe with the blood
of all that euer (for the truth) ſhould be ſlaine vpon the
earth, and with his owne blood alſo, becauſe they and
thoſe that crucified him, are all of one houſe and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
euen from <hi>Cain</hi> to this day, being the right and
true ſucceſſors of one another in euill. So that their
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8177:47"/>
maine argument of ſucceſſion, in the roomes &amp; chaires
of the righteous ſeruants of God, auaileth them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpoſe they aime at, ſeeing this, not only
may be, but is their condition notwithſtanding. For,
as they were not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, which came of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
after the fleſh, nor they (all) Iſrael, that came of
<hi>Iſrael;</hi> and as that was not circumciſion, which was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the fleſh; nor that baptiſme, which waſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
but the filth of the fleſh: ſo neither is that the true
heauenly and ſpirituall ſucceſſion, which is outward,
by an externall ordination and ſucceſſion in the roomes
and ſeates of the righteous ſeruants of God; but the
true and heauenly ſucceſſion (which haue all thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
treaſures belonging to it) is that which Chriſt
hath built vpon the rocke, are they that haue the faith
of <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, euen thoſe

and children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that haue the faith and works
of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and as the circumciſion of the heart, is the
true circumciſion; and as to haue the heart ſanctified
by faith through the Spirit, is to be baptized with the
baptiſme which ſaueth, to put on Chriſt by baptiſme,
and to be a true Chriſtian: ſo likewiſe, to be a true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
or Elder, is to enter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>in by the doore firſt, euen

whereby euery true Paſtor muſt enter, and to be called
and ordained of God, by thoſe heauenly gifts of Chriſt,
whereby they are made able Miniſters of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament;
and then in the ſecond place, to be approued
and iuſtified of his Church and children of wiſedome.
For the calling of a true Miniſter of God, and that
which maketh him ſo to be, is as heauenly and ſpirituall
as that which maketh a true Chriſtian; elſe euery true
Chriſtian had a greater priuiledge then euery true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of Chriſt, which (doubtleſſe) is not ſo, but rather
euery true Miniſter hath a greater; yea ſuch are the gifts
of the Spirit, which Chriſt ſince his aſcenſion hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to his Church, for the adminiſtration of the Goſpel
of peace, that whereas he gaue this teſtimonie of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
that in regard of the gifts of the Spirit, which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him for the adminiſtration of repentance, a greater
Prophet then <hi>Iohn,</hi> was neuer (before him) borne of

            <p>And if yet they alledge for their ſeparation, as their
maner is to doe, That in the Church of England there
be many very ſuperſtitiouſly minded, many vngodly,
proud, couetous and vnclean perſons, both in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

could not truly and ſpiritually partake thereof, ſo long

theſe corinthians were much adicted to their old hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh

Here we ſee by the plain commandement of God, &amp;
exhortation of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that a ſeparation ought to
be made from all kind of Idolatry and vnrighteouſnes
of the heathen, and from all fellowſhip with them in
their vncleane things. But here is no ſeparation from
the Church, though theſe ſuperſtitious Chriſtians were
in it. Nay, it is euident, there was neuer any ſeparation
admitted,<note place="margin">Such as were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, hauing not the Spirit.</note> either by word, or by example, (except by
thoſe that ſeparated themſelues to make ſects, which

pride and wickednes of the Biſhop and Church of

they had brought into the Church the Idolatries and
abhominations of the Pagans, and ſo cunningly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
them, with the name and religion of Chriſt,
that no man could pertake of any good among them,

receiue not of her plagues.</hi> This was not, becauſe there were
many offenders in the Church of Rome, nor becauſe

            <p>Neither was there a ſeparation to be made from the
Church of the Iewes, as bad and as cruell as it was, but

            <p>You are not ignorant (I ſuppoſe) of the manifold
miſchieues that men haue fallen into, by reaſon of the
fleſhly wranglings which haue been in theſe late times,
what confuſion, diuiſion and diſtraction there is among
the people; what and how many ſundry opinions and
ſeuerall ſects there are, yea ſects vpon ſects, diuiſion
vpon diuiſion, error vpon error, hath been bred and
brought forth. Many haue riſen (in theſe latter times)
ſpeaking peruerſe things, to draw diſciples after them,
to get themſelues a name, the diuell deluding them
through pride, vnder pretence of ſome excellent way
of truth, which he makes them beleeue is reuealed vnto
them. As firſt, for the Church of Rome, all the world
ſeeth what confuſion, what fearfull deluſions are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
what multitudes of ſects of new deuiſed orders of
Prieſts,<note place="margin">Note, that theſe ſtriuings are (onely) about formes and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which leade to nothing but contentions.</note> of Friers, each drawing a traine after him; and
now (ſince the light of the truth hath broken forth)
what ſtrange contentions haue beene raiſed in the
Church of God about things of no moment (when
great and weightie matters haue been neglected,) and
what emulations, diuiſions and ſeparations haue bred
thereupon; and then, how after this, people being in
diſtraction, haue runne from one ſect and error to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from ſeparation to ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, diuiding themſelues
into many ſeuerall ſects, to Anabaptiſtry, wherein (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe)
are diuided into fiue or ſix ſundry ſects, each
hatefully condemning other, holding (alſo) many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
errors, ſome to expect new Apoſtles, ſome to
the hereſie of <hi>Arius;</hi> and ſome others (who being, as it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8177:50"/>
were, diſtracted with theſe things) haue fallen to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(the moſt blaſphemous and erronious ſect this day
in the world) commonly called by the name of <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of loue,</hi> whoſe author was one <hi>Henrie Nicolas,</hi> or
<hi>H. N.</hi> for ſo they will haue him called, that is (as they
expound it) <hi>Homo Nouus,</hi> the new man, or <hi>the holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or <hi>holineſſe,</hi> which they make to be Chriſt, and <hi>ſin</hi>
they will haue to be Antichriſt, becauſe it is oppoſite to
Chriſt. They ſay, that when <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, then Chriſt
was killed, and Antichriſt came to liue. They teach, that
the ſame perfection of holineſſe which <hi>Adam</hi> before he
fell, is to be attained here in this life; and affirme, that
all their Family of loue are as perfect and innocent as
he. And that the reſurrection of the dead, ſpoken of
by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. Cor. 15. and this propheſie, <hi>Then
ſhall be fulfilled the ſaying which is written, O death, where is
thy ſting? O graue, where is thy victory?</hi> is fulfilled in them,
and denie all other reſurrection of the body to be after
this life. They will haue this blaſphemer <hi>H. N.</hi> to be the
ſonne of God, Chriſt, which was to come in the end of
the world to iudge the world; and ſay, that the day of
iudgement is already come; and that <hi>H. N.</hi> iudgeth the
world now by his doctrine; ſo that whoſoeuer doth
not obey his Goſpel, ſhall (in time) be rooted out of the
world; and that his Family of loue ſhall inherite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite
the earth for euer, world without end; only (they
ſay) they ſhall die in the bodie, as now men do, and their
ſoules go to heauen, but their poſterities ſhall continue
for euer. This deceiuer deſcribeth eight through brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
of the light (as he termeth them) to haue beene
in eight ſeueral times from <hi>Adam</hi> to the time that now
is, which (as he ſaith) haue each exceeded other; the
ſeuenth he alloweth Ieſus Chriſt to be the publiſher
of, and his light to be the greateſt of all that euer were
before him; and he maketh his owne to be the eighth,
and laſt, and greateſt, and the perfection of all, in and
by which Chriſt is perfected, meaning holineſſe. He
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8177:51"/>
maketh euery one of his Family of loue to be Chriſt,
yea and God, and himſelfe God and Chriſt in a more
excellent maner, ſaying, that he is Godded with God,
and codeified with him, and that God is hominified
with him.</p>
            <p>Theſe horrible blaſphemies, with diuers others, doth
this <hi>H. N.</hi> and his Family teach to be the <hi>euerlaſting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>

14. 6. and himſelfe to be the Angell, yea and the
Archangell which is ſaid to ſound the great and laſt

Church of Rome, and to all her idolatries and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then they do to any Church elſe (whatſoeuer) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
themſelues. They wickedly abuſe theſe words of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 13. 32.</note> 
               <hi>I muſt walke to day and to morrow, and the third day
I ſhall be perfected;</hi> and ſay, that by <hi>to day</hi> is meant the time
of Ieſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and by <hi>to morrow,</hi> all
the time of the religion of the Church of Rome; and by
<hi>the third day,</hi> this their day of <hi>H. N.</hi> and his Family,
wherein they wil haue Chriſt to be perfected. And they
doe compare all the whole religion of the Church of
Rome, to the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> affirming, that as God did
teach his people by thoſe ſhadowes and types till Ieſus
Chriſt came, ſo he hath taught the world (euer ſince)
by the images, ſacrifices, and filthy heatheniſme of the
Church of Rome, till this wretch <hi>H. N.</hi> came, and now
he muſt be the onely chiefe teacher, Gods obedient
man, yea his ſonne, as they blaſphemouſly call him; he
(by his Goſpell) muſt make all perfect. They will out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſubmit to any kind of religion, and to any ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
ſeruice whatſoeuer, pretending it is not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
that can ſinne, but the ſoule. They will be Prieſts
in the Church of Rome, and act their Seruice after their
maner of deuotion; and as Satan can transforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
into an Angell or light, ſo they can thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
(likewiſe) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

they can carry themſelues (being directed thereto by
their Maſter <hi>H. N.</hi>) that yee ſhall hardly (euer) find
them out. They will profeſſe to agree in all points with
the Church of England, as alſo with the Church of

they will not (lightly) deny their Maſter <hi>H. N.</hi> nor
ſpeake euill of him or his writings,<note place="margin">Notes how to diſcouer a Famileſt.</note> if they ſhould be

them, I ſay, to put them to the deniall and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring
of him and his writings, and to pronounce him
a blaſphemer, and his doctrine blaſphemous; this
they will hardly doe, vnleſſe they be not yet his full
diſciples.</p>
            <p>Theſe horrible blaſphemies, &amp; wicked actions (which
I hate to deſcribe) but that I deſire Chriſtians ſhould
take notice of them, and beware) doth this blaſphemer
and his blaſphemous ſect, teach and practiſe. But I
ceaſe, ſighing and ſorowing in my heart, (God doth
know) to ſee that the deuill ſhould worke ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife
now in this laſt time, wherein (I know) God will
haue his truth to proſper, and moſt of all, becauſe many
ſilly ſoules are taken in their ſnares like poore vnwary
birds (in time of winter, when foode is ſcarſe) ſeeking
for releife. Alas, what may be the cauſe of this? Is there
not ſome great fault in thoſe that ſhould giue light to
the world, who ſit in the places of the ſtarres of God.
Doth not their negligence &amp; coldnes driue the people
into theſe extreames? or are the violent courſes, and
carnall contentions of ſome other the cauſe thereof, or
is it both? doubtles, they are both great cauſes thereof,
the diuell being the cheife Author, for there is nothing
that he doth enuie more, then the power of truth and
godlines; if he cannot worke all men aſleepe, by cold
carnall ſecurity, as he doth the moſt, he will (if it be
poſſible) deceiue the reſt by ſome pretended ſtrict way
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8177:52"/>
of truth, for his aime is to deceiue all, he ſpareth none.
O that the watchmen (therefore) would lay theſe
things to heart, and examine themſelues, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of the holy Apoſtles, and rules which they haue
ſet downe, to proue them by? What will it auaile you

you be not eſteemed of the world; nay? what if ye be

for that theſe (with others) are not yet rightly informed
as touching the authoritie of kings &amp; gouernours, what
it is, how far it doth extend, nor yet how far forth

            <p>That kings and rulers, gouernours and magiſtrates,

Chriſtians by faith according to the promiſe in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
though Chriſt was not yet come in the fleſh, they
liued and dyed kings of this world, and true Chriſtians
alſo: and the caſe is not now altered by the comming
of Chriſt in the fleſh, the Goſpell hath not made any
alteration in that reſpect, but doth rather confirme it,
where Chriſt ſaith vnto his diſciples, (who ſtriued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

Luk. 22. 23. 24. 25. 26. (a place which theſe

He doth not here forbid a Chriſtian to be an earthly or

his words do allow both; only he forbiddeth that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ſhould aſpire in their minds, or ſeeke to be great,

            <p>Now, that Kings and Rulers haue lawfull authoritie
from God ouer all perſons, and that all ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
vnto them and their lawes,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
at large, ſaying, <hi>Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the higher
powers: for there is no power but of God; the powers that be,
are ordained of God; whoſoeuer therefore reſiſteth the power,
reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt, ſhall receiue
to themſelues damnation: for rulers are not a terror to good
works, but to the euill; wilt thou not be afraid of the power? do
that which is good, and thou ſhalt hane praiſe of the ſame; for
he is the miniſter of God to thee for good: but if thou do that
which is euill, be afraid, for he beareth not the ſword in vaine,
for he is the miniſter of God, a reuenger to execute wrath vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him that doth euill. Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubiect, not
onely for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake. For, for this cauſe
pay you tribute alſo, for they are Gods miniſters, attending
vpon this very thing. Render therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to all their
due, tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtome to whom cuſtom,
feare to whom feare, honour to whom honour, &amp;c.</hi> By all
which (I ſay) it is euident, that the power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Kings is of God, and ordained by him, yea though
they be infidels; and that it doth extend ouer all, as wel
true Chriſtians as others, Eccleſiaſticall perſons as ciuill,
and that euery ſoule ought to be ſubiect vnto them
and to their lawes and ordinances, euen for conſcience
ſake, (alwayes prouided that they be not oppoſite to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8177:54"/>
the lawes and ordinances of God, and rules of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
though they be not the ſame, but their owne, euen
the ordinances of man, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> termeth them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Submit your ſelues to euery ordinance of man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>for the
Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as ſuperiour, or vnto
gouerners, as vnto them that are ſent by him for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of euill doers, and for the praiſe of them that do wel, &amp;c.</hi>
If then Kings and gouerners (being infidels) haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
from God to make lawes and ordinances, ſuch
as God commandeth not, but are their owne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in reſpect of conſcience towards God (ſome
of them) and might be left vndone, if they were not
by authoritie commanded; and that this is to be done
of euery ſoule, euen for conſcience ſake, and for the
Lords ſake, as the Apoſtles ſpeake; not for conſcience
as touching religion, as if there were any religious vſe
or conſcience that way to be made of them, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of dutie to Kings and gouerners. As touching the
things that God commandeth, and they alſo require,
we ought to obey them, not becauſe the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
them, but becauſe God commandeth them,
and not as mans ordinances, but as Gods. If (I ſay) Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
ought to be thus obedient vnto infidels, (for ſuch
were the Kings where Chriſtians in thoſe days liued,)
much more ought we to be obedient to Chriſtian kings
in the like reſpects, and much more authoritie haue
they to conſtitute and require the lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God according to his word: for their office &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is, not only to ſee their people gouerned and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for, as touching their temporall ſtates, to place offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
(vnder him) ouer them for the ſame purpoſe, but
alſo and chiefly to ſee them prouided for as touching
their eternall eſtates, to plant ouer them faithfull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
to feed their ſoules with the bread of life, and to
roote out and ſuppreſſe ſuch as ſpoile and deuoure the
flock, and ſow hereſies among the people, as haue done
and doe the popiſh prieſts and Ieſuites, theſe Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8177:55"/>
Familiſts and others. And as the dutie of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
King is to place ouer his people faithfull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds:
ſo it belongeth to him alſo to ſee them proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for,<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 4.</note> according to the commandement of the Lord,
which ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the oxe
which treadeth out the corne.</hi> For, to Princes and Rulers,
and ſuch as haue power to muzzle their mouthes and
to ſee them prouided for, doth the Lord ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Thus much briefly touching the authoritie of Kings
and Rulers, how far their power doth extend, and how
far forth Chriſtians are bound to obey and ſubmit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them; and thus it muſt be during the time of this
world, Kings muſt rule (by Gods appointment) ouer
all people, all are bound to obey them in all their lawes
and ordinances which are not oppoſite to the lawes of
God; but if they ſhall command any thing that God
forbiddeth, or forbid anything that God requireth (as
the Antichriſt of Rome, and many heatheniſh Kings &amp;
gouerners, Iews, &amp; ſome profeſſed Chriſtian Kings haue
done) they may not be obeyed, but Chriſtians ought
rather to ſuffer (with patience and meekneſſe) whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they ſhall inflict vpon them, for they are here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to ſuffer. And that there will come a day, in which
all Kings, Princes and powers muſt lay downe their
Crownes and Scepters at the feet of Chriſt, and reſigne
all their power and authoritie to him the King of kings
and Lord of Lords, whoſe right all the kingdomes of
this world are, and that all powers and principalities,
peoples and nations ſhall ſerue and obey him (the moſt
high Lord and King of all) for euer and euer, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
do euidently and often declare, ſo often as would
be too long for me now to recite, onely ſome few I will
mention for proofe thereof. The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
deſcribed the foure great Monarchs which were
to reigne in the earth ouer the inhabitants thereof, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that time to the end of the world, and hauing alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene
the end and deſtruction of them,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 13, 14.</note> ſaith, <hi>I ſaw in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8177:55"/>
the night viſions, and behold, one like the Son of man, came
with the clouds of heauen, and came to the Ancient of dayes,
and they brought him neare before him, and there was giuen
him dominion and glorie, and a kingdome, that all people, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and languages ſhould ſerue him, his dominion is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
dominion which ſhall not paſſe away, and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
that which ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi> This doth he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
explane in the 27 verſe of this Chapter, ſaying,
<hi>And the kingdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 7. 27.</note> 
               <hi>and dominion, and the greatneſſe of the
kingdome vnder the whole heauen, ſhall be giuen to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Saints of the moſt High, whoſe kingdome is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
kingdome, and all dominions ſhall ſerue &amp; obey him.</hi>
As alſo in the interpretation of the dreame of <hi>Nebucad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
(the firſt of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ure Monarchs,<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 44.</note>) after he had
deſcribed the laſt, he ſaith, <hi>And in the dayes of theſe kings
ſhall the God of heauen ſet vp a kingdome which ſhall neuer be
deſtroyed; and the kingdome ſhall not be left for other people,
but it ſhall breake in peeces and conſume all theſe kingdomes,
and it ſhall ſtand for euer.</hi> And againe, ſpeaking of the
reigne of the ſame Monarch,<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 18.</note> he ſaith, <hi>But the Saints of
the moſt High ſhall take the kingdom, and poſſeſſe the kingdom
euen for euer and euer.</hi> By all which the Prophet ſheweth
plainly, that the Stone which was cut out of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
without hands, Chriſt which was to come of the
houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſhould (by the power of the moſt high,
through the word which was to proceed out of his
mouth) breake in peeces, conſume &amp; deſtroy all thoſe
Monarchs which were to reigne in the world; and that
he (the Lord &amp; owner of all) ſhould poſſeſſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and reigne on the earth for euer and euer, world
without end. And that the Saints of the moſt High
(not the carnall Iewes yet remaining, as ſome imagine,
but all his redeemed, from the beginning of the world
to the end) ſhall poſſeſſe the kingdome, and reigne
with him, not in a carnall earthly maner, but in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
eſtate of glorie; not for a time, but for euer &amp; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
beyond all time; and that then &amp; from thenceforth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8177:56"/>
all powers and dominions, people and nations whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
ſhall ſerue and obey him. This in briefe (is that)
which the Prophet intendeth, which (alſo) the reſt of
the holy Prophets foreſaw and foretold of, as Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
teſtifieth, ſaying, <hi>And he ſhall ſend Ieſus Chriſt, which
before was preached vnto you, whom the heauens muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
vntill the time of reſtitution of all things which God
hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets ſince the
world began,</hi> meaning this great reſtitution, which is to
be fulfilled at the ſecond coming of Chriſt in the clouds
of heauen, when the ſeuenth Angell ſhall ſound the
laſt Trump, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying, <hi>And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
Angell ſounded, and there were great voices in heauen,
ſaying, The kingdomes of this world are becom the kingdomes
of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reigne for euer &amp;
euer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 27. 13</note> And that this ſhall not be till the great Trump ſhal
ſound,<note place="margin">Mat 24. 31.</note> mentioned by <hi>Eſaias</hi> the Prophet, by Chriſt in
the Goſpell,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 52.</note> by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians &amp; Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falonians,
by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Reuelation,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4. 16.</note> till Chriſt
ſhall come in the clouds of heauen,<note place="margin">Reu. 10. 7.</note> and that euery eye
ſhall ſee him,<note place="margin">Reu. 11. 15.</note> euen they that pierced him, and that all
the kindreds of the earth ſhall mourne and waile before
him,<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 30.</note> is manifeſt (I ſay) by all thoſe ſeuerall Scriptures,
as alſo by the teſtimonie of the holy Author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,<note place="margin">Reu. 1. 7.</note>
where he ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8</note> 
               <hi>For vnto the Angels hath he not
put in ſubiection the world to come, whereof we ſpeake, but one
in a certaine place teſtified ſaying, What is man, that thou art
mindfull of him? or the ſon of man, that thou viſiteſt him?
thou crownedſt him with glorie &amp; honour, and didſt ſet him
ouer the workes of thy hands, thou haſt put all things in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
vnder his feete, &amp;c.</hi> In which place the Apoſtle
ſheweth cleerly, that it is the world to come, in which
all powers and things ſhall be actually and viſibly ſeene
to be vnder his feet, and all the kingdoms of this world
ſhall be the Fathers and his; then (I ſay) in that world,
not in this,<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 39.</note> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>My kingdom is not of this world,</hi>
then when the laſt enemy is deſtroyed, when this world
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8177:56"/>
ſhall be made another world, according to his promiſe,
then ſhall all powers and principalities,<note place="margin">Eſa. 45. 23.</note> all people and
nations ſerue and obey him; he will no longer be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored
by them, they ſhall not vſe their tongues and
powers then as they liſt, and as they had wont to do, but
all tongues ſhall confeſſe, and euery knee ſhall bow to
him; they that in their life times would not be brought
by the faire meanes of his Goſpel to ſerue &amp; obey him,
ſhall be brought to do it (after death) by paine; yea Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
himſelfe (the author of wickedneſſe, who neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to giue praiſe and honour to God or to Chriſt)
euen he with all his angels and ſpirits of wickedneſſe
(vnder their torments, and by force of the rod of iron,
which Chriſt the King of the whole earth ſhall exerciſe
ouer them in that world) ſhall be compelled, with all
powers, people and kings whatſoeuer, to confeſſe and
bow before him, ſerue and obey him, praiſe and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
him, his iuſtice and mercie for euer. For if at the
name of Ieſus euery knee ſhall bow,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 10, 11.</note> both of things in
heauen, and things in earth, &amp; things vnder the earth,
and that all tongues ſhall confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt is
the Lord, to the glory of God the Father, as the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh; then (doubtleſſe) Satan and his followers are
not exempted, yet euermore vnder torments (as we
haue ſaid.) If Satan and his Angels, or any of the curſed
children of men, which ſhall be condemned and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
for euer with them, ſhould after iudgement
raile againſt God, and blaſpheme him, as ſome do teach
they ſhall; or if they ſhould doe the leaſt miſchiefe (any
kind of way) either againſt Chriſt, or againſt any of his
brethren, the children of God, which ſhall then reigne
for euer with him; how is it then ſaid, that al powers ſhal
ſerue and obey the moſt High? how are all things then
ſubdued to Chriſt, and put vnder his feet? how hath he
looſed the works of the diuell? as the Scriptures ſpeake.
If the laſt enemy be death,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 14.</note> and that death be once ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp in victorie,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 55.</note> and it be fulfilled which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8177:57"/>
               <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O graue, where is thy victory?</hi>
what is the thing then left, that can doe the leaſt euill
againſt God, againſt Chriſt, againſt Sion, or againſt any
of her children which are now redeemed from all thoſe
former captiuities? nay, none ſhall euer hurt or deſtroy
in all that holy mountaine; and for that old Serpent,
vpon his belly ſhall he go, and duſt ſhall be his meate.
When Satan (that Serpent) went firſt about to ſeduce
mankind, by ſowing ſinne (the ſting of death) in his
heart, he aimed not at his owne perpetuall torments,
neither did he intend to come to praiſe &amp; glorifie God
for euer and euer, (as he ſhall one day be compelled to
do) theſe were no part of his thoughts; nay, but his aime
&amp; purpoſe was to bring all men in ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to himſelf,
to do him homage and ſeruice, and ſo to depriue God
of all his honour on earth for euer, that he and his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe
might haue the rule; this was his plot; hee
litle thought of a ſeed to come, to bruiſe his head; nay,
after the Seed was promiſed, he ceaſed not for all this,
but ſtroue ſtill to effect his purpoſe, and he preuailed
much therein, chiefly by preſenting riches, honor, and
the glorie of this world vnto men: ſo that when the
Seed himſelfe (in perſon) came, he ſpared not to tempt
him with the like baites; but he ouercame him, and
hath in part, and ſhall ere long, fully vndoe his whole
plot, and caſt him where he ſhall receiue that which he
aimed not at, and force him to doe that which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
intended: and Sion which had been ſo long deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and waſte, ſhall be ſet vp the praiſe of the whole
earth, and be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſſe and ſafetie
for euer, according to the Prophets. She ſhall be farre
from oppreſſion,<note place="margin">Eſa. 54. 13, 14.</note> for ſhe ſhall not feare; and from terror,
for it ſhall not come neare to her; violence ſhall be no
more heard within her land, nor waſting &amp; deſtruction
within her borders;<note place="margin">Eſa. 60. 14.</note> ſhe ſhal call her walls ſaluation, and
her gates praiſe, her gouernment ſhall be peace, and her
exacters righteouſneſſe; all thoſe that formerly deſpiſed
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8177:57"/>
her, and the ſons of them that did afflict her, ſhall come
bending vnto her,<note place="margin">Reu. 3. 9.</note> and worſhip at the ſoles of her feete,
and ſhall call her, <hi>the Citie of the Lord, Sion of the holy one
of Iſrael;</hi> her Sunne ſhall no more go downe, neither
ſhall her Moone withdraw it ſelfe, for the Lord ſhall be
her euerlaſting light, and the dayes of her mourning
ſhall be ended.</p>
