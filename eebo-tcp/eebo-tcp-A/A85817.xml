            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

intended againſt an Ordinance of Parliament, for aſſeſsing, &amp;c.
ſent to the Preſſe by the Merchant, who

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received your Letter, and the two Books you ſent mee on Saturday laſt by
the laſt Carrier, and have ever ſince imployed my thoughts and beſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
upon them, and in ſumming up to my ſelfe the whole ſtate of the Caſe;
which is truly the ſubject matter of this diſpute. You know, Sir, what obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
I have to you for your care and expence in my education, and for
recommending mee into ſo pious and honourable a Family, and therefore
would not willingly diſſent from you in an Opinion, to which (to my ſorrow) I find you ſo
much wedded; But ſince you require from me to try to perſwade my Father (whom you call
Malignant) to make himſelf a good Example in the City, by freely bringing in the twentieth
part of his eſtate, before the Aſſeſſors fetch it; and to perſwade, and enable mee to perſwade
him to it, you incloſed the Kings Declaration againſt the Ordinance for that Payment, and
an Anſwer (as you are pleaſed to call it, a moſt cleer and convincing one) to that Declaration.
I ſuppoſe you will ſooner excuſe me for giving you my Reaſons, why I cannot obey you, then
for a ſilent ſullen diſobedience. And I differ from you with the more confidence, becauſe it
ſeems by your Letter that I have the Authority of a Father for mee, though I have that of an
Uncle againſt me. Truly Sir, I am ſo much ſatisfied with the Kings Declaration, and ſo little
with the Reply, That I cannot but thinke that the two Houſes did purpoſely avoid replying
themſelves, and turn'd it over to another, as finding their ſide too weak to be mayntained,
and thinking it leſſe diſhonourable to be confuted by Proxy. And that the moſt proper Reply
to ſuch Declarations is to forbid the Printing and publiſhing under paine of Plundering and
Impriſonment. And indeed, if all that hath beene written on both ſides had beene ſuffered
freely, and indifferently (as was required by Juſtice, and deſired by the King) to have beene
communicated to, and examined by the People (to whom the Houſe of Commons had firſt
(and without any preſident) in that way begun to appeal) thoſe Paper-bullets (as hee calls
them) would have killed this War in the wombe, and the ſame People who have beene now
ſeduced into Rebellion, would have kept their Seducers to their. Loyalty, whether they would
or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:158366:2"/>
I ſhall now come to the Reply it ſelfe, in anſwer to which, if I ſhall ſpeake of things that
you may conceive me a ſtranger to, I ſhall deſire you to remember how induſtrious a curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I have ever had to informe my ſelfe fully in all the Queſtions of the Times, how carefully
I ſtudied the Queſtions of Arminianiſme, the point of Ship-money, and the diſputes about
Altar and Table, and then you will not wonder, if in a queſtion which concerned as well the
ſubſiſtence, as the Salvation of all the Subjects of this Kingdom, I have not beene lazie to
ſatisfie my ſelf, as well in Right as in Fact; of which though the latter (by reaſon of my
condition) was harder to me, yet what with my Intereſt in the Gentleman of the Houſe of
Commons who was my Pupill in <hi>Oxford:</hi> What with my acquaintance with ſome <hi>Exeter</hi>
Colledge-men, Chaplains to ſome of the Kings Regiments (men ever till now rather eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Puritans, then Popiſhly affected) and by being often, preſent by their means, where ſome
diſcreet Officers of the Kings have often met; I am confident, I am ſo well inform'd that what
I ſhall ſay is come to mee by very good Conduit pipes, though I had it not from the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p>Mee thinks, if the Authour of this Reply had intended, that his moderation ſhould have
reacht any farther then the Title of his Book he would not in the very firſt lines have confuted
his Title, and ſpoken ſo ſcornfully of a Declaration under His Majeſties Name, as hee doth
in the Phraſe of the Pen, that drops this Declaration, and ſo falſly and maliciouſly as to ſay,
It is fellow to the Tongue which cuts like a ſharpe Raſour; to ſay, that Malignity was the
Whetſtone, and that it cares not though it mangle Truth and goodneſſe: For ſuppoſe, that
his implicit belief in ſome Vote of the Houſe of Commons, as when to free Sir <hi>Henry Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi>
for ſaying in that Houſe upon the reading of a Declaration ſent from the King encloſed
in a Letter ſigned and ſealed by His own Royall Hand and Signet, That hee that made that
Declaration deſerv'd not to be King of <hi>England;</hi> they Voted as if pretending to Inſpiration,
that that Declaration was not the Kings (for you know I was preſent when this was related
to you the ſame night at Supper by a Parliament man.) Suppoſe, I ſay, this confidence in
ſome ſuch new Vote upon this occaſion, ſhould have perſwaded him, that the King did not
wholly endite it Himſelfe; yet ſince He viſibly did allow of, and ſend it, I wonder He ſhould
not conceive it to be as much His, as this very Ordinance is the Act of both Houſes; Since it
is more evident that the Houſes did not write this, then that the King writ not the other, and
that being drawn up by their Command, and publiſhed by their Authority (as the other is by
the Kings) is all that can make it theirs; And yet I believe a Perſon that were brought to the
Bar for uſing the ſame words of their Ordinance, would not be excuſed from breach of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
by anſwering that not the Houſes, but ſome Committee, or particular Member of
them was the Author of it.</p>
            <p>Next the King objects the totall deſtruction of the Liberty and Propriety of all His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
by the impriſonment of their perſons without cauſe, and diſpoſing of their Eſtates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Law: and the Reply acknowledges as much as the Declaration objects, by that full and
ſufficient Anſwer. What have theſe men to doe to talke of fundamentall Laws? It were well
he would have it moved that an Ordinance be made, that the Laws ſhould no more be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of; for doing as they doe, they can get little advantage by ſuch diſcourſes; elſe, that the
King who is ſworne to protect the Law ſhould alone not have leave no name it, were a very
hard caſe. But perhaps the Replyer may defend himſelf by ſaying he imitates onely the Style
of the Pſalmes, why doe the wicked take my Law in their mouth? and follows only the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
Style of all their Sermons, who whatſoever is ſaid of wicked Kings and Perſons, aſſume
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:158366:2"/>
Authority to take it for granted as applyable to the Perſon of our gracious Prince, and of all
thoſe who venture their Lives to aſſiſt and defend Him: for to defend himſelfe hee may well
accuſe his Friends, I am ſure, to defend his Friends, he is no other way able to doe it then by
recrimination upon his Enemies, and for that runs up as high as Loans, Knighthood, and
Ship-mony. His memory is very good concerning thoſe grievances, but very ill to forget by
whoſe iuſt and gracious concurrence we have been caſed both of them, and even of the feare
of the like for the future; and ſure, if any known Authors or Miniſters of thoſe Calamities,
remayn ſtill about His Majeſty to frame His Declarations, it hath been by their negligence,
not by His Majeſties oppoſall of their Remove and Puniſhment. And it is not ſo ſtrange
that His Majeſty upon information, how grievous thoſe preſſures were to His Subjects, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
the introducing of the ſame illegalities, and miſeries under no other colour then of new
names &amp; hath learned Law enough this Parliament to know that the pretence of neceſſity &amp;
<hi>Propterea quod Regnum noſtrum periclitatur,</hi> is no ſufficient cauſe of levying money, either by
Writ or Ordinance; As that this Author will talke of ſuch paſt faults, when there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
then ſuffered by the Subject, which hath not upon the ſame Pretences, but with
leſſe colour, beene ſince acted and exceeded by thoſe, who were called together to eaſe
them from the like ſufferings. But alas, they onely take away mens eſtates in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their Proprietie, and impriſon their perſons in defence of their liberty, and
I believe will ſhortly hang them up to ſave their lives (as they already ſhoot at the King in
his own defence) for he ſays, the Parliament (and by that throughout he means both Houſes)
hath power not onely of liberty and impriſonment, but of life and death. Nor are wee like
to ſtay here, for he ſaith, that the Houſe of Commons alone is truſted with all the eſtates of
the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and conſequently may ſhortly ſave the Lords a labour of joyning
with them in diſpoſing of the eſtates of Commoners. And if they ſhall after pretend (as by
the ſame Right they may) to a power over the lives of the Commoners too, a Member of
ſuch a Houſe in a perpetuall Parliament may get more Revenue and Mayntenance by His
Place, then ever any Penman of his Majeſties Declarations will do by His. The truth is, the
King and Lords both are as much truſted with the Eſtates of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> as
the Houſe of Commons is; neither it without them, nor they without it can diſpoſe of them:
and whatſoever Rights the King hath in Him by the Law, as the choice of Counſellours and
Officers, of Commanders of Forts and Caſtles, and of the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom, and the
like; with them He is truſted by the whole Nation, and neither one nor both Houſes have
any more ſuperiority over that Truſt, then he hath over any Truſt committed to them. Hee
repreſents the people too in what the Law hath left to Him, nor doe they repreſent them in
any thing which the Law hath not truſted to them. But unleſſe ſuch Ordinances be made,
the War cannot be mayntained. I wonder not, that this Argument ſhould appeare a good
one in their Army which lives by War, bus I wonder, it ſhould be ſuſpected likely to prevail
upon the City, which can as little ſubſiſt without Trade, as Trade can continue without
Peace, and which by this War hath been ſo much already diverted, that many yeeres will
ſcarce return it into the former channell. I wonder the Citizens do not conſider, that by this
War their charge increaſes, whileſt their gettings diminiſh: That their Train-bands are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſuſpected (and perhaps will ſhortly be diſarm'd and plundered too) and the City awed
by <hi>Red-coats.</hi> That for this War the twentieth part of their eſtates is voted away, and Aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
moſt of one Faction appointed, who may call nineteene parts the twentieth; That they
are (under that terrour) impriſoned, upon grounds upon which no man ſhould be impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:158366:3"/>
and impriſoned by perſons who ought to impriſon no body; (for ſuppoſe both Houſes
had an Arbitrary power over their goods and liberties, they never claimed any till now by
Ordinance, or otherwiſe, to transfer that power to a Committee; which yet is daily acted
by them without reporting to the Houſes) and this ſlavery is onely evaded by ſaying, it
is thus farre a voluntary ſlavery, that they may free their perſons if they will by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Contribution, and that it is done to fright them from a perpetuall ſlavery:
And truly, the Kings, Attourney had no great invention, if hee could not have found the
ſame Anſwer to juſtifie all the Impriſonments for Ship-money, Knighting-money, Coat
and Conduct-money, &amp;c. to have been both voluntary and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Nor is this reaſon of mayntaining the War any better as to the leg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll, then as to the pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
part. The King (who hath power of making War and Peace, which both Houſes, how
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ll and free ſoever they are, have not) in never ſo juſt and neceſſary a War hath no legall
power to leavy money to mayntain it, without conſent in Parliament. But this War for
which this Ordinance is made, is not onely as illegall as the Ordinance it ſelf, (I can make
no greater expreſſion) but it is as ungrounded as it is illegall. They firſt make a neceſſity,
that they may make a War; and then root up liberty and property, that they may continue
it: Schiſme, Pride, Faction, and Ambition, were the onely grounds; Feares and Jealouſies
were the onely pretences; and Miſery, Slavery, and Deſolation, are the onely effects, of that
which now to petition againſt is become a crime.</p>
            <p>And if I make this appeare to you, I doubt not, Sir, but you will then confeſſe, that not
onely theſe illegall proceedings of theirs are not juſtified by the War, but that even the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
preſſures to which they have neceſſitated the King; (what Taxe ſoever He can have
laid upon <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> or my Lord of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Yorkeſhire,</hi> or Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi>
upon the Weſt) are to be imputed to the beginners of this Warre; and that both
the plundring of Maſter <hi>Speaker</hi> of his Wine and his Battelaxe, and the plundering of
<hi>Braineford,</hi> (which though it were done to a Towne taken by aſſault, yet for want of other
inſtances is twice repeated) and the danger of <hi>London</hi> (which hee ſayes was as neare to the
ſtate of <hi>Braineford,</hi> as <hi>Braineford</hi> is to <hi>London</hi>) is to be charg'd upon the ſame ſcore. Let us
conſider the beginning of theſe diſtractions. When with ſo much difficulty, by ſo few voyces,
that unexampled Declaration of the houſe of Commons had been ſpread among the people,
which incited them againſt the eſtabliſht Lawes, and againſt the houſe of Lords, which
would not alter what was eſtabliſht<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when the people, giving credit to their information,
that there was no hope of happineſſe for them without their concurrence, had (to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Parliaments, and with the breach of the higheſt priviledges of that moſt honourable
Court) come downe in Tumults to make them concurre; and by affronting and injuring
ſome of the Members of both houſes, ſo awed the reſt, that the Army, if it had really beene
brought up to <hi>London,</hi> could have done no more (though a meere diſcourſe concerning that
was voted to be Treaſon.) When all theſe Tumults (of which I ſpeake the more knowingly,
becauſe I was then by accident in the court of Requeſts when the Rabble came up, and heard,
no Biſhops, no Biſhops, cryed with that animoſity and violence, that it rings ſtill in my eares;
and ſaw Sir <hi>John Strangewayes</hi> threatned as their enemy; and one (I think they called him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Killigrew</hi>) laid hands on, and ſo much feare in the faces of ſome other Members, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
they hardly knew what they voted in a weeke after, and the next day ſaw <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
Abby aſſaulted by the ſame Rabble) when theſe Tumults were not onely not puniſht,
nor the Authors enquired after nor ſo much as the complaints of the particular Members
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:158366:3"/>
conſidered, but the Lords were twice refuſed to be joyn'd with in a Declaration againſt the
like for the future, And this Rabble commended and ſtiled their friends by the moſt eminent
Members in that Houſe: When Juſtice <hi>Long</hi> was committed by the Houſe of Commons for
obeying a writ ſent by direction of the Lords Houſe, and ſending a watch to guard them, and
the Sheriffe forbid by the ſame Houſe to proceed legally againſt a Riot in <hi>Southwarke,</hi> When
this countenance to Riots, and diſcountenance of Law had made Tumults ordinary and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
even at the Gates of <hi>White-hall</hi> and occaſioned that accuſation of the Lord <hi>Kimbolion;</hi> and
the five Members which hath been ſince five hundred times repeated as the principall ground
of Jealouſie, (though they were accuſed in ſo legall a manner, as had beene formerly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Houſe of Peeres in the Earle of <hi>Briſtols</hi> Caſe: and though the King offered them ſo
much ſatisfaction for it, that any private Chriſtian that ſhould refuſe to receive it from his
equall, were in no caſe to receive the communion.) Who ever after that ſaw the great Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
of armed men in <hi>London,</hi> and the multitudes of people every day flocking to them from
ſeverall Countries, and the low condition the King then was in, removing from place to
place, without the convenience of ordinary Accommodation, (ſome of His ſervants leaving
Him, and others refuſing to attend him) could not beleeve that He could then give them ſuch
a Terror, as no leſſe then all the Caſtles and Forts of the Kingdome, and the ſole diſpoſall of
the whole <hi>Militia</hi> could give them ſecurity enough againſt Him, who had not with, or neare
Him, money enough to pay a man, nor powder enough to kill a bird; and could never have
arrived at ſuch a condition, as to be able to raiſe an Army, if the violence which hath beene
ſince offered Him had not aſiſted Him. Nor were the Lords then ſo affraid of the King, or
yet ſo afraid of the people, as to demand ſo unreaſonable ſecurity; ſo that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
having twice in vaine attempted their conſent, were faine to aske it of His Majeſtie
alone. But when after the uſuall <hi>Satellites</hi> came up to them with a Petition, ſeconded and
countenanc't by the Houſe of Commons, demanding thoſe Lords names who refuſed to joyne;
This Eloquence prevailed, or rather this <hi>Militia</hi> made the other paſſe; and in a few dayes
(the King granting moſt, but not all they askt) the Lords (who were unwilling to put the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to the trouble of comm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng again) joyned in Declaring (and were as good as their words)
that if the King would not conſent, they would put the <hi>Militia</hi> in execution without Him.
Thus illegally was that Ordinance paſt both Houſes, which would have been moſt illegall,
however it had paſt. Thus was the Kings higheſt Right, His Negative voyce, and in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
point (which alone enabled Him to defend the reſt) forced from him. Thus was <hi>England</hi>
put in Armes without his conſent, whoſe Commiſſion onely could legally warrant the leaſt
Aſſembly in that kinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a few Officers by his command in a peaceable manner, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him at <hi>Kingſtone</hi> for his ſecurity, was voted leavying of warre againſt himſelfe; and
this was the firſt beginning of this neceſſary warre, which now muſt make all things lawfull
in order to that neceſſity: Whileſt the King preſſes ſtill his Meſſage of the 20. of <hi>January,</hi> that
he may but know what they would have, and is not thought worthy of an Anſwer. But to
juſtifie their actions by their feares, Armies are daily threatned from beyond-Sea, (though
they have laine wind-bound ever ſince) becauſe all the world ſaw he had nothing in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
he could fright them with; but ſtill the lower he was, the higher they grew; and the
more they contemne him, the more they feare him: Nothing that he can doe will ſatisfie
them; Nothing that he can ſay ſhall ſatisfie the people, for they ſhall not be ſuffered to ſee
it. Care is taken by order to the ſeverall Burgeſſes, That all the Townes of <hi>England</hi> muſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:158366:4"/>
hear of his comming to the houſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons; and that in a manner in which he did no te<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me.
But his ſorrow that he hath by this brok any Priviledge, his offers of ſatisfaction for it, and his
Reſolution both to obſerve &amp; defend them all for the future; If this be printed and offered to be
publiſht, his Secretary muſt be queſtioned for ſending it to the Sheriffs by his Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and the Sheriffs forbid to publiſh it according to the Kings own Warrant, and ſent for
as Delinquents if they do. Would he have my Lord of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> command his Town? he muſt
not. Would he not have Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> command it? he muſt. Dares he not come to <hi>London?</hi>
He muſt. Would he be wayted on in the Countrey by his meniall ſervants? he muſt not. Will
he not chooſe ſuch Officers and Counſellors as they will name, and diſplace ſuch evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
as they cannot name? Then the prevalency of the Malignant Party is cryed out upon;
his not encountring Colonell <hi>Burges</hi> and Captaine <hi>Venne</hi> in the head of their <hi>Mermidens,</hi> is
called deſerting his Parliament: The Rebellion of <hi>Ireland</hi> (which he had diſarmed himſelfe
to reſiſt) is laid to his charge, and his offer to venture his Royall Perſon againſt the Rebels
there, is voted to be an encouragement to that Rebellion. If he deny or delay any thing they
aske, though never ſo much in his power to grant or deny, a new Vote paſſes upon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers,
of being enemies to the State; and (having once found that Word to have great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the people) whatſoever he ſayes or does, he cannot but breake their Priviledges;
and whatſoever they ſay or doe, they cannot breake his. And indeed their obſerving no Rule
at all in their Votes, and the peoples readineſſe to obſerve all their Votes as a Rule, had ſo
hared him and all his ſervants, that I had rather be not onely Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> or Maſter <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
but Maſter <hi>Cromwell</hi> or Maſter <hi>Pury,</hi> then King of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Jre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in ſo ſad and diſtracted a condition. And I wonder not, when they asked him his
Crowne in the Nineteene Propoſitions, that they thought they had made him weary enough
of it, to part with it for asking. Still the <hi>Militia</hi> is every where preſs't and Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi>
having before pretended to keepe <hi>Hull</hi> for the King, now keepes the King out of <hi>Hull,</hi> though
he offered to enter but with twenty ſervants; he is juſtified in it by the houſes, and the houſes
ſlander themſelves that they may juſtifie him, and acknowledge a direction they never gave.
Upon this he takes to himſelfe a much ſmaller Guard then they had daily kept together ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moneths at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> This is voted an intention to leavy Warre againſt his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Sheriffes are ordered to ſuppreſſe it. All this while (to prepare the people to
ſuffer any wrong to be offered the King) the Preſſes and the Pulpits (the two ſeed-plots of
this Warre) had ſwarmed daily with ſlanderous Invectives againſt his Majeſtie: (beſides
Declarations of a ſtrange nature.) And if any grave pious Miniſter did write, preach, ſpeake,
or almoſt thinke for the King, he was accuſed by the factious part of his Pariſh before the
Committee for ſcandalous Miniſters, and their meere receiving and countenancing of ſuch
an Accuſation, (though their leiſure would not admit him to cleare himſelfe before them)
was enough to blaſt him with the people.</p>
            <p>After this, all that could be taken of the Kings, or any of His Friends, Armes, Goods, Ships,
any thing is good prize; and (as if the Maxime were inverted, and He now could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no wrong, who was wont He could doe none) they proceed really againſt Him (though
in pure civility they pas't no ſuch Vote upon Him) as an enemy to the State. And at laſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
protected all Delinquents againſt Him and the known Law, and voted all Delinquents
who had refuſed to become ſo by ſubmitting to their illegall commands: Though the King
had for His Guard onely one Regiment of the <hi>Yorkeſhire</hi> Trained-bands, and one Troope of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:158366:4"/>
Horſe, Voluntiers, of the Gentlemen of that Country, And though the King never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
any man, till Sir <hi>John Hotham</hi> was denyed to be brought to a legall tryall; yet an
Army is voted to be raiſed to defend them from the King and His Cavaliers, and to
fetch up his Majeſty and His fellow Delinquents. Yet to this Vote his Majeſtie oppoſes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
His owne Declaration, and that of the Lords with Him, (who ſaw beſt what was done
towards it, being upon the place) that he had no ſuch intention as was pretended; and till
contributions were raiſed to raiſe men, He deſired no contribution to be prepared by His
friends for him; and till they had leavyed men, and muſtered them in ſome number, He gave
not out ſo much as one Commiſſion to leavie a man; But then (not thinking it needfull to
ſtay till my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſhould come and take Him <hi>En Cuerpo,</hi> that hee might ſatisfie the
world how defenſive the Warre was on His part) He grants out Commiſſions, but then
grant not any to any Papiſts; and takes all poſſible care, and gives all poſſible Orders, that
they entertaine no Souldiers of that Religion; yet theſe men (who well may couple Peace
and Truth together, for their actions and words have a long time ſhewed that they love them
alike) charge him to the people in daily Declarations with raiſing an Army of Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Parliament; which makes it the leſſe ſtrange, if his Majeſtie ſince confented to
have the aſſiſtance of ſome Papiſts, (for they are not ſo many as you thinke for) ſince Hee
ſaw that without their aſſiſtance He could not avoyd all the ſcandall, which having it could
produce, eſpecially ſince He ſaw many of that Religion were entertained in their Army;
(having taken at <hi>Edge-hill</hi> ſeverall <hi>Wallons, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> of that Religion, who confeſſe
of many more:) And ſince He ſaw a great part of the reſt to conſiſt of another kinde of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants,
which by the Law of this Kingdome not onely ought not to be armed in it, but not
toremaine in it at all. Well, his Majeſtie is come to <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

it ſelfe, Hee ſent twice to deſire it (I had almoſt ſaid to petition for it) from both
Houſes: How it was received all the world knowes. After this he meets them, Hee fights
with them, hee beats them, (of which the ſuffering their Ordnance to be taken away next

<hi>London</hi> themſelves in ſtead of bringing the King up thither, was ſo g<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

to their Petition at <hi>Colebrooke,</hi> then they had done to his Meſſage from <hi>Nottingham.</hi>
VYhileſt the Committee was with Him there, part of their Army marcheth out of <hi>London;</hi>
That Hee might not be incloſed on all ſides, hee marches to prepoſſeſſe <hi>Brain<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ford,</hi> (but at
the inſtant ſends word of His march, and the reaſon of it to the Houſes) He found them there,
he beats them out; And if His intention had been to have marcht on and ſacked <hi>London,</hi>
what altered that intention? Could He thinke himſelfe ſo much weaker by the loſſe of ten
men, or them ſo much ſtronger by the loſſe of two of their beſt Regiments, beſides their loſſe
by water, as for that reaſon to change his minde? No: Aſſoone as He found <hi>Kingſtone</hi> quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
behind Him before any approach or notice of any Forces of theirs, hee gives orders to
march away. Hee againe and againe repeats his deſire of Peace, which is ſo farre from being
accepted, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Petitioners are threatned, hurt, and impriſoned, for deſiring it too,
and a <hi>Scots</hi> Army is invited to continue the VVarre. But I hope our brethren will remember
that thoſe againſt whom they are called, have paid and are to pay them more of the brotherly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:158366:5"/>
aſſiſtance then thoſe that call them; and theſe men will finde themſelves as much de received in
their hopes of their owne forraigne Forces, as they were in their feare of the Kings, and that
the <hi>Scots</hi> will ſtay till the <hi>Danes</hi> come.</p>
            <p>To ſumme up this point, If to take away by force all the others juſt Rights, be to begin the
VVarre, his Majeſtie is not the Aggreſſor: If to have a Guard firſt be the beginning of the
VVarre, (as the Replyer pretends) certainly this Warre began at <hi>London,</hi> and not at <hi>Yorke;</hi>
the firſt being raiſed by the power of a Committee, upon ſome thing (which after came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
fetcht as farre off as <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> If the raiſing men firſt by Commiſſions were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
it, it was begun there too: If the denying of Delinquents to be legally tryed were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
it, <hi>London</hi> was the place, and Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> the per on, where and for whom it was firſt
begun: If the eagerneſſe of continuing can ſhew who begun it, does not this Averſion from
Peace declare ſufficiently that they begun the VVarre, who now ſo carefully nurſe their owne
childe? And I ſuppoſe no indifferent perſon can thinke theſe viſible Arguments confuted by
the Replyers wonder, and his onely Arguments in the Reply to the contrary; which are a tale
of a Papiſt in <hi>Yorke,</hi> that ſhould ſay, <hi>Let the ſword try it;</hi> (when it were little to any other
purpoſe whether a Papiſt had ſaid ſo, then to ſhew by the Kings backwardneſſe to follow this
Counſell, that the Counſels of Papiſts were more prevalent with the Parliament; then with
Him;) And of Sir <hi>Francis Wortley</hi>'s drawing his ſword, and ſaying, <hi>VVho is for the King?</hi>
VVhen it is well knowne at <hi>Yorke,</hi> that this was not ſaid at all by him: and that what was
ſaid and done, was to a very Different end: But indeed upon ſuch an information upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,
(which Mr <hi>Ruſhworth</hi> brought from <hi>Yorke</hi> in ſhort hand) Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was likely to have
been accuſed of high Treaſon, but it being put off for that time, the truth was diſcovered, the
Relater was aſhamed, and Sir <hi>Francis Wortley</hi> never further accuſed for it.</p>
            <p>Yet as little as he can ſay to prove the War begun on the Kings part, and as much as is ſaid
to prove the contrary, he hath the face to compare the Kings making Warre upon his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>Sauls</hi> hunting of <hi>David,</hi> and that, as if the caſe were ſo exactly the ſame, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but not having heard of the Bible could make us not know it. You took, I thank you Sir,
very early care, that I ſhould not be unacquainted with the Booke he ſpeakes of, and I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not (knowing it ſo well as I doe) that he ſhould be better able to juſtifie this Rebellion
(though this caſe too differs wholly from that there quoted) out of <hi>Bodine,</hi> then out of the
Bible. A Popiſh Author is fitteſt to juſtifie, that which hath been raiſed out of Popiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
But to returne to <hi>David;</hi> had he ever given <hi>Saul</hi> any cauſe to feare him by ſpreading
Declarations, or raiſing and encouraging <hi>Tumults,</hi> againſt him and the eſtabliſhed Lawes?
Had he nothing to make him apprehend <hi>Saul,</hi> but meere feares and Jealouſies? Did <hi>Saul</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
him with an Impeachment, or with a Javelin? And did hee ever offer after to quit him
by a Bill? Did <hi>David</hi> upon his Apprehenſion ſeize the Citadell in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and keep <hi>Saul</hi>
out with armed men? Did he ſeize his Armes, Goods, and Ships, and then juſtifie the ſeiſure
by ſaying, Hee tooke from him not the Property, but the miſchiefe? or fly into a remote Cave
for ſecurity? Did he invade <hi>Sauls</hi> Priviledges, and deny him a Negative voyce? Did he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to command the <hi>Militia</hi> of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> without <hi>Sauls</hi> conſent? Did he ever demand from
him ſuch nineteene Propoſitions, as the onely way to compoſe differences betweene
them? Did hee raiſe an Armie to fetch thoſe Evill Counſellours from about <hi>Saul</hi> who had
perſwaded him to ſeeke his life? Did hee purſue him with it, and give him battaile, and
then charge the malignant Party about him, for going about to deſtroy him, by bringing him

            <p>Yet, Sir: I charge not the Parliament with this. The replier thinks not ſo well of, and
wiſhes not ſo well to that honourable Aſſembly, as I doe: Nothing offends me more in
the preſent Actions of the remaining part of the Parliament, then that by them they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
thoſe who wiſh Parliaments but ill, with Arguments to infuſe into Princes an il O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of Parliaments, and furniſh Princes with principles which with more pretence
may be applied by them to the Deſtruction of their Subjects. Parliaments are indeed
the Root of our propriety, and their genuine Priviledges are the Roote of Parliaments.
But the Parliament conſiſts of three eſtates, and for any two to deny the third his juſt
Rights and Priviledges, and for one, or both, or a part of both or either, a Committee,
to uſurpe the rights and Priviledges which belong onely to the whole three, is the way
to root up both priviledges, Property, Parliaments, and all; and to make the People more
weary of their Phyſitians, then they were before of their diſeaſes. Who knowes not that
the Houſe of commons conſiſts of neere five hundred Members, and that uſually foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
is now counted a full Houſe, and that of at any time they make one hundred and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(as for a rare inſtance, the replier tels us of once or twice, and that onely by report)
it is when the military Members are ſent for up from the Army to pay their gratitude to
their new profeſſion by oppoſing of Peace? And that many of thoſe, who are preſent
do not beleeve themſelves ſecured by their Army, though they are too much frighted to
dare to complaine of feare? And can it be thought that ſo many perſons of Honour, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their country, would be abſent from the ſervice of it, if they thought the worke now
in hand ſo neceſſary to the publique defence of Religion, Lawes, Liberty, Property, and
Parliaments, and that the higheſt ſervice they could doe them were to countenance the
preſent cauſe with a full Houſe, as they muſt do, if they were of the ſame opinions with
the remaining Partie? and on the other ſide, if they be confeſſed to be of contrary opinions
can it be thought, that ſo many as are able to make up a major part (for that is moſt true

            <p>Tueſday the 17. of this Month was that luckie day in which the lading of theſe ſhips

The place deſigned for this great triall, was in the middle way betwixt <hi>Leſtithell</hi> &amp; 
<hi>Bodwin,</hi> where they might meet on equall termes, and ſo fight it out. Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> who
knew his owne advantages, did willingly accept of the invitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and very early on

enemies on a little hill upon the brow whereof he had planted ſix good peice of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,

were not held conſiderable. What his whole number was is not yet made knowne. The
Army of the enemy conſiſted of 4000 men, conducted by a man much ſpoken of for his
abilities in the art of war, and one thought himſelfe much wronged in that he had ſo

although it be not known at how deare a price, His Majeſties Army bought ſo great a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
yet it is hoped that it was purchaſed at an eaſie rate, becauſe there is no mention in

of any loſſe that did befall them: Not that wee thinke ſo great a victory could be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

but that the loſſe was inconſiderable both for the number and quality of thoſe happy ſoules
who gladly ſacrificed their lives for their King and Country. The like ſucceſſe God ſend
His Majeſtie in His enterpriſes, til theſe diſturbers of his peace be all rooted out. And
that no hand be left to hold a ſword againſt HIM.</p>
