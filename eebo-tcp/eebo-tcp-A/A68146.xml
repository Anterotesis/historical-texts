            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This text is ſhort, but ſweete and weighty, as the ſunne in heauen ſeemeth little, but is great and mighty in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: all bodies die without the ſunne, and all ſoules and bodies periſh without the effect of this Scripture. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers thinke, that the ſunne and a man maketh a man, but diuine philoſophy wil thinke &amp; ſpeake and conclude, that this ſonne of God, the ſunne and light of mankind, maketh and ſaueth and crowneth man with glory, in that he wipeth out and waſheth away the ſinne of the world: the ſunne is the hart of heauen, the captaine of the ſtars, the eye of the world: this worde is the hart of the Bible, the cheefe of al words, to which our eares muſt giue eare, and on which our eyes muſt alwaies looke. For in this verſe are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained, the lawes of Moſes and Iſraël with the prophecies of all prophets both great and ſmall, in that <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth Ieſus <hi>the lambe of God,</hi> and the fruit of the new Teſtament both in the Euangeliſts &amp; Apoſtles ſpringeth and groweth from this ground, in that he is ſaid, to <hi>take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſinne of the world.</hi> Then was <hi>Simplicius</hi> but a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh iudge, to count the tales of Aegypt and the tables of Moſes alike; and <hi>Galen</hi> was but a prophane humoriſt, and <hi>Lacuna</hi> his ſhadow little better, to miſlike the creation of man, and miſreport the wonders of the red ſea ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: then are the Pelagians peruerſe and miſerable diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which denie and euacuate the baptiſme of infants,

And this in effect is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſumme and chiefe purpoſe of this text. <hi>Of the ioyfull eſtate of the godly by ſeing Chriſt,</hi> and, <hi>The wofull fall of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by turning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</hi> Now to proceede in the playner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of euery portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and particularity of this verſe, we ſee in it both a briefe Hiſtory, and a bleſſed Doctrine. The Hiſtory is, that when <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw Ieſus comming to him, he gaue out among the people his iudgement of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the doctrine is his iudgement, that Chriſt is the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſinne of all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of al maides and children, of all babes and ſucklings, which are all ſaued by grace, by mercy and imputation. Concerning the parts of the hiſtory and narration, they are deliuered in three circumſtances: the time when, the place where, the perſons by whom, and to whom, and of whom this ſentence is giuen. The time is the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Inquiſitors of the Phariſees had bene queſtioning and arguing with Iohn-baptiſt. The place is Bethabara beſide Iordan, where Iohn baptized. The perſon which gaue this holy verdict and ripe iudgement is the Baptiſt, ſo named of baptizing, who ſpeaketh to the people &amp; his diſciples which were at his baptiſme, that they may learne how to thinke truly and ſpeake vprightly of Ieſus Chriſt.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17887:8"/>
As for the braunches of the doctrine, it containeth both the humanity of Chriſt and his diuinity: his humanity appeareth by the title and appellation of a Lambe, which is viſible and corporall: his diuinitie is ſignified by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and office of this propitiatory and ſatisfactory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſinne, which is an inuiſible and ſpirituall ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction conceiued onely by faith and loue. And of theſe two partes, the one hiſtoricall, the other doctrinall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the reall true matter and eſſential ſubſtance of this text.</p>
            <p>To returne to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of the time, ſome make it vncertaine and indefinite, and read thus: <hi>On a certaine day,</hi> or thus, <hi>Another day,</hi> and becauſe they would ſeeme to be ſharply eyed and miſtically conceited, they paraphraze and gloze vpon it in this order: <hi>Iohn ſignifieth gracious or penitent, as if he were Ioänan, who in reſpect of his gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce and repentant grace may rightly be ſaide, not to haue ſeene the face of Chriſt the firſt day, but the day following his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is turned into comfort, and he looketh vp and ſeeth his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing health comming vnto him,</hi> and then, <hi>the former day</hi> with them ſhal be the <hi>old lawe,</hi> when Chriſt was abſent, <hi>the next day</hi> muſt be the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> where Chriſt is both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and corporally preſent. Thus it pleaſeth thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal and tropological ſcholemen, <hi>Nicolaus Lyra, Hugo Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalis, Guilielmus Minatenſis,</hi> and the reſt of that ſect, to do what they liſt, without asking leaue of Gods worde, the onely and chiefe ſquare and touchſtone of all Diuinitie. Alas what vaine conceits &amp; friuolous imaginations haue bene grounded and builded vpon ſuch diſguiſed allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and tropologicall conſtructions, ſo farre fet and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extorted, as a man may ſophiſtically infer <hi>Quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> or hypocritically intrude <hi>quid pro quo.</hi> God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſuch fond, abſurde and ridiculous allegorizing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17887:8"/>
hath bene too highly eſteemed &amp; egerly haunted in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, but now in ſuch light of the text, ſuch darknes of the gloſſe is at laſt worne out with the wiſeſt and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt, God be praiſed; ſuch double taking of ſimple mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſuch allegorizing without cauſe, ſuch moralizing without effect, ſuch tropologicall &amp; ſcholaſticall daliance is worthily aboliſhed. Hiſtories are hiſtories and muſt haue an hiſtorical interpretation, allegories are but tropes of Rhetorick and continued metaphors, and muſt not be vnnaturally forced or vnſatiably conceiued, but onely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially and morally reſolued, where they are artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and morally applied. Herein it ſhall be no audacitie in mee, but lawfull mediocrity, to diſſent from <hi>Hyperius</hi> a man about my age, when he writ his booke <hi>De Theologo,</hi> where he giueth a <hi>ſupereſt</hi> of the vſe of allegories. <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 32. To allegorize when the text allegorizeth, leaſt we ſpeake vainely and from the purpoſe, which he termeth <hi>neceſsity</hi> that cannot be hindered, this no man of iudgement euer doubted, or when the doctrine ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be profitable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allegorizing, which is all one with the firſt, or not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in that example which he citeth.

            <p>To leaue this common place of compariſons, the ſecond proofe and groundworke may be ſquared and faſtned in this ſort: That the Prophetes word foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, which is Gods owne word, when it proueth true, muſt be reuerenced as the trueth: for God is only true, and in him is no maner or ſhadow of falſhode. But the Prophets word foretelleth which is Gods owne word, that the Meſſias ſhall come within a time appointed, &amp; this proueth true: for <hi>Daniel c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. writeth thus: After 69. weekes, that is, 483. yeares, the Meſſias ſhal be cut off; reckoning a week not of ſeuen daies, but of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares, as it is vſed in <hi>Geneſis, c.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 27. and in <hi>Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi> more plainly, <hi>c.</hi> 25. <hi>v.</hi> 8. in which time thus definite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appointed, &amp; ſhortly after, Chriſt came in the fleſh, and liued &amp; died in the fleſh, as is eaſily proued in this or the like computation: from the ſecond yeare of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Longimanus,</hi> when the kings commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t went forth, to bring againe the people, and to buylde Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>Eſdras c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Agge. c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 1. to the beginning of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Monarchie were 144. yeares, according to the account of <hi>Metaſthenes</hi> the Perſian: &amp; from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Alexanders</hi> raigne to the incarnation of

            <p>Now followeth the doctrine, which the wicked heare and marke not, or if they marke it, they ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, if they remember the word, it taketh no roote in their hearts, or if it be rooted, it rotteth and withereth at the laſt, and ſcarcely bringeth foorth the leaſt tokens of regeneration, but geueth leaues and no fruite, and is therefore curſed with Chriſtes owne curſe, as the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree was curſed for bearing no figges, <hi>Marke. c.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 21.

            <p>Thus the firſt and principall cauſes of our deliuery are iuſt and lawfull in Chriſt, as the meanes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current cauſes are allowable in our ſelues, according to S. <hi>Chryſostomes</hi> collection, That our ſinnes are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by confeſſing them to God; <hi>Eſay c.</hi> 44. <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. by forgiuing iniuries to men; <hi>Math. c.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 14. by almes and liberality; <hi>Dan. c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 24. by continuall praier; <hi>Iam. c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 16. by faſting and turning vnto God; <hi>Ioel. c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 18. Yet theſe are but apprehenſiue and declaratiue cauſes of our iuſtifying and ſanctifying, and Chriſt alone is the conſummatiue and perfectiue cauſe of all, as a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned writer diſtinguiſheth briefly and ſubtilly, becauſe he is ſufficient, and <hi>our goodneſſe but ſtraw without him, as</hi> Luther <hi>termeth it, for ſo I may best take that word</hi> Strami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neam, <hi>which</hi> Bredenbachius <hi>caſteth ſo fiercely in his teeth,</hi> Sententia de diſſidijs Eccleſiae componendis, fol. 35. <hi>and perhaps taught</hi> Campian <hi>to make his gloze.</hi> Seeing then we receiue this great and incomprehenſible benefit by Chriſt, euen the benefit of our deliuery, what kinde of deliuery is it which wee enioy? Is it a deliuery by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary manumiſſion? not ſo, for neither the fleſh, nor the diuell are of that nature, to ſurrender vp any thing with a franke and willing mind, but they are couetous, and muſt be conſtrayned. Is it a deliuery by exchange and commutation? not ſo, for Chriſt will neuer leaue or giue any hoſtages to the diuell. Is it a deliuery by a price and payment? ſo it is a deliuerie. But this price is paid to God our king, not to Satan Gods Iaylor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are bought with a great price, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 20. with the precious bloud of Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſtle, c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 19. and without ſhedding of bloud is no remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

and without death no teſtament, being without force ſo long as he that made it is aliue. <hi>Heb. c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 22. Is it a deliuery by force and compulſion? ſo it is a deliuerie as when a ſtrong man keepeth a houſe, and a ſtronger then he commeth in, and taketh what he wil out of the houſe, <hi>Luke c.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>Thus we were in the Lions mouth readie to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured, but Ieſus brake the iaw of the Lion aſunder, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaued his ſheepe, 1. <hi>Kings c.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> 36. thus we were bondme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but now are we free me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Iſraël came out of Egypt, <hi>Exo. c.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 41. thus we were woful &amp; miſerable, but nowe are wee ioyfull and bleſſed in our ſaluation, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> came from priſon, <hi>Gen. c.</hi> 41. <hi>v.</hi> 14.38. Then, for whoſe ſake hath he redeemed vs but for his owne? for if we liue we are Chriſtes, if we die we are Chriſtes: if we are his, then muſt we liue after his will, not our own will: if we are his, then muſt we ſerue none but him that ſaued vs: Be not the ſeruants of men, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 23. if we are his, it becommeth vs not to iudge our brethren: who art thou, ſaith the Apoſtle, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt another mans ſeruant? hee ſtandeth or falleth to his owne maſter, not to thee, <hi>Rom. c.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 4.

I omitte ſome concluſions purpoſely: if Chriſt be a lambe, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we acknowledge his humanitie and bodily ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or els he cannot be called a lambe: and ſo doeth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,

his natiuitie, his growing, his eating, his drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, his ſleeping, his weeping, his groning, and other his actions and paſſions proue and conclude him to be a man.

               <p>I might declare the like conuerſion of infinite other, but his example is moſt famous, and the matter it ſelfe moſt euident; the kingdome of darkenes ſtouped to the kingdome of light, Satan yeelded to Chriſt, the world, the fleſh, and the deuill were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered by the lambe of God, and great hope appeared of the very vniuerſall eſtabliſhment, and catholick peace of the Iſraëticall kingdome. But Satan cannot ſleepe long, hee and his helliſh angels muſt play their parts, the malice of the deuill lyeth in continuall wayte, to intrap and intangle the ſoule of man. Satan is a cunning and ſtrong aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, and euer ſtriueth to increaſe his Synagogue and route of infidels, of Atheiſts, of Gyants, of Heretikes, of Apoſtataes, of Schiſmatiks, in euery dangerous and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiferous kinde, that iniquitie might haue the vpper hand.

               <p>And ſeeing our laſt mention was of Antichriſt, marke alſo I pray you, how the ſame Prophet in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next Chapter, or rather God by his Prophet, more particularly and ſpecially menaceth Babylon, that is, Rome, <hi>v.</hi> 1. But as for thee thou daughter, thou damſell Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſit down in the duſt, ſit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground, there is no throne, ô thou daughter of Chaldaea, for thou ſhalt no more be called tender and pleaſant, thy filthineſſe ſhall be diſcouered, and thy priuities ſhalbe ſeene, for I will auenge me vpon thee, and will ſhew no mercie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee as I doe vnto other.

               <p>Heare now therefore, thou delicate one, that ſitteſt ſo careleſſe, and ſpeakeſt thus in thy heart, I am alone, and without me there is none, I ſhall neuer be widow,

nor deſolate againe, yet both theſe things ſhall come vnto thee vpon one day, namely, widowhood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, they ſhall mightily fal vpon thee, and ſo forth, as conſequently followeth in the ſame chapter, to the ſame effect, of much trouble, miſchiefe, ruine, and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine vtter deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ouerthrow menaced againſt Babylon, for a time the Lady &amp; Empreſſe of the world, that is, Rome. A notable caueat for Antichriſt, that is, the Pope and his adherents, if they would be ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wiſe to foreſee and conceiue their owne miſerie and deſtruction: but it is ſaid in the very ſame chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 10.

               <p>And no doubt, euen ſo it goeth with all the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers and impes of Antichriſt in what degree ſoeuer, that any way oppoſe themſelues againſt Chriſt, or any way blaſpheme and deface the lamb of God, they may ſeem wiſe and cunning in their owne eyes, in their owne ſtubburne wilfull conceite, but extreme ruine, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, and perdition, is the finall reward of all ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and cunning, euen in the mightieſt Lordes and Princes, and Emperors, and Popes of the worlde. For euery one that heareth my word and doeth it not, ſaith Chriſt himſelfe <hi>Math. c.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 26. ſhall bee likened vnto a fooliſh man that buylt his houſe vpon the ſand, and the rayne deſcended, and the floods came, and the windes blew and bet vpon that houſe, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.

               <p>Theſe are Gods goods, Gods cities, Gods ſuburbs, Gods mannors, which he himſelfe hath geuen, before <hi>Conſtantines</hi> donation no whit belonging to vs, as lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his firſt will and teſtament, to his owne holy and beloued Prieſthood.
