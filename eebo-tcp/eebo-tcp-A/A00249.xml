            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:17134:5"/>ANd now to come to my intended matter. The weyght of this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſecution ſeemeth chiefly to conſiſt in two penall ſtatutes: thone enforcing you to make ſhew by outward ſignes of yelding to a contrary religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the other debarring you from practiſe of your owne: the one propoſing vnto you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of temporall goods: the other thretning bodily deth: I mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e thone in flicting penalty, of .xx. pownd by the month to be exacted of all thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fuſe to be preſent at the ſchiſmaticall prayers now called in England by the name of diuine ſeruice, the other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding you to receyue catholicke Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, and conſequently excluding you from the benefite of god his ſeruice &amp; Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, vnder no leſſe payne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the ſame to ſuffer death as in caſe of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. Agaynſt the terror of both theſe, lawes, I intend to geue ſuch comfort, as it ſhall pleaſe god by my poore pen to aforde. And firſt I will aſſay to geue a cordiall agaynſt the thirten monthes mulct, as that which may extend it ſelfe more generally, and is more like to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17134:5"/>
put in execution, then that other lawe which draweth blood at the firſt encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter: the world being more earneſtly ſet in theſe dayes to thirſt after money, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deſire the ſhedding of mens blood. And like as peſecution beginneth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye with leſſer penalties before it proceed to greater: ſo ſhall it not be a miſſe to keepe the ſame order in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remedye to theſe afflictions: The loue of worldly goods being not ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall as the care of keeping of a mans life, &amp; therfore ordinarily the loſe more eaſlly digeſted. Although many will ſay that they would rather dye, ſpeedely, then liue a long time in miſerie: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this their iudgement may be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for that they haue already ſome fee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling of want in this life, but of deathe they haue not yet taſted, neyther doe they feele it ſo much, being in their opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion farther from them: but if death were imine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I thinke ther are very few that would not ſaue their liues if they could although with very hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for their maner of liuing: ſo that comonly that is found true, although
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17134:6"/>
it were vttered by the Father &amp; Author of lyes: <hi>pellem pro pelle, et cuncta que habet homo dabit pro anima ſua</hi>:<note place="margin">Iob: 2.</note> Skyne for ſkyne and all that a man hath he will geue for his ſoule, that is to ſay for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his naturall lyfe. Yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ther is good hope that if we maye perſwade men to endure patiently the with-drawing of goods &amp; liuings, they will more boldly aduenture if it ſhal-be needfull, the loſſe of liues: the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from theſe temporall poſſeſſions, being one eſpeciall payne, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſubſtance doe find at the time of their death being alſo a greate cauſe why they feare to dye, and therfore ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny times a great impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py atchiuing of glorious martirdom.</p>
            <p>ACording to this order therfore let vs firſt conſider this penalty of twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And yet ſaying of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſome of his faithful acqainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that he was alreadie a chriſtian, he was alwayes tolde that they wolde not ſo repute him, vntil they ſaw him in the church of Chriſt, wher-vnto he wolde replye in ſcornful manner, aſking whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the walles made men to be Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians? as manye at this daye wil aſke, whether their reſorte to the material churche of heretikes, can make them ceaſe to be of the Catholike churche? But in the ende, by God his grace, he turned ouer the leafe, and going glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to the church, he was inſtructed in the faythe, baptiſed and made a true Chriſtian. And when the time came, that he ſhould make profeſſion of his faythe before the faythful people, for that was then the manner for ſuche as were newly conuerted: It was offered him that he ſhould do it more ſecretly, leſte ſo great an aſſemblye at the firſte ſhould abaſh him. But he made choyſe

And theſe outward ſignes are eſſpeciallye the bleſſed Scacrifice, the holy ſacramentes of the ſame, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayers and ſeruice of God, which are not in the proteſtants churches. And therfore whoſoeuer reſorteth thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doth manifeſtly fayle in theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his profeſſion, and ſo diuideth himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the viſible vnity. Fourthly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this vnitye requireth not onlye that a man participate in ſacramentes and prayers, but alſo that he be obediente to his lawfull paſtours. And now it is euident that the whole churche in the Councel of Trent by condemning the hereſies of this time, hath alſo forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vs to haue felowſhip with the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of thoſe hereſies in diuine thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Neither was it needful by expreſſe wordes to prohibit the comming to their churches: ſeing that it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden expreſly to pray with heretikes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17134:16"/>
euen by the Cannons of the Apoſtles, and in diuers ages by ſundry Councels whiche wee ſhal haue occaſion to cite herafter. And who knoweth not that the meaning, will and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of all Catholike paſtors at this daye, is that we ſhold abſtaine from the a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd churches vnder no leſſe payne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be caſt out of the true church. Fiftly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the practice of our country is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifeſt, wherby thoſe that only haue bin preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at the ſciſmatical ſeruice, are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for very ſciſmatikes, &amp; accordingly are dealt withal in their riſing vp from their ruine, and they in the mean time in their owne conſciences do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them-ſelues to be debarred from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the vſe of al holye Sacraments. Sixtly al this is grounded vpon great reaſon: for like as the proteſtants are heretikes in reſpect of their falſe doctrine, ſo are the ſciſmatikes in their different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſeruing God. And therfore who ſoeuer doth but ſeeme to concurr with them in that outward acte of ſeruice, the Churche being not able to ſearche his harte and minde, but iudging him

And here it is to be noted that the <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> were not the firſt, that would warrant men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye their fayth in time of perſecution. It was certayne hundred yeares before the doctrine of the <hi>Helaeſaites:</hi> and ſome time before them it was taught by the <hi>Gnoſtikes</hi> or <hi>Valentinians</hi> againſt whome Tertulian purpoſlye did write a booke called <hi>Scorpiacum,</hi>

Fourthlye becauſe their whole ſtate differeth: what parte hath the faithful with the heretikes or Infidels, yea and the worſe ſorte of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, becauſe of their departure from the faythe once receyued: by reaſone wherof their error is leſſe excuſeable, their malice commonly greater, their company more perilous for infection, and leſſe hope of their recouerye, then of ſuch as neuer knew Chriſts religion. Laſtly for the diuerſitie of their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſeruice: What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? for you ar the Temple of the liuing God ſayth the Apoſtle, which he proueth by that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the lawe that God wil dwel and walke in them and wil be their God &amp; they ſhal be his people.

Yea perhaps you ſhal be able to beſtow more largelye vpon the domeſtical of fayth or if your almes be leſſe for lack of ability your good-wils ſhal be rather the more. For as you know the widdowes two mites is more then any riche mans treaſure and good folke wil conſidder, that you are afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Catholiks and therfore wil require the leſſe at your handes.

yet a lytle willynglye: yea this whiche ſhal-be the greateſt almes that could be geuen. For as that bleſſed mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyr Sir Thomas more ſayth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man loſeth anye thing for Gods cauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the deuils eſcheator ſeaſe vpon it, yet it is rendred to God.

it ſhal be eaſier for ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deſcend from their meane ſtate vnto the loweſt then for ſome other that haue borne a great port to come down but to a certayn mediocrity of liuing. For where there be leſt poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ther is manye times leſſe loue of the world: Although in deede there be no greate differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between leeſing much or litle for Gods ſake, ſo that a man beare like loue towards God. But to ſuch of you now whoſe loſſe may be more greuous or that maye fall in to greater wante I directe my ſpeach, deſiring you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydder a while the condition of theſe earthlye goods and the burthen of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertye whiche maye light vpon you in the hardeſt caſe that may be foreſeene by mans reaſone.<note place="margin">Comfort for the poore.</note> So ſhall you ſee ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the loſſe to be ſo great nor the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience that maye follow therof ſo intollerable, as at the firſt ſighte it might be eſteemed.</p>
               <p>AND Firſt touching wordly goods I myghte tell you accordyng to ſome phyloſophers,<note place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> yea by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of manye Chriſtyan Doctors,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17134:33"/>
that they are not worthye the name of goods, becauſe they make not their poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeſſors any thing the better. But rather they make them for the moſt parte farr the worſe: for ſo much as they are the occaſion of pryde whiche is the verye worme and diſeaſe that foloweth ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. They kindle couetouſnes &amp; ther fore they be lyke to colde water being drounke by a man that is in ſome hott diſeaſe: the more that he drinketh the more it increaſeth his thirſt. They are matter of intemperance and ouer deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate lining. They geue impunity to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and conſequently are occaſion of manye ſinnes. I might ſaye that they are common to good and to euil men, but more commonlye they ar beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the euil then vppon the good. <hi>Beholde ſinners haue obteyned riches,</hi> ſayth Dauid in one Pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſal. 72.</note> And this is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for ſundrye good reaſons. Firſt becauſe we ſhoulde vnderſtande theſe earthlye poſſeſsions not to be the true goods nor the rewarde whiche we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to receyue, alſo becauſe thoſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men are manye tymes rewarded
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17134:33"/>
with earthlye ryches for ſome morall good which they haue done being not worthye at all of better recompence. And for the moſt part this aboundance of wealth, is an occaſion wherfore they become more vitious &amp; ſo is permitted vnto them as matter of more greeuous damnation. I might ſaye vnto you that none of theſe externall thinges whiche a man poſſeſſeth are to be called hys owne, becauſe they are not within him ſelf, &amp; therfore it is not in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s power to keepe or not to leeſe them. This mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued certayne Phyloſophers as Bias and Stilpo of <hi>Megara</hi> being ſpoylled of all that whiche they had, to boaſte that they caryed with them all their goods, meaning that they had not loſte theyr inward vertues. This bragg they made perhaps more confidently then truely, but how much better may a Chriſtian ſaye that although he be depryued of his earthlye goods, yet he hopeth that he ſhal not loſe his fayth, his truſt, and his loue towards God, and conſequent lye he ſhal not loſe God himſelfe the geuer of all goodnes and the onlye ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17134:34"/>
that maye ſuffice and cauſe him to line content and happye. I might ſhew to you out of profane hiſtoryes that manye Philoſophers either for loue of knowledge or deſire of vayne glorye as Anacharſis, Crates, Antiſthenes, and almoſt all thoſe of like ſtudye and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, and manye worthye Captayns and honourable men in their common wealthes, as Ariſtides and Phocion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Athenians, and among the Romanes, Fabritius and M. Curius, haue eyther choſen to become poore, or haue refuſed to be made rich, when occaſion was offered. I might proue further by good reaſon, that this exter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nal wealth, is no otherways profitable, but when it is wel beſtowed. And how can it be beſtowed with more aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, then being forſaken for gods loue and for the redemption of your owne ſoules. Otherwiſe what benefite hath the rich man by his great abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance? Or what doe his large poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s auayle him? Are they profitable in reſpect of his health? we ſee that moſte wealthy men can hardlye repayre their bodies
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17134:34"/>
by contynuall applying of medicyne, where-as the poore man contynueth ſound without healpe of phyſike. Hath he more libertye to goe where he wil, or more freedome to do what him beſt pleaſeth? vndoubtedlye no. For ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſide the couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſe hart is alwayes tyed and chayned vnto his money, and take what riche man you wil, he is more reſtrayned from beſtow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing his tyme at his pleaſure by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde inſtance of his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral affayres then the poore cottier, by the neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of getting his dayly liuing by day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye labour. But dothe he enioye more pleaſures? No ſurely. For although he haue perhapps greater ſtore of delights yet pleaſure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth rather in rarenes then in continual vſe, &amp; rather in mens deſires, then in the nature of thinges themſelues. The rich man can ſcarcely finde any dayntyes that maye content his appetite, where as the poore hath hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger for his ſauce to al kind of meats. <hi>As it is written in the Prouerbs.</hi>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17134:35"/>
neuer ſo trimly. But perhapps the rich are leſſe ſubiect to iniuries and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? It is altogether contrarye. For the poore man lyueth without moleſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of any if you conſider him as he is poore: and if he be any wayes troubled it is in reſpect of ſome litle goods that he hath or procureth to haue. But the rich man is more often a pray to thoſe that are more mightye and riche, then the poore people are to him-ſelfe. He is had in geloſie by his ſuperiors, he is impugned by his equalls, he is enuyed and vndermined by his inferiors, he is betrayed many times for his money by his ſeruants, yea by his owne children. Therfore I might ſaye farther, that by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the hauing of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye pelfe is matter of care, how it maye be kepte, how it may be imployed, and how it may be increaſed.
