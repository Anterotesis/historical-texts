            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of Rhetorike: I haue
sette out this mery treatise / wherin
plainnes and flateri do come in trial / 
in such wise as none honest man wil
be therwith offended. The persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that do reasone, be of small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:
For Pasquillus, that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
moste, is an image of stone, sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
in the citie of Rome openly: on
whome ones in the yere, it is leful to
euery man, to set in verse or prose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te that he will / agayne whom
he lift, howe great an astate so euer
he be. Not withstandynge in this
booke he vsith suche a temperaunce / 
that he noteth not any particular
persone or Countrey. Gnatho was
brought in by writers of Comedies
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25894:2"/>
for suche a seruante / as alway affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
what so euer was spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his
maister: but he was a Greke borne,
and therfore he sauorith some what
of rethorike. Pasquille is an olde
Romane / but by longe sittinge in the
strete, and hering market men chat,
he his become rude and homely.</p>
            <p>Harpocrates was the prelate of the
temple of Isis and Serapis, whiche
were honorid for goddis in Aegypt / 
whose image is made holdynge his
fynger at his mouthe, betokeninge
silence. These thre communed to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as it foloweth / but where, I
had forgoten to aske,. All be it by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the matter is merily brought
in, and therwith sauoreth somwhat
of wisedome: I thought hit not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to participate it with you
that will not interprete it but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
to the beste meaninge, And in
the redinge this littill treatise distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly,
will consider diligently the state
<pb facs="tcp:25894:3"/>
and condition of the parson that spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth / 
with the ordre and conclusion
of his hole reason. And if it seme to
you, that Pasquill sayth true, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claringe
howe moche ye do fauoure
truthe, defende hym ageynste vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
tunges and ouerthwart wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,

Yet a great dele more is there

               <p>Well Pasquillus / 
thou wylte neuer leue thyn olde cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome

wyt ynough to perceyue what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

I herde the wordes that thou spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest

that thou arte a good felowe, and
woldest that all thynge were well,
though thy wordes be all crabbed.
Wherfore not withstandynge that

I had wende all this whyle,
