            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt followed ſo cloſe after thee, and the Sea (the great Sea) was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and mountains on each ſide of thee, how great was the ſtraight thou wert in, and the trouble and ſorrow that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed thee about, oh my ſoul! that thou wert even at thy wits end, ſcarce any hope of ever coming at the promiſed Land, but rather murmuring againſt the Lord, ſaying in thy heart, Oh that thou had ſtaied ſtill in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and not come one ſtep towards <hi>Canaan.</hi>

Remember, oh my ſoul! how he made a way for thee to paſſe through the Sea, and divided the waters thereof hither and thither, and by his mighty power carried thee through the Sea, and <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his hoſt he utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in his wrath, and delivered thee oh, my ſoul! out of his

            <p>Oh! oh! my ſoul, my ſoul, thou in the lowly fear and holy dread of the Lord thy tender God, and in truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe livingly and experimentally canſt ſay, the Lord my God is my ſtrength and my ſong, he alſo is become my ſalvation, he is my rock and ſtrong tower, his work is perfect, a God, the God of truth and righteouſneſſe, juſt and right he is, the holy one whoſe dwelling is on high, in the holy place, and with him alſo who is of a poor, and a meek, and a contrite ſpirit, and that trembleth before his Holineſſe, and feareth and dread before his dreadfull Name: ah! ah! thy right hand O Lord, thy right hand, O Lord God of power, is become glorious in power, is become mighty in power, thy right hand, O Lord God Almighty, hath daſhed in pieces mine enemies; by the greatneſſe, O Lord my God, by the greatneſſe of thy wonderful excellency, thou haſt O Lord confounded them that roſe up againſt me; thou letteſt forth thy wrath and conſumed them as ſtubble before a mighty fire, thou letteſt forth the breath of thy fury, &amp; blew upon them and ſcattered them as chaffe before a mighty wind: Oh! oh! who can ſtand before thy indignation, thy dreadful indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? who can abide the extream fierceneſſe of thy anger? thy fury is poured forth like fire, thou breakeſt the rocks in pieces, the mountains tremble before thee, the mighty God; thou ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt thy voice and the Heathen tremble, thou roareſt, and the Kingdomes are moved, and the earth melteth at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thy preſence, who cometh with fire, and thy Chariots like a whirle-wind; thou rendereſt thy anger with fury, and thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes with flames of fire: thou haſt thy way in the whirlewinds, and the Clouds are as the duſt of thy feet.

            <p>Wherefore I'le not fear, though the Earth be removed and carried into the midſt of the Sea, and though the Sea roar and be terrible, and the Mountains ſhake with the ſwellings thereof, and the Hills fly before it; though the tall Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> fall, and the ſtrong Oaks of <hi>Raſhan</hi> bend before it, yet I will not fear. The Lord is with me, and he will not forſake me, but he will help me, and that right early. Wherefore I will onely fear before the Lord, before the Lord my God, the mighty eternal God of mighty eternal Power, who meaſureth out the Heavens as with a ſpan, and meaſureth the waters of the Seas in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his hand; who comprehendeth the duſt of the Earth in a meaſure, and weigheth the Mountains as in ſcales, and the Hills as in a ballance; who taketh up the Iſlands as a very little thing; before whoſe face the Heavens and the Earth flee away, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold there appeareth no more Sea.</p>

O Lord, thou blew upon them, and the Sea covered them, and they ſunk as Lead in the bottom of the mighty Waters. O Lord, O Lord God, who is like unto thee? who amongſt the gods is like unto thee the only God, who art dreadful in holineſs, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in praiſes, doing wonders? Oh! let the people hear and be afraid, and the Dukes of <hi>Edom</hi> be amazed, and let trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling take hold of the mighty men of <hi>Moab</hi>; oh! who can but fear before thee, O Lord my God. Thou haſt redeemed me, and led me forth in thy power, and guided me in, thy ſtrength unto thy holy habitation; thou wilt bring me in and plant me in the mountain of thy Inheritance, in thy Sanctuary O Lord, which thy hands have eſtabliſhed, wherein I ſhall live with thee, O Lord my God for ever: Ah! glory, glory, glory unto thee O Lord

God my God. The Lord is a man of war, the Lord of Hoſts is his name; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his mighty men hath he drowned in the Sea, but he hath ſaved thee, oh my ſoul!

            <p>Oh my ſoul, my ſoul! thou wert a captive in the Land of <hi>Babylon,</hi> eſtranged from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and an Alien from <hi>Sion,</hi> ſetting ſorrowful and ſolitary by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Babylon</hi> in the Land of Captivity, mourning when thou thought upon <hi>Sion,</hi> for thou wert a Captive in a ſtrange Land, and ſorrow (through the ſenſe of thy awful Captivity and Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from thy native Land) compaſſed thee about, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on every hand; tears was thy drink, daily ſorrow thy meat, and groans &amp; ſighs thy greateſt joy; thou wenteſt bowed down all the day long with an heart aking, and thine eyes dropping with tears, becauſe of the oppreſſions of thine enemies, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of thine oppreſſours; and at the remembrance of <hi>Sion</hi> (and in the ſence of thy ſeparation from her) thou didſt pant, oh my ſoul! thou didſt pant after <hi>Sion,</hi> the Land of thy nativity; Oh! as the Hart panteth after the water brooks, crying in the anguiſh of thy ſorrow; how long Lord, how long ſhould I be a captive in a ſtrange Land? with longing deſires in thy heart after <hi>Sion</hi>: thinking in thy heart, oh! when ſhall I walk with the ranſomed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48135:5"/>
of the Lord upon the Mountain of <hi>Sion,</hi> &amp; travel with the Lords redeemed in the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and in that day, oh my ſoul! the Lord for his own Seeds ſake had regard unto thy cries, and thy tears and ſorrows was not hid from the view of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pitiful eye, and in tender mercy and bowels of compaſſion towards thee: he, through his free love unto thee brought thee forth out of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Land of thy captivity, and ſet thy face towards <hi>Sion</hi> thy deſired reſt, oh! my ſoul.</p>
            <p>But oh! oh! my ſoul, how oft wert thou bewildered in thy going, even after thy face was turned towards <hi>Sion</hi> travelling thitherward, ſaying in thy heart, oh! I will go joyn my ſelf unto <hi>Sion</hi> in a perpetual Covenant which ſhall never be broken, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thy way, ſometimes wandering as it were in the wilderneſs, in the deſerts and ſolitary places hungry and thirſty, my ſoul even fainting with weakneſſe, and then didſt thou cry unto the Lord in thy diſtreſs and he helpt thee out of all thy troubles, he took thee by the right hand, and brought thee into the right way in which thou mighteſt come to thy deſired reſt, oh my ſoul! And now, oh my ſoul! thou art come to <hi>Sion</hi> with ſongs and everlaſting joy upon thy head, and thou haſt obtained joy and gladneſſe, and thy ſighing and mourning is fled away.</p>
            <p>And now, oh my ſoul! thou that wert in a deſert doth rejoice, and as a wilderneſſe art made glad, and as a ſolitary place doth now bloſſome as a Roſe, as a dry heath, now as a fruitful val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, as the parched ground, now as the moiſt mould that drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the rain that comes upon it. Now, oh my ſoul! thou in truth canſt ſay the wilderneſſe doth rejoice, and the deſert and ſolitary place is made glad, and bloſſome as a Roſe; water comes forth out of the wilderneſſe, and ſtreams in the deſert, the parched ground is become a poole, and the dry heath ſprings of water; now the mourner rejoices, and the heavy hearted is made glad, and beauty is given in ſtead of aſhes, the oyle of of joy for mourning, the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe; now, oh my ſoul! is thy horn exalted in the Lord in whom thy mouth is enlarged over thy enemies: ah! the Lord maketh rich, and he maketh poor; he woundeth, and he maketh whole; he killeth, and he maketh alive; he brings down, and he raiſeth up; he raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt, and the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar

from off the dunghill, and ſetteth them among Princes, and cauſe them to inherit the ſeat of Glory. Yea, the full he empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they hire themſelves out for bread, and they that were hungry and empty he filleth with good things: yea, the barren he cauſeth to bear ſeven, and ſhe that hath had many children is waxed feeble: this is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in thy eyes, oh my ſoul!</p>
            <p>Oh! my ſoul, my ſoul, thou canſt in truth ſay, thy winter is (in meaſure) over and gone, and the ſtormy wind is fled away, and the cold parching froſts are diſſolved, and the ſpring and ſummer is come, and the Sun with its warm beams breaks forth, and the gentle ſhowers deſcends, and the time of the ſinging of birds is come, and the turtle is heard in thy land, oh my ſoul! and the vine putteth forth her tender grapes, and the fig-tree with her pleaſant figs gives a goodly ſmell. And now oh! my ſoul, thou canſt ſet under thy vine, and under thy fig-tree with thy beloved: and who ſhall make thee afraid, with whom thou canſt walk into his pleaſant garden of delights, among the beds of ſpices, and feed among the lillies, and there ſolace thy ſelf in the boſome of his love.</p>
            <p>For oh my ſoul, oh my ſoul! there was a time when thou oh my ſoul! hadſt loſt thy beloved, and thou ſoughtſt him by night upon thy bed, and in the broad wayes, but thou foundeſt him not; and therefore ſorrow compaſſed thee as a wall about, and mourning covered thee as a garment, and thou couldſt have no reſt, until thou hadſt found thy beloved, crying fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thy heart, ſaying in thy ardent deſires after him) oh! oh! thou art hid from me as in the clifts of the rocks, and as in the ſecret places of the ſtairs: let me ſee thy countenance, and let me hear thy voice, for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely; and when he did ſometimes ſhew himſelf unto thee behind the wall, or as through a lattice, and put his fingers in by the hole of the door, thy bowels were moved for him. But now oh my ſoul! thou doſt enjoy his preſence which is ſweet and pleaſant to thee, he is as a bundle of mirrhe, he is thy joy, thou ſits under his ſhadow with great delight; for he is a bower of ſpices unto thee, and his fruit is ſweet to thy taſt, he hath brought
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48135:6"/>
thee into his banketting houſe, where his banner over thee is love, where he comforteth thee with the flaggons of his love he cauſeth thee to drink of his ſpiced wine which is as the liquor of life, and the juyce of his pomegranates which is as honey to thy taſt.</p>
            <p>Oh my ſoul! he filleth thee with good things, that ſo thou mighteſt become as a watered garden, and as a ſpring of water, whoſe water fails not; that thy bones might flouriſh as an herb, and thy kidneyes be covered with fatneſſe, and thy belly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as an oyly brook: thus hath the Lord thy tender God, thy merciful God, oh my ſoul! ſet thee free from the yoak of bondage. And now, oh my ſoul! rejoyce in fear and trembling, and dread and fear continually in the holy preſence of the Lord thy God, and watch, watch, watch, oh my ſoul! diligently, watch in the lowly fear and godly jealouſie over thy own heart, trembling in thy bowels, leſt thou, oh my ſoul! in the joy (the great joy) in the ſenſe of what the Lord hath done for thee (and in a ſight of thy good ſtate thou art advanced to) ſhould be lifted up above what is meet, and thereby come to loſſe and a fall; wherefore, oh my ſoul! to prevent ſuch miſhaps coming unto thee unawares, keep thee watchful and low in fear, and humble, and contrite in heart, and meek, and chaſte in mind, tender and broken in bowels, poor and needy in ſpirit, waiting and depending upon the meer preſerving grace of the merciful hand of thy merciful, pitiful, compaſſionate God of infinite lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſſe; that whatever thou do or ſuffer (through his ſtrength) for him, thou maiſt not be (in the leaſt degree) exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above him, but ſtill keeping low in him, dwelling beneath him at his footſtool: and whatever thou receiveſt from him, when he calls for it, return it back to him; and be nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, but what thou art in him alone, knowing that what thou art it is by him, and what thou hath it cometh from him.</p>
            <p>Therefore be nothing without him, and return his own to him, for he is worthy that his own ſhould praiſe him. And in the belly of a humble, lowly, broken, contrite ſpirit dwell, oh my ſoul! where thou mayeſt ſerve God with thy tears, dwelling in the ſence of the freeneſſe of his love and mercy in what he hath done for thee, that the remembrance thereof may rend thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els

            <q>Oh my ſoul! where didſt thou begin, but in the ſence of Gods dear, tender, precious, moſt excellent love ſtirring in thy heart, and there muſt thou end, and reſt ſatisfied, and lay thee down quiet in peace with Gods moſt dear babes, and tender innocent lambs, unto whom thou cleaveſt as fleſh to their bones, towards whom thy bowels, thy bowels, thy tender bowels do unſpeakably yearn with ſecret pantings in thy inward parts, through the weight of love that abides in and upon thee, oh my ſoul! my ſoul, my ſoul.</q>
