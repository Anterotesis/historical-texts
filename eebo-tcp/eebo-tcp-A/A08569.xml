            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was moued (gentle Reader) to tranſlate this Booke into our mother tongue, for diuers and ſundrie cauſes. Firſt the fame of the authour prouoked me thereunto, who is, not in my priuate opinion, but in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of alſuch as know gim, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Prieſte and godly Biſhoppe, in the iudgement of the world, for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, wiſedome, eloquence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found knowledge in al kinde of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in theſe our daies a ſingular, yea an odde man. Then I thought it expedient, to impart the benefit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto my vnlearned countrey men,
<pb facs="tcp:970:3"/>
bicauſe as it was writen generally for the commoditie of al the Churche of Chriſt, ſo it was eſpecially meant and as it were dedicated to the Churche and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weal of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, vnto the which, as it may appeere both by the epiſtle which he wrot before vnto the Queenes Maieſtie, as alſo by this Booke, he bare ſiugular good will. Moreouer I iudged, that mylabour in tranſlating it ſhuld be the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably emploied, bicauſe there are in it many goodly exhortations to ſtirre a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp to the loue and feare of God, many holeſome leſſons, by the whiche a Chriſtian man may direct and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his life, many points of Catholike doctrine (whiche are in theſe dayes called in controuerſie by our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries) ſo plainly ſet out, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
<pb facs="tcp:970:3"/>
maie take great profit therof, ſo lernedly diſputed, that ſuch as are wel exerciſed in Diuinitie, may find wherwith to increaſe their knowlege. To be ſhort, the thing that moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to take theſe paines, was, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it conteineth a briefe confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manie erroneous opinions, of much heretical and peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t doctrine, compriſed in a litle booke, ſet out theſe late yeares in the name of M. Haddon: wherin was pretended an anſwere to the Epistle of Oſorius, (which I ſpake of before) but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte was nothing els, but a numbre of ſtout aſſertions faintly prooued, be ſprinkled here and there with bitter tauntes, vnſauerie gyrdes, and other the like ſcomme or froth of vndige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted affections. Theſe were the things
<pb facs="tcp:970:4"/>
that cawſed me to ſpare ſome time from my ſtudy to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate this booke into Engliſhe for the commoditie of ſuche as vnderſtande not the Latine tongue: wherof if thou ſhalt receiue any profit (as thou maiſt very much, if thou reade it with diligence and good iudgement) thanke God of it, and with mindful hart acknowledge his great mercy and goodnes towards vs, in that it hath pleaſed him in this perilous time, not only to ſend vs at home in our owne countrie moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, godlie, and learned men, to be vnto vs a perfecte rule both of good life and true beleefe: but alſo to moue the heart of this graue Father and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Biſhop (whoſe learned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges haue deſeruedly obteined ſo great authoritie thoroughout al the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thinke it a great grace and benefite of God M. Haddon, that your booke, which ye ſette out againſt me a fewe yeres paſt, with much a doe at the length, this laſt daie came vnto my handes. Such care hath God put into the hart of Henrie the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who is a moſt godly Prince and wiſe gouernour, to vſe al poſsible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that no ſuch bookes, as may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine the purenes of godly Religion, be brought in emongeſt vs. Had it not benne, that Emanuel Almada Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of Angra, a man excellently wel furniſhed with al good qualities and vertues, to me moſte intiere, both for the ſtreight friendſhippe, as alſo for the long acqueintaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene
<pb facs="tcp:970:6"/>
vs begone and continued euen from our Aunceſtours, had accompai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned the moſt vertuous Ladie Marie Princeſſe of Parma, into the low Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, I had not as yet heard any thing either of the booke, or of the Writer. But he, after his arriual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe parties, chauncing vppon the booke, thought he could no leſſe doe of friendſhippe, but take vpon him my cauſe, and confute your reprocheful wordes. Howbeit in the worke, which he wrote with ſingular diligence, he tooke vppon him the defence, not ſo muche of me, as of Religion, of pietie, of godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>After his returne into his countrie (whiche was much later then we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped) it was rumored foorthwith, that an Engliſh man, whoſe name was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, had writen againſt Hierony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Oſorius, and that the Biſhoppe of Angra had earneſtly taken vpon him the defence of Oſorius, and this much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:970:6"/>
was ſignified vnto me by my friendes letters. At the ſame time, I was pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully occupied in viſiting my Dioceſe, the which notwithſtanding, I was not ſo letted, but that I found a time to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute my frind, and welcome him home by my letters, in the which I required of him, that he woulde ſend me your booke together with his defence. He anſwered me to euery point of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as humanitie, courteſie and frind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip required. But as touching your booke, he ſaid he was moued in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience not to ſend it, vntil he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined licence of the Cardinal. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye may perceiue, how heinouſe and wicked offence it is emongeſt vs, to reade the bookes of ſuch men, as haue with many errours infected Religion.</p>
            <p>This wiſe man, albeit he had had very exact and perfect tryal of my Religion by long experience, and ſaw that I was placed in the roome and dignitie of a Biſhop, and therefore might of mine
<pb facs="tcp:970:7"/>
owne authoritie ſearch and trie out what ſoeuer wilines or craft laie hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the couert of your writings: yet durſt he in no wiſe make me partaker of your booke, before he vnderſtoode our Cardinalles pleaſure. You wil here peraduenture ſcorne and laugh at his ouermuch ſuperſtition. But I ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinke any dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put away the contagion of ſuch a deadlie or mortal peſtilence, to be ouermuch. After many moneths at the length when he vnderſtoode the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals pleaſure, he ſent me your booke willing me withal to ſpare ſome time from mine owne moſt earneſt affaires, to anſwere you, and ſo did the reſt of my friendes alſo counſel me to doe. And although it might ſeme a diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie not to regarde the requeſt of my friendes, yet I would not haue yelded vnto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if in this your woorke my eſtimation only had ben touched, and not the puritie of the Catholike Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:970:7"/>
violated. I was alſo moued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto ſo muche the more, bicauſe I thought it a point of Chriſtian charitie to trie, whether you might be brought through my diligence, to laie downe ſomewhat of your engraffed lightnes. For doubtleſſe I may wel gather of theſe your writinges, that in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, ye ſtoode very much in your owne conceite, yea and that in ſome places as it were rauiſhed with good liking of your ſelfe, ye ſtoode ſtil looking earneſtly about you euen for the fauourable applauſe of your frinds. But how much your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued you, it ſhal foorth with appeere.</p>
            <p>Firſt of al wheras ve ſay that I am a great framer of wordes and ſentences: whether ye meane truely, or whether ye diſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, I can not tel, but the praiſe that you geue me, I doe not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If there be in me any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grace of ſpeache, truly it is bicauſe I haue beſtowed my time and ſtudie,
<pb facs="tcp:970:8"/>
not ſo much in words, as to atteine the knowledge of the higheſt pointes of learning. Beſides that, this qualitie of ſpeach, how ſimple ſo euer it be in me (if it be any thing at al) I haue vſed, not to the damnable forging of falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but with earneſt and zealous good heart, to the ſetting foorth of true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines.</p>
            <p>In the very beginning of your booke ye laie to my charge a great crime of raſhnes and preſumption: for thus you ſaie. <hi>You tooke muche vpon you, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a priuate man, ſeparated from vs by land and ſea, and vnacquainted with our affaires, durſt ſo boldly ſpeake vnto the Quenes Maieſtie.</hi> Now Sir, I beſeche you, let me learne this one thing of you. What meane you by this worde <hi>priuate?</hi> Is it a worde of reproche on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Or may it not be applied alſo to good, vertuous, and noble men? Are there not emongeſt you many noble men that beare no office, neither ſerue

in any place of the common weale? Saie you ſo Sir? Are al thoſe that ſerue not in the Office of Requeſtes to be thruſt out by you from the preſence and ſpeach of Kinges? For ſo you laie the name of a priuate man to me, as though ye eſtemed it to be a woord of villanie and diſhonour: as though you would ſaie, that my father were ſome vplandiſh man, and I brought vp in baſenes, of ſo ſmal accompte, that I was neuer woorthie to looke any King in the face, and therefore had committed a fault woorthie of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſe puniſhment, that durſt in my letters to name Queene Elizabeth, (whome I alwaies name for honours ſake dewe vnto her Princely Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie). But admitte I were not (as I am in deede) of a verie auncient gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans howſe: yet it was not the part of a man brought vp in liberal ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to eſteme any kind of men, or any kind of honour more then the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
<pb facs="tcp:970:9"/>
of vertue. For al cogniſaunces or Armes either of nobilitie, or of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, although they be faire and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in ſhewe, yet when true vertue is away, being falſe, vaine, and void of al ſound fruict, are deſpiſed and holden as worthy of no account with euerie wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that, if ye meane to ſpeake to my rebuke, charge me with ſome crime or grieuous offence, laie not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me the name of a priuate man. For before I had the office of a Biſhoppe, I was, both for fauour, authoritie, and worſhippe, preferred before a great number of your calling. If the name of a priuate man did ſignifie dulnes or lumpiſhnes of witte, if it did importe any heinouſe crime or diſhoneſtie of life: then ſurely, he that ſhoulde ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect that name to me, ſhould reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpeake of me, and contrary to my deſertes. But for ſo much as we ſee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, that, emongeſt Princes thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are in the higheſt places of honor,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:970:9"/>
which are of al honour moſt vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and contrariwiſe thoſe voide of al honour, whiche could moſt faith fully and honorably ſerue their Princes: it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that the name of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man ſignifieth not the vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the perſons, but the vnluckines of the Princes. For they are ſo beſette and holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſeruice of lewd fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that thei can not vſe the vertue of good men. Now wheras you ſay, that it is nothing decent, that I being a ſtraunger ſeperated from you by lande and ſea, ſhoulde write a letter to your Queene: I beſeke you Sir, teache me: were letters deuiſed to aduertiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thinges behoueſul, in their abſence, or in their preſence? Doubtleſſe in their abſence. Whie then do ye blame me, that bearing very harty good wil vnto your Queene, I admoniſhed her being abſent and ſeperated from me by land and ſea, of thinges apperteining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the eſtabliſhmente of her eſtate?
<pb facs="tcp:970:10"/>
If I had benne preſent, I wolde haue humblie beſought her, not by letters, but by worde of mowth in preſence, that, if ſhe minded to ſaue her life and mainteine her honour, ſhe ſhould eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew the companie and familiaritie of infamous perſonnes.</p>
            <p>You obiecte alſo vnto me, that I am not ſkilled in your affaires. As though I talked not of ſuch matters as are moſt perfectly knowen of al men.</p>
            <p>Laſt of al you increaſe the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of my fact with the name of a Princelie Maieſtie: as though your Quene did excel rather in richeſſe and puiſſaunce, then in gentlenes and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, and as though I were ſuche a man as could not by my letters aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the greateſt Prince in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an worlde of things of greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. Acknowledge nowe, I pray you, your moſt vnaduiſed raſhnes in this your talke, for thus muche you ſeme to ſaie. Whereas you haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:970:10"/>
had the practiſe of the Law, neuer borne in any common weale office (I meane ſuch office as apperteine to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Law) neuer offered ſupplications to any Prince: Who hath made you ſo arrogant and preſumptuous, as to take vpon you to ſpeake vnto the Queenes Maieſtie, a thing graunted to me al on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to ſuche as I am, and that for great good cauſe? If you perceiue not M. Haddon, howe fonde and childiſh this your talke is, I muſt nedes deeme that you are beſtraught of your ſenſes. But if it greaueth you to ſee, that the Quene geueth eare to ſome other man that is not of your qualitie, I can not blame you. For whie, certaine it is, that you can not long enioy this your felicitie, if many wiſe and vertuous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal vnto her good wil and authoritie ioyne their ſeruice and induſtrie. For the counterfeicted attendaunce of fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vertue, in the preſence of true vertue vaniſheth awaie. Wherfore, I
<pb facs="tcp:970:11"/>
geue you counſel to exclude al honeſt men (of whom, as I vnderſtand, there is no ſmal number in England) from the familiaritie of the Prince, expel them, thruſt them out, by proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s force them to flee out of the Realme. As for me, that am ſo farre of, there is no cauſe whie ye ſhould be greatly careful, for ſo much as it can not be ſuſpected, that I ſhoulde take awaie from you your gaines, after which as you ſhew your ſelfe, you gape ſo greedilie. But by your pacience Sir, me thinketh ye are of nature very baſe and abiecte, that for ſo meane a promotion take ſo great ſtomake and courage. If ye can not beare ſo meane a condition, but that you muſt needes in reſpecte of your office, laie vnto me the name of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, what would you doe, if you were called to ſome higher degree of worſhippe?</p>
            <p>You ſaie, that I do goe about to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the eſtimation of lawes, wheras
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:970:11"/>
in deede I doe thinke, that the good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of a common weale ſtandeth and is mainteined by lawes, and am hartily ſorie, that through theſe peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſectes al good lawes cuſtomes and ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are fallen to ruine and decaie.</p>
            <p>You ſaie that I appeache all the whole Realme of England, I can not tel, of what, hateful newfanglednes: the whiche is alſo falſe. For I haue heard of credible perſonnes, that the greateſt part of that Iland doe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Olde Religion.</p>
            <p>Now wheras you require of me to beare with you, bicauſe you haue tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſomewhat freelie with me, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Engliſh ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, foſtred and brought vp of the Queenes Maieſtie, and of the affaires of England not ignorant: I com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mend your loue towardes your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, I commend your loyaltie towards your Prince, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend your knowlege of things gotten by long experience, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend alſo your freedom in ſpeache.
<pb facs="tcp:970:12"/>
But beware you doe not (ſo muche as in you lieth) ouerthrow your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, beware you bring not the Quene into daunger of her eſtate and life, and when you are pricked and yearked foorth with the goades of your owne madnes, beware you cloke not your erroneous beleefe and licentious life vnder the honeſt name of libertie. Ye promiſe aſſuredly that you meane to doe it, for no debate or diſſenſion of minde, whereas there can not be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any greater diſſenſion then this, you taking vpon you to mainteine, and I contrariwiſe to inuey againſt the moſt wicked and heinouſe malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the worlde.</p>
            <p>And where you ſaie, that your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to pul out of mens heartes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine falſe opinions that they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the ſtate of England: if you can ſo doe, you ſhal doe me a verie friendly pleaſure. But this one thing I meruaile much at, that you ſay, that my

writings might happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to cauſe this falſe rumor and infamie, that is now bruted of England. What ſay you Sir? Are you only ignoraunt, how long time it is ſence England was firſte charged with this infamouſe report? How was it poſsible, when the holie men Iohn Fiſher Biſhop of Rocheſter, and S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas More were openly put to death for their conſtancie in their faith and Religion: when the good Religiouſe Fathers the Carthuſians were with moſt cruel tormentes ſlaine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: when the houſes of Religion, in the whiche was appointed a manſion or dwelling place of perpetual chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, were laid wide open, and turned to prophane vſes: when many other mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes of holines were vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen and defaced: how was it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I ſaie, that England ſhoulde be without a very exceding greate infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie? But without cauſe, ſaie you. Be it ſo (if it pleaſe you) for I wil not

as yet diſpute for either part. Yet this muche I ſaie, that euen at that time there was a great brand of diſhoneſtie burnt into the eſtimation of Engliſh men. But you forſooth, that ſhoulde haue defended al thoſe thinges with maine pollicie and counſel, were not yet come to beare the ſwaie, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter being deſtitute of ſuch a ſpokeſman as you are, that opinion that was by the conſtant reporte and brute of al men diuulged, tooke place in al the Realmes of Chriſtendome.

put into my Oration, and what to be put out, I thinke it dependeth of my iudgement, and not of yours, whiche peraduenture knowe not, what my meaning is.</p>
            <p>You ſaie that, whereas I pretended in the beginning to doe ſome other thing, I fel at the length to taunting and defacing of Religion. That is trew in deede, if moſt vile and ſeditions he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie may be called Religion. You ſay that it is to no purpoſe for me to goe about to diſcharge manie Ingliſh men of the enuie of the facte, for that, (as you ſaie) their caſe and cauſe is al one. And to proue that, you declare the manner of England to be ſuch, that no law bindeth the people there, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be firſt decreed by the whole communaltie, receiued of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, approued by the Clergie, and laſt of al authoriſed by the King, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can not ſtand, that a lawe being made by the ful conſent and agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:970:14"/>
of al, ſome men ſhould ſuſteine blame, and ſome others ſhould be altogether void thereof. The law I like wel: But that it is not kept, I thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke itmuch to be miſliked. If the geuing of voices were free, and not wreſted and gotten out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men by threatning and puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, I would like your ſaing wel. But here to paſſe ouer with ſilence the lightnes and inconſtancie of the multitude, which may verie eaſilie be brought to any inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience either with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſeueritie, either with the ſhew of gentlenes: and withal to leaue that point vntouched, howe it is a thing impoſsible for euerie particular man to geaue his voice, but of force they muſt geue ouer their authoritie of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing voices vnto a few: I would you would teach me this one thing, (for I confeſſe plainely, that I am a ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and nothing expert in matters of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale) what horrible fact had the biſhop of Rocheſter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:970:14"/>
that neither the grauitie of his perſon, neither the dignitie of a Biſhop could ſaue him from death? Went he about anie treaſon againſt his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey? Had he conſpired the death of the Prince? Had he entred into talke with foraine ennemies to betraie his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale? Nothing leſſe. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he moſt conſtantlie refuſed to yeeld his conſent vnto a wicked ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, the holie and innocent man was ſo puniſhed, as though he had ben the moſt deteſtable traitour in the worlde.

But now what ſaie you to the Carthuſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, moſt vertuouſe, godly, and religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, men in pleading at the barre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acqueinted, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon affaires and practiſes of the world vnſkilful? Why were thei ſo cruellie handled? Why were they truſſed and hanged vppon gibbets? Whie were they diſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred and quartered in peaces? Whie were they finally burned and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed with fier? dowbtleſſe bicauſe they would not with their voice allow and make good a thing, that vnto them ſeemed wicked, heinouſe, and vnworthie to be named. What ſhal I ſay of the holie bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, whom you haue lode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fetters and chaines, whom you haue ſhut vp in darke and cloſe priſons, whom you haue robbed both of goods and honour? Haue you any thing elles to laie to their charge, but that they would not geue their aſfent to your
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:970:15"/>
ſtatutes, which ſemed to them vniuſt? And therfore it is no wonder, if other men being with ſuch cruel and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible puniſhments put in extreme feare be not ouer bold to declare their mind freelie in open place. For where the geuing of voices is not free, but forced of men by feare and terrour, there rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth, not the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of the whole, but the luſt and outrage of a few. You doe not therefore ſufficiently proue, that thoſe lawes were made and allowed by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon agreement and conſent of al ſtates. For it is manifeſt, that they were violently forced, and that who ſo euer did gaineſaie them, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely puniſhed.</p>
            <p>As touching my humble ſuite vnto the Queene, wherein I beſought her Maieſtie, that, if I were able by good argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to proue, that theſe authours or brochers of newe fanglednes did moſt daungerouſly and perniciouſly erre, it might pleaſe her to eſteme and
<pb facs="tcp:970:16"/>
hold their doctrine as vngodly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable: you ſay, that it is a falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation without ſtrength of argument: that it procedeth of ſtomake, and not of loue towardes the trewth: that it is grounded vpon a ſlaunder, and not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reaſon: that it is a reproch, and not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation laied vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground worke of religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You require of me the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſame thing, as I required of your Quene: that is to wit, that if you were able to ſhew, that I had without good cauſe found fault with the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your common weale, I ſhould repent me of myne offence.</p>
            <p>Firſt of al, I take Chriſt Ieſus to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (who only knoweth the ſecrettes of my hart) that I wrote thoſe my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters neither for hatred, neither for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, neither for reproche (as you ſay) but for earneſt good zeale and loue I beare to the trewth and to the welfare of the whole realme. For what haue Ingliſh men hurt me more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:970:16"/>
then other men? What wrong or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure haue thei done me? Trulie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a whit. But contrarie wiſe I haue ben informed by the letters both of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tonius Auguſtinus Biſhop of Ilerda, a man for his excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertues and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knowledge in the liberal ſciences, wel deſeruing the dignitie of a biſhop together with immortal fame (who was ſometime ſent from the biſhop of Rome legat vnto Quene Marie) as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the letters of Iohn Metellus a Burgonion, a man, whom for his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and ſwete conuerſation ioyned with rare giftes of learning I loue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie intierly: that manie great learned men in England did geaue m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a verie honourable report. Wherefore there was good cauſe, whie I ſhould rather loue Engliſh men, then malice or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile them. Neither did I euer thinke to reprooue your common weale, but the corrupt lewdnes of a fewe, which diſquieteth the whole realme.
<pb facs="tcp:970:17"/>
And whereas you charge me with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie for medling in a ſtraunge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale: I thinke it is no ſtraunge common weale, but myne owne. For I did not reaſon of the lawes of your Realme and ciuile ordinaunces, but of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion, for the which I am not afraid to looſe my life. And therefore ſhal I neuer thinke any thing to be impertinent to me, whereby I may mainteine and ſet foorth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this common weale. Conſider now, M. Haddon, how iuſt your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is. This is your demaund. If you can conuince and manifeſtly prooue, not that I am in any errour (for that were tolerable) but that I wrote my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle for hatred, euil wil, and reproch: you require of me to confeſſe my fault and to ſaie that I was ouer raſh, when I tooke vpon me to control your mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whiche I knew not. Can you on the other ſide prooue, whereas I mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t louingly, frindly, and religiouſly,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:970:17"/>
that it was done ſlaunderouſly, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and vntruly? But leſt you ſhould ſay, I deale to ſtraightly with you, this much I promiſe you faithfully. If you be able to proue, not that I wrote for any euil intent (for that is impoſsible) but that the rearing vp of this your newly framed religion is without all fault and blameleſſe, I wil repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me of my doyng. I am not ignorant, how daungerous a matter it is, to promiſe thus much to a man of law. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue a good affiaunce, that you ſhal not be able to circumuent me with any malicious and crafty fetch of the law, and my deſire is to diſcharge honeſt men of ſlaunderous reportes: I promiſe you thus much of myne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie: if you be able to proue, that thoſe felowes be honeſt, godlie, and religious men, whiche I take to be lewde and wicked verlettes, I will neuer ſpeake one word againſt you.</p>
            <p>You take it in ſnuffe M. Haddon,
<pb facs="tcp:970:18"/>
that I deale ſo boiſteouſly with your new maiſters, ſaing that I doo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thunder out againſt them moſt horrible and fyerie reproches, yea ſo much, that mans hart can not deuiſe any thing more deteſtable. Wherin I perceiue that you can not well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, what an argument, and what a reproch is. For I contended not with reprochful woordes, but with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, ſuch as you can not yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. Than you ſaie. <hi>Where are theſe monſters of Religion? What are thei? How long haue they continued?

For I loke for reaſons, and not for a vaine noiſe of wordes. But that, that you bring in vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, is a very toy and mockerie. Your woords be theſe. <hi>Declare the thinges, name the perſones, note the times, adde the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that we may haue ſome certaintie, wherin to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with you, as alſo to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you.</hi> I thinke, M. Haddon, it was longe, ere you were ſet to the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike ſchole, and that ye were not verie apte to learne it. You would be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Rhetorician, and yet you know not that Rhetorique is a prudencie or diſcretion in ſpeaking: ſo that what ſo euer is againſt diſcretion, is not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient in this arte, whiche you went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to learne at an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient time. There is a rule of the law, vſual in iu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, which is this.

declared, what oportunitie he had, what time, what occaſion, what pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale, what hope to eſcape, what ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went before, what came after, with all other circumſtances, which maie before the iudges increaſe the ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fact. Now ſir when your maiſter (which as it ſemeth, was but meanelie ſeene in theſe matters) had taught you this rule: you thought it wolde ſerue in al cauſes, not only in iudgemente, but els where: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you require of me ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as the cauſe did nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. For my meaning was not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe any man, but to aduertiſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Quene, that ſhe ſhould not ſuffer her ſelfe to be brought to any inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience. If you or any ſuch as you are were to be arreined, what? ſhould we, in a matter openlie knowen and not denied, but defended to be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, vſe ſuch argumentes, conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and circumſtances as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:970:19"/>
Not ſo. But it were ſufficient to declare, that your doinges were heinouſe and vngodlie. And he that ſhould otherwiſe doe, might worthely be laught to ſcorne as a trifling and a fooliſh babler. Why then Sir? If you neither vnderſtande what is decent, neither conſider what the cauſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, neither perceiue the difference of thinges: is it meete, that I ſhoulde be punniſhed for your ignorance? I thinke not ſo. But whereas my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, not to arreine any man, but only to admoniſhe your Prince, that ſhe would put awaie from her ſelfe and her realme the peril that hangeth ouer them: could I doo any leſſe, but ſet the greatnes of the daunger before her eyes? And bicauſe the greateſt daunger in the wordle is, to take a falſe religion for a true: I ſhewed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine markes, by the whiche a man might diſcerne falſe and diueliſh here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, from true and godly religion. Thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:970:20"/>
markes, if they be falſe, reproue them: if they be not manifeſt, conuince me of ignorance: if they offend not you, hold your peace: if vnwares I touched you at the quicke, ſhew your greefe.</p>
            <p>Monſters of Religion I know there are verie manie, if they be not yet come into England, I am glad for your countreis ſake: and I confeſſe I was in an errour, when I thought that your Iland had ben peſtered with diuers and ſundrie kindes of ſuch monſters. But your bare denyal is no ſufficient Conſutation. You muſt vſe manifeſt proofes: you muſt declare by good reaſon, that I was in an errour, and then I will ſaie, that you are an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent felow. But if you can not doo this, but only prate and talke: I am not bounde to beleeue you. A litle after ye ſaie thus. <hi>You crie out againſt religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you fight againſt the ſetters foorth of religion, in theſe two pointes you vſe much bitter talke, and yet in neither of

them both do you tel vs either what it is, or where it is.</hi> Sir either you haue not read my letters, or if you haue, the meaning of them, whiche is verie plaine, you vnderſtande not (ſuche is peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture the dulnes of your witte). Could any man ſet foorth more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with wordes, the infamous doinges of men, the great owtrage, and cruell impietie of their procedinges? Anon after, ye take a peece as it maie appere out of ſome other ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s oration, and ſet it in for your owne, in a place nothing to the purpoſe. theſe be your wordes. <hi>This your accuſation is verie pitiful, the which if I anſwere but with one woord, ther is no remedie, you muſt needes hold your peace.</hi> It is euen ſo, ſir, you haue made a great ſpeake. The thinges that you haue done, the deuiſes and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that you haue wrought, al was don in darkenes and huggermugger.

               </gap>, no ſignes
<pb facs="tcp:970:21"/>
and tokens by the which a man might come to the knowledge of your doinges. Then you ſaie thus. <hi>You crie, yea with gaping mowth, and that verie lamentably: that this newly deuiſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be ſhunned, abandoned, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, that the begynners of it were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchieuous perſons, murderers, cutthrotes, poiſoners, ouerthrowers of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales, ennemies of mankind.</hi> Surely this talke that you aſcribe vnto me, is yours, and not myne, how be it I am not angry with you for the deuiſing of it. For ſuch heinouſe offenſes would be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp with much ſharper wordes then theſe be. But ſir how anſwere you theſe thinges? Full ſtowtly I warrant you, they can not be denied. Yet thus you ſaie. <hi>I conſtantly affirme, that ther is no ſuch thing: I beleeue not you, I require to be inſtructed. What ſaie you? What proue you?</hi> Oh what an eloquent felow is this, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo eaſily with one clauſe or ſentence, and that verie ſhort, ſhut

vp the whole matter? How manfully you ſtand to your defence? How wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily you kepe out your ennemie? In good ſooth I can not but muſe at your, folie, to ſee, vpon how ſmal occaſion (when you haue ſaid nothing at all) you fal to crying out, as though you had vttered ſome excellent matter. I ſaid in that my epiſtle, that the Virgins or Nunnes conſecrated vnto God, were defiled with incoſtuous wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke: I ſaid that the images of Saincts, and of the Croſſe, yea and of Chriſt him ſelfe crucified, were pulled out of their places, and broken in peaces. I ſaid, that the olde Religion was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and a new ſet vp in the place of it. Other thinges I let paſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing them to their conuenient places. What ſaieth M. Haddon to al this? Al theſe thinges confuteth he, like an Oratour, with one word: and driueth me to the wall, that I can goe no farder. <hi>I beleue you not,</hi> ſaieth he, <hi>I

               </gap>inly, that thinges that are commonly reported to haue ben done in England, were neuer done. If it be ſo, I muſt bring witneſſes. And prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If you denie it, then will I call other witneſſes to teſtifie for me, if nede ſhall ſo require. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward yo bring in theſe wordes. <hi>You crie out as lowd as you can, heaping toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the villanous woordes in the worlde, whiche, it ſeemeth, you haue ſorted out, and ſet a ſide for the nonce, to deface this your counterfaict religion, and to ſticke and kill certaine perſonnes, which no man knoweth but your ſelfe.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:970:22"/>
I praie you, M. Haddon, ſobre your ſelfe a litle, but euen ſo longe, as you maie peruſe, againe this your talke. You ſhall ſee your ſelfe, that you were ſtarke madde, when you wrote theſe thinges. For you vtter ſuche matter, as neither I, nor you your ſelfe doo vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>You ſaie, that I doo deface my counterfaicte religion with woordes of villanie. I omitte the name of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaicte Religion, as though I had ben the authour or begynner of any newe Religion at all. But how ſhould I my ſelfe deface myne owne Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which I doo mainteine and with dew praiſe ſet out? This would I faine learne of you.</p>
            <p>Then for the perſonnes, which you ſaie I ſticke, I wold gladly vnderſtand what they are. As for Luther with his adhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and folowers I take them for moſt wicked and infamous perſones,
<pb facs="tcp:970:23"/>
and ſuch in dede I doo a litle pricke in my writinges. Theſe are the perſons, which you ſaie no man knoweth but I. And you for ſooth, know them not: and yet you commend them highly, which is a point of meruelouſe great ouerſight in you to commend ſuch as you know not. But you, will neither ſaie ſo, neither can you wel tell, what you wolde ſaie. Doubtleſſe it were better, to be do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, then to vtter ſuch matter, as no man neither ſad nor mad can vnderſtand.</p>
            <p>You accuſe me that I haue defamed your moſt noble Iland, being thervnto brought by pelting rumours of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſe perſones. Whie then, ſir, you graunt, that I haue deuiſed nothing, but what I haue ſpoken, I was moued to ſpeake by common report. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer I haue alreadie declared, that I ſpake not againſt the whole Iland, as you ſaie, but only againſt the brochers of your new fangled Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:970:23"/>
Now whereas I ſaid, that hereſie and ſectes are popular, which is verie daungerous and noiſome to Princes, that minde to rule like kinges, (wherin you M. Haddon, find great fault with me) if I prooue it not by good reaſon, I am content, you ſhal take me, yea and proclaime me as a ſlaunderer. But of this we wil talke hereafter.</p>
            <p>The miſchieuouſe practiſe of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherwith it is reported that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Princes haue ben killed, you pourge with two examples taken out of your auncient Cronicles. For you ſaie, that the Emperour Henrie the fourth was made awaie by the treaſon of a monke, that gaue him the bleſſed Sacrament infected with poiſon. You ſaie alſo that Iohn king of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was by the like man and maner poiſoned. I know that both theſe tales are proued to be ſlaunderous lyes by good and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued writers. But to my matter, whether it were ſo or not, it ſkilleth
<pb facs="tcp:970:24"/>
litle. Neither did I euer ſaie, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Martin Luther there was no man that could I kill in poiſon, or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him ther was neuer ill monke or frier in the wordle. But thus much I ſaid, that when ſuch offences are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in common weales, by men not ſo well trained in godlie life: it were expedient, that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed, by the puritie of this your moſt vnſpotted diſcipline, by the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vertue of your goſpell, by the goodlie redreſſe that your Doctours haue brought to the wordle. The whiche being nothing ſo, but all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the contrarie, (for it is manifeſte that within theſe thirtie yeares laſt paſt manie moe conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies haue ben wrought againſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then in many hundred yeares before) I maie boldly ſaie, that the operation of this your medicine is not ſo effectuall, as you take it to be. Soone after ye ſaie thus. <hi>But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:970:24"/>
theſe thinges particularly vnto you, is not nedeful, whiche being neerer vnto ſuch miſchiefes then I am maie the better learne out of your neighbours bookes: how often the cuppos of poiſon haue walked emongeſt the Princes and rulers of the Churche of Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how and by whome the ſedes of diſcorde and warres haue ſuffered thorough all the common weales of the Chriſtian Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> You are a wonderful fellow M. Haddon. This obſcure and intricate maner of ſpeaking liketh you merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly well. I praie you what woulde you ſaie, when you ſaie that I am nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnto ſuch miſchiefes? Meane you that I am neerer, as acceſſarie to ſuch faultes? If you ſaie ſo (as your wordes ſeeme to importe), you are not well acqueinted with my manners. If you ſaie, I am of that countrei, wher poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is oftentimes geuen to Princes in meates and drinkes, that is falſe alſo. For there is no cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey in the worlde,
<pb facs="tcp:970:25"/>
where the name of a king is more reuerenced then here. If you ſaie that I am neerer vnto Rome, where ſuch thinges are ſometimes vſed, ſurely you haue not wel learned the ſituations and diſtances of countreis. For we are much farder from the citie of Rome then you are. Whereas you ſaie, that the ſeedes of warres haue ſuffered, what your meaning is, I aſſure you I can not tel. Except peraduenture the printer miſtooke, and for this woorde <hi>Diſperſa,</hi> put in vnwares <hi>perpeſſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As towching the heades or prelates of the Churche, whiche were made awaie with poiſon: I graunt that ſuch wicked actes haue ſometimes ben co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. For it chaunceth often, that, where a man wolde leaſt looke for it, there reigneth moſt the heinouſe vices of coueteouſnes and ambition: out of the which two fountaines ſpringeth al euils to the deſtruction of mankind. Yet this I warne you, that it is muche
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:970:25"/>
looked for, that the redreſſe of al theſe euils ſhould procede from your Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelike diſcipline, which pretendeth in outward ſhew to make an end of al enormities.</p>
            <p>But ſir, what is it, that you beare your ſelfe ſo hohly, ſo godly, ſo reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, yeelding vnto God thankes with ſo kind and mindful hart, for the benefite of this your Goſpel. Thus you ſaie. <hi>I humbly hold vp my handes vnto the immortal God, thanking him hartily, that it hath pleaſed him, by the riſing of the ſonne of his Goſpel openly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mongest vs, to driue awaie the moſt depe darkenes of the times past: through the lack of whoſe knowledge, and through the affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of ſuperstition, we walowed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without care in the ſinke of vice, beleeuing that by the lead of Bulles, and by the mumbling of praiers not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, was purged, what ſo euer ſinne might be committed in this life.</hi> What more godlie praier could be deuiſed
<pb facs="tcp:970:26"/>
than this? You thanke God, that you are deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt perilous darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, yea and that through the light and ſhining of the goſpel, which was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſet out, not by Matthew, Iohn or any other holy Euangeliſt, but by Luther, Melanchton, Zwinglius, and ſuche other worſhipful ſquiers lately dropte out from heauen. And ſo being deliuered through the benefit of this proſperous and luckie goſpel from the ſtincking dich of al filthines, in the which you wallowed before (as you confeſſe your ſelfe) hauing affiaunce in ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: you are now no more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte vnto the brandes of fleſhly luſt: you are no more troubled with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: you are not occupied in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome cares of coueteouſnes: you are not puffed vp with pride and vaine glorie: you truſt no more to fraude, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and lying. For it is like, that haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g receiued the brightnes of heauenly light, ye diſpiſed foorth with al worldly thinges, and were inflamed with the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:970:26"/>
deſire of heauenlie life, yea and (that more is) of the diuine nature it ſelfe. Who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deny, if this be ſo, but that ſo wonderful an alteration of life doth moſt manifeſtly declare the verie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt him ſelfe? But I would faine learne this of you, whether you alone in al England, doe enioye theſe ſo great benefites, or whether thei be common to al ſuche, as haue receiued the brightnes of your new goſpel. If you alone haue the fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this light with ſo great fruict of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh ſay you, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one. for as the ſonne riſing driueth awaie the darkenes from the eyes of al men: euen ſo the brightnes of this goſpel putteth awaie the myſte that was caſt ouer all mens heartes. Al thinges are now laid open, al thinges
<pb facs="tcp:970:27"/>
are come to light. Ther are no faultes in the worlde, no wicked offences, no heinouſe crimes, no, none at al. Ther is great good cauſe, if this tale be true, whie we ſhould forſake our owne countrei, and come to dwel in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that we might be partakers of this your felicitie with you. For what could a man deſire more of God, then alwaies to behold ſuche a countrei, where, for the greater part, neither coueteouſnes, norſenſualitie, nor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, nor pride, nor contention, nor raſhnes, nor any other ſpot of vncleane life may take place. But, Sir, I praie you: What was the let, whie you vſed no iuſtice or godlines, before this new ſonne beames ſhone vpon you? Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſuperſtition, you ſaie. for we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, that through the vertue of a peece of lead, and the mumbling of a few praiers, whiche we vnderſtoode not, al our offences were forgeauen vs, what ſoeuer we had done in this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:970:27"/>
worlde. What ſaie you? is it to be thought you were al ſo mad, that you wolde thinke a ſinne conceiued in the hart to be forgeauen through the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a peece of lead, or by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of praiers, the mind being otherwiſe occupied? What a great dulnes of witte was that? what a ſtraunge folie? who had put that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into your hartes? Were there no men emongeſt you learned in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſcriptures, to teach you, that al the hope of ſaluation conſiſteth in the grace and mercie of Chriſt? Trulie I hold vp my handes moſt humbly vnto the immortal God (as you pretend to doe) yeelding him moſt hartie tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, that it was my chaunce to be borne and brought vp in Spaigne, where no man (if he be a Chriſtian) was euer ſo fooliſh as to thinke, that there is any other waie to pourge ſynne, but only by the grace and goodnes of Chriſt. The which to atteine, the neceſſarie
<pb facs="tcp:970:28"/>
and onely meane is according to the doctrine of Chriſt him ſelfe, to deteſt and forſake vice, to confeſſe our ſinnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted with baſhfulnes and ſorow, to withdraw our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſenſualitie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinencie, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vice to honeſtie, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> malice to charitie, to enter into a new trade of life, and to exerciſe our ſelues in holy workes. Now ſir, of you tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſo much to lead, that ye thought it of force to blot out ſinne: you were not wel in your wit. If you ſaie that al England was in the like blindnes, you bring a great ſlaunder of madnes vpon your countrie, that hath brought you vp and placed you in ſo great worſhip. No, ſay you, I ſaie not ſo. But I meane by the name of lead, in the whiche we ſaw the name and image of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome engraued, the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and iuriſdiction of the Pope him ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, the which manie hundred yeres agoe, was holden and eſteemed as a thing verie holie, of our Fathers and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:970:28"/>
afterward of vs. This authoritie, which we ſometime reuerenced, being now inſtructed by the moſt cleere doctrine of this goſpel, I doe neglecte, deſpiſe, contemne, and thinke it to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a thing of naught of all wiſe men. Whie then, M. Haddon, what needed you the name of lead to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie this authoritie? Did you it, to make it more odiouſe? Or rather thought you by ieſting at the woord to gette the greater applauſe of your compagnions? For I knowe, that pleaſaunt ſporters, as you be, are muche delighted with ieſting, and like to contend not ſo much with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes and ſentences, as with ſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fing, and (as it ſeemeth to me) with an vnſauerie kind of pratling. In ſuche like ſcoffes and tauntes Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Luther your youthlie Patriarke and olde wanton was a great doer. And I dowbt not but ſome of your clawebackes, when he came to this
<pb facs="tcp:970:29"/>
place, tooke vp a great laughter, and bound it with an oth, that it was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous pleaſauntly ſpoken, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently wel handled. For al thinges are ſo farre out of courſe and dew order, that it is a verie eaſie matter for a ſawcie reprochful ſcoffer, to get the name of a merie felowe and pleaſaunt compagnion.</p>
            <p>But as concerning this matter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Biſhop of Angra hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed verie learnedly of the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Biſhop of Rome: yet wil I reaſon with you (as with a ſeculare man and ciuilian) of the ſaid matter in few wordes. Firſt of al let this be a <note place="margin">The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of the Church.</note>grounde worke or foundation. The Church of Chriſt is one and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. Then let this be agreed vppon. It is not ynough for a Prince, whiche maketh lawes to eſtabliſh a common weale, to ſet them out, except he alſo appoint gouernours and inferiour ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. Let this alſo be the third
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:970:29"/>
ground. (for ſo much as you like wel myne opinion as touching the order of a Monarchie) that it is moſt expedient for a common Weale well appointed with cuſtomes and lawes, to be vnder the rule of one Prince. For many doe teare and diſmembre a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, but one by ſupreme authoritie vniteth and as it were with glew, ioineth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heartes of the people. It was therfore moſt agreable to the beſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of gouernement, when the Prince of al Princes (vnder whoſe euerlaſting Empire are ſubiected both heauen and earth) intended to ſet vp a heauenlie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale in earth: that he ſhould firſt make Lawes, and then creat Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Magiſtrates, which might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcribed order of Lawes and equitie, rule this common weale. Suche were the Apoſtles and the reſt of the Diſciples of Chriſte. Laſt of al, leſt the band of this ſocietie might be diſſolued, and the peace of
<pb facs="tcp:970:30"/>
the Citie diſtourbed: he appointed a Monarchie, and gaue the ſupreme go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement thereof vnto Peter. Are not theſe thinges commonly knowen of all men? Ymagine you to obſcure and darken thinges moſt clearely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? Truſt you ſo muche to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that you thinke your ſelfe able to wreſt the wordes of the Goſpell from the true meaning, to ſerue the filthie appetite and luſt of you and your com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panions? I pray you what can be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more plainely and cleerelie then <note place="margin">Mat. <hi>16.</hi> c.</note>thoſe woordes? Thou arte Peter, ſaith Chriſt, and vpon this rocke I wil build my Churche. And what ſo euer thou ſhalt bind vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, it ſhalbe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <note place="margin">Luc. <hi>22.</hi> d.</note>in heauen. And againe. I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not, and thou being turned, confirme thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And many other places of like effect, which do manifeſtly proue, that Peter had a Prerogatiue aboue the reſt of the Apoſtles. But you wil ſaie for al
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:970:30"/>
this, that theſe teſtimonies of the holy ſcriptures, which we haue alleged, are expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded farre otherwiſe of the new Apoſtles. I wil ſet againſt the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of your Apoſtles, the authoritie of S. Ambroſe, Auguſtine, Hierome, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile and all other holie men, that haue with their writings geuen light to the Church of Chriſt. But now your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours wil anſwere, that although it be true that the ſupreme authoritie was graunted to Peter, yet foloweth it not, that it was geuen to his ſucceſſours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Why then I aſke you an other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Did Chriſte ſet vp a Church to continue but for one mans life? Or els minded he to eſtabliſh it for euer? If he appointed, that his Church ſhould ſtande ſo little time, he didde not ſo great a thing, as was to be looked for of his infinite bountie and wiſedome: for ſo muche as he beſtowed ſo much labour and diligence, yea and ſhedde ſo muche bloud about a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale,
<pb facs="tcp:970:31"/>
whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance was limited within the bounds of ſo ſhort time. If he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that his church ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue for euer: then doubtleſſe he ſet it in ſuch order, as ſhould in al chaunges and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of times be mainteined and kept. If it be then euident (as it is moſt euident and plaine) that Peter had a Superioritie ouer the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: it muſt needes folowe, that the ſame preeminence or principalitie, of right apperteineth to al ſuche as haue ſucceded in Peters roome and charge. Or els, in the Church of Chriſt, which is one, it might ſeeme there was ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not the order of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, but the gouernement of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. And then what knot or band of concord were there in the Churche? By whoſe authoritie ſhoulde the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtes riſen in it be aſſwaged? By whome ſhould ſeditious opinions and ſects be rooted out? By whom ſhould pride and ſtubbornes be reſtreined and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:970:31"/>
kept vnder: if there had ben no man appointed in the Church from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, by whoſe authoritie all men ſhould be kept in order? No we for ſo much as the church of Chriſt is ſimple and one: and one it can not be, vnleſſe there be in it one only Prince: further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more being euidente and plaine, that Chriſt ordeined one onely ruler in his Church, whom al men ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge and obeie: finally being out of al doubt, that this preeminence apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth to the Succeſſours of Peter, and that none of al the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Fathers endewed with the ſpirit and grace of God euer doubted, but that the biſhops of Rome were the ſucceſſours of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as bothe their writinges, and the common agreement of the vniuerſall Church declareth): with what ſprite were your newe Apoſtles moued to bring in this new Goſpelliſh doctrine, to diſtourbe the order appointed by Chriſte, to breake the bande of vnitie
<pb facs="tcp:970:32"/>
and concord, to ſhake the very Rocke and ſtaie of the Churche. But leſt ſome man ſhuld thinke, that theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were wrought of them without any cauſe in the world, I wil briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, what their deuiſe, or rather what the fetch of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in this enterpriſe. It was vnpoſsible that euer the peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſects ſhould gather any ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, except the authoritie of the Biſhop of Rome had ben firſt weakned. For how could the miſchieuous weede haue growen any long time, whereas it was a very eaſy matter with the authoritie of the Biſhop of Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forthwith to cut it doune, ſo ſoone as it appeared aboue the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Take vs (ſaith the ſpouſe of <note place="margin">Caut, <hi>2.</hi> d.</note>Chriſt) the litle foxes, that deſtroy the Vineyardes. This requeſt of the ſpouſe who ſhalbe able to fulfil, if noman haue authoritie to ſuppreſſe the malice and lewdnes of heretikes, before it waxe great? For it is manifeſt that by the fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are vnderſtode heretikes. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Nowe the railes and barres being after this manner broken downe, and the gates laid wide open, it was a very caſie matter for al vile and deſperate felowes to ruſh in, to mangle and teare in peeoes the vnitie of the Churche, to bring in ſo many wicked errours, ſuche horrible ſectes, ſuche a

Do you ſo requite Luther, to whome you are bound for this ſingular benefite? For it was he that draue all feare out of your hartes. What terrour is this that you ſpeake of? What feare? What carefulneſſe of minde? Suche is the faith, that Luther deuiſed, as being once well planted in your hearte, no feare in the worlde ſhall euer be able
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:970:34"/>
to ſhake the quietnes and ſecuritie of your conſcience. And, me thinketh, that it is not to be borne, that you ſaie, you doe deſpiſe the deuiſes of men. For you are not ſo farre forewarde in the waie of heauenly life, but that you make good accompte of ſome men. For the diuiſes of Luther, Zwinglius, Bucer, Caluin, and ſuch other as were the founders of this your new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weal, you haue learned them, you haue greedily ſnatched them vppe, yea you haue with heart and minde embraced them, ſtriuinge within your ſelues, who ſhoulde be foremoſte in them, finallie you haue decreed to frame the order of your life after their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whereby we gather, you looke not ſo ſteddilie to heauenwarde, but that ſometimes you looke downe vppon menne. And well donne too ſurelie. For righte and reaſon requireth, that you ſhoulde alwaies haue bothe in your eyes and heartes
<pb facs="tcp:970:35"/>
ſuche men as they were, ſo chaſte, ſo holie, and ſo religious. But yeat this muche I tel you by the waie, your minde was not ſo feruently inflamed with the loue of heauenly thinges, but that you did highly eſteeme ſome men withal. Admitte that Frier Luther had ben a holie man (euen as holie as you liſt to make him) that Melanchon had ben void of al earthlie affection: that Zuinglius for the meruelouſe reporte of ſincere and chaſte life had ben ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be one of Gods owne priuie cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel: that Bucer had excelled al men in cleane, honeſt, and chaſt conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that Caluine had paſſed in vertue and holines Bernarde, Anſelme, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Ierome, Baſile, and al other holy men, that haue lead an angelike life here vpon the earth: yea adde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe (if it pleaſe you) euen your owne Martyr, whoſe rare vertue you commend ſo highly: Admitte I ſaie, that theſe men had ben moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:970:35"/>
furniſhed with al the higheſt vertues, yea and moſt chaſte withal: yet were they men, and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible, but that they might haue ben in ſome errours. And yet doo you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme their lawes, decrees, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as a diſcipline of moſte high wiſedome, and as a moſt holie rule of mans life. With what face then ſaie you, that you deſpiſed, and reiected the deuiſes of men, whereas you doo aſcribe vnto thoſe menne that I haue here named, almoſte a diuine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? But now let vs conſider the ende of your oration. Soone after you bring in this clauſe. <hi>Hauing in like manner regarde vnto the ſaying of the Prophete, where he commaundeth vs, that wee ſhould confourme the innocencie of our life vnto holineſſe and iuſtice.</hi> In this place I merueiled excedingly, not at you, M. Haddon (for it is not credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſo graue a man as you be, ſhould lie ſo impudently) but at the
<pb facs="tcp:970:36"/>
ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous report of men, which with feined tales, and forged co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaintes (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing vs being ſtraungers, and ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (as you ſay) of your affaires haue made vs beleeue that you conforme you ſelues, not vnto holines of life by the law of God, but vnto licentious lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes through vnbridled luſte and bolde preſumption. And the doctrine of that mad felowe Martine Luther made it ſeeme the more probable, the whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning wickedly al good workes, and burning at a ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and holie ordinaunces of the Church, and teaching for a ſownd doctrin this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous affiaunce, vnto the which alone he aſcribeth ſaluation, calling it raſhly and impudently by the name of faithe, and putting quitte out of mens hartes al feare of lawes bothe of God and man, ſetteth out ſenſualitie in her ful ſtrength and force, geaueth fleſhlie luſt free ſcope and libertie, pretendeth hoope of impunitie, boldeneth men to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:970:36"/>
al ſynne and wickednes. Wherefore I thought it impoſsible, that a man obſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing his preceptes, ſhould withal geue his mind to iuſtice, vertue and religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or take great care how to keepe him ſelfe chaſt and honeſt. For it is the part of a wiſe man, when he ſeeth the cauſe to doubte nothing of the euent. And it is commonly ſeene, that naughtie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynninges haue the like ending. What ſhould I then do? Seing iuſt cauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie, hearing it moſt commonly, yea and ſadly reported, that you are in farre worſe caſe, then you pretende to be: weying withal the conſtant fame, which is, that ſuch as folowe this new religion, are not only ſubiect to fleſhly and vncleane liuing, but alſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in al wicked and heinouſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: ſhould I not beleeue it?

<pb facs="tcp:970:37"/>
of al men confirming this opinion? I could not doe it. Wherfore if that be falſe, whiche was conſtantly and not without inward ſorow of al good men reported, you muſt pardon me, and lay the fault vnto the lightnes and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of certaine men bearing you no good wil, whiche were the deuiſers of this falſe report. But if it be true that is reported, then are you a very madde man, if you thinke by lying and facing to waſh out the ſpot of true infamie.</p>
            <p>Here you muſe againe what I mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to aduertiſe your Queene, to beware of ſuche as are infected with theſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies. And here I tel you againe, that, when I come to that place, I wil doo my endeuour ſo to handle it, that you ſhal no more muſe at it.</p>
            <p>You declare vnto me the felicitie of your Quene, that ſhe aboundeth in riches, that ſhe liueth in proſperitie, that ſhe feareth no treaſon, neither of her owne ſubiectes, neither of foren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

I am right glad of it, and I pray God graunt her alwaies a good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous and flouriſhing reigne.

but your maiſters haue brought you like an ignorant felowe to beleeue it. <hi>S.

               <hi>If Monkes had leued according to

the rules of Baſile, no man woulde euer haue touched them with ſo much as his finger.</hi> As though your quarel had ben againſt men, and not againſt chaſtitie it ſelfe. But admit that their manners were looſe, their behauiour diſſolute, their life wanton. What then? was there none emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt them al, that kept their chaſtitie?

wherſoeuer they ſet their foote, they leaue behind them moſt manifeſt foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteppes of baſhfulnes and honeſty. But admit that the greater part of them had ben drowned in vice: was it therefore good reaſon by and by, to ouerthrow the whol order? How much had it ben more for your honeſty, to haue don as the moſt puiſſaunt King Fernandus did ſometime in Spaigne and Elizabeth his wife, a Princeſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting fame? as the moſt honorable king and renoumed Prince Emanuel: as Iohn the third his ſonne, a King for his religion and godlines worthy of moſt high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation: as Charles the fifth an emperour born to immortal glorie: as Euricus the Cardinal ſonne of king Emanuel, in whom ſhineth a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful light of al vertue and holines: finally as all other moſte religious Princes did: who ſeing the manners of monkes to tende towardes a niceneſſe, ſent for certaine perfecte religious menne, by

whoſe diligence their vnbridled affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and licentiouſnes was tied vp, their looſe manners by ſtreighter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline reſtreined, and their ſleapie mindes ſtyrred vp to the moſt feruent loue of godlines.

Furthermore the patrones of the Church (as it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you to call them) perced him thorough with their writinges, and ſet out his name to all the poſteritie, diſhoneſted with the fowle ſpottes of his moſt heinouſe and filthie life.

rage of the baſe people: and did ſo beare them ſelues in euerie office, that it might ful wel appere, that they were no free men, but the verie bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues of the vndiſcret and mad peple. And the better to bring this matter to paſſe they marked verie dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, not only what the people longed for, but alſo whome they enuied at for wealth and richeſſe: and ſo brought al men of power and richeſſe to be enuied, ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp the moſt earneſt hatred of the commons againſt their Princes, ſet fire vnto the hote rage of the multitude, therwith to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume and waſt al ſuch as were in high authoritie and honour in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales.

Theſe are they, that are wont to be called Populars.</p>
            <p>Now it remaineth, that we declare, whether frier Luther were Popular after this manner. Is there anie doubt in the wordle of the matter? What other thing, I praie you, intended Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only to flatter the people? Al ſuch thinges as the people hated and lothed, did he not take them quite

For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luther denied, that ſyn was quite blotted out in holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the grace of Chriſt, he affirmed, that ther was none other iuſtice, but onely the ſingular
<pb facs="tcp:970:59"/>
iuſtice of Chriſte, applied to euerie particular man by faith, were he neuer ſo ſynnefull and wicked: the whiche being but one in all men, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible, that there ſhoulde be anie difference in the worlde betwene the iuſtice of anie common man, and the iuſtice of Paule or Peter, yea or of the moſt holie Virgine mother of God. And you demaund of me what thoſe monſters of religion are. Al theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whiche I haue here moſt briefely compriſed, I ſaie, are the moſt horrible monſters of religion: and the father of them is not villanous, but villanie it ſelfe: not frantike and madde, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie frantikenes and madnes it ſelfe. What ſhew of baſhfulnes, honeſtie or modeſtie could you ſee in this man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ouerthrower of all honeſtie, continencie, and modeſtie? What glimſe of vertue could he ſo daſel your eyes withal, that you woulde ſuffer your ſelfe. to be ſo daungerouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:970:59"/>
in him? And yet wil you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewe in your errour as you haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne. And yet wil you acquite ſuche a peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſecte as blameleſſe and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faulte? And yet will you liken the good holie Fathers to Luther a moſte vile and infamous caitiue.</p>
            <p>But you triumph excedingly, that he ſtoode ſo ſtiffe thirtie yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was neuer puniſhed for his naughtines and owtrage. Can you imagin anie greater puniſhment in the worlde, then the remembrance of a ſynneful and filthie life? The remorſe of his heinouſe offences made him ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly afraied. The feendes of hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of damned ſowles vexed his mind. The ennemie the diuel ſhooke him vp, and would not ſuffer him once to breath or reſt him ſelfe. Truth it is, he woulde banket and make good cheere with his freendes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſomewhat relent his intenſif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Being at ſupper with his frinds ouer night he quaffed ſomewhat free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the nexte morning was founde dead.</p>
            <p>You ſaie afterward, that there were brought into England by the goodnes of God a golden couple of olde men, Martin Bucere, and Peter Martyr, whoſe vertues you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend aboue the ſkies. Of them I haue nothing elles to ſay, but that I thinke them to be verie lewde and naughtie felowes, if for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, yet for this cauſe onely, that you ſo highly commend them. for he that commendeth Luther, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that he ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend any thing that is godly, honeſt, or holy.</p>
            <p>Whereas you put me in mind that I ſhould ſomewhat temper my ſtyle, and not cal ſuch men arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and prowde,

You are ſo doubteful, ſo diuers, and ſo ſlipperie, that you can not wel tel your ſelues, what you thinke, and what you mind to ſtand to. And yet when you ſpake thoſe wordes, you commended them that acknowledge nothing elles but the holy Scriptures, and refuſe al holy traditions and ordinaunces. Theſe are your wordes. <hi>Truely if it were ſo, then folowed they the example of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, then folowed they the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Apoſtles, and of the auncient Fathers in the primitiue Church.</hi> How many things you laie out at a venture?
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:970:62"/>
It is like forſooth that Chriſt the mind and wiſedome of God the Father, by whoſe power and diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſation the law it ſelfe was made, by whom the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes declared thinges to come, of whom al holie men of old time recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their light, was content to abyde that lawe him ſelfe, that he would not be ſo hardie, as to ſpeake one woorde, which he founde not regiſtred in the holy Scriptures.

But nowe to come to other pointes, of the birth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding of God: of the regeneration of men in heauenlie life, the whiche Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus <note place="margin">10. 3. <hi>a</hi>

But when Chriſt ſpake theſe wordes, there was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:970:63"/>
no Goſpell yet written, neyther did any writen monumente confirme the ſayinges of Chriſt, but looke what he ordeined by woordes, was afterward put in writing, to the ende that men ſhould not forgette it. I doe here let paſſe many thinges (minding not to proſecute al that might be ſaied, for ſo muche as I haue alreadie ſpoken ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie) to the intent you might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand howe vnaduiſedly you haue ſaied, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt did alſo obſerue ſuch a rule in his doinges.

What ſhould I ſpeake of that, <note place="margin">Act. <hi>15.</hi> e.</note>that the Apoſtles ſay in their Councel? It hath ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and vs? They ſaie not. It is writen in the holie Scripture: but, It hath ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med good to the holie Ghoſt and vs. Nowe as touching the holie Fathers, which peraduenture you neuer read, how durſt you affirme of them, that they neuer brought in any thing for the gouernement of the Churche, but what thei had found writen in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scriptures? How many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſeth S. Baſile, and diſputeth that thei were deliuered from the Apoſtles vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Churche, onely by woorde of mouth? How many ſuch things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited of Cyprian, Chryſoſtom, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, and the reſt of the holie Fathers? How much do they reuerence al ſuch holy ordinaunces, as were decreed in general Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels? I do here omitte an

For in times paſt, al heretikes in a manner held this opinion, that nothing ought to be receiued, vnleſſe it were written in the holie Scriptures, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal to wreſt and corrupt the holie Scriptures with their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. But the holie Fathers moſt earneſtly defended the contrary, alleaging Argumentes and Examples brought euen from the Apoſtles time, and by the decrees of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels directed they al their doinges. Wherfore ſuche thinges as you report of Chriſt, of his Diſciples, and of the holie Fathers, are al moſt euidently falſe. You ſay, it is not true, that your Doctours ſhould take any thing vppon them, aboue the

            <p>You ſay that I am not able to ſhew any fault or diſhoneſtie in the worlde in their life. That is true, if we muſt needes ſtand to your opinion: For ſo much as emongeſt you neither filthie pleaſure of the bodie, nor rebellion, nor any other diſordre or outrage are accompted as faults.</p>
            <p>You find faulte with me, for that I ceaſe not to trifle daungerouſly, and to hinder the eſtimation of moſt graue perſonages, by whoſe diligence your

            <p>

And of like the greadie deſire you had of the goods and poſseſsions, with the which the Nonnes and Monkes were mainteined, holpe the matter well foreward. If you had had no face at al, no ſhame, no baſhfulnes in the world, how could you with more vile and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie language haue diſhoneſted ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a trade of life?

Could any thing be more impudently ſpoken? And yet you content not your ſelfe with al this ſtincking ſturre of wordes, but you ſay moreouer, that the tender young maidens, and the ſeelie boies were violently thruſt into the ſaid Monaſteries, to their greate hinderance in good manners. What meane you by this? What would you ſay? What geaue you the worlde to vnderſtande? Is there any vice ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſe,

The one is of them, which liuing a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon life, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent them ſelues with the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable exerciſe of meane vertue and godlines. The other is of ſuch, as ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour them ſelfe to excell in the folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of heauenly life and diſcipline. Now for ſo much as the ende, whiche euery Chriſtian man ought to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, is the likenes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and iuſtice of God, the which they atteine muche ſooner, which are pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pter and redier to behold the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the wil of God: the which beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie no man can wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue in his hart, ſo long as he is as it were tied downe with the bandes of ſtreight frindſhip and familiaritie of the bodie: it came to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:970:68"/>
paſſe, that ſuche as had an earnſt and feruent deſire to ioyne them ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, called away their mindes (as much as was poſsible) from the famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar acqueintance of the body, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they mighte the better faſten the eyes of their hearts in the cleerenes of God. Theſe are they, which (as our Lord ſaith) haue ghelded them ſelues for the loue and earneſt deſire of the kingdome of heauen. For the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the bodie weyeth downe the heart euen to the earth, and with her importunitie carieth away the minde from the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation of the brightnes of God.

For this conſideration S. Paule alſo, when he forbiddeth the husbandes to forſake the companie of <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>a</hi>
               </note>their wiues, addeth this clauſe. except it be for a time to geaue your ſelues whollie to praier. In the which place the holie Apoſtle teacheth plainely that the verie lawful and holy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of man and wife, doth hinder the mind, that it can not ſo freely and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pearce the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and there talke familiarly with God. And therefore ſaieth he in the ſame Epiſtle, he that ioineth his virginitie in marriage, doth wel: and he that ioyneth not, doth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The reaſon, whiche the Apoſtle geueth, why it were better for a maide to contine we vnmarried, is this. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that, ſuch as are entangled with the cares of marriage, are oftentimes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:970:69"/>
caried a waie from the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of heauenly thinges. But ſuch as are free from mariage, are troubled with none other care, but how to pleaſe God. And, the ſingle woman, ſaith S. Paule, thinketh vpon the thinges that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine vnto God: how ſhe may be holly in bodie and in ſoule. And a few lines after, he ſetteth before our eyes, the goodli fruit of this moſt holy freedom, which is, a libertie to praie vnto God at all times without any impediment or lette. That this ſo great a gifte, and benefitte ought to be aſcribed, not to the merite of man, but to the mercie of God, our Lorde him ſelfe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſaying. Euerie man receiueth <note place="margin">Mat. <hi>19.</hi> b</note>not this word, but they only to whom it is geauen. Whereby it is manifeſt, that, ſuche as doe ſo conquere the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of fleſhly pleaſure, that they are able to continue their lyfe in chaſtitie, they dooe it by a ſingular benefitte of God, and for that cauſe are moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

of honoure and reuerence.</p>
            <p>But you wil ſaie peraduenture, that I ſpend muche talke in thinges too wel knowen, and not neceſſarie. They are, I graunte you, thinges verie well knowen, and thoroughly debated in the writinges of holie menne. But that they are nothing neceſſarie, then maie you geue iudgement, when you ſhall perfectly vnderſtande, that they are impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to thoſe matters, which I haue taken vpon me to treate of.</p>
            <p>Whereas therefore in the Primitiue Churche, the greateſt parte of men that became Chriſtians, liued vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and godly, but yet ſo, that they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred little from the common lyfe of men: there was no ſmal number which were inflamed with moſt erneſt deſire of the greater dignitie and higher per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Nowe theſe (being there vnto moued by the ſpirit and grace of God) fearing leſt the luſte of the bodie, and care thereof, might be ſome hindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:970:70"/>
vnto them, and hoping withal that thei ſhuld more manfully vanquiſh the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality of the fleſh, abſteined the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mariage: to thentent that although their bodies walked vp and downe in the earth, yet their minds a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thoughts might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant with God in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The which thing that they might the more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly bring to paſſe, they ſeparated themſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the company and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation of men, and with one accord pitched in one place: that ther might be made of al their mindes, one ſure and perfecte agreemente of heart and will. And the order that was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the beginninge at Hieruſalem, that no man ſhoulde haue any poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeuerall to him, (whiche coulde not be long kept of all, for the greate multitude of men) was of theſe men reſtored and putte in vre againe. Their lyfe was nothing elles, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a perpetual warre againſt the bodily pleaſures and ſinne; with an earneſt
<pb facs="tcp:970:71"/>
and continual meditation of heauenlie thinges. Their bodie therefore they ſubdued with faſting, watching and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: but their mindes they ſtirred vp to behold the bewtie and brightnes of God by prayers and ſpiritual ſonges, hymnes and meditation of godly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Hereof proceded that moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent flame of loue: hereof came that earneſt deſire to folow godlines and vertue: hereof aroſe the ioyning of mans wil with the wil of God: hereof ſprang a certaine cleere and bright ſonneſhine in the ſowle of man: finally hereof iſſued that knot or coniunction with God, then the whiche mannes hart is able to y magin no thing ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or faſter.</p>
            <p>Theſe men were at the firſt called in greeke Monkes, that is to ſay, ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie liuers: not ſo much bicauſe they haunted deſert places, as bicauſe they forſoke and deſpiſed al wordly things, and were knitte with a moſt ſtreight

               </gap> vnto a ſtate, in the whiche no man might diſquiet or pul them away from this coniunction of the ſpirite of God: tooke ſuch ordre of life, as I haue here declared. S. Diony ſius of Areopagus whom I eſteeme, after the Apoſtles, as prince of al Diuines, doth not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the name of a Monke after this ſort, but declareth alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the Biſhops vſed at the profeſsing of monkes. This name of a monke hath ben ſometimes in great reuerence and eſtimation: and howſes were builded for them to dwell in, the whiche, as Philo writeth, were at the firſt called Monaſteries. There were alſo many virgins inflamed with the loue of God,
<pb facs="tcp:970:72"/>
the which ſubdewing the ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the bodie, taming the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind, deſpiſing the richeſſe of the world: gaue themſelues wholly to the ſeruice of Chriſt: and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring their purpoſe to good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte, thei came together in one place, where they liued alwayes in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of God. S. Baſile a very holie and great learned man, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares drewe out a rule in writing for Monkes, to the ende they ſhould no more alter and chaunge their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, but be well ſetled and bound alwaies to one vniforme faſſhion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

For the worlde was neuer, nor is nowe, nor neuer ſhall be without ſome feedmen and ſeruitors of Satans retinew, which endeuoure them ſelues to vndoe the

               </gap>d it? With how greate woordes doth Auguſtine bring men in admiration of it? How often, how grauely, how eloquently doth S. Hierome ſet out the excellencie of it? Who did not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend it in words, but alſo folowed him ſelf that trade of life, and liued and died in the company of Monks. And ſo did Gregorie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen, the moſt worthy piller of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, the goodly paterne of vertue and eloquence. What ſhould I here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herſe al other men, that haue excelled in learning and holines? Was ther euer any vertuouſe and perfect man in the world, which gaue not exceding great commendation to the rule and life of Monks? Truth it is, that the erneſt loue of this perfect religion hath ben ſlaked and quenched (as it happeneth) diuers times: but there neuer lacked holie men to ſtir it vp and kendle it againe.
<pb facs="tcp:970:73"/>
from thence came that wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful good Father Benet, from thence came Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard and Brunus, and after them Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis and Dominike, the whiche did not only ſet an order in the life of Monks, but alſo with moſt earneſt and feruent deſire, laboured to reforme the church of Prieſtes which was very ſlacke and negligent. How many Martyrs came from thence? How many Writers? How many excellent men in al kinde of vertues? For if there was any thing in the Church in their time, that tended either to example of excellent vertue, or to a rule of high wiſedome, al that may we thanke the Monkes of: or (to ſpeake better) thanke Chriſt him ſelfe, which ſtirred the hartes and mindes of Monkes to follow ſuch a goodly diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of vertue and wiſedome.</p>
            <p>But, to abridge this our diſcourſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now made plaine, that there were euen in the Primitiue Churche, two kind of Chriſtians: the one which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:970:73"/>
them ſelues with meane doings, liued a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon life without crime: the other, which tending to heauen warde with greater ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, withdrew their minds from the familiariti of the body, and them ſelues from al reſort of men, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated their whole life, to the ſeruice and loue of Chriſt: being alſo euidently proued, that this life of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection farre paſſeth the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon life: ſurely it is veri manifeſt, how great honour and reuerence men ought to haue borne to thoſe houſes of Virgins and Monkes. For they were in this kinde of life, which is more noble and excellent, yea and commeth farre nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the nature and likeneſſe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles, as it were common Scholes or working howſes of heauenlie vertue, and cleane lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. This is that, that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced manie Chriſtian Princes moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and godly men, to build Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and to endew them with poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions, by the whiche the Virgins
<pb facs="tcp:970:74"/>
and monkes might liue and ſerue God continuallie. When this was donne, thoſe princes were for victories moſt renowmed, for chiualrie and feates of armes moſt honorable, and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis excellently wel gouerned. But nowe we ſee in many places where men do baſely ſwarue from the godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their auncetours, that it cometh farre otherwiſe to paſſe. For with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of rentes and reuenewes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth nedines: with the multitude of men, diſhoneſty: with pride, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale: finally with the ſhew of holines impudently faced and borne out, ſacrilege.</p>
            <p>But you wil ſaye, that this kinde of monks are al decaied and worne away. Not emong vs, I aſſure you. For ſence the Kinges of Spaigne haue bent them ſelues earneſtly towards the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religion: there is found ſo great religion and godlines in diuers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, that manie younge men of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:970:74"/>
the nobility brought vp in great welth, ſtanding in good hope of muche wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and honour in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, being inflamed with the loue of ſuche wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful vertue as they ſee with their eyes, doe forſake richeſſe, deſpiſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, reiecte pleaſures, litle regard the teares of their parents, and flie for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour into ſome holy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of monks, as it were from the ſtormy tempeſt of filthie vice, into the quiet hauen of cleane life. In like maner many virgins of excellent bewtie and comely beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, being ſewed vnto for marriage of diuerſe yong men of the Nobilitie, haue forſaken al the allurements of this life, that they might in the company of holie virgins much more pleaſantly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace them ſelues in the ſpirituall and ſweet familiarity of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But you will ſaye peraduenture, that theſe exaumples of greate ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are verie fewe in compariſon of them, that are thruſt into Monaſteries
<pb facs="tcp:970:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt their wil and repining at it. And no meruaile. For why, in euerie kind, looke what is excellente, is alſo rare. Then whereas you talke of violence vſed in putting the Virgins into Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, it was neuer permitted by any Lawe, nor yet allowed of wiſe men, and the holie Councell of Trent hath from hence foorth vtterlie forbidde it, and therfore it is now no more vſed.</p>
            <p>But what fruicte and commoditie haue theſe Virgins by this kind of life? Doubtleſſe ſuch as can not in wordes be expreſſed. For manie of them are ſo inflamed in ſpirit, that they are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken quite awaie from their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and lifted vp into heauen, where in the contemplation of the goodnes of God they reioyſe excedingly, and beholding the bewtie and brightnes of God (ſo much as they may) are aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, yea ſo much that ſomtimes thei are beſides them ſelues. I haue good acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce my ſelfe with a Monke, a

ſimple and plaine man, the whiche, ſo often as mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made of the loue of God, his ſenſes failing him, he falleth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the grownd, and yet in the meane time, his memorie is freſh, and is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of heauenlie and godlie thinges. It were an infinite matter, if I wold reherſe, how manie holie men I haue ſeene in thoſe companies which you laugh to ſcorne, and howe manie virgins I haue talked withal, which are wonderful for religion and holines.</p>
            <p>If theſe thinges be true (as they are moſt true) why haue you taken away this ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an example of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Whie haue you defaced ſo wonderful a rule of chaſtitie and cleane life, in the which is conteined that, that is in the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt the higheſt perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and (as I ſaid before) moſt of all to be eſteemed? whie haue you viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly and furiouſly ruſhed into thoſe holy how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to aboliſh vtterly out of the worlde the very reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of perpetual cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtity?

Nowe as touching the Phariſaicall continuance of praiers (for ſo it liketh you to terme the continual exerciſe in the Diuine ſeruice of God) this much I anſwere. If the defence of Religion do confiſt in vnreaſonable and reprochful woordes, then are you to to muche to good for vs. For you haue had in that honeſt faculty, an excellent ſcholema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter called Luther, from whom proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded al theſe termes, Phariſee, hypocrit, Papiſt, and ſuch other (which I do let paſſe as wordes not meet to be ſpoken of any honeſt and baſhfull man) with the which he reuiled holy men. And yet you to mainteine one miſchiefe by an other, to defende Sacrilege with a heape of ſlaunders and falſe witneſſe, you ſaie, that the diſorder of Monkes in their Celles, and of Nunnes in their Cloiſters was ſo great, that they might well be compared with the reuelles of Bacchus.

diſpleaſure you had conceiued againſt the Biſhoppe of Rome for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling and geauing ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you: the caſting of your eyes vpon the goods and poſſeſsions, with the whiche the Mounkes liued: the flatterie of certaine naughtie and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fellowes: the fonde pleaſure and appetite to make alterations and chaunges, helped the matter wel for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. In olde tyme emongeſt the Romaines (whiche were men vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void of the light and knowledge of God) the Virgins of Veſta were had in ſuch eſtimation, that euerie man did geaue them the waie, the place, and ſeate, with verie great reuerence. And you haue diſteined the Virgins of Chriſte with a notorious and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall infamie. Thoſe Virgins, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they mainteined the fier of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta, the citezins did not onely honour and attende vpon religiouſly, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reuerenced their iudgementes: and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:970:78"/>
you haue not ſuffered the holie vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of Chriſte to keepe their virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſolemly vowed, to maintaine the euerlaſting fier of heauenlie loue in their heartes enkendled. It was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for thoſe Virgins to marrie after thirtie yeares, and yet of their owne accord they did abſteine from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: you haue maried the virgins of Chriſt, to whome it was in al ages vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, to filthie ribaudes. Thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, if they were at anie tyme by intiſement deflowred, they were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried aliue and ſo ended their life with a horrible kinde of death: and you haue taken them, whiche were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſted (as you ſaie) with moſto vile brothelrie, and haue for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo great a vice pleaſauntly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded them with ſporting and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunce. And yet you ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore God hath ſtirred the harts of our men, that theſe ſo great ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I would faine learne of you, what God that was. for there are manie, as S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paule ſaith, that are called Goddes. For to ſome men the bellie is a God: to ſome other monie is a God: yea and to ſome riot and ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and hawtines is a God. I would therefore faine knowe, what God that was, that put it into the heartes of your menne, to aboliſhe and rake vp in the earth the loue of moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and perpetuall chaſtitie. Was it Bacchus, or Cupide, or Mercurie? For of Chriſt the ſonne of God, who is verie muche delyted in perpetuall chaſtitie and cleane life, I am right wel aſſured, that he neuer moued you to any ſuch heinouſe acte.</p>
            <p>The idlenes, which you ſpeake of,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:970:79"/>
was not a fruteles ſitting ſtil, void of al holie workes, but it was a continuall exerciſe in the contemplation of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinges.</p>
            <p>As touching the moſt filthie bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelrie (as you cal it) you are in one ſentence conuinced both of a lie, and of impudencie withall. For, if there had benne anie ſuche offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of them, you woulde not haue ſuffered it vnpouniſhed. And then howe impudent and ſhameleſſe you be, the forging of ſo filthie a crime doth plainelie declare. It is not therefore true that you ſaie, that your doinges ſtande well with the profitte of the common weale. But contrariewiſe you haue bv violence and authoritie drawen out thoſe ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des or companies (as you cal them) from holie quietnes to a buſines defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with wicked ſacrilege: from the exerciſe of godlines, to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vice: from the diſcipline of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall

continencie to the bondage of moſte vncleane voluptuouſneſſe. Howe be it by this, I doe not excuſe your Religiouſe menne. For it had ben muche better for them to ſuffer intolerable paines, yea and to let their lyues in tormentes, then to forſake their Faith, whiche they haue openly profeſſed to Chriſte. For if they had withſtood your warninges and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, your threates and authoritie with good courage and conſtante heartes, dowbteleſſe they had died an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable death for the glorie of Chriſte. For you are wont to punniſh extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet you glorie that by this your ſo goodlie an acte you are reſtored againe to libertie. As thoughe you vnderſtoode, what thinge true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie were.

For when they haue liued rioteouſlie, ſaieth he, to the reproche of Chriſte, they will marrie. What then? Is it not lawefull for widowes to marrie? Doubtleſſe it is lawfull.</p>

Bicauſe they haue, ſaith he, broken their firſt faith. what faith I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeke you? Expound the meaning of S. Paule, if you can.

Is it the promiſe, which they made to their houſbandes, that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſpot the bed of wedlocke with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie? No. For of that promiſe they were quite diſcharged by the death of their houſbandes. Whie then it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that this promiſe was not made to anie man, but to the ſonne of God, that they ſhoulde keepe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> chaſtitie both of bodie and mind perpetually to his glorie. The whiche promiſe when
<pb facs="tcp:970:82"/>
they had decreed to breake, they did a greuous reproche, not to men, but to Chriſt him ſelfe. And therfore it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the Apoſtle, that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, (as being condemned for the offence of a moſt wicked adultery) not to be receiued into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of chaſt widowes, but rather to be forebidden to enter into the church. And that you maie the more meruaile at it, note, that S. Paule ſaied not, that thoſe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes after the firſt mariage had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made, but onely that they would haue married: wherby it is geauen vs to vnderſtand, that this religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is moſt wickedly and heinouſly broken by the onlie will and deſire to be married againe. It was therfore law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for widowes to marrie, before they had promiſed and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated their cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitie vnto Chriſte, but after the time that the promiſe was paſt, it was no more lawful. Now then ſir: Think you that the offence of the Virgins is anie
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:970:82"/>
thing leſſe, which haue not only a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to marrie, but doe marrie in deede to the great reproch of Chriſt? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is farre greater: by ſo much as, it is a more wicked offence for an vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed virgin to plaie the harlot to the diſhonour of Chriſte, then not to kepe the chaſtitie of a bodie, whiche is not vntowched. How long then laſteth this libertie? So long as it is in our free choiſe, to take what way we wil. But when we haue once either yoked our ſelues in matrimonie, or els offered vp our bodies by vow to ſerue God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as it is not laeful to break the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of matrimony, ſo is it not lauful to violate the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of perpetual cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie. And who ſo euer preſumeth to doe it, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth a moſt wicked crime, that deſerueth the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God. He that hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantly <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>g.</hi>
               </note>determined in his heart, ſaith S. Paule, hauing no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtreint, but hauing power ouer his owne wil, and hath aduiſedly
<pb facs="tcp:970:83"/>
determined in his hart to kepe his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, doth wel. He laieth no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at al vpon vs: but by his authoritie approueth the wil of that man, which weying and conſidering the matter wel, and taking withall the will of the virgin (for otherwiſe it maie not be) de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicateth the ſaid virgin vnto Chriſte, which he kepeth vnder his rule and power. But after the virgin hath once bound her ſelfe with the vowe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual chaſtitie, S Paule ſaieth not, that ſhe is at her choiſe to marrie if ſhe wil. For if he ſhould ſo ſaie, he ſhould ſpeke verie muche againſt him ſelfe. But al theſe thinges are verie eaſily confuted in the opinion of ſuch as are addicted to Luther. For it is not lawful, ſay thei, for any man to bind him ſelfe by vowe to that religion, which he is not able to kepe. And to reſiſt the tyrannie of fleſhlie luſt, they ſaie, is graunted to no man. This is the talke of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not only inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent and diſſolute, but alſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:970:83"/>
bent againſt God. For he diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the goodnes and power of God, and meaſureth the ſtrength of vertue and continencie, not by the almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and power of God, but by his own weakenes and filthie appetit. And this is the propertie of al naughty felowes, by their owne beaſtly life to iudge the conuerſation of other men. Nero was fully perſwaded, that al men were as euil as him ſelfe, but that their vnbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led luſt was reſtrained by the lacke of thinges, that it could not breake out at al times into deedes. And this opinion cauſeth, that when vicious men heare tel of anie man or woman that is verie continent, they doe not only not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, but they wil deuiſe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times ſome infamous crime to burden him withal. I graunt you thus muche, that neither Luther, nor Bucer, nor Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, nor Occolampadius, nor Caluin, nor your Martyr him ſelfe was able to ſuſteine the aſſault of the fleſh. For the
<pb facs="tcp:970:84"/>
heauenly gifte of perpetual chaſtitie, is iuſtly denied to al ſuche, as haue moſt wickedly diuided them ſelues from the church. But vnto ſuch as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the boundes of holy Churche, and are deſirous to be ioyned with moſt feruent loue to Chriſt the chiefe and principal worker of honeſtie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for ſo much as they are fenſed on euerie ſide with the ſtrong bulwarke of God, it is very eaſie to put fleſhlie pleaſure to flight, to pul vp the verie ſtrings and rootes of al vncleane vice. Otherwiſe S. Paule had neuer geanen counſel to virgins to continew in the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>b</hi>

               <hi>Let vs put examples. The old Church of the Apostles and Martyrs had none of all theſe monumentes, and yet was their ſpirite moste earneſtly inflamed with the loue of God. In the wane of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For ſo long as the Image of the Croſſe was printed and engraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the hearts of all men, this multitude of Images

was not ſo neceſſari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. But you doe much like, as if a man ſhould ſay, that the remedies of diſeaſes were the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of diſeaſes. for the picture did not cauſe men to forgette holie thinges: but rather it was wiſely deuiſed, that men might not forgette them. If the vſe of Images quenched, as you ſaie, that ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of ſpirit, with the which men were inflamed in the olde tyme: then muſt it needes folow, that, when Images were firſt ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of you, you were by and by verie hote in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Tel me therefore, if it pleaſe you: When you firſt brake downe the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, tables and other monumentes of Saintes: when you defaced them, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled them, and daſſhed them in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand peeces: when you burned the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of the moſt holie Martyr S.

fell from aboue, not onely fierie ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, but alſo fierie heartes and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles, the heate and flames whereof wrought with you ſo extremely, that you are not able by any meanes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide this ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge force of loue, which burneth within you. Neither do you now liue vpon the earth, but in hearte and mind you are in heauen. For euen as vpon the ouerthrow of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the biſhop of Rome, ther aroſe out of hand a new ſonne emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt you: ſo muſt it nedes folow, that vpon the pulling downe of Images, vppon the breaking of the monumentes of Chriſt crucified, vpon the digging vp of the graue of the holy Martyr, and burning of his bones: you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued foorth with ſuch a fier of heauenly loue in your bowelles, that there is nothing in the world to be ſeene in your heartes, but only that ſame hoat and ſierie loue of God. If it be ſo, I commend the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of your ſpirite, I allowe your

doing, I thinke, this worthie acte of yours deſerueth immortall fame and honour. for what ſo euer quencheth the feruencie of the ſpirite, what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doth any thing breake or weaken the force of loue, it would be put back with the whole bent of the hart. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we to beare anie thing in the world, that might cauſe a dulnes or ſlakenes in the minde. But if it be nothing ſo, if, after the breaking downe and defacing of the goodlie monumentes of vertue, you were not inflamed by and by with fier from heauen: then it is moſt euident, that the Images and reliques of holie men buried vnder the grownde, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder you from that feruent loue of God. Whie then, what (the diuell) madnes came into your heads, that you ſhould be ſo earneſtly bent to make a waſte and ſpoile of thinges, whereof you could take no commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie in the worlde?</p>

Neither was it firſte decreed in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, that Images ſhuld be ſet vp, but that they ſhould not be pulled down. And the herefie of ſuch as would haue them to be ouerthrowen, was there condemned by the ful agreement of al the fathers. Of the which errour, as it appeared by the teſtimonials brought into the Councel, the firſte brochers were certaine Manichees and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioniſtes.

It was there declared at that time, by the authoritie of Baſile, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie of Niſſa, Cyril, Ierom, Auguſtin, and by the cuſtome receiued in the Church euen from the Apoſtles time: that the Images of Chriſt, of his moſt bleſſed Mother, and of other holie men had ben ſet vp, vpon a great good conſideration, to call the mindes of men continually to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God.

            <p>In that part of India, which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the riuers Indus and Ganges tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes the eaſt, there is a towne called Mailapur, and belongeth to the great kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Narſingua, where the bodie of S.

For euen as ſelfe ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce blindeth the mind with errours, and maketh it prowd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent: ſo doth the remembrance of the wekenes and miſerie of man bring men to the learning of wiſedome.

But al theſe things are conteined in the confeſsion of our wickednes and ſynnes. For confeſsion conteineth in it ſelfe a diſcrete exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and acknowleging of our ſelues, a learning of humilitie and modeſtie, a baſhful rehearſal of the ſynne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a feare of the daunger hanging ouer our heades. By this confeſsion, ſuch as lie downe, are ſtirred vp: ſuche as be faint, are cheered foreward: ſuch as be prowd, are pulled downe: ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:970:102"/>

And this is well knowen, that when the time draweth nere in the which confeſsion is to be made, men are more modeſt and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent then at other times. And the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is to bring manie men vnto it, the better it is ſeene, that it was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the prouidence of God.

The which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true, yet me thinketh it were the parte of a weake and faint hearted man, not to diſcuſſe and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine by reaſoning on both ſides, what ſo euer is wont to be diſputed in theſe darke matters, vntil at the length, the matter being diligently weyed and conſidered, we may be able either to lerne the truth of other, or els to find it our ſelues. If we can not atteine vnto this, yet at the leſt wiſe, we muſt haue great regard, emongeſt the reaſons of diuers men to take ſome one that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth better and ſurer: with the which as it were with a boate we maie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne our life in theſe waues with ſome daunger, vntil we may either find an other ſhip of more aſſurance and leſſe daunger, or els be inſtructed by the wordes and aduiſe of God him ſelfe, how to directe our courſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie errour. Thus much ſaid he. But to what purpoſe, ſay you, haue
<pb facs="tcp:970:108"/>
you alleaged this place out of Plato? That you may vnderſtand, that men of excellent wits did euen in thoſe daies perceiue, how litle we ought to truſt to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s reaſon, and how earneſtly we ought to praie, that our life might be gouerned, not by the ſtaie of our owne wit, but by the rule of the woorde of God. So we doe, ſay you. Would God ye did. But it is not ſo. But rather when it is leſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, you wil weake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and take it awaie quite, and runne like mad me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into darkenes: againe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reaſon is to be bridled by the faith of Chriſt, you yeald ſo much to reaſon, that what ſo euer reaſon is not able to atteyne, you will foorth with geaue it ouer. Now for ſomuch as reaſon is driuen into a narrowe and ſtreight roome, and the boundes of Chriſtian faith are paſsing great and endles: it is a token not onely of a naughtie and wicked man, but alſo of a blunt and dul wit, to directe his life, not by faith,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:970:108"/>
but by reaſon. For what man a liue is able to trie out perfectly the cauſes of the leſt thinges in the worlde? to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe exactely the firſt ſpring, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the varietie, the beawtie, the fruict, the profitte and vſe of trees and pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes? to expreſſe in wordes the ordre and waie, by the which eche thing in his kinde is holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together and made to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue? what man in the world is able to atteine by wit, to ſearch out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret force and cauſe, how a liuing thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is made, nouriſhed and knit together with bones and ſinewes? by what cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or ſubtilty the vaines are ſpread through the whole body, how the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries are ſo wonderfully wouen one within an other, and how they do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of liuing thinges, and the naturall knowledge and pollicie that ech thing hath to keepe and defend it ſelfe: what man was euer able to find out by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted reaſons the very ground and perfecte knowledge of theſe thinges? Great learned men haue diſputed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much as touching the mind of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: of the nature, diſpoſition, wit, reaſon, inuention, memorie, and other powers of it: but of al this diſputation we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue none other commoditie but this, that we may wel perceiue by their long ſtudie and diligent ſearch, howe great darkenes and ignoraunce there is in mans reaſon. For we ſee in them a goodlie endeuour of mind to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature of mans mind: but of the perfecte knowledge of the thing, which thev ſeeke for, we are neuer the neere. Wherevpon it is gathered, that no man is able to know him ſelfe perfectly.</p>
            <p>And yet there are ſome men ſo hard
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:970:109"/>
that, if a thing be tolde them, which is wont to grow or to be done in farre Countries, they wil not beleue it: as though the thinges whiche they ſee with their eyes, and yet are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the cauſes, were leſſe to be wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, then thoſe thinges, which are reported to be done in other places. But now to omit to ſpeake of the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the earth, the paſsing great wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſea, the nature of the ayer that enuironeth vs, the burning of the ſkie, the due proportion and agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of theſe bodies, the chaunge and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of one nature into an other as it were by courſe and order of Lawe: What ſhall we ſaie of the brightneſſe, bewtie, hugenes, and compaſſe of the heauen? You, if ye leane vnto reaſon onely, what woulde you haue done in this caſe? Ymagine you had ben borne and bred in the darke countries of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria (as the Poetes feine) and ſome man had tolde you, that there were a

huge greate frame conteining within his compaſſe al the whole world, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelouſlie decked and garniſhed with many fiers, of ſuch hugenes that al the landes and ſeas in compariſon of it, are but as a pinnes point, of ſuch ſwiftnes in mouinge, that within the ſpace of fower and twentie howers it turneth the whole bodie round about, of ſuch force and violence, that ſeuen other huge bodies of the ſame nature, which are conteined within his compaſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge a contrarye courſe, it beareth them al backe with his onely mouing, if a manne ſhoulde tell you this tale, would you beleeue him? No truly, if you truſt onely to reaſon and ſenſes.</p>
            <p>For ſo would you perſwade your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, that the thinges, the cauſes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vou are not able to conceiue, were impoſsible, (before you ſee them with your eyes).</p>
            <p>What if he ſhoulde tell you of the ſonne ſhine, a thing both healthful and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:970:110"/>
comfortable to al liuing creatures, and of the goodly order, which the ſonne keepeth in goinge by litle and litle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, and again how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth by the ſame way to the ſouth, caſting his bright beames vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al things in the world? What if he ſhould report how the moone with her increaſe and decreaſe diuideth the times of the yere and how ſhe geueth ripenes to al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs which the land and ſea bringeth forth? What if he ſhould declare, how diuerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the heauenly bodies aboue are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and tourned, and how notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are all reduced to a moſt perfecte harmonie and agreemente? Would you beleeue it? No truely, if you can be perſwaded in nothing, except it may either be proued by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or perceiued by ſenſe.</p>
            <p>It is ſurely a token of a baſe mind to eſteme the knowlege of things, by the narrow and ſtreight meaſure of mans vnderſtanding, and not according to
<pb facs="tcp:970:111"/>
the almighty power of him that made them. And out of this dulnes or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of nature procedeth al ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as are contrary to holy Religion. For all heretikes, either they eſteeme the almightie power of God by their owne weakenes, or els they meaſure the infinite mercie of God by their own naughtines. As though thei were able to make any reſemblance in the world of the power of God, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how great the goodnes is of that moſte bountifull Father, whiche doth with ſpecial regard, as it were, walke vp and downe throughout al his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly mainteineth eche thing in his kinde and nature. And to paſſe ouer all other thinges, me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that in that laſt geuing of ſhape and fourme to euery liuing thing, I ſee a miracle, which ſheweth plainly the power and cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent workeman, in whoſe handes the liuing creature was made and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:970:111"/>
Neither dothe the multitude of liuing thinges miniſh the eſtimation of Gods worke, but rather augment and increaſe it. For the benefites of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, the more they are in number, and the better they are knowen, the better is the greatnes of his power and mercy ſene, although the reaſon of his workes be not vnderſtood. What ſhal I here ſpeake of thoſe thinges, that are for the excellency of their nature farre aboue the ſenſe and vnderſtanding of man? Who wil beleue that there is an infinite multitude of heauenly ſpirites, whiche being of vnderſtanding moſte cleere, of holines moſt pure, of vertue and power very excellent, of comelines and bewty moſt like vnto God, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies occupied in the Seruice of God? euermore ſinging and praiſing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, continually burning with the flame of the loue of God? What? Can you conceiue by reaſon, how the only ſonne of God, the veri expreſſe Image
<pb facs="tcp:970:112"/>
of the Father, the brightnes of ouerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting light, being equal with the Father in nature, power, kingdome, and maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: toke vpon him the ſhape of man, ſuffered in his mortal bodie labour, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, puniſhment for vs, redemed with his bloud our ſoules which were fouly ſpotted in ſinne? If theſe thinges are to be weyed by mans reaſon onely, they are nothing like to be true: but if we will conſider them according to the faith, which we haue of the bowntiful goodnes of God, there is nothing more credible. For paſsing great benefits are to be required and loked for of paſsing great bountie. He that ſpared not (ſaith <note place="margin">Rom. 8. f.</note>S. Paul) his owne ſonne, but gaue him vp for vs al: How gaue he not vnto vs al things with him? Wherfore to ſuch as beleue vprightly, I thinke ther is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els nedeful to be conſidered, but how the thing, that they are willed to beleue, ſtandeth with the bountie of God: the which doing, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:970:112"/>
that any man ſhould doubt of any myſterie of our ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges being thus determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I will now talke, not with you, M.

            <p>And bicauſe I wil ſeeke no further, let it be your golden Martyr, whom you commend ſo highlie. Ymagine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that I talke with him after this ſorte.</p>
            <p>O moſte vile and naughtie felowe, what came into thy minde to go about to deface, to violate, and to depraue that moſte holy Myſterie, the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente of the loue of God towardes vs, the comforte of our banniſhment, the ſtaie of the frailtie of manne, the bankette of heauen, ordeyned for vs in that laſt Supper by the handes of

Our Lord him ſelfe? Was there none in ſo many hundred yeres but thou and thy Maiſters, that durſt attempt ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſe, vile, and barbarouſe an acte? Was there none that vnderſtoode the ſenſe of the holie Scripture, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Goſpell, the order of the bleſſed Sacramentes, but you? Were ſo many holy Martyrs, ſo many Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, ſo many great wiſe men (in whome ſhone the beames of the brightnes of God) ignorant in matters of ſo great importance?

            <p>What is it ſo? If thou vnderſtande not, by what meanes the moſte holie bodie of Chriſt is in this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not placed or limited according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure and proportion of the greatneſſe thereof, but preſente in the eyes of a faithfull heart through the almightie power of the woorde of God: if thou ſee not that merueilouſe chaunge of earthly breade into the nature of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie bread: if thou perceiue not, by what meanes the moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of Chriſt, which filleth al things, multiplieth the giftes of his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that he may therewirh feede and refreſh the faithfull ſoules, and glewe them all together with charitie within them ſelues, and tye them faſt to him ſelfe with the band of euerlaſting loue: is it therfore reaſon, that thou ſhouldſt ſlaunder and depraue this ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a benefite of God? What thing doeſt thou vnderſtande? What thing
<pb facs="tcp:970:116"/>
doeſt thou conceiue by diſcourſe and reaſon? What thing is there in all the worlde, whiche thy minde is able to perceue exactly, and to know perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie? Why then doeſt thou not order thy life, by cleere faithe, and not by troubled reaſon? Tel mee, I pray thee, doeſt thou miſtruſt Gods power or mercie, or elles doth the greatneſſe of the benefite trouble thee? Neyther can the power of God be hindred by any let or ſtaie, neyther can his mercy be limited with any bowndes: and the greatnes of the benefite is a very good proofe of the truth thereof. For why, there is nothing more agreeable to the greate bountifulneſſe of God, then the greatnes of the thing, which he gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</p>
            <p>Then I aſke thee an other queſtion: What is the cauſe, thinkeſt thou, why I doe beleue, that the bodie and bloud of Chriſte is after a wonderfull man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conteined in this Sacrament, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:970:116"/>
thou beleeueſt it not? It is not ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bicauſe I will ſuffer my ſelfe to be abuſed for lacke of witte. For thou doeſt not paſſe mee either in witte, or learning. But this is the cauſe. Thou truſteſt thy ſenſes, and I directe al my doinges according to the faith of holie Churche. Thou doeſt caſte of the yoke, and ſpurne againſt it: but I doe of myne owne accorde put my heade into the moſte ſweete yoke of Chriſt. Thou doeſt refuſe his benefites, but I doe praie vnto him to encreaſe my faieth.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, we ſee this by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. The more a man yeldeth to vice and vncleanes of life: the feinter is his beleefe as touching this dreadfull Myſterie. Wherevppon it is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he, that geaueth him ſelfe wholie ouer to the pleaſure of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and therefore falleth from the vnitie of the Churche, wil beleue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of it. But on the other
<pb facs="tcp:970:117"/>
ſide we ſee, that the chaſter and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner life any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leadeth, the more ſure and conſtant is his belefe in this point: in ſo much that he perſuadeth him ſelf, that he beholdeth in this Sacrament, euen Chriſt him ſelfe nailed vpon the Croſſe.</p>
            <p>Surely this agreement of the mind and wil of man, is a thing to be woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at. The mind ſeeketh the thing that is true: the wil deſireth the thing that is good: and the wel gouerned wil foloweth the iudgement of the truly directed mind. It foloweth therefore that they only ſee the truth perfectly, which are wel ordered in their life and conuerſation: for vicious and naughty men are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly tourned away from the truth, bicauſe they haue their mind diſordered with vnruly deſires.</p>
            <p>Now therefore conſider to whom it is better to geaue eare. To thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, the which being of mind moſt pure, of life moſt chaſt, in holie Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures

This Sacramente the holie Fathers, whiche were taught of the Apoſtles, called <hi>Synaxim,</hi> that it to ſay, a bringing together, bicauſe it <note place="margin">Synaxis.</note>linked the mindes of men together wi in themſelues, and brought them to be ioyned al in Chriſt.

For <note place="margin">The effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Aulter.</note>it ſupporteth the ſtate of the ſowle, it eſtabliſheth the powers of the minde, it clereth the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, it ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth faith, it ſtirreth vppe hope, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kendleth charitie, it inflameth hartes,
<pb facs="tcp:970:118"/>
it filleth the godlie and deuout mindes with meruelouſe great ſweetenes and comfort. With this heauenlie foode, S. Cyprian (ſo often as any tempeſt or perſecution was towarde) thought it good to fortifie them, that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſuffer tormentes for the name of Chriſte. And therefore dyd he the ſooner admit into the Churche againe, ſuch as were yet penitentes, that is to witte, menne ſeparated from the Church for a tyme, to do penance for ſome offence committed: to the intent that, being ſtrengthned by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of the body of Chriſt, they might ſtand valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to the end againſt al the power of Satan. For the holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was of this mind, that the foode of this heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly bread gaue ſuch ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage, as could not be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any force of our enemie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil. What ſhould I here rehearſe other holy Martyrs without nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, al holie writers, the faith and agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the

vniuerſal Church continued euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles time to our daies? And yet wilt thou keepe open war, againſt the ordinaunce of Chriſte, againſt the doctrine of S.

            <p>Theſe thinges, M. Haddon, thinke them not ſpoken to you, but to your Martyr. And now let him ſtand a ſide, and I wil thus reaſon with you. Could you, M. Haddon, knowing, as you doe verie wel, not only the vertue of

this wonderful Sacrament, whiche is of al other the greateſt, but alſo the ſtrength and operation of al other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes: being withall of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that to deſpiſe the Sacramentes, is a moſte heinouſe treſpaſſe: when you vnderſtoode, that there was a man in the worlde ſo lewde and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that he woulde goe aboute to take awaie and aboliſh this moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie pleadge of the loue of God, this moſt ſure ſtaie of all Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, conteming in it all the graces and benefittes of God: could you, I ſaie, ſpeake familiarly vnto him? could you ſalute him gentelly? could you ſhewe him anie token of loue?

But you haue not onely ſpoken familiarly to this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, but alſo commended him aboue the ſkies: and you haue ſaied, that

that ſame golden couple of olde men, were brought into your Iland by the prouidence of God, to ſhine ouer you (which had alreadie the goodly brightneſſe of the newe ſonne riſen emongeſt you) with a muche clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light.</p>

But if you like his Doctrine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, then is it plaine, that you keepe not the Sacramentes at al: for ſo much as you haue vppon an vnſetled pange, without al order, wiſedome, or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taken awaie the greateſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that, that is of al other moſt wonderfull. Whie then ſay you, that you wonder, if there be any kind of profeſſours in diuinitie in the worlde,
<pb facs="tcp:970:120"/>
that deſpiſeth and ſetteth at naught the Sacramentes? But let vs now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the deſcription of your Church, the which you ſet before our eyes to behold, that we may vnderſtand by it, that you haue had none other maiſter in Religion, but only the holy Ghoſt. You ſay thus.</p>

               <hi>Firſt of all, bicauſe faith is by hearing, we ſende downe into all partes of our realme teachers of the holie Scriptures, to inſtructe the people in all pointes of godlines, and to infourme them in the true woorſhipping of God.</hi> Out of what fountaine ſprang theſe Doctours? If they came out of the ſchoole of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Bucer or Caluin: they can teach the people no godlines, being them ſelues open enemies to all godlineſſe. It were therefore muche more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to haue no doctours at all, then to be infected with the moſt corrupt Doctrine of wicked menne.

               <hi>Then haue we a common order of praier out of the holie Scriptures, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the authoritie of a Parlament, (for ſo doe they terme the conſent of the estates of our Realme) from the which we ſuffer no man to depart.</hi> By what order, lawe, or authoritie is this done: that a Councel, or as you cal it, a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, ſhould ſo impudently vſurpe the office of the Catholike Churche, to make orders for praiers, preſcribe how religion ought to be vſed, and not ſuffer any man to depart from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which it hath decreed? For in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinges it is not lawfull for theſe menne to geaue lawes, but to take lawes. For otherwiſe they ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the common weale, if they wil not content them ſelues with their

owne vocation, but will thruſt them ſelues into other mens doinges: and they ſhal marre Religion, if they will in matters apperteyninge to them onely, that ſuſteine the perſonne of the Churche, take vppon them to meddle, and tranſpoſe the dignitie of Prieſtes to them ſelues. You ſay after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.</p>
            <p>Prouiding both in the one and in the other, ſo muche as we coulde, that the commaundement of the holie ghost be obeied, the whiche, willeth that ſuch as ſpeake in the Churche, ſhould vſe the word of God: and that there ſhould be one common and agreable Doctrine emongeſt them all. <hi>You doe verie wel vndowbtedly.

               <hi>All theſe thinges are ſet out in our owne mother tongue, bicauſe it is a great madnes for a man to babble out before God, he can not tell what: and it is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctely againſte the most wholeſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of S.

their owne tongue. For we alſo doe not ſuffer ſuch, as are ignorant in the Latine ſpeach, to ſerue God, but only in their own mother tongue: and there are manie bookes of praiers and holy ſcriptures writen, not by Parlament, as you call it, but by holie Prieſtes: the whiche (being firſte examined by the prelates of the church) are ſent abroad euerie where, and by them are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, women, and ſimple folkestrained in the knowledge of their dewtie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God. And the thinges that are thus written, they are not taken out of euerie mans fantaſie, but out of the holie Scriptures, and out of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges and examples of holie men. So that there lacketh not omongeſt vs anie diſcipline of manners, nor exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of vertue, nor good bringing vp in true religion, to al ſuch, as coulde not imploie them ſelues to the ſtudie of learning.

Mary ſir, ſay you, it is againſt the moſt wholeſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of S. Paul How ſo I praie you? If you marke well the meaning of S.

            <p>But firſt of all it is to be knowen, that in S. Paules time al Chriſtian men in a manner were endewed with ſuch vertues and qualities, as fewe men in
<pb facs="tcp:970:124"/>
our daies can atteine vnto by ſtudie and faith. Then it is alſo to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there were in thoſe daies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers giftes and graces of the holy ghoſt geauen vnto ſuch men, as were infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the loue of Chriſte. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, although they were taught and ſchooled of the holy Ghoſt, yea and wel inſtructed to be humble and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt: yet were they in no ſmall dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of pride. The which is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, for ſo muche as S.

               </note>the fleſhe was a thing neceſſarie for him, leſt the knowledge of the ſecrets of God might puffe vp his mind. Now as manie were puffed vp with thoſe gyftes, ſo were ſuch, as had the gyfte of tongues, ſomewhat more inſolent then other men: and they would praiſe God in diuers tongues, whiche other men vnderſtoode not, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretour.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:970:124"/>
There was alſo an other great inconuenience, which was, that he, that ſpake with vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tonges, would not tarie till an other man had made an end of ſpeaking, but at one time a great many together woulde praiſe God in ſtraunge tongues. And theſe three diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities were cauſed in their aſſembles, for lacke of diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thoſe good men. The firſt was the arrogant ſetting out of the gyftes of God: the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was the diſquieting of ſuch as would teach: the third was the breaking of order, which of all thinges becometh the Church of Chriſte beſt.</p>
            <p>But S. Paule very wiſely remoueth al theſe thinges. For to place humility, he putteth al men in mind of that moſt wretched ſtate in the which they had liued before, when through the mocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ennemie the diuell they went ſuppliantly afterydols: that they might the more eaſily gather by that, that <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note>thoſe gyftes ought to be referred,
<pb facs="tcp:970:125"/>
not to their deſertes, but to the infinite mercie of God.</p>
            <p>He teacheth them alſo, that other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not to be diſpiſed, the which, although they had not receiued thoſe gyftes, yet were they not vtterly void of the gyftes of God: for ſo much as no man can confeſſe our Lord Ieſus from his heart but by the benefite of the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>a.</hi>
               </note>holie Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>After that he declareth how that the gyfte, which euerie man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, he hath receiued it, not for him ſelfe only, but for all other: and that it ought therfore to be imploied to the profit of the vniuerſal Church.</p>
            <p>Then he ſheweth how emongeſt al the gyftes of God, charitie hath the higheſt roome and dignitie, that they might thereby vnderſtand, that it ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not much, how manie tongues a man knew, or ells how great miracles he was able to worke, but with how great zeale and diligence he furthered
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:970:125"/>
the Churche.</p>
            <p>Laſt of al making a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the gyfte of tongues and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, he deſpiſeth not tongues, but perferreth prophecying far before the tongues. And theſe are the places, by the which the Apoſtle brought the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a certaine kind of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to the loue of grauity a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d modeſty.</p>
            <p>But that diſorder of talking together <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>f.</hi>
               </note>and hindering one an other in ſuche ſort, that the profitte of teaching was thereby loſt, S. Paule tooke it a waie, when he ſaied. But if any man ſpeake with tongue, let it be done by two, or at the moſt by three, and let one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde. For you maie prophecie by one and one, and you maie ſpeake by one and one. And leſt anie man might ſaie, that he was violently moued by the ſpirite, in ſuch ſorte, that he could not refraine him ſelfe from ſpeaking: the Apoſtle ſaith, that the ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes is ſubiecte vnto the Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tes.
<pb facs="tcp:970:126"/>
Wherin he teacheth them, that it laie in them, whiche were moued by the holy Ghoſt, to moderate the gyfte of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Finally he ſetteth an order, (of the whiche he had ſaied much before) by <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>f.</hi>
               </note>theſe wordes Endeuour your ſelues to prophecie, and forbid no man to ſpeke with tongues. But let al things be done honeſtly and orderly. The Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth not to vſe ſtraunge tongues: but yet he preferreth before tongues the gyfte of prophecie, that is to ſaie, the declaration of the wil of God, and the edifying of the Church: and he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, that al thinges be done with verie good order.</p>
            <p>Now there are two pointes to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in this place: the one is, that, emongeſt many things, which maie be done at one time at our pleaſure indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, looke what thinges maie be omitted without offence, are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when any daunger that maie
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:970:126"/>
thervpon enſewe, and the time ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. And therfore, although in S. Pauls time al myſteries might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to al men: it foloweth not, that they ſhold, in our daies (when ther is no like capacity in al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue them) be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to al men indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any reſpecte of perſonnes.</p>
            <p>The other point is, that the meaning of S. Paul in al that diſputation was, to keepe downe pride, to ſet vp charitie, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, that order ſhould be kept. He therfore that geueth occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of pride, that ſlaketh loue and charity, that diſtourbeth good order, although he ſeeme to folowe the wordes of S. Paule, yet goeth he directely againſt the meaning of S. Paul.</p>
            <p>Theſe thinges being thus determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I wil aſke you a queſtion: what came into your braines, to be ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to take al the volumes of the holy Scripture, and without anie neceſsity, ye with no ſmal da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of the vnlerned

No: you haue rather forced the weake mindes to fall out within them ſelues, through your diuers, yea and contrary expoſitions of the law of God. Was it done to ſet all thinges in good order? No: you haue rather ouerthrowen all good and auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t order. For now eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is a prophete, euerie man is a ſhepeheard, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a doctour, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man will prate in euerie place very vnſemely of matters of diuinitie, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil babble what him liſteth of the higheſt Myſteries, the loweſt pointe whereof is farre aboue his capacitie.

which was vſed of olde time in the churches: that baſhfulnes, whiche became honeſt matroues meruelouſly wel: that modeſty, which kept the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people verie wel in their dewtie.

            <p>If the vſe of one common tongue ioyneth the mindes of men in one, then was there nothing more agreable to the rule of Chriſt, then that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God ſhould be openly ſaied in one only tongue, the which was in all churches of the weſt part of the world learned in ſcholes, and practiſed in the dailie affaires: and nothing leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, then that the ſeruice is now ſaied in ſo manie tongues as there are nations, emongeſt whome men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out learning, without witte, without religion take vpon them the office of expounding the holie Scriptures.

What ſhal we doe to theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are ſo holie, ſo vtterly void of al care of this preſent life, that for the deſire and loue of the preſence of Chriſt him ſelfe, they can not abide to ſee any Vicare of Chriſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. But lette vs ſee a litle. This name of Chriſt, doth it import the dignitie and office of a biſhop only, or elles doth it comprehende alſo the authoritie and maieſtie of a King? Surely it can not be denied, that by the worde and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſt, in this name of Chriſt is conteined the power both of a biſhop and of a King. Whie then doe you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any other king, beſide our Lord Ieſus Chriſt? Whie are you not ſo free and earneſt, to ſhake of this yoke that remaineth? Whie ſuffer you this freedome of your goſpell to be hindered through the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb facs="tcp:970:130"/>
of a King? Whie doe you not (as it hath ben already attempted in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, whiche are infected with the ſelfe ſame religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) bend your ſelues earneſtly to make away the maieſtie of a King? for as you acknwolege one only high biſhop, ſo is it neceſſarie to obei one only King. If you thinke it mete to haue an other king in th' earth, as Vicare of that high and almightie king: what is the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uſe, whie you wold not haue an other biſhop as Vicare of that moſt high and holy biſhoppe? But you wil ſay. We haue biſhops, but we wil haue no high biſhop: Whie then, it is not the name of a biſhop, but of a high biſhoppe, that offendeth you. Wherefore thinke you then, that the authoritie of a Kinges power (whiche dowbtles is the higheſt) is to be borne in England? Are there not magiſtrates emongeſt you? Is there not a publike counſel? Haue you not Princes and Lordes? Then take awaie the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie

               </gap> therfore, that they were certaine litle kinges. What needed it then, being ſo many kinges emongeſt you, that there ſhuld be any one high or ſupreme king, to reſtraine by his authority the other inferiour kings? For if you thinke that this word (high) mai not be born in the dignitie of a biſhop: why do you not in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner deteſt the name of highnes in the Maieſtie of a king? No, ſay you, it was very wiſely prouided, that al the magiſtrats and Princes in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſhuld haue one ſupreme Prince, whom they ſhuld al reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and by whoſe power a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d autority they ſhuld be al reſtrained: for otherwiſe, it cannot be choſen, but that there would be ſtirred vp muche trouble and diſcord, to the great peril of the whole realme. I thinke you ſay

truly. And therefore I affirme in like manner, that in the Churche, whiche ought to be alwaies one, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that there be one ſupreme power of a high biſhop, whoſe authoritie all other Biſhops ſhould reuerence. For otherwiſe it muſt needes be, that there ariſe much debate and manie peſtilent ſectes, to the great ruine and decaie of the Churche, and that the Church be brought therby into verie great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

Now, for ſo much as Chriſt is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of peace: Whoſoeuer wil ſaie, that they wil haue but one only biſhop which is our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, and by the religious prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this worde, wil open a gap to ſo manie opinions, and to ſo much peſtilent diſſenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thei are lyers.

               <hi>Peter had his Prouince, Paule had his, and Iames his, and other had other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces. And yet did not this ſeparation of their perſons diſioine the vnitie of their ſaith.</hi> What conclude you then? maie

               <hi>In proceſſe of time, many of the Biſhops of Rome, were Martyrs, and were ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed vnto God by prophane and vngodlie Princes: but Crownes had they none, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were the Crownes of Martyrdome.

For their writinges declare plainely, that their iudgement was, that the ſoueraintie of the vniuerſal Churche, was euer in the Church of Rome. What ſhould I here reherſe Ireneus, Auguſtine, and al other holy Fathers? What ſhoulde I here vnfolde the memorie of al the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie?

And yet you put it in your oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirming it ful ſtoutly, and are neuer a whit aſhamed of your lying.

may alſo lack it ful wel: yea we ought to lacke it, not only bicauſe it is expreſſely forbidden by the Goſpel, but alſo bicauſe it ſtandeth wel with reaſon.</hi> What a raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and impudencie is this in you, to conclude an Argument after this ſorte without al reaſon? You muſt bring in your concluſion vpon thinges, that are true, knowen, and agreed vppon, not vppon thinges that are falſe and not graunted. If you be ignorant in this, you are a very dolt: if you know it, and yet will goe about to conclude your argument vpon falſe propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any proufe going before: you are to be taken as a very ſhameleſſe ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. For emongeſt the guyles and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, which the babling ſophiſters are wonte to vſe, this is accounted for one of the firſt, to goe aboute to conclude what them liſteth, vppon thinges, that are not true, neither graunted, neither agreed vppon. <hi>If the beſt ſtate of the Church,</hi> ſaie you, <hi>was without this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie,

we may alſo lacke it full well.</hi> What, if the beſt ſtate of the Churche was neuer without this Monarchie, may you then lacke it? I thinke not.

if you dally, you dally very ſtalely. If you ſpeake in earneſt, it is nothing true that you ſaie. Neither was it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre (whiche is a ſodaine rage ſtirred through the opinion conceiued of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtie) that could haue moued me to write thoſe my letters, for ſo muche as I was neuer prouoked to diſpleaſure with ſo much as one rough worde of any Engliſh man: but it was the loue of moſt holy Religion, and the good wil I beare towards the Quene, that moued me to ſend thoſe letters, and to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe her to eſchew the danger that han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged ouer her and her Realme.

in reaſoning. For you conclude al in one worde, as often as you liſt, and that meruelouſe wittily. But yet you take ſuch thinges, as are neither true, neither of force to conclude thoſe thinges, that you would proue. For firſt of all, the gouernement of a King is not violent, neither tyrannical: and ſuche as he hath taken vppon him to mainteine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like a louing Father, he doth not maiſter them like ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: neither doth he imploye his regimente to his owne commoditie, but to the ſafety of his ſubiectes. It is therefore falſe, that he doth maiſter them, except he wold rather be accounted a tyranne, then a King.

Yet you ſay. <hi>But the Quene put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not her hand vnto holie thinges.</hi> Why ſo, I pray you, M, Haddon? Is it bicauſe ſhe thinketh it not lawful? Or els bicauſe ſhe wil not? If ſhe thinke, that it is not lawfull, then doth ſhee ſpeake directely againſt you. If ſhe be occupied with other affairs, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore committeth holie thinges to men of the baſeſt ſort, ſhee doth otherwiſe then her eſtate requireth. For ſhe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that there is ſome other thing to be preferred before holie things. You ſay. <hi>The ciuile affaires are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the ciuile magiſtrates, the Church matters to the Biſhops.</hi> What Biſhops meane you? Are they thoſe Biſhops, that you haue viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly thruſt out of their Biſhopriks, and caſt into the iayles? or els are they

ſuche as you haue caught vppe in the ſtreates, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the alebe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, and haue placed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the roome of thoſe moſt holibiſhops? O what an honorable pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſence of Biſhops is that, for all ſubiects to reuerence, and al il men to be afraid of? But I would faine learne of you, what goodly gloſſe of vertue was that, that moued you to place thoſe baſe felowes in this roome and dignitie? Was it their meruelouſe and chaſt life, which you can not abide? Was it the knowledge of holie Scriptures, the which thei had learned in tauernes, or in ſcholes, where perhappes they had ben Maiſters? Was it their wonderful eloquence, where with thei were able to withdrawe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people from licentious liuing to continency, which they them ſelues abhorre? For it is to be thought, that they that depriued thoſe godlie and learned Biſhoppes of al their dignities, would not haue done ſuch wrong vnto the vertuous men:
<pb facs="tcp:970:141"/>
vnleſſe they had meant to ſet other in their places, that did very farre excede them in all godlines, learning and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>But I wold demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one thing of you: if they be ſo holi, ſo lerned, and ſo elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherfore did you not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them aboue all other this care and charge to write againſt me?

Was there ſuche a ſcarcity of learned Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, that you muſt needes take vpon you a charge that was none of yours, no nor ſeemely for you to medle in? For, to mainteine Religion, appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to a Biſhop, not to a man, that is to urmoiled in the ſuites and queſtions of the ciuile Law. If they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in ſuch vertues and qualities as are to be required in Biſhops, what a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde malice was that to thruſt out the good Biſhops, and to put ſuch baſe felowes in their roomes and dignities?
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:970:141"/>
You politike wiſe man, doe you not ſee that that common weale is neere to vtter ruine and decaie, wherin ſuch honours as are dewe to honeſtie and vertue are geauen to baſe varlettes? But be it, that they had ben promoted to this honour for their excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities (for I can not wel geſſe the truth of the matter: and it maie be that thei were, before thei came to that digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, put to ſchoole to Bucere or els to your Martyr:) but ſir, I demaunde of you, by what right or iuſtice was it done? Howbeit as touching iuſtice you haue already ſatisfied me, when you affirmed, that within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe of the Queenes Maieſties authoritie is conteined, what ſo euer concerneth God or man. But yet I pray you tell me, with what ceremonie, with what ſolemnitie, with what Religion was it done? Who laied handes on them? who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated them? I would know what holines and puritie you vſed in

the doing of it.

But you in geauing ouer the right of the biſhops to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, declare, that your biſhops are no diuines. Your biſhops therfore are (as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:970:142"/>
the common report is) not only poore ſcrapers and baſe felowes, but alſo vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant in the holie Scriptures. And menne ſay, that the principall cauſe whie they are choſen, is, that they muſte content them ſelues with ſome ſcantling of their reuenewes, and leaue the reſt to be rifled of you vnder pretence of the Queenes eſcheker. If this be not true, you muſte not blame me, a man (as you ſay your ſelfe) vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queinted in the affaires of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: but the falſe report of your il willers.

            <p>You conclude at the length, that both the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the biſhops, and decrees of the diuines are autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed by the confirmation of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Maieſtie. Whie then, if there

Tribute, to whome you owne tribute: cuſtume, to whom you owe cuſtume: feare, to whome feare is dewe: and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to whom honour apperteineth. It liketh not the Apoſtles to haue anie ſedition or broile in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale; or anie thing that maie diſtourbe the peace and good order. And therfore, although Princes were at that time verie ill affected towardes the moſte
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:970:146"/>
holie ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of Chriſt: yet in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters apperteining to the ciuile gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund al Chriſtian men, not only to obey their Princes, but alſo to make their hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble praiers vnto God <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>a</hi>
               </note>for their good eſtate. S. Peter therfore gaue not vnto the king, in calling him more excellent, the ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in the Church: (neither did anie man euer dreame of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that beſides you) but he graunted vnto him the ſupreme power in the ciuile gouernment.</p>
            <p>Tel me, I praie you, who helde the kingdome at that time, when S. Peter wrote theſe thinges? either it was Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius, or Claudius, or Nero. For Tiberius (which was alſo a naughtie and vniuſt man, as we maie coniecture) was dead before. Is this your iudgement then M. Haddon, that Peter and Paul did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, that the Preſident of the Churche ſhoulde doe nothing, but by order of Caius, or Claudius, or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro: that he ſhould reteine ſuch Prieſtes
<pb facs="tcp:970:147"/>
onlie, as they wuld haue and put away the reſt, if it liked the emperour: that he ſhould, if there chaunced any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie or hard queſtion in the Church, referre it to Ceſar: or that (to be ſhort) he ſhould miniſter all the ceremonies and ſacramentes of our religion accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Nero his pleaſure? If theſe thinges be voied of al wit and reaſon, then is that your opinion, whervpon theſe thinges doe neceſſaliy folowe, ſuche, that if you would ſtudie for it, you can not deuiſe anie thing more fooliſh and vnreaſonable.</p>
            <p>But you will ſaie, that this ſentence of S. Peter perteineth not to ſuche Princes as are enemies to the faith of Chriſt, but only to Chriſtian Princes. If you ſaie ſo, then are you of this mind, that S. Peter gaue this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to the Chriſtians, that, ſo long as ſuch men reigned, as were not well affected towardes the name of Chriſt, they ſhoulde not acknowledge their
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:970:147"/>
authority, they ſhould not regard their officers and magiſtrates, they ſhoulde deſpiſe their lawes, they ſhoulde like rebelles diſorder the peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie of the common weale. The which it were a verie great madnes to ſpeake. For then to what pourpoſe ſhould S. Peter bring in this ſentence <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi>
               </note>afterward. That you maie, ſaieth he, by well doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put the ignorance of fooliſh men to ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Doutleſſe, if they had not obeied vngodlie Princes, no man would haue ben put to ſilence by them: but euerie man would haue ſet vpon them, (and that for their deſert) as vpon peace breakers and enemies to al good order.</p>
            <p>If then neither the ſignification of the word requireth it, neither wil rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beare it, neither the comely diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the orders eccleſiaſticall and temporal by anie meanes in the world ſuffer it, that kinges ſhould beare anie ſwaie in the Church: what a ſtraunge
<pb facs="tcp:970:148"/>
kind of flatterie was this in you, to yeld vnto kinges a full power and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authoritie in Churches? But what a ſhameles part is that in you, to affirme by the authoritie of S. Peter and Paul, that the authoritie of kinges is aboue al other authorities? I graunt you, that kinges are by the authoritie of S. Peter ſet ouer al rulers and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the ciuile gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but not ouer things apperteining to religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not ouer the holi ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the church, not ouer the ſacramentes and ſeruice made to appeaſe the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſaie, that we doe abuſe th' authority of S. Peter and Paul to ſet vp the kingdome of the ſea of Rome, it is falſe. For we leane to the wordes of Chriſt, when we defend the authoritie of the biſhop of Rome: and who ſo euer doth violently wreſt the moſt plaine woordes of Chriſte, we iudge him to be a preſumptuous felow, we take him for an vnreaſonable,

For being once agreed that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Pope is good and godly: it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:970:149"/>
foloweth, that we muſt obey his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces and lawes. For as Kinges, to whome God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the ciuile gouernement in the common weale, not contenting them ſelues with the holie ſcriptures, ſuche as concerne the ſtate of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale (for ſo much as al things that maie happen in diuers kindes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weales, could not be compriſed in them) haue made other ſtatutes and lawes, the which all men are bownd to obey by the law of God: ſo the Biſhops of Rome, to whome is committed the rule and gouernement of the vniuerſal Church (although you ſwel and burſt at it) doe make decrees, not only by word, but alſo in writing, as the times require: the which all we, that beare the name of Chriſtian men, are bownd to obſerue and keepe.</p>
            <p>As for the feare, the whiche, I ſaied, was taken quite awaie by you, I doe impute it, not only to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caie of the Canon lawe, but muche
<pb facs="tcp:970:150"/>
more to the neclecting and deſpiſing of the lawe of God. For I ſaie, that thrugh the decrees of Luther the fear of Goddes iudgement and euerlaſting damnation is vtterly quenched. <hi>I haue heard,</hi> ſaie you, <hi>that verie manie men haue ben by the Canons excedingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritched: but I haue not heard, that manie haue ben instructed in the feare of God.</hi> What M. Haddon? Such as folow the ſtudie of the ciuile lawe, are they al in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the feare of God? No truly. And yet you woulde not haue the whole ciuile lawe to be burned for that. For the ordinaunces of Princes are not to be diſanulled for the malice and crafte of the interpretours: but the lewdnes of ſuch as turne all lawes to their owne gaine and aduantage were moſt ſeuerely to be reſtreined. And yet you ſaie, that you doe obſerue the decrees of Popes, bicauſe they are not a litle profitable. The whiche thing
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:970:150"/>
truly I meruaile muche at, for two cawſes. Firſt, bicauſe in this pointe you diſſent from the moſt holie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Luther, who, as you ſaie, was ſent from heauen. For he burned all the Popes decrees in ſuche ſorte, that he left not one of them. Then, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all your trade ſo dependeth of heauen, that you eſteeme all wordlie thinges no better woorth, but to be caſt awaie.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſaie, that I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your Doctours, bicauſe they haue cawſed a certaine vnreſtreined libertie in ſuche as they teache: I graunt I am yet of that opinion, and howe true it is, I will declare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>You complaine afterward, that I mocke thoſe your holie men. Your woordes are theſe. <hi>I woulde haue you to remembre, what your great Maiſter of eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wrote ſometime verie wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that it is an vngodlie coſtume to daly
<pb facs="tcp:970:151"/>
against the Gods, whether it be done in earneſt or in ſport.</hi> You are to ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, M. Haddon, and I ſee now, that Luther is a holie God with you, and that you praie, that Bucer wil be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto you, and that you thinke, that you muſt appeaſe with ſacrifice the maieſtie of your Martyr alſo. For theſe men do you eſteeme as Goddes: and therefore I looke when you will erecte aulters vnto them. For els, what other Goddes did I euer ieſt at? Then by like theſe are the Goddes, of whoſe diſpleaſure you warne me to beware. But whereas you ſaie, that I do vſe ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting wordes againſte Chriſte, in that point you folow your maiſters, which are in the myſterie of lying very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome crafteſmen.</p>
            <p>You chalenge me to diſpute, a thing ful vnſeemelie for your perſone. For you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not the ſcriptures, no, Luther him ſelfe could not, (being, as he was, altogether blinded in vice and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:970:151"/>
wickednes) diſcerne, what great light was in them. And this is the cauſe why he is caried to and fro, ſo diuerſly, ſo dowbtfully, and ſo vncertanly, that to this daie no man in the world is able to ſaie for certaine: this was his opinion. For at one time he affirmeth, that all ſtandeth in only faith: and he bringeth me in ſuch a faith, as, if it be once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceued, al good works are put to flight. At an other time being ouercome by the very force of truth it ſelfe, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed by his frindes to auoid the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie of men, he ſeeketh out the good works againe. I would you wold read ouer my bookes of Iuſtification: and I iudge, you ſhould not neede to be to ſeeke in anie point, concerning this matter, which you now ſpeake of.</p>

               <hi>We beleeue,</hi> ſaie you, <hi>the goſpel.</hi> You do wel. But the deuils beleeue alſo and quake for feare.

                  <pb facs="tcp:970:152"/>
Chriſt: that liue not according to the fleſh but according to the ſpirit. For I wil not goe farre from the verie woordes of the holie ſcriptures, leſt I maie ſeeme in ſome point to deale not vprightly.</hi> That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in deede, M. Haddon, to be the propertie of a perfect lawier, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the writen word of the law, and to goe ſometimes directely againſt the meaning of the lawe. But, I praie you, what words are thoſe, the which you <note place="margin">Ro. <hi>3.</hi> d</note>might in no wiſe leaue out? <hi>S. Paul,</hi> ſay you, <hi>after a long and earneſt diſputation concludeth, that he thought, that we are iuſtified by faith without the woorkes of the law.</hi> What S. Paul hath concluded, I know very wel: but what you wold conclude, I doe not yet perfectely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. <hi>We muſt needes yeld,</hi> ſaie you: <hi>we are not able to diſcredite the goſpell. But yet we muſt take that withal out of the ſelfe ſame S. Paul: faith that worketh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Galat. <hi>5.</hi> a</note>
               <hi>by charitie. If we doe keepe theſe thinges ioyned together: you maie not ſeparate
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:970:152"/>
them, and ſo reaſon againſte an errour, whiche hath none other author beſides your owne ſelfe.</hi> By theſe your wordes I doe coniecture, M. Haddon, that your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, wheras S. Paul ſaieth, that no man is iuſtified by workes, and againe, that we muſt kepe that faith that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by charity: (although theſe things maie ſeeme to diſagree the one with the other) yet that we maie not in anie wiſe depart from the verie wordes of the goſpel. And how ſo euer the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together of theſe thinges maie ſeeme to be a hard matter: yet for ſo much as S. Paul is the authour of it, it were a preſumpteous acte to go about to ſeparate what S. Paul hath ioyned.</p>
            <p>But I am of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that this only argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is ſufficient to proue, that S. Paul neuer ſpake theſe thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, bicauſe they ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g not together. For what thing ſtandeth better together and is more agreable, then the reaſoning and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of S. Paul? And nothing is leſſe
<pb facs="tcp:970:153"/>
agreable then this: that iuſtice is not geauen without that faith, that woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by charitie: and, that no man can <note place="margin">Onlie faith iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not.</note>be iuſtified by works. Not the hearers of the law, ſaieth S. Paul, but the doers <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>2.</hi> b.</note>of the law, they ſhal be iuſtified. They therfore that doe the thing, that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in the law, by the authoritie of S. Paul are iuſt before God. If that be true, what is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of S. Paul, then to ſaie, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made iuſt by workes? You therfore knit thoſe things together, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ioyned. But I would ſtand in it, and proue by this reaſon only, if I had none other, that S. Paul wold neuer ſpeak it.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſaie, that I doe fight or contend againſt an errour, it ſoundeth to my commendacion. For what good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier thing can I doe, them to plucke vp peſtilent opinions by the roote?</p>
            <p>But when you bring in vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, that of the ſelfe ſame errour, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d againſt, ther is none other authour
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:970:153"/>
biſides myne owne ſelfe, we had nede of Oedipus to expound it. You haue a meruelous liking in darke ſayinges. Heard you it euer reported, that I ſhould ſay, that the workes of holie menne were defiled and ſpotted with ſynne, and that for this cauſe no man could atteine iuſtice by holy workes? This is the errour whiche I doe ſtand againſt. But you wil not once ſay ſo, and yet you are ſo babiſh, that you can not vtter, what you thinke. But the fambling of your tongue we wil lette paſſe, and conſider howe fowly you are ouerſeene in weightie matters.</p>
            <p>You ſaie, that woorkes are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable to iuſtification, and yet, you ſay, that workes are not to be deſpiſed, for ſo much as we haue both theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions grounded vpon the authoritie of S. Paul. The principal deuiſours and Archbuylders of your newe goſpell, whome you worſhippe as Goddes, of whome you learned theſe myſteries,
<pb facs="tcp:970:154"/>
went further then ſo, and ſaid plainly, <note place="margin">Luthers moſt da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching Workes.</note>that al the workes, the which holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe, are not only vnprofitable, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vncleane and ſpotted through the contagion of originall ſynne. For they doe not beleeue, that originall or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed ſynne, the whiche we tooke from the ſpring, is quite blotted out in the baptiſme of life: but that it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtill, and caſteth out ſuch a deale of vncleane vice, that all the doinges of holy men, although thei be done by the mocion and inſtincte of the holie Ghoſt, yea and referred to the glorie of Chriſt, yet they are deadlie ſynnes, and deſerue of iuſtice the puniſhment of euerlaſting damnation, without the great goodnes and mercie of Chriſt. If it be but litle ciuilitie, as you ſaie, (and as yt pleaſeth your great lawier to write alſo) to iudge of a lawe, vnleſſe it be thoroughly weighed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: reade diligently the bookes of Luther, Melanchthon, Caluine, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:970:154"/>
other your learned men, and you ſhall ſee, that this was their opinion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the whole ſomme of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whiche they profeſſed, ſtoode vpon this opinion, that they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned al workes as wicked and ſynfull.</p>
            <p>You ſee here an extreme deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of atteining vnto iuſtice. For if no man can be iuſt, but he only that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the law, as S. Paule ſaith: if not he <note place="margin">

You ſee here, after what ſort that man, that was (as you ſay) ſent from heauen, hath cut of by his deuiſes all hope of atteining vnto iuſtice. But ſee on the other ſide, how wittily he hath deuiſed a remedie, and how al the reſt haue folowed him.</p>
            <p>He ſaieth, that no man hath anie particular iuſtice through the grace of Chriſt, but that the iuſtice of Chriſte him ſelfe is applied to all beleeuers by faith, in ſuch ſorte, that the iuſtice of Chriſt is no leſſe acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in euerie faithfull man (be he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:970:155"/>
ſo wicked) then if it were that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s owne iuſtice, that ſtaieth vppon faith onely. He ſayth therefore, that it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe through this faith, by the which euerie Chriſtian man aſſureth him ſelfe that he is in the fauour of God, that the iuſtice of Chriſt is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the iuſtice of that man, that beleeueth. You haue here the law of Luther, ſo muche as concerneth this preſent place, thoroughly ſcanned, ſo that you can not iuſtly complaine of any wrong done vnto Luther.</p>
            <p>Nowe conſider you on the other ſide, what a meruelouſe eaſie waie he hath deuiſed to atteyne vnto iuſtice. For to whome ſhal it not be a very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter (if he wil beleeue Luther) to ſay thus with him ſelfe? This geare goeth gaily wel with me.

            <p>You ſee now, how by the diligence of this excellent felow, all feare is put to flight, preſumption ſet on tip toe, boldhardineſſe confirmed in her full ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and force. For ſo much as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man can not be earneſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to doe any vertuouſe acte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either in extreme deſpaire or elles in extreme preſumption: and Luther hath in parte cutte of all hope of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and in parte hath brought his diſciples into a moſte preſumpteous affiaunce of atteyning vnto it, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:970:156"/>
an other iuſtice that was neuer hearde of before: is it not euident, although to eſchewe enuie he ſpake ſometymes manie thinges concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the woorkes of iuſtice, that he quenched all loue and deſire of well doing? For, I praye you, by what meanes wil you encourage a faint man to doe anie honeſt thing, if he haue learned before of ſome graue perſon, that ſuch as endeuour them ſelues to doe anie vertuouſe acte, doe but looſe their labour?</p>
            <p>Agayne, howe will you driue the feare of euerlaſting damnation into them, that are altogether careleſſe, and preſume ſo muche of their owne iuſtice, that they beleeue, that no man doth paſſe them in any excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of iuſtice? Wherefore no man in the worlde wil euer bend him ſelfe to doe holie woorkes (if he hearken to the Doctrine of Luther) for ſo much as it is impoſsible, that any man,
<pb facs="tcp:970:157"/>
being either in extreme deſpaire of honeſtie, or elles in extreme preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ſaluation, ſhould earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour him ſelfe to folow godlines.</p>
            <p>But, you wil ſay, that it may be, that Luther did exhorte his countrey men to good workes in his Bookes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. I know that wel. So did Epicure him ſelfe, when he had with Decrees taken away al vertue, yet woulde he diſpute now and then of vertue very notably. I conſider not, what the light felowe ſaith ſometime, either through the inclination of nature, or elles for feare of enuie: but I ſee, what is moſt agreeable to his decrees and doctrine. This is moſt vndowbtedly true that, when thinges are either vtterly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, or certainely aſſured, there is no man, that wil take any great paines in folowing of vertue. Therefore, for ſo much as Luther hath ſhewed him ſelfe to be the authour both of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme deſperation, as alſo of that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:970:157"/>
preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: who doth not ſee, that, by him, al good and godly works hath ben quite ouerthrowen? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was in him a great fault, a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el deede, a ſhameleſſe acte, a wicked crime, an intolerable villanie: but yet was that other muche more heynouſe and deteſtable, that he woulde wreſt the godlie and wiſe ſaying of S. Paule after his owne pleaſure, and abuſe the teſtimonie of the holy Apoſtle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his ſhameles opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and doctrine.</p>
            <p>But let vs now ſee, howe you will make Luther the defacer of all vertue, labour, diligence, and induſtrie: to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with S. Paule, the high Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter of al holines, religion and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? S. Paule, ſay you, ſaith, that there is nothing auailable to ſaluation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides faith that worketh by charitie. The ſelfe ſame Paul ſaith, that no man is iuſtified by woorkes. It is therefore euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſay you, that theſe two points are ioyned together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:970:158"/>
But I ſay on the other ſide, that, for ſo much as theſe things do diſagree ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedingly the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible, that euer S. Paul ſhould ioyne them together. But that it may be fene how il your maiſters vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d S. Paul: it is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, what his meaning was, what he went about, what inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purpoſe he had, as in al his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſo eſpecially in this, whiche he wrot to the Romains, out of the which you haue taken theſe teſtimonies cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly vnderſtood.</p>

Paul in this Epiſtle? Doubtleſſe this, to withdraw men from all affiaunce in worldly things to the faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>He teacheth therfore, that there was no ſure ſtaie of ſaluation, neither in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither in the ordinaunces of the olde Law. For it was neither nature, neither the law, that toke away iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and brought in iuſtice, in the which only ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth our ſaluation and honour.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:970:158"/>
For only iuſtice procureth the fauour of God towards mankind.</p>

               </gap> nothing towardes iuſtice, he proueth by this argument: bicauſe all menne, which ſtaied vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, although they were endewed with excellente witte, yet they were ſpotted with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie; with vncleane luſtes, malice, couerouſnes, diſhoneſtie of life, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and with other vices vnſemely to be named. As though he ſhoulde ſaie thus. If the excellencie of nature, if the ſharpeneſſe of witte, if the force of the mind and reaſon had holp<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> any thing towards iuſtice: then had the Gentils, which excelled in nature, in wie, and in reaſon, ben well appointed and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for al helpes and ſtates of iuſtice. But the brightnes of iuſtice ſhone not emongeſt them: (for they were full of iniquity and vices without number) wherefore the excellencie of nature holpe them nothing to liue iuſtly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:970:159"/>
Then turning him ſelf to the Iewes, he vrgeth the ſelfe ſame argument, but more earneſtly and with greater force. For he had entered into a moſt erneſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict with the Iews, as touching the ceremonies of the old Law: the which the Iewes, thought neceſſarie to kepe ſtil, beleuing that the ſoules were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by them.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Law, which were but only ſhadowes of Iuſtice, vaniſhed away at the coming of the true and perfect iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: and that ſuche as referred the cauſe of iuſtice vnto thoſe ſhadowes, appaired the honour of Chriſte. For they diſtruſted the power and merite of Chriſt. And therefore writing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Gala. <hi>5.</hi> a.</note>the Galathians, he ſaith.

only and Images to the hope of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to come. And thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſacrifices ordeined by the law, the which in this place and in the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Galathians, he termeth the woorkes of the Lawe, writing to the Hebrewes, he calleth them the iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the fleſh. S. Paul therefore ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 6.</note>of this part of the Lawe, whiche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in ſhadowes of iuſtice, which conteineth the cleanſing of the bodie, and reacheth not vnto the ſoule, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, that no man is iuſtified by the woorkes of the Lawe. This was the meaning of S. Paule, and the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that ſo long and earneſt diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you ſpeake of. As though he would ſaie thus. If Circumciſion, if the ſprinkeling of aſſhes, if the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vppe of brute beaſtes, if the other cleanſinges of the Law did make men iuſt, it ſhould folow, that al the Iewes which obſerued and kept orderly the holie ceremonies of the Lawe, atteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:970:160"/>
vnto iuſtice. But it is euident, that al ſuch lewes as leaned and truſted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lawe only, were naughty men, vncleane liuers, backbiters, murderers, and wicked perſones. Wherefore they receiued not the fruit of iuſtice by the law. And ſo it remaineth, that no man is iuſtified by the workes of the lawe.</p>
            <p>If you haue any wit at al, this reaſon concluding ſo aptely maie teach you, what workes S. Paule meant, when he ſaied, that no man is iuſtified by the works of the law. For otherwiſe what could any man haue ſaid more vnapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, woorſe hanging together, and leſſe to the purpoſe? If S. Paule had ſaid, that the Iewes had excelled in cleane liui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, in godlines and innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie, and yet that ſuch vertuos dedes had helped nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g towardes iuſtice: if he had vpon theſe thinges concluded, that they were not iuſtified by the workes of the law: you might well haue geſſed, that by the works of the law, he had vnderſtoode
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:970:160"/>
the deedes of vertue and godlines. But S. Paul neuer ſpake any ſuch word. No, he declareth plainly by the teſtimonie of the law it ſelfe, that ſuch as beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and labour about the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the law, wer very naugh ty and wicked men: whereupon he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <note place="margin">Works of the lavve do not iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</note>that the works of the law did not iuſtifie. What then? Think you that S. Paul doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vpon things that are not proued and agreed vpon, as you do? If you preſume to ſay ſo, then ſhal you falſly charge the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the holy man with the crime of raſhnes and folie. The whiche thing how far it is from S. Paul, is wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to al ſuche as ſtudie his writinges with a pure inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion. For what can be deuiſed more witty and better appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fuller of wiſedome and more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly endited, then the reaſoninge and ſtyle of S. Paule? His Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are al ſo wellinked within them ſelues the one dependeth of an other

ſo aptly, they are knit together ſo fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the ſeconde cometh in vppon the firſt, the laſt anſwereth vnto the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmoſt ſo neceſſarily, he chaineth all the whole diſcourſe in one, with ſuch an excellent order and cunning, that it is not poſsible to finde any one pointe in al his talke, that agreeth not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully wel with his meaning expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any other place before. It is therfore gathered by the reaſon it ſelf of S. Paule, (which concludeth verie aptly) what workes of the Law thoſe are, by the which, he ſaieth, no man is made iuſt. They are thoſe workes, the which S. Paule plucketh at euermore in his diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, againſt the which he contendeth moſte earneſtly, from the afſiance of the which he endeuoureth to withdraw the Iewes: for the cauſe of the which he was cruelly aſſaulted of the Iewes, and oftentimes put in great peril of his life.</p>
            <p>Now if you deſire to know, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:970:161"/>
theſe ſacrifices of the Lawe, are called the woorkes of the lawe: howe thoſe workes alſo, which are done by the ſtrength of reaſon only, (vnto the which men leane and truſt to muche, and therefore require againſt al reaſon a reward for them, not accordinge to grace, but of duetie) are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted emongeſt the workes of the Law: how the workes of godlines, charitie, humanitie and vertue are to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the power and holineſſe of faith: in how great blindenes thei are, the whiche not vnderſtandinge theſe places of S.

I will not as now diſpute, howe farre from al reaſon it is, to put any hope or affiaunce of ſaluation in a thing, that is vncleane and wicked. And therfore, if al workes, as Luther ſaith, are defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with ſinne: then are thei not to be wrought dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, but to be neglected and deſpiſed.

not for that, that workes doe make the way vnto ſaluation, (for as of them ſelues they came not into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) but bicauſe there is in them a certaine fruit of Faith.

            <p>Now let vs ſee the faith of Luther,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:970:165"/>
whether it be able to bring foorth any <note place="margin">Luthers faith fruit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les.</note>fruicte, that is quicke. No without doubt. Firſt of all, bicauſe al workes as he ſaieth, ſeeme they neuer ſo holy, are diſteined with ſynne. And no man maketh any account or eſtimation of a thing that is vncleane and ſpotted with ſynne. Moreouer bicauſe (as he mainteineth) the force and ſtrength of inordinate luſt is ſo great, that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it impoſsible to withſtand it by any meanes in the world. Seing then it is impoſsible for any man to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour him ſelfe to doe any good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, vnleſſe he doe firſte deſtroie the kingdome of ſynne: and the kingdome of ſynne can not poſsibly be deſtroied, if it be true that Luther ſaith: it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that no man can poſsibly do any holy workes. For who is ſo mad, that he wil beſtowe his labour in any thing in vaine and without fruicte? Laſt of al bicauſe Luther hath determined ſuch a kind of iuſtice, as needeth not
<pb facs="tcp:970:166"/>
the healpe of any doing or worke. For if I perſuade my ſelfe, that the iuſtice of Chriſt is applied vnto me by faith, no leſſe then if it were mine own iuſtice: and that I haue atteined vnto that moſte high and perfecte iuſtice of Chriſt, although I lyue and continue in ſyn: with what deſire, care, or hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes ſhould I be pricked forewarde to doe any good worke? Forſomuche therefore as Luther both deſpiſeth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly works, and cutteth of al hope of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie and holineſſe: and by this faith, which he hath deuiſed, taketh away al feare of puniſhment: is it not euident, that he is the ouerthrower of holy workes, the deſtroier of honeſtie and godlines? although he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to ſtirre vppe his diſciples to the loue of vertue? Wherefore it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſeene, that this man of God, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend aboue the heauens, what with bringing good workes into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and what with cauſing men to

            <p>
               <hi>The ſelfe ſame S.

Paul, that the freedome of will is buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon his authoritie, the whiche Luther goeth about to ouerthrowe? For wherefore ſhoulde he haue ſaied, that we are the coadiutours of God, if a man coulde doe nothing towardes the woorke, that God woorketh in vs? Wherfore ſhould he haue warned vs to woorke our ſaluation, if it were
<pb facs="tcp:970:170"/>
not in our power to doe it? But you, euen as in that ioyning of faith that woorketh by charitie, and of woorkes that are vnprofitable, laboured in vaine to glew together by the teſtimonie of S. Paul ſuch things, as can not poſsibly be ioyned: in like manner you would bring to paſſe, by this your ſingular wit, the which we ſimple idiotes can not reache vnto, that freedome and bondage ſhould be knit together with a moſt faſt knot of frindſhip, and that by the ſayings and meaning of S. Paul. And therfore at one time you alleage certaine places of S. Paul, that maketh for freedome: at an other time you bring other teſtimonies, the which, as you thinke, confirmeth bondage. But I might proue by this argument alone, that you could neuer ſo muche as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte, what great wiſedome was in S.

For although they be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers channels of waters, yet came thei al out of one fountaine. But whereas you abuſe the teſtimonies of S.

Where haue you heard or read, that I doe denie the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, or that I doe affirme, that out of it there ſhoulde ariſe anie euil in the worlde? Is this no furie? Is this no madnes? Is this no impudencie? You coulde neuer gather anie ſuche thing out of my writinges: vnleſſe you thinke perhaps, that the prouidence of

            <p>In this place, (good Chriſt) what a ſtirre you keepe? how wonderfully you laie about you? how you vaunt your ſelfe in wordes like a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? You doe, in your owne conceit, not only beate backe the hornes, as you ſaied before, but alſo ouerthrow and diſcomfite a whole armie. You bring diuers places of S. Paule, which are nothing neceſſarie, to prooue that there is a prouidence. After that you laie out againſt me with open mowth, as though I ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that by the prouidence of God, if there were any, a man were bereft of his ſenſes. The which is in deede a verie ſhameles lie. For you neuer read anie ſuch word in my oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neither doth it folow, that a man ſhould be like a blocke, of gods
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:970:172"/>
prouidence, but of Luthers madnes, by the which, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, he taketh awaie the freedome of the will. But you peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture thinke, that the lewdnes of Luther is ſo ioyned with this prouidence, that who ſo euer ſpeketh erneſtly againſt Luthers mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he muſt needes appaire Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence. But I am of a contrarie mind, that who ſo euer foloweth the lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Luther, doth ſo much as in him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ouerthrow the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God.</p>
            <p>But what meaneth this? Wherfore declare you not in plaine words, what you wold haue? wherfore vſe you ſuch darke parables? wherfore forſake you the name of Babilonical bondage, and take vp viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tli the name of prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? Luther ſaied, that free wil was either a thing of a title only, or els a title with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a thing. He ſaith, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and not doe: that he is drawen, and doth not deliberat: that he is onli an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the which God turneth, as him
<pb facs="tcp:970:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
liſteth: that God driueth him foreward and pulleth him backeward as his ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is: and that he vſeth him as a ſawe or a hatchet: and that man hath no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or ſtrength in the worlde to doe either good or euyl. But he correcteth him ſelfe afterward in this manner. I did il, ſaith he, to ſaie that free wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore grace is a thing of a title only: I ought rather to haue ſaied ſimply, that free wil is a feined deuiſe in thinges, or els a title without a thing. For ſo much as it is in no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s power once to thinke anie good or euil (as it is in the article of Wicleffe condemned at Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) but all thinges doe come to paſſe of a mere and abſolute neceſsitie. He am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifieth theſe things afterwardes with manie wordes, and ſtreineth him ſelfe verie ſore, to prooue that the mind is alwaies tied, the wil bownd, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to doe taken awaie, yea in ſuche ſort, that we can not poſsibly not only doe, but alſo not ſo much as thinke
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:970:173"/>
vpon anie thing good or bad. Theſe thinges taught Melanchthon alſo, and ſo did Caluine with great copie of woordes, and other, whome I here omit. To be ſhort, the ſomme of this doctrine was, that ther is no difference betwene vs and anie other woorking toole. Theſe are the thinges, whiche your Doctours teach openly.</p>
            <p>But I faie, (and al good men, al holy men, all men endewed with godlines and vertue auowch my ſaying to be true) that to teach this your doctrine is a heinouſe offence, a deſperat bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, a deteſtable owtrage, a courſed acte. For graunt me this doctrine to be true, and I ſaie, that lawes are taken quite awaie, counſells put to ſilence, honeſt craftes ouerthrowen, learning defaced, ciuile gouernement diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the determination of right and wrong confounded.

the murder with the ſwerd is arained: ſo, right and reaſon would, that not I, which was forced to doe a miſchiefe by a certaine fatal violence, the which I could not withſtand, but he that vſed ſuche forcible meanes towardes me, ſhuld beare the blame of it. I ſaie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this point, out of the whiche foloweth ſo many and ſuche horrible mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſters, is ſo heinouſe and wicked, that if al the reſt were gathered together, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of this, they might ſeeme to be very light. For it doth both ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw quite the ſocietie and good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der emongeſt men: and it doth falſly charge that our moſt holie Lord and bowntiful father with the crime of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice and creweltie. This therfore do I ſaie, iudge, define, determine, taught by infinite teſtimonies of the holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, moued theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to bi the monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of al holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that euer wrote either of old time or in our daies, inſtructed by many diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:970:175"/>
philoſophers, endewed alſo with vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right reaſon, the whiche was wont to be called the lawe of nature and God: that this abſolute or fatale neceſsitie, with the which Luther tied vp all the doinges and thoughtes of men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, can neither ſtand, nor enter into the mind of anie reaſonable man: and that, who ſo euer deuiſed it firſt, was of al men, that euer liued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, moſt vile and wicked.</p>
            <p>This is that, which I ſaied. This I would haue you to confute, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, either that Luther neuer ſpake it, or els if he did, to prooue that he did it vpon good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration. The which thing of like you doe not (peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture for feare of enuie) and therefore you ſhifte your ſelfe into a diſputation of Gods election, and you goe about to prooue by the teſtimonie of S. Paul, that there is a prouidence: as though I had diſputed againſt the prouidence of God, and not againſt the madnes of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:970:175"/>
Luther. Can anie man in the worlde deuiſe a more fond or fooliſh order of diſputation and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futation, then this is?</p>
            <p>You are ouer bold and raſh to abuſe the epiſtle of S. Paul to the Romaines, being, as you are, altogether ignorant in it. And yet, as though you had with this your leadden ſweard killed God haue mercie on his ſowle, when you had brought in that example out of S. Paul of the children that were yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, you ranne vpon me like a mad man. This is the language, that you vſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſaie you good ſir? Behold the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction once againe, and that according to the pourpoſe of God. Behold the time of the election which was, before the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were borne. What ſhall we then ſaie? that there is anie vniuſtice in God? S. Paul deteſteth that ſaying, but Ierome Oſorius dowbteth not to auowch it.</hi> O M. Haddon, what madnes is this that vexeth you? What ſaie you? What
<pb facs="tcp:970:176"/>
thinke you? What a ſhameleſſe luſt of lying is this? When ſaied I ſo? in what wordes? Shew the place: reprooue me by witneſſes: conuince me by good proofe. Before you doe this why rage you? Whie take you on like a mad man? Thinke you, that Luther, that mad felowe and filthie varlet, and the heauenlie doctrine of S. Paul are ſo neere ioyned together, that who ſo euer is againſt Luther, muſt needes be againſt the moſt holie ordinaunces of S. Paul alſo? <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaie you) <hi>it is the voice</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>9.</hi> c.</note>
               <hi>of God to Moyſes. I will haue mercie on whome ſo euer I haue mercie, and I will haue compaſsion, on whom ſo euer I haue compaſsion. S. Paul bringeth in vpon this: that it is not in him that will, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him that runneth, but in God that taketh mercie.</hi> After this you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the example of Pharao, but you ſhew not plainely, to what ende you alleage it. And then, as though you
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:970:176"/>
had alreadie declared by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of S. Paule, that the freedome of mans wil was taken awaie, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude after this ſort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſaieth Ierome Oſorius? For ſooth he ſaieth: if manes reaſon be tied vppe, if freedome of deliberation be taken awaie, if the will be ſettered with euerlaſting bandes: that it muſt needes folowe, that man is altogether bereft of his iudgement and ſenſes, that there is no difference betwene him and a ſtone, yea that God is made to be the authour of euill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that it ſtandeth not with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that we ſhould be pouniſhed, for that offence, whiche we committed, not with our will.</hi> That is true, M. Haddon, neither haue you confuted my argumentes, neither haue you brought anie teſtimonie of S. Paule, the which might cauſe me to chaunge my minde. And yet as though you had determined the matter all at
<pb facs="tcp:970:177"/>
pleaſure, you rowſe your ſelfe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a more earneſt vaine of ſpeach, you bring thoſe woordes, that folowe, out of the innermoſt corner of your cunning. You ſaie thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doe I make anie thing of my ſelfe? doe I alter or chaunge anie thing? do you not acknowledge your owne wordes, whiche are partly falſe, and partly wicked?</hi> Theſe things while you declaimed them like a fine Rethorician, and vaunted your ſelfe ſomewhat inſolently with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine luſtie kind of talke: you make that ſame gliſtering gloſſe of wordes to ſhine a great deale the brighter by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in (as your manner is) a taunt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch. Your wordes are theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of like you are that prowd reaſoner, whoſe haughtines S. Paul rebuketh very ſharply. Will you being an earthen veſſel, made of dyrt and claie, demaund of the potter, to what vſe he hath ſo made you?</hi> Theſe and the like tauntes you caſte out againſt me, and you warne
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:970:177"/>
me withall, that I doe not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, thorough this my intolerable pride, ſuch as leane vppon the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. Theſe are the thinges, which you vtter in exceeding great choler.</p>
            <p>O goodly golden veſſel, made by the excellent woorkemanſhip of Bucer, I pray you diſdaine not the poore ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then veſſels: for it is in them, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come golden veſſels. In a great houſe, ſaith S. Paule, there are veſſels, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of gold and ſiluer, but alſo of wood <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>c</hi>
               </note>and earth. And ſome are made for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſome for reproch. If any man therefore will pourge him ſelfe from theſe, he ſhalbe a veſſel for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, made holy and meete for our Lord, and prepared to all good worke. You ſee how S. Paule declareth, that it is a very eaſie matter for vs, if we wil, to be chaunged out of woodden and earthen veſſels, into veſſels of gold and ſiluer. And by what meanes this
<pb facs="tcp:970:178"/>
thing may be brought to paſſe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth plainly, when he ſaieth: If he wil pourge him ſelfe from theſe. From whom? From them doubtleſſe, which as he ſaid a litle before, had ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen the faith of certaine men. But that you may vnderſtande, howe ill your maiſters haue expounded thoſe teſtimonies of S. Paule, whiche you haue hudled vppe together, I thinke it neceſſarie to ſet out at large the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of S. Paule. The which thing, that it may the better be done, it is to be conſidered, to what ende S. Paule brought al thoſe argumentes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A learned expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:970:178"/>
to the fleſhe, but according to the ſpirite: that is to ſaie: they put away all filthineſſe of vncleane life and naughtineſſe, they cutte of the verie ſtringes of carnalitie, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the woorkes of vertue, godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and iuſtice with an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: when he recorded after this ſort in his mind the graces and gyftes, with the which the mindes of thoſe menne were adourned and bewtified, that were receiued into the protection of Chriſt, and ordered by the guydaunce of the holy ghoſt: he reioyſed incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly.

But for ſo much as many men tooke occaſion by this fall of the Iewes, to appaire the eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods truth and faithfulnes: ſaying,
<pb facs="tcp:970:179"/>
that it could not ſtand with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of Gods truth, that that nation, which was foſtered in great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of libertie and felicitie, whiche was called by Gods owne promiſes to the hope of the heauenly and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting kingdome, ſhoule be tourned out of al good thinges, and left in moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible darkeneſſe: and that it might be gathered by this, that either the light was not yet brought into the worlde by Chriſt, or that God was not ſure of his promiſe: for ſo much therefore as certaine raſh and vndiſcrete felowes vſing theſe argumentes went abowte therby moſt vnworthely and ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to diſteine the glorie of God: S.

And ſo much doth he ſignifie, when he ſaith. Not, that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:970:179"/>
the worde of God is fallen. Nowe the <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>9.</hi> b<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>prouſe of this defence he taketh out of ſower places.</p>
            <p>The firſt place is the deſcription of a true Iſraelite, to th' intent that, when it was vnderſtoode, that the Gentiles gathered together vnto Chriſte were nombred in the ſtocke of Iſrael, it might appeare, that God had in their ſaluation and honour excedingly well fulfilled his promiſes.</p>
            <p>The ſecond place was that, in the which he declared, that maine, euen of them that came of the very ſtocke of Iſrael, were ſaued. For in that great ſhipwracke, certaine remnantes eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped through faith, out of that moſt crewell tempeſt and waues of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
            <p>In the third place he teacheth, that ther was no ſtay in god, but that al the Iewes might haue come to ſaluation. For God had his treaſures and richeſſe alwaies in readines to beſtowe them,
<pb facs="tcp:970:180"/>
and allured them with often calling v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to repaire towardes him, and to receiue the fruicte of his bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but they being through the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their law brought into a pride, and through pride into verie madnes, with harts vnkind and obſtinately bent to liue in ſynne, refuſed the liberalitie and gentle calling of God.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>11.</hi> c.</note> Laſt of all he foretelleth, that the time ſhal come, when the ful multitude of the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles are come in, that al Iſrael ſhalbe ſaued. And with theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, (whiche he handleth at large) the Apoſtle declareth very plainely, howe faſt and ſure God hath alwaies continued in his faithful promiſe. Of the which we wil touch thoſe pointes onely, that apperteine to this preſent diſputation.</p>
            <p>Firſt therfore he ioyneth the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of a true Iſraelite with the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of equitie and iuſtice: and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the nobilitie of a true Iſraelit
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:970:180"/>
conſiſteth, not in the communitie of bloud, but in the propagation of faith: and that he is the true ſonne of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is borne according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, the whiche faith behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: and not he that is borne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, in the which earthie men do glorie. Not they, ſaith S. Paule, <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>9.</hi> c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>that are the ſonnes of the fleſh, but thei <note place="margin">Gen. <hi>18.</hi> b.</note>that are the ſonnes of promiſe, are cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſeede. And this is a word of promiſe: I wil come about this tyme, and Sara ſhal haue a ſonne.</p>
            <p>But leſt it might be ſaid, that Iſaac was therfore preferred before Iſmael, bicauſe he was begotten of a free mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he bringeth in like manner an other example of twoo twinnes. For Iacob and Eſau were begotten and borne both of one father, of one Mother, and in one hower: and yet was Iacob placed in the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of his Father, out of the whiche Eſau was caſte by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence

For the very yelding of my minde, by the which I geue my aſſent vnto the warninges and inſpirations of God, and do not refuſe his benefites, is to be referred to the grace and mercie of him, that called me, and bowed my mind: and in the receiuing of my ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and dignitie there is no merite of mine. For if I be a poore needie man, and oppreſſed with extreme neceſsity, what merite is mine, if I be ſuſteined, and enriched by the liberalitie of ſome bountiful Prince, which ought me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?

            <p>It foloweth in the text of S. Paule. What ſhall we then ſaie? Is there any vnrighteouſnes in God? God forbid. For he ſaith vnto Moyſes. I wil haue mercie on whom I haue mercie: and I wil haue compaſsion on whom I haue compaſsion. S. Paule geueth a reaſon, wherfore no man can poſsibly laie any vniuſtice to God. For the defence of Gods iuſtice ſtandeth altogether in his mercie. For that often repetition of Gods mercie ſignifieth his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie in geauing mercie. And the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God quiteth his iuſtice of al ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. As though oure Lorde him ſelfe ſhould ſaie: I am by nature ſo merciful,
<pb facs="tcp:970:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that I pleaſure in no thing more, then in pardoning of ſyns, and in keeping a moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant and euerlaſting mercie to mainteine them, whome I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into my protection. It may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſene very wel, when I do pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſyn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſuch as are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, do periſh through their owne default. For if thei would come to good order, thei might obtein the like mercy and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But forſomuch as of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, thei eſtemed more darkenes then light, bondage then freedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pouertie then riches, death then life: it was iuſt, that they ſhoulde be throwen downe headlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g into bitter paine and torment. And ſo by this place which S.

For it is he the which with often calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me cauſeth me to wil: it is he alſo, the which geueth a cheerefulnes vnto my wil. Howbeit, neither my deſire, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my cherfulnes, ſhal haue ani good ſucceſſe, vnleſſe he of his mercie ſhall bring both my wil and my earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to perfection. For our ſtrength is appaired, our hopes vaniſh al to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo often as the mercie of God for our vnkindnes of heart, departeth from vs. When I therefore doe any good woorke, it is to be aſcribed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to mans will as being naturallie
<pb facs="tcp:970:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inclined to honeſty, neither to my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt endeuour: but only to the mercy of God. But that it might appeare yet more plainely, that the Iewes fell not through the vniuſtice of God, as vngodlie men reported, but through their owne vnfaithfulneſſe and wilfull ſinne, he reherſeth the like example of naughtines and lacke of beleefe. For God vſed the like meanes in callinge Pharao to honeſtie, and fraying him from vnbeleefe. But he of a pride and ſtubbornes, which was in him, would abuſe the mercie of God, to his farre greater puniſhmente and damnation. Vppon this, S. Paule bringeth in theſe <note place="margin">Exod. <hi>9.</hi> d.</note>wordes. For the Scripture ſaith vnto Pharao: for this haue I ſtirred thee vp, that I maie ſhewe my power in thee, and that my name may be declared in al the earth. In the which place, two thinges are to be noted.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that Pharao was not dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſuche outrage by any violence
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:970:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> force of Gods behalfe, as S. Paule declareth him ſelf unon after. The other point is, that the wickednes of Pharao was therfore tolerated a great while of God, the moſt wiſe and bountiful Lord of al things, (which out of euil thinges draweth euermore ſome good, and bringeth thinges diſordered into good order) that by ſhewing one example of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ueritie, he might kepe a great many men in wel doing. And this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare much better, if we will trie the wordes at the Hebrew fountaine, for this ſentence might very well be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated after this ſorte. For this cauſe haue I ſuffred thee to ſtand, that I may ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>we my power to theo, and that my name may be honoured in al the earth. He ſayeth not, I haue taken away thy wittes from thee, and I haue cauſed thee to be madde, that thou ſhouldeſt continually rebell againſt mee: but, I haue ſuffred thee a greate while, and haue differred thy due punniſhmente,
<pb facs="tcp:970:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that I mighte reſerue it to the greater ſetting out of my glorie, and the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many men.</p>
            <p>He called Pharao both to faith and alſo to honeſtie. But for ſo much as Pharao regarded not the goodneſſe of God, but ranne on like a wild colt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an vnbridled affection: it ſtode ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wel, not onely with Goddes iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but alſo with his mercie, that many menne ſhould by the moſt iuſt example of Pharao be put in feare, and ſo brought to good ordre. For as the gouernours of common weales doe vſe to out of with conſtant ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſuch as they can not redreſſe by lighter puniſhmentes, to the ende that they may by the terrour of that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment keepe the reſt of the citizins in ordre: euen ſo doth that moſt high gouernour ſhew ſometimes an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of ſeueritie vpon them, that wil not be refourmed, but wil vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne wickedly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted heape a ſhameleſſe defence:
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:970:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he maie by the deathe of thoſe lewd perſons benefite the whole, and that he may, in puniſhing the wicked, ſhew many points of his high mercie.</p>
            <p>What is the cauſe then, that we ſee that word ſo often repeted: And God hardened the heart of Pharao. To har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt thou not, ſaith S. Paule, that the goodnes of God mooueth the to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? But thou, according to thy hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vnrepentaunt hart, doeſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vp to thy ſelf diſpleaſure. In like maner therefore God cauſed not that hardnes in Pharao: but Pharao refuſed the mercie of God, and of a certaine hardnes and frowardnes, that was roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him, abuſed the cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of God vnto greater ſyn, and ſo encreaſed the heape of Gods wrathe towardes him euery day more and more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:970:187"/>
Now marke how wonderfully the Apoſtle linketh together his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt of al he declareth, that to be a true Iſraelite cometh not of mans nature, but of the grace of God. Then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the iuſtice of God, by the great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of his grace, which is offred freely to al men, that wil vſe it. For by that mercie it is euidently ſeene, that ſuch as periſhed, periſhed through theyr owne default: and this doth he declare more plainly by the example of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao, the whiche refuſed the mercie of God, and was willingly forlorne: that it might be gathered by this, that the Iewes fell in like manner through their owne wilful blindnes, bicauſe their hearte was to obſtinatly bent and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The which is not ſo to be taken, as though the thing that God willeth, he willeth it without great good reaſon. For the wil of his euerlaſting wiſedome can not be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from vnderſtanding, reaſon, and aduiſement. And his will is to rewarde the faith of the choſen, not as of dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but according to grace. His wil is alſo to withdraw his helpe and aide, from ſuch, as refuſe it, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to ſuffer them to be of a corrupt iudgement. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon S. Paule ſayeth: Then you wil ſay <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note>vnto me: Wherefore doth he yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine? For who ſhal withſtand his wil? In theſe wordes S.

If this be true, ſaith euery wicked perſon, that God ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth mercy on whom he wil, and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him liſteth, he refuſeth him, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his hart, and no man can reſiſt his wil: then he that ſynneth, ſinneth of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity. If he do ſyn of neceſsity, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth God ſo often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of the hardenes and crueltie of wicked men?</p>
            <p>This ſynful and preſumpteous talke S. Paule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futeth two waies. Firſt of al, he ſheweth, that it is a preſumpteous act, to iudge of the iugeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of god. For euen for this cauſe only, that a thing is don bi god, although we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not the reaſon of it, yet muſt we aſſuredly thinke, that it was done, not without great reaſon. Then he declareth the counſel of God, by the which he hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that is to ſaie, beareth long time with the wicked, and at the length lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them deſtitute of his aide and healpe, that he may ſuffer them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>9.</hi> d.</note>to the profite of manier. O man, ſaieth the Apoſtle, who art thou, that

reaſoneſt with God? Doth the thing, which is fourmed, ſaie vnto him that fourmed it, why haſt thou made me ſo? May not the potter make of one lump of claie one veſſel to honour, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſhonour? In which place you may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidre by the name of a pot, that it is not a worke which is determined without reaſon, but ſuch a thinge, as is done by workema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip. Wherin he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you to vnderſtand this much. If the potter, as a potter, doth what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he doth, by art: much more doth God al things, by art, reſon, and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel. S.

If there were any ſenſe in earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: ſurely ſuche veſſels were not to be borne withall, as woulde diſpute with the potter, whiche made them,

And wilt thou ſaie, that the thing, which is made of that moſt high and perfecte wiſedome, (in the which neither raſhneſſe, neither vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may reſt) is made vndiſcretely and vniuſtly?

It is an vnperfecte ſpeach, the whiche manner of ſpeaking S. Paule vſeth ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tymes. There lacketh either this, or ſome other thing like to this. And yet wilt thou reprooue the wiſe and iuſt counſel of god?</p>
            <p>Now in theſe wordes, firſt of al it is to be noted, that God framed not the
<pb facs="tcp:970:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
veſſels of wrath. Truth it is, that God made nature vnto the veſſels, but not ſynne, not vngodlines, not the reſt of vices, which deſerueth to be puniſhed moſt ſharply by the ſeueritie of Gods iudgement, (whiche the holie Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture calleth wrath). For it cometh to paſſe by the wil of euery wicked man, that he is made the veſſel of wrath, which would not be made the veſſel of mercie. The whiche thing S. Paule meani<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to ſet forth more plainly, ſaith: He ſuffered. And being not ſatisfied with that word he ſaith moreouer: He ſuffred in much patience the veſſels of wrath. What is this? What griefe is that ſo great? What torment is that ſo crewel, that, to the bearing of it, God neded patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yea and that no mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, but exceding great patience? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it is that, which is (if God were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any griefe) of al griefes, that may be deuiſed, the greateſt: to wit, it is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious liuing, wickednes, and an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:970:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wil to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in ſynne. For there is nothing els, that diſagreeth with his vertue, goodnes, and wiſedome: there is nothing els, that is directely againſt his moſt holy ordinaunces and lawes: to be ſhorte, there is nothing elles, that God doth moſte extremely hate and dereſt. So that, it is no wonder, if a verie great patience were (to ſpeake of God as of a man) needefull, to beare ſuch a bitter torment. God therefore cauſed not this hardneſſe of heart in Pharao, but he ſuffred with a certaine great patience the wilfull ſtubbornes of that moſt wicked man, whiche grieued his heart. The which thing to expreſſe the beter, S. Paule ſaith: Veſſels made to deſtruction. He ſaith not: The veſſels which God him ſelfe hath made to deſtruction: as he ſaieth a litle after of the veſſels of mercie, the whiche God him ſelfe hath prepared to glorie: that you may vnderſtande, that Godlie menne are
<pb facs="tcp:970:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
appointed vnto glorie by the wil and mercie of God, and that wicked men are thruſt out viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly into euerlaſting tormentes, through euerie mans owne <note place="margin">Eſai. <hi>50.</hi> d</note>wilful ſynne: as Eſaie ſaith. Goe into the fier, whiche you haue kendled for your owne ſelues. But to what ende, I praie you, did that moſt high Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo long time and with ſuche great patience the veſſels of reproch? To ſhewe, ſaith the Apoſtle, his wrath: that is to ſay, to ſhewe the ſeueritie of his moſt holie iudgement, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his maieſtie. Againe, I aſke you: to what pourpoſe was it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <note place="margin">Rom. <hi>9.</hi> c.</note>to declare that vnto menne? To ſhewe, ſaieth he, the ritches of his glorie towardes the veſſels of mercie, the which he hath prepared to glorie. For he doth al thinges for the choſens ſake.</p>
            <p>Now it remaineth, that we doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what fruict doe the choſen take by ſetting the iudgemente of god, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Againe when they conſider by the fal of the wicked, out of howe great thraldome they are delyuered by the mercie of God, they embrace their parent and

Laſt of al the very holines it ſelfe of the euerlaſting lawe, and the ordre of Gods iuſtice being ſet before the eyes and ſight of good menne, bringeth them to a clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer vnderſtanding of God, and cauſeth the mercy of God vſed towardes holy men to be the better knowen: and ſo increaſeth their ioye. To the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the good might take ſo great and ſo manifold fruicts by the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation of the wicked: god would not vſe any ſuch violence towardes the wicked, that they ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſinne as being driuen vnto it of neceſsitie: but he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred moſte patiently their wilful fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes and ſtubborne obſtinacy, that he might in the end tourne altogether to the glory of his choſen.</p>
            <p>If you haue not vtterly loſt al ſenſe of a ſobre man, you may ſee plainely, that free wil is not by the ſaying of S. Paule taken away, but rather verie

ſurely eſtabliſhed. Theſe thinges the Apoſtle proſecuteth afterwarde more at large, and declareth at the length, howe the Iewes fell from God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their pride, arrogancie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe, and obſtinacie. For they were ſo puffed vp with a vaine affiaunce of a ſhadowed iuſtice, which ſtoode vpon the woorkes of the lawe, that they deſpiſed very ſtubbornly and wickedlye the true iuſtice, whiche conſiſteth in cleannes of life, in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in charitie, in peace, in ioye, and in other the like fourniture of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly vertues whiche by the holie ghoſt are planted in the mindes of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men.</p>
            <p>Now for ſo much as this is the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meaning of S.

<pb facs="tcp:970:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with vniuſtice? For what right is it, that wicked men ſhould be puniſhed for a wicked acte, whiche they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not willingly, but being violently driuen vnto it by an euerlaſting and external power.</p>

               <hi>Luther ſay you, ſet out a Booke, in the whiche he ſpake earnestly against the hurly burlies in Germanie.</hi> What if ſome one of them, whom he rebuked, ſhould haue ſaid vnto him eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then: ô Luther, why doſt thou blame vs innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men? whie keepeſt thou ſuch a ſtirre? whie plaieſt thou the madde man? we haue learned of the, that it is not in vs to do any thing good or euil: in ſo much that we are not free, ſo much as to thinke ſuch thinges, as we would. For God worketh al things in vs, as you ſay: and we are only certaine working tooles, the which god thruſteth out with his hand, whether ſo euer him liſteth, and wre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cheth vs foreward and backeward at his pleaſure.

For ſo much as therfore, that moſt mighty Lord, whoſe power can not be hindered by any ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of man, is the mouer, the deuiſer, yea the doer of this ſtirre, whie blame you vs for it? Whie reuile you vs? Whie labour you vainly to withdraw vs from this ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If anie man, I ſaie, of that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whiche Luther tooke vp with ſuche ſharpe woordes, had ſaied thus much vnto him: I praie you, what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere woulde he haue made? With what honeſt ſhifte woulde he bothe maintaine his doctrine, and defend the iuſtice of God?</p>
            <p>But to let Luther paſſe: what ſaie you ſir Luthers aduocate, which ſaie, that he was ſent from God: how maie you (if you approoue his doctrine and rules) puniſh male factours? If there be no freedome, if mans will be tied, if al power be taken awaie, if the verie

thoughtes be fettered, if al things, both greateſt, and leaſt, and middlemoſt, be bownd with an euerlaſt neceſsitie, if God be the authour and doer of all things both good an euyl: vndowbted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe ſeelie wretches, which you (as I take it) commaunde to be had awaie to execution, haue done nothing. By what right doe you puniſh the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent men? What reaſon haue you to put gyltleſſe perſones to death? who made this lawe, that the doers of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony ſhould be acquited, and the tooles or inſtrumentes of fellons co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned? with what kind of ſpeach, are you able (if you minde to maintaine this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) to rid that moſt high Iudge of the infamie of vniuſtice. Is this no vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie? Is this no madnes? Is this no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpteous part of a raſh and an vnbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mind? And yet wheras Luther doth at one time both diſtourbe the order of mans life, and lay vnto gods charg, (like a moſt ſhameles varlet) the crime

of vniuſtice: he is not afraied to ſaie, that he ſtandeth in defence of Gods glorie, whiche he goeth about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and ouerthrow.</p>
            <p>You ſaie, that I doe condemne the firſt fownders of this doctrine, as no leſſe wicked and vngodlie, then if they <note place="margin">Protag. and Diag. thought there vvas no God.</note>were like vnto Protagoras or Diago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras.

Wherin you ſhew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie plainly, that you read thoſe my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with litle heede. For it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my meaning, to condemne all Englande of ſuche vices. For I knowe, there are in that Iland ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie manie godlie and religious men,
<pb facs="tcp:970:199"/>
which neuer fel from the holy church, but would gladly yeald their liues for the glorie of Chriſt, if neede ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Yea manie haue alreadie by their moſt honourable death ſet out their faith excedingly: manie haue abiden impriſonement, reprochful woordes, with diuers other inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities: manie being loth to ſee ſuche a decaie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wander from place to place of their owne accord like baniſhed men and outcaſtes, and haue liefer to keepe a continual combat with miſerie and needines, then to beholde with their eies ſo heauy a ſight. The which thing verie manie other men would do alſo, if you would ſuffer them. Moreouer and this I heare that ther are certaine places within that Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, vnto the which the infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this morreine is not yet come: and it is reported that there are manie noble men alſo, which are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towched. A frind of myne, an honeſt and credible perſon, which hath ſome

doinges in England, tolde me this for certaine, that there are moe in the realme, that continue in their faith ſtil, then there are of ſuch as haue forſaken it: howbeit they dare not profeſſe it openly, for feare of them, that are in authoritie. For it is lawful for them, ſo long as they are not required to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their faith openly, to keepe it to them ſelues, vntill ſuch time, as, they muſt either maintaine their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſuffring death, (if they be put vnto it) or els reſerue them ſelues to a better worlde, to the ende that all good men decaie not at once. And as for them, whoſe heartes are not blinded with pride, which are caried awaie, not ſo much of malice and naughtines, as of ſimplicity of mind (of the which there are verie manie) maie verie eaſily be brought home againe. Wherefore I ſaied not, that al the Iland was geuen to ſuche vices, neither haue I laied downe al hope of the recouerie of the

            <p>Furthermore I meant not in thoſe my letters (as I tolde you before) to make anie enditement or accuſation, but to aduertiſe your Prince, that ſhe ſhould not ſuffer her ſelf to be infected with the peſtilent ſectes of deſperate felowes: the which thing that I might doe it the better, I declared certaine toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, by the which true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be diſcerned from falſe religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and true Prophetes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falſe Prophetes.

Thus much haue I ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning my letters, the which you ſaie were writen without good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without anie comely grace. Wherin I find a great lacke of grauitie in you: for it is not the part of a graue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be moued with a talke, which is

            <p>You confeſſe alſo, that my letters were caried vp and down throughout al Chriſtendome, the whiche ſhoulde not haue ben done, if they had ben written without anie good grownd.</p>
            <p>But let vs ſee, how you, which ſaie that I had no argument to ſtaie vpon, will anſwere that myne argument, by the whiche I prooued, that the puritie of the Goſpel was not reſtored by your maiſters, for ſo much as emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the diſciples of your Goſpel there raigneth a numbre of moſt deteſtable vices. <hi>Tuſhe,</hi> ſaie you, <hi>it is all falſe,

By this talke you thinke, that you haue tourned the eadge of our dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But you ſee not, howe manie faultes there are in it. Firſte of all I deny not, that it was euer ſo (as I ſaid plainely in my letters) that there were manie vices in euerie common weale, and that the ſeades of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines were ſowen emongeſt the good corne. But I required (and that inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to vnderſtand, how theſe menne of god had diſcharged their duetie, which tooke vpon them to purge the corne, and to plucke vppe al ſuch weedes are were noiſome to the corne. The which thing when I ſaw they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not, yea, when I ſaw that through their diligence vice came vp a great deale ranker then it did before, I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by that, that their doctrine was nothing wholeſome. That the true Prophetes ſuſteined the enmitie of falſe Prophetes, Chriſte of Caiphas, the Apoſtles of Nerons, the Martyrs
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:970:202"/>
of Decies, I graunt you: but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much more for the confirmation of myne argument. For vertue was euer enuied of the wicked, hateſull to viciouſe, aſſaulted by the vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <note place="margin">Vertue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth.</note>And yet was it alwaies of ſuche puyſſaunce, that it preuailed againſt al crafte and policie, againſt all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile practiſes and priuie awaites, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the force of wickedneſſe and vice, and brought to the world a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wholeſome ordre. For they that gaue eare to the Prophetes, that folowed Chriſt, that kept the faith of the Apoſtles, that reuerenced the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of the Martyrs, were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpteouſe, wicked, diſordered, and vicious: but they were wiſe, modeſt, ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle, courteous, decked and beutified with diuerſe and ſundry vertues. For the vertue of holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the more it was aſſaulted, the greater and goodlier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it yealded of godlie fruict.

            <p>I ſpeake not of your aduerſaries, by whom you wil complanie peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that your brethren haue benne wrongfully withſtoode, euen as the Martyrs were ſome tyme by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: but I ſpeake euen of them, that loue Luther, Bucer, Zwinglius, and your Martyr, that praiſe and reuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the Churche doth repreſent the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of al theſe benefites in ſuch ſorte, that it ſeemeth, that they are not ſo much declared in words, as expreſſed in doinges. For as the excellent Poete ſaith:
<q>
                  <l>The thinges we heare, do not ſo ſoone prouoke the mind to riſe,</l>
                  <l>As doe the thinges, that vewed are, with true and faithful eyes.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Al theſe thinges, which I haue here declared, with manie other of lyke
<pb facs="tcp:970:216"/>
ſorte, whiche I haue omitted (for I thinke it not neceſſarie, to rehearſe particularly euery point) are not (I graunt you) matters of perfection. They are certayne introductions and neceſſarie helpes for vs, whiche haue ſome what to doe as yeat with this mortall condicion, as we feele by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. For ſo often as theſe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces of the Churche are litle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, the minde waxeth dul, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence fainteth, the loue of religion ſlaketh, and ſo by litle there creapeth into our heartes a certayne forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of vertue and godlineſſe. Agayne, when we bende our mindes earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſette vppe agayne thoſe godlie ordres, we feele, that the loue of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and godlineſſe is ſtirred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kendled in vs. And no meruaile. For why, the brightneſſe of that light, which hath ſo wonderfully lightened your mindes, is not yet riſen vnto vs: neither are we ſo weaned from the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:970:216"/>
acqueintaunce of the body, that we may be without all theſe outward ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnes of heauenly thinges any tyme without greate daunger. This is the ordre of the Churche, which is holy, ſimple, and one: this is the rule and Diſcipline, by the whiche all wee, whiche haue not yet atteyned vnto the higheſt degree of wiſedome, are inſtructed.</p>
            <p>Now I haue declared theſe thinges, it remayneth, that I tourne my talke vnto thoſe your heauenly felowes, and men of God, the which being not contented with this beaten and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcipline, haue taught their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples a newe trade and doctrine which is more wonderful then this. Geue me leaue therefore to talke with them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort.</p>
            <p>It is a great matter (right woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Sirs) and a harde enterpriſe, whiche you haue taken in hande: a thinge of ſo greate importaunce
<pb facs="tcp:970:217"/>
in deede, as none of al thoſe holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whoſe vertue and witte we eſteeme very much did euer attempt the lyke in all their life: to cure an old forgrowen diſeaſe with a new kind of medicine. When you ſawe that the old diſcipline was fallen, that manners were decaied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that vnlauful luſt ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged vp and downe without reſtraint, that the Church tended to ruine: you did, (as it became holy men ſent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen) take it verie heauily. Wherein I can not blame you. For it was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worthie of many teares and much bitter weeping. But you reſted not ſo: bicauſe it were a token of a feint heart and weake ſtomake, to pitie the fal and ruine, and not to procure any other remedie for ſuche a miſchiefe, but onely a fewe teares. You did not therefore, as we are woont to doe, ſorowe and lament ſo great a miſhap, and powre out teares vnto God for it: but you thought it good to prouide
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:970:217"/>
by your labour, ſtudie, and wakefull diligence, that the Church ſhould not be quite ouerthrowen. And who can denie, but that this is a token of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable hart and a valiaunt cowrage. But let vs ſee, after what ſort you haue perfourmed this ſo great, ſo weightie, and ſo worthie an enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>I muſt therfore repete a ſentence, whiche I vſed in my letters, for the whiche M. Haddon, a man brought vp in your rules and doctrine, quarelled with me verie ſharply. What: haue you thought it expedient to heale the woundes, which the Chriſtian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale hath taken, by ſuch meanes, as the moſt holy Fathers vſed of old time in propping vp the Churche, when it was like to decaie? No, ſaie you: for they were the deuiſes of men: and ſo great a miſchiefe coulde not be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died by mans healpe, but only by the ſtaie and mightie power of God. And therfore you determined to forſake all
<pb facs="tcp:970:218"/>
wordlie healpes, and to ſticke only to the word of God. Verie wel. For that is it in deede, which healeth the mind, fortifieth the ſtrength, geaueth light to the ſoule, and bringeth it to euerlaſting glorie. Wherfore I long to ſee ſome worke of this your word of god (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you glorie ſo much) which maie be ſo notable and ſo vndoutedly wrought by God, that it mai appere to the world by it, that you did not without good cauſe ſet all other remedies at naught, and lay all the hope of your ſaluation vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the only ſtaie of this your goſpel. But for ſo much as the kingdom of god that is to ſaie, the goſpel and power of the word of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth, not in the vaunt of woordes, but in a meruelous vertue: and this vertue ſtandeth, not in vndiſcret and ſawcy talke, not in filthy and licentious liuing, not in bitter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and flamboldnes, but in modeſtie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinencie, and charitie, in the workes of iuſtice, and loue of godlines: my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:970:218"/>
is to ſurueie narrowely this your wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful gentlenes; courteſie, ſoftnes, patience, continencie, charitie, holines of life, and other the like vertues, which maie witneſſe, that the Church hath ben preſerued by you. But this can not be, ſaie you, before all ſuche thinges, as hinder this our great and godlie pourpoſe, be taken quite away. For it is the office and dewtie of the worde of God, to pul downe the olde howſe, before the fowndacions of the new howſe be laied. I take this alſo to be verie well and wiſely ſpoken. For euen as a medicine pourgeth oholer or other noiſome humours, which do moleſt the body, before it doth repaire nature being feeble and brought low: ſo was it expedient for you, to expell pride, coueteouſnes, leacherie, and other diſſeaſes of the ſowle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Churche coulde receiue the comfortable nouriſhment of vertue and godlines. This deuiſe of yours I
<pb facs="tcp:970:219"/>
like verie well. But now I deſire to know, how theſe hurtfull and peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t humours haue ben pourged by you. Oh, ſaie you, ther was nothing in the world ſo much againſt godlines, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: wherfore our principal care was, to take awaie al ſuperſtition. You are not to be blamed for that: for in deede there is nothing ſo muche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to true vertue, as is falſe and counterfeicte vertue. Wel now, I will not demaund of you, howe you haue taken awaie ſuperſtition: for that is verie euident. You haue defaced the authoritie of the Biſhop of Rome: you haue ouerthrowen the howſes of Monkes and Nunnes: you haue laied hand on ſuch goods, as were apointed to holie vſes: you haue rifled churches: you haue beſtowed the goods of them vpon whome you liſted: you haue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the reuerence of the auncient ceremonies: you haue defiled the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vſage of Sacramentes: you haue
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:970:219"/>
throwen downe Images, monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, Croſſes, and aulters: you haue conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the deuout teares and good works of holie men as naught and vngodlie: you haue diſanulled the holie decrees, lawes, and ordinances of the Church: you haue cut of all hope of true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and honeſtie, by a certaine tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical eſtate or inuincible kingdome of ſynne, which you haue ful clerkely by your doctrine ſet vp. Neither were you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with this waſt and ſpoile of thinges, but you haue alſo taken quite away the freedome of mans wil: and contrarie to nature and reaſon, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the equity and iuſtice of gods lawe, you haue tied vp all the doinges and thoughtes of men, good and bad, wholeſome and vnwholeſome with a certaine fatall neceſsitie. Theſe are the thinges (with manie other of like ſort) whiche, I ſee, are by you, as the lettes and ſtaies of wholeſome doctrine, pulled downe, defaced, deſtroied,
<pb facs="tcp:970:220"/>
mangled and minced in peeces.</p>
            <p>I doe not now bewaile the decaie and waſt of holie thinges. For if the health of the church could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be recouered, if the Goſpel could not otherwiſe be brought to his olde brightnes and dignitie, I could eaſily beare this loſſe, and it woulde not grieue me to ſee thoſe thinges, that ſtande whole, the whiche you haue not yet deſtroied, to be vtterly raſed withall.</p>
            <p>Wherfore if you haue left anie thing vntowched, ſette vppon it alſo, if it like you, ſhake it, pull it, hourle it downe vpon the grownde, ſo that you reſtore vs that auncient feruencie of godlines, that loue of iuſtice and equitie, that ampleneſſe of charitie, that contempte of wordlie thinges, that earneſt deſire of heauenlie life, with the whiche the Churche was inflamed of old time in the Apoſtles daies. This is the puritie of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:970:220"/>
this is the excellent worke of the worde of God, in this ſtandeth the whole perfourmaunce of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. You can not diſcharge your dewtie and bande with anie meane vertue. For when I ſee the ſacke and ſpoile, whiche you haue made, to be ſo great, howe might I thinke it to ſtande with right or reaſon, that you ſhoulde recompence it with anie meane commoditie? Wherfore I will aske you once againe, although M. Haddon be offended withall, I will earneſtly demaunde, yea I will moſt inſtantly require of you, what thing is reſtored by you in the ſteede of all thoſe thinges, whiche you haue pulled downe? I will repete the ſelfe ſame woordes, that I vſed in thoſe my letters, whiche M. Haddon ſo muche reuiled.</p>
            <p>What is ouerthrowen I ſee, but what is ſet vp, I ſee not: what is grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vp by the roote I perceiue, but
<pb facs="tcp:970:221"/>
what is planted I perceiue not. Tell me, I praie you, what it is, to repaire the doctrine of the Goſpell when it tendeth to decaie? What it is, to bring al thinges verie neere, as M. Haddon your diſciple ſaieth, to the rules of Chriſtian godlines vnto the moſt holie doctrine of the Apoſtles? what it is, to driue awaie with a newe light and brightnes the darkenes of errours, and miſt of ſynne, in the which men liued? I think it be, to bring to paſſe, that men maie haue no wil to looke down vnto the earth, that they may be deſirous to looke vp to heauenward, to become modeſte and humble, to be inflamed with the loue of holines and chaſtitie, to be decked and beawtified with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable vertues of meekenes, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, grauitie, and conſtancie, to be verie obedient to the Rulers of the Churche, to yeald verie great honour and loue to the gouernours in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, to emploie their whole
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:970:221"/>
life, deuiſes and practiſes to a common profitte, to be zelouſly bent to wardes godlines and Religion, finally to make and prepare the way to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertues.</p>
            <p>I demaund of you therefore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be anie one man amongeſt al thoſe, that ſo much eſteeme and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence you, yea that ſette you vp as Goddes, endewed with ſuch a ſeruent loue of heauenly thinges, with ſuche chaſtitie and cleannes of life, that he wil not ſuffer him ſelfe to be diſteined with any ſpot of diſhoneſtie: with ſuch patience and gentlenes, that, although he be prouoked with railing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiteful language, he wil not only not offende in worde, ſuche as wronged him, but alſo wiſh them al good things and proſperitie: with ſuche louingnes and charitie, that he wil beſtowe all his ſubſtance to the common profitte; with ſuche grauitie and conſtancie, that he wyll neuer be diſordered:
<pb facs="tcp:970:222"/>

With al theſe vertues did the Churche ſometimes flouriſh: with theſe fier bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie loue were men of olde time infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: from this moſt ſeruent loue of godlines coulde they not poſsibly be brought by anie terrour or tormentes. And this tooke you vppon you, to pourge the goſpell thoroughly, to put to flight ſuperſtition vtterly, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kendle againe the light of the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church, which was put out.</p>
            <p>Be therfore as good as your word, perfourme your promiſe, diſcharge your debt, into the whiche you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.

Reſtore that puritie of mind, reſtore that chaſtitie of bodie, reſtore that feruencie of godlines, reſtore that continencie, and gentlenes, that peace and concord, that band of charitie and frindſhip, bringe your countreimen againe to that ſtate, from the whiche we are al fallen: that you maie by ſuch a wonderful alteration of thinges, and heauenlie example of vertue put vs to ſilence, to whome this newfanglednes is both ſuſpected and hateful. As for vs, it is no meruaile, if we haue not as yet atteined this great and high perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vertue. For you haue not yet ſet out this goodlie light to vs. I aske this queſtion therfore of ſuch only, as take your part, how holily, how vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how religiouſly they liue. For rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would, as I ſaied before, that we ſhould looke for no meane matters at your handes. For you haue taken vpon you a charge of ſo great honour, magnificencie, and profite to the
<pb facs="tcp:970:223"/>
worlde, as poſsibly there can not be deuiſed a greater. Wherefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe your adherentes and diſciples doe ſo much excell in vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie al other men, that are vertuous and godlie, (and yet be not of your ſchoole) that they maie dymme the light of their vertue, and put them out of conceite: you haue not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led your promiſe. For if the ſelfe ſame degree of honeſtie might haue ben kept and mainteined by vs, without the loſſe and ruine of thoſe thinges, vpon the whiche you haue laied your violent and griedie handes: if the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of your brethren doe not verie much paſſe the vertue of our men: ſhal it not appeare to the worlde, that you wiſe men haue taken a great deale of paines in defacing of thoſe thinges, which you haue ouerthrowen, to no pourpoſe or profite? Shall it not be ſeene, that thoſe thinges were not the lettes or ſtaies vnto you, for the which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:970:223"/>
coulde not exerciſe iuſtice and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines?</p>
            <p>What if your Diſciples are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neuer the better by defacing thoſe thinges, but rather much more diſode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and outragious, muche more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and vicious? What, if licentious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing be now leſſe puniſhed, if miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous hardines be now greater, if more debate and greater broyles haue bene ſtirred vp, ſence you haue ſet your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to be teachers of men? What, if moe robberies and ſhamefuller actes are now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted emongeſt you in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery parte of the realme (if it be true, that is reported)? What, if there be wrought more traiterous practiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the maieſtie of Princes, euen by ſuch as haue geauen them ſelues fully and wholly to your doctrine?</p>
            <p>But I wil let your maiſters goe, and will vrge you, M. Haddo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, once againe? What can you alleage? What exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can you bringe of that auncient
<pb facs="tcp:970:224"/>
vertue? How can you mainteine and defend this newfanglednes? And yet you will auowch, that your Churche differeth nothing at al from the order and diſcipline of the Apoſtles. You ſaie manie things in deede: but no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is in his right wit, will euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you. It is not ynough to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>firme, what ſo euer you liſt, in wordes. I loke for the examples of this heauenly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and not for vaine woordes. If you ſee vnlawful luſt ſet at libertie, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der flinging vppe and downe without checke, the highe waies beſet with theeues and murderers, tumultes ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiracies wrought, and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practiſes deuiſed againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales euerie where: if all theſe miſchiefes be not only not taken away after the time that the doctrin of theſe felowes, whom you ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, tooke place, but rather muche more increaſed: with what face dare you ſaie, that this your newe doctrine
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:970:224"/>
differreth nothing from the doctrine of the Apoſtles?</p>
            <p>You ſaie, that I require a perfection which can not be had in this life. It is like ynough ſir, that I doe ſpeake of light offences, ſuch as continent and honeſt men may fal into euery houre, and not of moſt vile, filthie, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous crimes, ſuch as haue cawſed all holie things to be waſted, ſpoiled, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed with fyer, without any fruict of godlines and Religion, the whiche thinges theſe felowes promiſed to reſtore.</p>
            <p>You require of me, that our church as you cal it, and yours maie be ſet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and compared, that it maie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at the length, whether of them both is more eſtabliſhed by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and doctrine of the Apoſtles. Your requeſt is not reaſonable. For I ſaie not, that there is no ſpot of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanes at all emongeſt vs. But I ſaie and affirme, that it is verie ill done of
<pb facs="tcp:970:225"/>
you, that thoſe ſpottes are not taken awaie emongeſt you by the diligence of your Apoſtles. We haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed nothing, we haue not pleadged our faith and truth, that all thinges ſhould be brought againe to the olde perfection by our diligence: no man can call vs into the court, and charge vs, that we haue not ſtoode to our promiſe. But theſe men, who, as you ſaie, were ſent from heauen, haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this much vpon them: to reſtore the puritie of the Goſpell, to bring againe charitie, holines, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinencie, with that moſt earneſt longyng after the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting glorie, to bring al other ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as ar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in the word ofgod, to light, which were before buried in darkenes, and to ſet vp once againe a heauenly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth.</p>
            <p>But that you maie ſee, what courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and fauour I wil ſhew you in this conflicte, I will not require of you to examine and trie your manners by
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:970:225"/>
the ſtreight diſcipline of the Apoſtles, and by that exacte rule of moſt holie and perfect religion: but to compare the ſtate of this your Church with the grauitie, vertue, religion, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful behauiour of your auncetours: the which thing if I can intreat you to do, you ſhall vnderſtand that there is ſo great oddes betwene your goſpelliſhe doctrine, and the honorable religion of olde England, as can not be expreſſed in wordes. Why then ſir, what a thing is this? If you were neuer able, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the tyme that you gaue your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to theſe newe and vngodly opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to reach to any part of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of your auncetours: by what meanes, I praye you, ſhall you be able to atteyne to that auncient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Churche, whiche flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Apoſtles dayes to the great wonder of the world? Are you ſo voide of all witte and reaſon, that you thinke it ynough to ſay, that your
<pb facs="tcp:970:226"/>
Churche differreth nothing from the Apoſtles doctrine, as though me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were bound by and by to beleeue you? No ſir, that muſt be ſhewed and prooued, not by braggyng and light behauiour, not by boaſting and reprochfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, but by wonderful examples of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, innocencie, chaſtitie, cleanes, religion, and charitie, by a moſt holy life, a moſt vertuouſe conuerſation, and a moſt feruent loue of godlineſſe. Yea, M. Haddon, I tell you once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that it is not ſufficient for them, that haue promiſed to bring the looſe manners of our tyme to that moſt flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate of the primitiue Church, to be meanly vertuous: they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, they muſt be wonderfull. The whiche thing bicauſe they do it not, but rather, wherſoeuer they put their foote, they leaue the grownde em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed with muche naughtineſſe and vice: it is very euident and plaine, that they could not perfourme ſo much, as
<pb facs="tcp:970:226"/>
they had promiſed. For they haue brought into the common weale, for the cleannes of the Goſpell, fowle vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for peace and loue, debate: for modeſtie, pride: for religion, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: for liberty, bondage: for good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, licentious liuing: for pleaſaunt calmenes, a moſt crewel ſtorme. And yet you like a godly man lay before me the iudgement of God, to make me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraied: in the whiche you ſay, that I poore wretch (for ſo it pleaſeth you to terme me) ſhal yeald an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of this ſo heinouſe and wicked offence before the iudgement ſeat of Chriſt, bicauſe I haue preſumed to rebuke thoſe holie, continent and religious perſons.</p>
            <p>In deede there is good cauſe, why I ſhould feare. For M. Haddon a wiſe man, and ſuch a one as hath familiar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference with God at al tymes, wold neuer haue ſaid it, vnleſſe it had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto him before, by ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly reuelation. Reaſon would ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:970:227"/>
that I ſhould tremble and quake for feare of that iudgement, the which you your ſelfe feare neuer a deale, and yet you threaten me very ſeuerely withal.</p>
            <p>You ſay, that I doe not only laugh at your Goſpell, and deface your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, (whiche are very heauenlie menne) but alſo violently wreſt Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie. The which thing how falſe it is, I wil declare hereafter.</p>
            <p>You ſay afterwarde, that all that teſtimonie of Hieremie concerning falſe Prophetes perteyneth vnto vs. Howe ſo ſir? Hearde you euer ſay, that there was any newe Prophete e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt vs, that went about to tourne vs away from the auncient Religion? That warranted vs of peace and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as though he had had commiſsion from Chriſte ſo to doe? That taught the people, that ſynne ſhould eſcape vnpuniſhed? You retourne once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to ſpeake your pleaſure by the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:970:227"/>
holy Church, the ordre wherof I haue alreadie declared: in the whiche al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be ſome diſeaſes, yet they are ſuche as may be cured. For we refuſe not the medicine, the which without the Church can not be found els where.</p>
            <p>After that you commend your own Church highly. <hi>The publike fermons,</hi> ſay you, <hi>you commit to certaine ſeely friers: and they declaime after their owne faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, in other matters they are dome.</hi> As touching preaching, I haue ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that this charge is in no wiſe to be neglected of the Biſhoppes: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the holy Churche beare with ſuch negligence: but rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth and chargeth al Biſhops moſt ſtreightly, to folow the office of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and teaching with all diligence. And it is no reaſon, that the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a fewe men ſhould be imputed to the whole Church, the which is ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reful to take good and wholeſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre
<pb facs="tcp:970:228"/>
with euery particular man, that he ſhould doe his dewtie. Moreouer, there are, as I ſayd before, many Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops emongeſt vs, the which preach oftentymes, and ſtirre vppe their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes to the loue of godlines. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte it were alwaies ſo, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were made by Monkes: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is more tolerable, that godly and religious perſones ſhould be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Biſhops to doe that office, then that baſe fellowes, and ſuche as are poiſoned with moſt peſtilent and erroneous doctrine, ſhould be made rulers ouer Churches.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſay, that at our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons the audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is brought a ſleepe, I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it muſt needes happen ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when he, that preacheth, can not be ſo eloquent and fine, as you are. What then? Bicauſe ſome man nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a litle ſometime, therefore ſhall not the reſt awake them ſelues, and geaue diligent eare to the ſermon?
<pb facs="tcp:970:228"/>
ſhall no preacher be able to moue and exhort his hearers to ſerue God with greater loue and feruency?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the miniſtring of Sacramentes,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the Priestes only are doers, the reſt are but lookers on.</hi> Of lyke you are not pleaſed with that. You haue no liking in modeſt and ſeemely ordre. You would peraduenture, that there ſhould be made a diſordre and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offices, and that al men ſhould take vppon them the office of prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But we thinke, that that come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordre was ordeyned by God, that Prieſtes only ſhould miniſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and that the reſt ſhould take the profit of them with ſilence, and not medle them ſelues with the diuine ſeruice.</p>
            <p>As concerning the vnknowen ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, in the which the ſeruice is ſaide, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficiently already: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, bicauſe I wil not repete one thing often tymes, I referre you to thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:970:229"/>
thinges, that are ſaid before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let vs now enter,</hi> ſay you, <hi>into the maſſes, in the which you would haue the very marow of religion to be powred out.</hi> That is very true. For they conteine in them a moſt ſeruent lifting vppe of the heart vnto God, moſte holy and deuout prayers, the monumentes and remembraunces of Chriſte, whiche repreſent vnto vs his life, his paſsion, his death, and merites, the ordre and woorking of our ſaluation, and the appeaſing of the diſpleaſure of God. And (that I may ſay nothing elles) in them is offered vppe the moſte holie bodie of Chriſt, the ſelfe ſame Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that taketh away the vncleane ſpottes of ſynnes, that yealdeth vppe thankes to our moſt mighty Lord and bountiful parent, that enkendleth god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindes, and inflameth deuout hearts with the loue of euerlaſting life and glorie.</p>
            <p>You ſay moreouer, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medleth
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:970:229"/>
with the Goſpell emongeſt vs. You ſay wel in that. For we can not abide, that euery man ſhould be a Reader, euery man a Doctour, euerie man a Prophet. But we thinke it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to prouide, that al thinges may be done honeſtly and orderly.</p>
            <p>Where you ſaie, that all exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of the Goſpell are whiſſhed omongeſt vs: that is falſe. For we haue continuall preaching, and there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, what ſo euer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualtion, (not vnlearnedly, nor yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauerly, as you imagine:) and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers keepe ſilence after a very modeſt and comely ſorte.</p>
            <p>You come, ſaie you, <hi>to the Lordes Table once per aduenture euery yeare, and that more for a ſolemne ceremonie, then for a contrite heart.</hi> This geſſe of yours is very vaine alſo. Truthe it is, that al men are bownde by lawe and order to come vnto our Lordes Table once in the yeare: but ſuch as doe it but once
<pb facs="tcp:970:230"/>
in the yere, are not wont to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And emongeſt vs there are of ſuch as feaſte them ſelues at this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie banket very often, an exceding great number. Whereas you ſay, that it is done for a ſolemne ceremonie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and not for a contrite heart, you doe but geſſe as your manner it. And for ſo muche as your geſſe prooueth falſe, it ſeemeth, that you may woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie be numbred emongeſt the falſe Prophetes. When you ſaie, that in this ſupper the ſupper of our Lorde is not remembred of vs, you ſpeake with out the booke, euen as you didde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Howe be it, as touching the Supper of our Lorde, I can not wel tell, what to ſaie to you. For as yet I am not perfectlie infourmed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you folowe the wicked opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Martyr, or no. If you doe folowe him, with what reuerence or trembling can you come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Aulter, ſeeing that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:970:230"/>
that there is none other thing in it, but onely a naked and bare remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the death, which Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vppon the Croſſe for vs? If you folow him not, wherefore do you not abhorre and deteſt the naughtie and wicked felowe?</p>
            <p>You find fault with vs alſo, bicauſe we haue no publike or open confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſynnes emongeſt vs. I woulde faine learne of you, how that ſynne, which is committed ſecretely, is to be confeſſed in the face of the worlde.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I haue,</hi> ſaie you, <hi>declared your vſage.</hi> You blamed me, bicauſe being vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the affaires of England, I declared ſuche thinges, as are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſelie knowen and caried by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by talke, by moſte conſtante reporte of all menne, into all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis and Coaſtes, euen to the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt partes of the world, to the great griefe of all ſuch as heare them: and
<pb facs="tcp:970:231"/>
yet you ſpeake raſhly of our matters, whiche you haue neither ſeene, nor vnderſtoode, (and therefore you vſe this word, <hi>peraduenture)</hi> and as though you knew very exactly, al thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which you haue ſpoken, you ſaie boldlie, that you haue declared oure vſage, and that very plainely.</p>
            <p>After that you tourne againe to the commendation of your Church. You ſpeake much of your continuall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, of the deſpiſing of mans traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of your Pſalmes, and Hymnes, and Lawdes, with the which you honour the Lord. Anon after you ſaie thus. <hi>Then foloweth the holy table of the Lord, which is occupied euery holie daie.

And of your Miniſter you ſaie neuer a worde, by what meanes, with what ceremouie, after what ordre of Religion, by whome he came to that dignitie.</p>
            <p>You talke muche of the puritie of your ſermons, whereas in deede there can not poſsibly be any puritie in ſuch a corrupt and peſtilent doctrine.</p>

What, could a man of ſuch a wonderfull witte and ſingular elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as you are of, lacke wordes, in the defence of ſo true and ſo honeſt a cauſe as this is?</p>
            <p>But that concluſion of yours liketh me meruelouſly wel.

For Eraſmus and certaine other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, haue geuen this marke vnto your Religion, that none of you al wil once ſigh, no not vppon ſuch daies as are to be kept with teares and ſorow. And Luther him ſelfe, the foreman of all this rable, he neuer wept nor ſoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, at the remembrance of the bitter paines and tormentes, whiche Chriſt ſuffered for vs vppon the Croſſe.

            <p>As for the diuerſe expoſitions of our Doctors, which you ſpeake of, thei are altogether impertinent to our matter. For there is no diſagreeing omongeſt vs in ſuche matters as concerne the

What thinge can be more euident and plaine, then this ſigne? What more prouidently ſpoken for our ſaluation? Being now warned and inſtructed by God, I geue no eare to wordes, but I tourne mine eye to workes: I loke to ſee, howe faithfully theſe Ptophetes haue fulfilled their promiſe.

Doubtleſſe if we beleeue our Lorde him ſelfe, we muſt ſaie, that it ſtandeth rather in woorkes, then in a goodlie ſhewe of woordes. For ſo muche therefore as theſe your Maiſters haue confirmed this new Goſpel, not by good workes, not by woorking of miracles, not by continencie of lyfe, not by vprighte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, not by feruencie of mind, not by burninge deſire, and longinge after heauenlie things, but by boaſting and bragging woordes: is it not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
<pb facs="tcp:970:236"/>
that they are not partakers of the kingdome of heauen? Is it not cleere, that they were not ſent from God? Is it not verie euident, that they were falſe Prophetes?</p>
            <p>But let vs retourne vnto Ieremie. And firſt of all, where you ſaie, that I would, for a certaine pride, which is in me intolerable, be eſteemed as one of Gods priuie counſel, I would faine learne of you, whereof you gather that. Heard you euer ſaie, that I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched anie newe Goſpell? that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed anie newe doctrine, the which in the olde time was neuer heard of? that I withdrew the people from the olde faith and auncient order with goodlie promiſes? that I mainteined anie opinion deuiſed by myne owne ſelfe ſo conſtantly, as though it had proceeded from God him ſelfe? No truly. What reaſon moueth you then to ſaie, that I take this ſo great a name vpon me, whereas in deede you ſee no

token of ſuch intolerable pride in me? You ſaie afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You molest Ieremie againe, and will not ſuffer the reuerende Prophete to take his breath.</hi> If I haue moleſted the holie Prophete, I haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no ſmall offence againſt my ſelfe. But let vs ſee, how you will prooue it. You procede thus. <hi>You alleage theſe woordes of the Prophete. If they had ſtoode in my cownſell, and had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared my woordes vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, truly they had tourned them from their euyll waie, and from their naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deuiſes.</hi> The wordes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete are verie cleere. I can not tell therfore how you goe about by your woordes to make them darke. It fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let vs take our beginning out of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie, whiche was a worthie Prophete.</hi> You can ſaie none other. If you could M. Haddon, I doubt you would doe it. You goe forewarde.</p>

               <hi>Did he fraie al the Iewes from vice? Did he bend them al to vertue? Marke wel the whole ordre and proceſſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, conſidre the watling that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, which is in deede very lamentable.</hi> Hitherto you reaſon, not againſt me, but againſt the moſt godlie Prophete, to prooue him a vaine man: for you make him to ſpeake contrarieties. He had ſaied before, that the word of God was of ſuch force, that it brought men from vice to vertue. He lamenteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that, although he were ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by the might and power of the word of God, yet he could not poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bring the people from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. Wherefore he ſpeaketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties, and diſagreeth exceedingly with him ſelfe. As you did therefore in S. Paule, euen ſo doe you now. You improue not my ſaying, but you make the man of God to ſpeake contrarie to him ſelfe. But I ſaie on the other ſide: that it may moſt eaſily be prooued by
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:970:237"/>
this reaſon onely, that you could not vnderſtand the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete, bicauſe you thinke, that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth from him ſelfe. For it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that there ſhould be any diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in the worde of God, of the which Ieremie was a miniſter. And yet you, to impugne more openly the meaning of the Prophete, you earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleage the example of S. Peter, yea and of Chriſte him ſelfe, by whoſe preaching, ſay you, not al ſuche, as heard them, were fraied from their ſynne, vice, and wickednes.</p>
            <p>And at the length you goe ſo farre, that you affirme, that whereas one man yealdeth to the warning of God, an other doth not, it is not in the free wil of euerie man, but that it was ſo ordeined before the beginning of the worlde: and ſo you confirme againe that fatal violence or neceſsitie. And whereas you heare the complaint of our Lord him ſelfe, whiche is very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable,
<pb facs="tcp:970:238"/>
wherein he bewaileth the infidelitie of the Iewes, which would not be receiued vnder his winges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto very mercifully moued: yet do you impute their damnation, not to the wickednes of the naughtie men, but vnto God as the author ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The which impiety of yours is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſufficiently confuted, (ſo much as the place required.) But neither you neither your maiſters doe vnderſtand the Prophets: and therefore they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Prophets ſhould ſpeake contrarieties.</p>
            <p>Thinke you, that God by Ieremie gaue that token to diſcerne a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete from a falſe: that al ſuch, as were preſent at the ſermons of a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete, ſhould foorthwith be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen from wickedneſſe, the which thing the falſe Prophetes could not doe? If you imagine, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete ſpake ſo, you are much decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For our Lord him ſelfe, by whoſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:970:238"/>
ſpirite all the holy Prophets were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kendled and ſtirred foreward, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto thoſe men, that were obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bent in ſynne, that ſhutte their eyes, and ſtopped their eares will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that the light of heauen might not ſhine vppon them, or the Worde of God moue their heartes, made them not to forſake their wickedneſſe. And therefore he complayneth of the Capharnaites, and ſuche other as withſtoode his Doctrine verie obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately.</p>
            <p>What is that then, that Hieremie ſaid? Dowbtles this. That ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued the Prophetes, ſuche as hadde them in good eſtimation, ſuche as tooke their ſayinges to be the verie anſweres of God, (if thoſe Prophetes were ſent from God) there is no doubt, but that they were eaſily brought from vnbeleefe to faith, and from vice to an honeſt ordre of life. The whiche thing when it folowed not,
<pb facs="tcp:970:239"/>
it was a moſte ſure argument, that they were not ſent from God. For example.</p>
            <p>Phaſur the Prieſt was in high repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <note place="margin">Ier. <hi>20.</hi> a.</note>He bent him ſelfe earneſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hieremie. Hananias deſired to be called and eſteemed as a Prophete. He was in lyke manner an enemie to Hieremie. Hieremie in thoſe daies threatned the people, that ther ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged a great plague ouer them: but the other ſignified vnto the people with manie circumſtances of words, that al ſhould be wel. Many men folowed them, but very fewe folowed Hieremie. Nowe ſir, when there was ſuch a great diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion betwene theſe twoo factions, by what token might a man diſcerne, whether of them was ſent from God? By the vertues and vices of ſuche as folowed either part. Therfore if it had ben dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly marked at that time, that ſuch as folowed Phaſur and Ananias, or other the lyke falfe and deceitfull
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:970:239"/>
Prophetes, prooued neuer the better, but rather walowed ſtil moſt filthily in the ſelfe ſame vice, as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: might it not haue ben eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that thoſe Prophetes, vnto whom they had addicted them ſelues, were not ſent from God? And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie wiſe if it had ben noted, that thoſe fewe which folowed Ieremie, which reſorted vnto him, which gaue diligent eare vnto his doctrine, did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſinne, embrace godlines, and feare the iudgementes of God: they might haue iudged very well, that he was ſent from God, and that the thinge which he ſpake came not from him ſelfe, but that he vttered ſuche thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges onelye, as he hadde learned of God.</p>
            <p>Wheras therfore ther were at that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yme many men, whieh tooke vppon them the name of Prophetes, and ſaid: thus ſaith our Lorde: when in deede they had neuer heard the voice of our
<pb facs="tcp:970:240"/>
Lord: and clawed the common people and brought them in hope of a merie worlde, and ſaid peace, peace, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no peace, that is to ſay, no great quietnes, and abundaunce of thinges, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme calamitie hanged ouer the ſtate of the Iewes, and the common people, whoſe eyes were wholly bent vppon them, who eſteemed them as menne of God, were nothing the better for them, but continued ſtill in as muche wickednes, as they did before: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it was euident, that thoſe menne were falſe Prophets and craftie crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and that they did poiſon ſuche, as they tooke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to inſtruct, with peſtilent errours.</p>
            <p>The lyke might be ſaid of the tyme of Chriſte and his Apoſtles. There were Prieſtes, and Phariſees, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees, and Herodians, all contrarie to the Doctrine of Chriſte. Suche, as folowed Chriſte, and applied them ſelues with al diligence to learne his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:970:240"/>
doctrine, withſtood ſynne, and were inflamed with the deſire of godlineſſe and vertue: but ſuche as folowed the Prieſtes of that time, and the Phariſees, were diſteined with many foule vices. By this token therfore it might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, that Chriſt wrought by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt, and ſpake the worde of God: and that the Prieſtes and Phariſees tooke a pride vpon their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite which proceded of an vnſetled and vndiſcrete mind.</p>
            <p>We may ſay the like of the Apoſtles, who had much a do with falſe Prieſtes and Philoſophers, whiche were fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly bent againſt the truth. For ſuch as herkened vnto the Apoſtles, were beautifully fourniſhed with the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of true vertue: but ſuch as went vnto the contrary part, were clogged with moſt hei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouſes vices. Any man therefore, that was in his right wittes, might well perceiue by the reſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Hieremie, that the Apoſtles
<pb facs="tcp:970:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were ſent from God: and that their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries were moued and ſtirred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the enemie the diuel.</p>
            <p>That this is the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete, al men, which are not obſtinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet in their owne mad and frantike opinion, may ſee very plainely. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the wiſedom of God, which ſpake in the holy Prophete, ſhould ſpeake againſt it ſelfe: the which thing if a man ſhould but once conceiue it in his heart, it were a moſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> wicked ſynne, and horrible offence. Wee may nowe applie it vnto theſe newe Prophetes.</p>
            <p>There was a certayne woorſhipfull Prophete, whom you thinke vndowb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly to haue ben ſent from heauen. Many men went after him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him highly, and garded him both with their bodies and armes, and fourniſhed him with their gooddes. I will therefore demaund not of al, but of ſuch onely, as did not onely loue

That ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might haue ben a full proofe, that Luther ſtoode neuer in the counſell of God. For if he had ſtoode in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of our Lord, and had declared the verie wordes of God vnto ſuch as fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him and were named after him, dowbtles there ſhould haue ben ſeene ſome wonderfull alteration of life in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:970:242"/>
The like maie be ſaied of Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, Zwinglius, Bucer, and Caluine, and other the like Prophets. For theſe men were none ſuch, as might by good example of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent and honeſt conuerſation aſſwage the heate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinency in thoſe that folowed them: but rather out of their ſchooles proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded verie often vicious and inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent men: yea and not only inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent, but alſo viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t churchrobbers, deſtroiers of good lawes, wily practiſers of treaſon againſt princes, felowes miſchieuouſly bent to deface al places of holines and deuotion by manſlaughter, bloudſhead and fier. Wherfore the teachers of this doctrine were not ſent from God: for if they had ben ſent from God, doubtles they had tourned thoſe men, that honoured them as goddes, from their wicked life.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, for ſo much as there is no diſagreement in the ſpirite of God, if they had ben ſent from God, there

But the world knoweth, that there is a moſt bitter diſſenſion emongeſt them: wherfore it foloweth neceſſarily, that they were not moued by the inſtincte and inſpiration of the holie ghoſt, but driuen with burning fyer brandes of the findes of hell, and that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them ſelues, not to inſtruct men, but to ouerthrow them.</p>
            <p>You ſaie, that there is a meruelous goodlie agreement emongeſt you. I ſpeake not of you as nowe. For it maie be, that you maie by feare of pouniſhmente ſtaie for a lytle time the furie of raging felowes, (the whiche remedie, when the minde is not well ſettled, can not endure longe.)

mighte be preſente wyth you, and preſſe you with wordes, and wind you to and fro by the force of argumentes, that you were able to ſtande to your tackelinges? No without dowbt.

If you vſe the like ſtile and the like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, that is to ſaie, if you contend with the like arrogancie and reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful language: I haue not ſo much time to ſpare, that I wil deſire to take it once in my handes. For you define nothing, you ſpeake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>nothing ſincerelie, you conclude nothing by good argument. You ſaie at the length.</p>

               <hi>Confute it if you can. But you can not.</hi> That was verie arrogantly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Who hath made you ſo loftie and high ſprited? Your eloquence?

            <p>You ſaie, that one hath barked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte your Apologie.

            <p>But this leſſon haue you learned of your maiſters: who beinge openlye conuinced, fall a crying, being ſette a gogge, kepe a raging ſtirre: and when they are able to ſaie nothing to the grownde of the matter, they heape together manie woordes without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and beſides the pourpoſe, and yet they vaunte them ſelues emongeſt their adherentes beyond all meaſure and modeſtie.

            <p>Whereas you ſaie, that there hath ben manie men emongeſt you, which haue confirmed the truth of the goſpel by baniſhment, nakednes, hungre, yea by ſheading their bloud and yealding their liues: I graunt it. For ſo did the Biſhop of Rocheſter, ſo did Moore, ſo did the holy Carthuſians (to paſſe ouer a numbre of others) theſe men died a moſt honourable death for the glorie

            <p>If you meane any other of your men, heare what S.

If thei therefore, that breake vp the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church, and ſeperate them ſelues from it, although they yeld their bloude and liues for the Religion of Chriſt, which the Church holdeth, are

not to be accounted as Martyrs, but as naughty packes and Church robbers: what is to be thought of ſuch, as being without the Church, are not aſhamed to ſpil their bloud and liues in the main tenance of rebellion and vngodlines?</p>
            <p>I am nowe come to that place, whiche is by you, (who are a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally abhorring the ſleightie occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of flatterie and lying) verie clerkely handled. Your woordes are theſe.</p>

Truly if your Quene be ſo witty, as I may wel think ſhee is, not by your talke, but by the reporte of other men, ſhe will tourne you out of her courte and companie as an open and detected flatterer, and wil not ſuffer her ſelfe to be moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently mocked of you.</p>

            <p>If, when you ſette for this bootie, you had made your entrie more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertlye, your fowle flatterie needed not to haue benne repelled with ſo greate inforcemente. For a manne

            <p>As towchinge the quietneſſe of thinges, whiche you talke of at large, I ſaie this muche.

            <p>As for the compariſon of your Church with the Primitiue Churche, which you ſaie may be confirmed by the Hiſtories, I ſaie that, either you haue not read the Hiſtories, or els you are paſt all ſhame. You ſhoulde haue brought ſome example or teſtimonie out of the Hiſtories, with the whiche you might ouercharge vs. But you can neuer doe it, forſomuch as all the antiquitie maketh againſt you.</p>
            <p>Whereas you ſaie, that your nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is verie well agreed, would God it were ſo: but it is otherwiſe repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted commonlye.

            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore ſaie you, that menne haue benne caried awaie by vs from that most aunciente and holie Religion, whiche was grownded vppon the bloude of Ieſus Chriſte, and hathe continewed alwayes one euen vntill our daies, and that they haue benne trained in an other Religion, which is moſte curſed and deteſtable?</hi>

            <p>Then you adde, <hi>Doe you beleeue theſe thinges, as you haue ſpoken them? No trnely doe you not.</hi> Theſe thinges were very merrily ſpoken of you, M.

            <p>

But whereas you ſaie, that I doe not beleeue thoſe thinges whiche I haue ſaied, you are fowly deceiued.

            <p>
               <hi>For in the olde and beſte time of the Church, neither was their any Popedom, neither leaden redemption for ſynne, neither the marte of Purgatorie, neither woorſshippinge of Images, neither run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge vppe and downe to viſite Sainctes, neither offering in the Maſſes for the liue and for the dead, with other like.

to declare, by authoritie of the holie Scriptures, by teſtimonies of the holy Fathers, by fetching the Monumentes and Recordes of al the Antiquitie, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by reaſon, by vſe, by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by a number of examples, that thys kinde of gouernement hath all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies bene in the Churche: and that, who ſo euer goeth about to appaire it, is a breaker of peace, an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrower of Religion, a woorker of ſedition, a puller downe of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, whiche is one, and a fettor vp of diuers and ſundrie churches, diuerſly ſundered and diuided within them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, a bringer in of infinite moſt filthie vices, and trowbleſome errours.</p>
            <p>As for the mart of Purgatorie, which you ſpeake of, we anſwere you, that there is no ſuch thing. If at any time in ſo many hundred yeares ther hath ben any bying and ſelling of holie thinges vſed, the holie Churche alloweth it not, but baniſheth it out of the bounds
<pb facs="tcp:970:251"/>
of the Chriſtian common weale, as a moſt peſtilent and pernicious abuſe.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe of Images, we ſay, that al we, that liue in the holy catholik faith, are able to prooue both by reaſons, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes, and examples, that euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the primitiue church, (eſpecially after it might be done for tyrannes) there hath ben Images ſet vp in churches, to the euerlaſting remembraunce of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to moue men to godlines and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to the glorie and honour of Chriſte, the whiche is ſeene in the wonderfull vertue of holie men. We ſaie moreouer that the errour of thoſe men, that threw downe Images, was condemned by manie authorities of the holy Fathers, by diuers decrees of generall councels: the whiche thing your maiſters, be they neuer ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, can not denie, vnleſſe they wil firſt burne al the writinges of holie fathers, al hiſtories and records, all the decrees of general Councels.</p>

What ſhoulde I here reaſon of the reuerence and honour, which was of old time geauen vnto ſainctes? Could you neuer ſpare a litle time from the fine woorkes of Accurſius, to beſtow in the reading of Gregorie Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zene, Baſile the Greate, Hierome and Ambroſe? If you coulde doe it, you ſhoulde ſee it in their bookes, howe many times godlie perſonnes came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the olde time, what reſortes and aſſemblies there were made, what eloquent Orations were pronounced in the commendation of Sainctes, how greate multitude of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preſſed thither to heare them. But nowe, if I woulde ſhewe you, with what feruente zeale and deuotion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie many men were wont to continue all night at the Tombes of Martyrs, it were a hard matter to expreſſe it.</p>
            <p>None of al the holy Biſhops in thoſe daies, did once put backe the common people from hearing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation
<pb facs="tcp:970:252"/>
of Martyrs: no man diſſwaded them from that moſte earneſt deuotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the Saintes: no, they did rather exhort al ſuch as were preſent, to viſit their Monumentes, to praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, to obſerue and keepe ſuch woorſhippe, as was dew vnto them. For they ſawe in thoſe aſſemblies, when the name of Martyrs was ſette out with heauenlie prayſes, that not the nature of the bodie, but the grace of God, and the almightie power of Chriſte him ſelfe was dewlie honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in them. For if the Chriſtian menne in thoſe daies kept the ſignes of the holie Croſſe, and the Images of Sainctes, whiche were of deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſette vppe in Churches, with ſuch reuerence: if they were oftentimes put in minde by thoſe ſignes to plucke vppe their heartes, and to remember the vertue whiche thoſe domme Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges did repreſente: was it not muche more conuenient, that the liuely Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

Haddon: whether of theſe two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whiche are mainteined both by Luther, think you to be the truer? The later, ſaie you. Well then the former he receiued not of God. Then was he not as yet ſent from God. But after he had diſteined him ſelfe with inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wedlocke, after he had allured his contrei men to rebellion, after he had defied chaſtitie and all holines, after he had ſtirred vp ſuch broile and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the common weale, that he coulde not appeace it him ſelfe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when he had railed againſt the ſtate of the church with moſt reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſhamefull language, when he had vttered moſt horrible and diueliſh blaſphemie, when he had waſted, ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and burned all holie thinges, when he had committed all theſe outrages and villanies: then was he thought a meete man to be taken into gods pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie counſell, and a perſone woorthie, to whome God, beſides all other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:970:254"/>
ſhoulde mercifully reuele that myſterie alſo of the deuiſing of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. Then did this great wiſe man vnderſtand at the length, that S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, which held that we ſhould praie vnto God in our Sacrifices for the dead: that S. Cyprian, which laied this moſt grieuous puniſhment vpon ſuch, as appointed Prieſtes in their teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be tutours or gouernours to their children, that there ſhould no ſacrifice be offred vp for them in the churches: that S. Chryſoſtome, whiche referred this ordinaunce to the tradition of the Apoſtles: that S. Deniſe (to paſſe ouer a numbre of others) which wrote ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligently of the care, that is to be had for the departed in the faith, and of praiers, that are to be made vnto God for their deliueraunce: Luther, I ſaie, vnderſtood, from heauen that al theſe men had ben in great errour and folie.</p>
            <p>Trulie the capitaine of this your faction had a great commoditie of his
<pb facs="tcp:970:255"/>
naughtines and folie, if, after the rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of ſuch broiles and troubles in the worlde, he was deliuered by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of God from that errour, in the which thoſe holie Fathers, moſt God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and wiſe men, excellently wel lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scriptures, linked vnto Chriſte with a moſt ſtreight band of heauenlie loue were quite drowned.</p>
            <p>If no man can thus perſwade him ſelfe, vnleſſe he be peeuiſh, frantike and ſtarke mad, void not only of al godlie religion, but alſo of common ſenſe: who doth not ſee that this opinion of Luther is wicked a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d deteſtable, taught and ſet out by none other, then by the enemie the diuell.</p>
            <p>But this, ſaie you, is not witten in the ſcripture. What then? The thing, which the Apoſtles taught by word of mowth, which their ſchollers deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the poſteritie, whiche hath ben moſt conſtantly holden and beleeued from the primitiue Churche till our
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:970:255"/>
times, whiche hath ben approued by the beleefe and full agreement of the whole Church for ſo manie hnndred yeares, ſhall Luther a ſeditious mad ſelowe, after ſo manie ages gariſhly auowch it to be a feined matter? Shall men, whiche take vpon them to be both Godlie and religious, folow him as a God of heauen, that attempteth moſt deſperatly to aſſault heauen? For he maketh warre againſt heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which taketh vp armour againſt the faith of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No, no,</hi> ſaie you, <hi>you would not thinke, what manner of man he was. For he, I tel you, woulde allowe nothing, vnleſſe he fownde it written in the holie ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi> Well ſir, I will not nowe handle that matter, whiche is by the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſcuſſed long a goe: howe the goſpell conſiſteth not only in thinges written, but alſo in cuſtomes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces receiued without any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, deliuered vnto the Churche by
<pb facs="tcp:970:256"/>

            <p>Then againe when he ſaied, that there was no Purgatorie, by what teſtimonie of the Scripture thought he, that Purgatorie might be vtterly diſprooued? Brought he anie one place, by the whiche he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince that there is no Purgatorie? Dowbtleſſe not one. Such therefore was his preſumption, that, what ſo
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:970:256"/>
euer came into his head, that woulde he conſtantly affirme: and againe, the ſelfe ſame thing, if it miſliked him, would he vtterly denie.</p>
            <p>And yet his diſciples for ſooth find no fault at all, neither with his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, neither yet with his lewd faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions: but what ſo euer the drowſie blowbol draueled out ouer his pottes, that toke they vp ſo griedily, as though it had ben good goſpell.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> But leſt you ſhould ſaie, that it can not be ſhewed by the teſtimonie of the ſcripture, that there is a purgatory, although it be not neceſſarie, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe places, whiche are wont to be alleaged for the proofe thereof, I thinke it good to bring a fewe: of the whiche that is one of S. Marke: where our Lorde, when he had ſaied, that hel (into the which al ſuch ſhalbe throwen downe, as eſteeme more their bodilie pleaſure, then their dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towardes God) ſhoulde haue this
<pb facs="tcp:970:257"/>
propertie, that the worme of them, that ſhall be tombled down headlong into it, ſhould neuer die, and their fyer neuer be quenched: he brought in <note place="margin">Marc. <hi>9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> g</note>foorthwith theſe wordes: for euerie man ſhalbe ſeaſoned in fyer, and euery ſacrifice ſhalbe ſeaſoned in ſalt. In this place there are two thinges to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. One is, that there is a worme, that is to ſaie, a vexation or torment of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience gnawing and moleſting the minde, the whiche ſhal haue an ende: and that there is a torment of fyer alſo, the whiche in like manner ſhall haue and end in ſome men. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our Lorde woulde neuer haue <note place="margin">Eſaie. <hi>66.</hi> a</note>brought that place out of Eſaie: their worme dieth not, and their fyer is not quenched. By the whiche place we are taught, that there is one torment euerlaſting, and an other that laſteth but for a time. For ſo muche there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as this worme and fyer is a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or vexation of minde, and of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:970:257"/>
tormentes there is one, whiche is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the iudgement of God to laſt but a time, and the other to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew for euermore: is it not euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prooued, that there is a purgatorie? (for ſo is the place of puniſhment cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in the whiche by the ſentence of God the ſowles are purged within a certaine time of ſuche ſpottes of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial offences, as they had gathered in this life.)</p>
            <p>An other thing worthy to be noted is this, that no ſynne ſhal eſcape vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. For euen as in the old lawe it was not lawful to offre vp any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice without ſalt, ſo is it not lawful for our ſoules to approch vnto the throne of Gods maieſtie, vnleſſe their vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be before clenſed by ſalt and fyer, that is to ſay, by the rigour of Goddes iudgement, and by dewe puniſhment: that, when al the ſpottes of vncleane affection be put out and quite conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the faithful ſowles may come to
<pb facs="tcp:970:258"/>
haue ſuch a puritie and cleerenes, that thei may be able to receiue the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God in them ſelues, and be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confourmed to the glory of God. For although by the mercy of God ſynne is taken quite away in ſuch as ſtay them ſelues vppon a liuelie ſaith, yet are they for the moſt parte ſo bounde with ſome knot of the law, that they muſt needes ſatisfie the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God. For almightie God is mercifull, but ſo<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that he is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of his iuſtice: he is alſo iuſt, but in ſuche ſorte, that in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of his ſeuere iudgement he ſheweth manie pointes of great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
            <p>Moreouer this puritie or cleannes, which is gotten by the grace and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of Chriſt, hath certaine degrees, ſo, that he that is cleane, may be yet cleaner, and come vnto a cleerer knowledge of the nature of God. And the encreaſe of this cleannes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:970:258"/>
in ſalt and fyer, that is to ſay, in ſuch pouniſhment, as is appointed to pourge the remnantes of ſynne: that the Sacrifice may be purer and holier and more acceptable to God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſarie, that the Sacrifice, whiche is to be offered vppe vnto God with ſuche rites and orders, as are appointed by Chriſte our high Prieſt, be firſt cleanſed, yea and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectely well pourged, by laying on ſome pouniſhment vppon ſynne, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this lyfe, or elles in the lyfe to come. For euen as God, when he pardoned Dauid, quited him not of all <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 12. <hi>d.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:970:259"/>
ſatisfaction or amendes for the offence committed. The which ſatisfaction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not in the weight or eſtimation of it ſelfe, but in the infinite merite of Chriſt. For otherwiſe there ſhould be no end of puniſhment, for ſo muche as the offence was endles: in ſo much as the maieſtie of God was offended, (which is endles.)</p>
            <p>Vnto this penaunce, which is to be abiden of al ſuch, as haue not thorugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pourged the vncleannes of their <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. <hi>d</hi>
               </note>ſinnes in this life by dew labours, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked S.

That there is a moſt certaine hope of ſaluation offered vnto the iuſt, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth not: but that it is geuen, vnleſſe they take great paines and trauaile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he denieth vtterly.</p>
            <p>S. Peter againe in the ſelfe ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, to teach vs, that the entraunce

vnto ſaluation is not ſhut vppe to the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>d</hi>

He ſaith not, that Chriſt going downe to hel declared that ioyfull and glad tydinges to the holy Fathers onely, but alſo to menne which were committed to ward, that is to ſay, to men which were ſhut vp in priſon for offences committed. And left it might be thought, that thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whome Chriſt at that time inſtructed with a more cleere and exacte know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, had ben before vtterly voide of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:970:260"/>
in the daies of Noe made light of the counſel and aduertiſement of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man: the whiche notwithſtanding, (before thei were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed in the flud) were better aduiſed, and gat pardon of their ſynnes and offences: but yet ſo, that for their long offence, they ſuffred in hell a long penaunce. Out of the which place it is gathered by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie of S.

it is euidently prooued, that many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo haue offred vp moſt holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for the dead, that is to ſay, for the ſaluation of the deade.

            <p>Of lyke, Sir, all theſe thinges, whiche you miſlike, and call the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtie of Religion, were deuiſed and brought in, by brothels and baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, or elles by ſuche felowes, as ſerue the bellie, luſte, or vnſtedfaſtneſſe of the people for their commodities ſake, and not by the ſpirite of Chriſte, and by moſt continent and holy menne, in whome was the ſpirite of Chriſte. But you are neuer able to prooue that you ſay. For both reaſon and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of all antiquitie, as alſo the authoritie of holy Fathers doe vrge and preſſe you, yea and conuince you of impudencie: but wee haue putte backe the violent puſſhe of this your vngodlyneſſe and malice, with argumentes moſt ſure, with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies moſt graue, with examples moſt true.</p>

Whereas you ſay, that I ſpeake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe then I thinke, to ſerue the eares of my compagnions, I ſee well, you are wel acqueinted with my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour.

            <p>For what is the Popedome els, but a miniſtration of an authoritie, which is lawefull and ordeyned by God? What is our beleefe of Purgatorie,

What are the praiers made in our Sacrifice for the liuing and the dead, but a work of moſte perfecte holineſſe, of moſte excellent Religion, of moſte ſeruent charitie?</p>
            <p>Theſe be diſhoneſt points, which you haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a way. There is good cauſe, why you ſhould glorie in it, and haue your name recorded with honor to al the poſterity. for you haue brought in, for obeying of holy and lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, rebellion: for the feare of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, a raſh a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:970:265"/>
of the moſt holie ſacrifice, and charitable behauiour of men, a deſpiſing of religion and forgetting of charitie: yea moreouer and this, you haue brought in a ſcornfull laughter exceding al modeſtie, together with a ſawcie talke paſsing all ciuilitie. Are theſe thinges comelie, M. Haddon? Are theſe thinges honourable? Are theſe thinges to be commended? Are theſe thinges to mabe a ſhewe of?</p>
            <p>But you ſaie, that the Biſhoppes of Rome keepe warres, that in Rome is kept a market of purgatorie, that holie thinges are there ſet out to ſale, that manie men are to muche incombred with ſuperſtition in the woorſhipping of Sainctes, that Prieſtes liue not very continently, and that they abuſe their ſacrifices now and then to their luker and gaine.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all as towching warres you muſt thinke, that we can not of reaſon and equitie condemne all warres. For
<pb facs="tcp:970:266"/>
they are ſome times begonne for the defence of Religion, and maintenance of a iuſt cauſe.</p>
            <p>As for the buying and ſelling of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinges, if in ſo manie hundred yeares ſome ſuche matter haue ben vſed, it is no wonder. For (as you ſaie your ſelfe) it can not be choſen, but that ſometimes in the good corne there will growe ſome weedes. And if anie ſuch abuſe haue ben, it is now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken quite awaie.</p>
            <p>If ſuperſtition trouble mens mindes now and then, it is verie eaſily taken awaie by the labour and diligence of Biſhops. The vicious and vncleane life of Prieſtes is verie ſeuerely puniſhed. And there are at this time emongeſt vs a great manie moe of them, that liue verie continently, then of ſuch, as will diſteine them ſelues with vicious and vncleane liuing.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, to paſſe ouer all other, the vertuous, godlie, and religiouſe

example of this moſt holie Pope Pius the fifth, (whome neither ambition, neither coueteouſnes, neither the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the people, neither yet the raſhnes of men, but the holie Ghoſte hath placed in this roome of highe honour and dignitie) bringeth to paſſe, that all thinges waxe better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euerie daie, and that verie manie are ſtirred to the loue of true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
            <p>But admitte there were no ſuche matter at this time, as I talke of: admit that al went to naught, and that there were no man to refourme the church where it is decaied: ſhould it be well done by and by to euerthrow all ſuch thinges, as haue ben wiſely ordeined, ſo ſoone as men doe abuſe them to naughtines? No truly: but rather to prouide, as neere as we maie, that holy thinges maie no more be abuſed. For otherwiſe all would decaie, and there wold folow a meruelous diſorder and
<pb facs="tcp:970:267"/>
confuſion of thinges in the Churche.</p>
            <p>If you, as you haue for the miſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of a fewe monkes (as you ſaie) taken quite awaie the whole order, and for the lewdnes of certain Priſtes ouerthrowen the dignitie of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and authoritie of Biſhopps: ſo you woulde procede, (for it ſtandeth with as good reaſon as the other doth) and for the default of a Magiſtrate, or Prince, or King, which hath not done his dewtie, take awaie the orderly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the common weale, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Kinglie honour and authoritie: the worlde ſhoulde come againe to that confuſion, which (as the Poetes report) was, before that nature was diſpoſed and ſet in comelie order. For what thing is ſo holie, the whiche men maie not abuſe ſometimes to doe much harme and miſchiefe? For, that we maie goe no further, wedlocke it ſelfe, (which you preferre before per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall virginitie) is it alwaies kept in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:970:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuch chaſte, godly, and religious order, as it ought to be? Doe the houſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des neuer looke beſides their wiues? Doe the wiues neuer beguyle their houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes? Are there no aduowtries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nowe and then emong? Yeas queſtionles are there: and manie fowle and ſhameful actes are done of maried men oftentimes, with great raſhnes and impudencie. Shall we therfore, for the lewd demeanour of ſome maried perſones, breake the band of man and wife, and take awaie the holie ſtate of lawfull wedlocke? No truly. For then woulde men and women runne vnto it without order, and there woulde be no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene them and brute beaſtes. Wherfore although all our doinges were voide of al good order, honeſtie, and religion: yet are not ſuch thinges, as haue ben for a moſt godlie pourpoſe deuiſed and ordeined, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be diſannulled, but rather or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der woulde be taken, that thinges,
<pb facs="tcp:970:268"/>
which are amiſſe, might be amended. Neither are ſuche thinges, as maie be cured, to be cut of: neither yet, if the feſtered and corrupt partes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt needes be pared of, is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for that to deſtroie the whole bodie, whiche maie be recouered: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the ſtate of a common weale to be altered, ſo ſoone as anie diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der happeneth in it, but rather reaſon woulde, that al ſuch matters, as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied, ſhould be brought again to that comelie order, in the whiche they were at the begynning.</p>
            <p>Ariſtotel telleth, that there was a certaine man called Hippodamus of Mileſium, which wrote of a common weale. Emongeſt other matters he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth a lawe of his, by the which he decreed, that a great rewarde ſhoulde be geauen out of the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to him, that coulde deuiſe anie lawe profitable for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale. This decree Ariſtotel miſliketh. For he
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:970:268"/>
thinketh, that there woulde be an end in making of lawes, bicauſe the often <note place="margin">Often chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of lavves daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note>chaunging of them is wont by litle and litle to bring them into contempt: and the lawes being once deſpiſed, the good eſtate of a common weale can not long continewe. Wherefore that excellent learned man counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth al ſuch, as make lawes, to foreſee, that there be not more euyll in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten altering of the lawes, then there is in that diſorder, which they goe about to refourme by the new lawe. For he thinketh it more ſafetie to keepe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good lawes, then to make others not muche better. Wherein he hath good reaſon. For whie, that conſtant and perpetuall reuerence towardes the lawes cauſeth a certaine feare and baſhfulnes, and linketh men together within them ſelues with a ſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable band of equitie. But this fond appetite that men haue to alter and chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the law (without fom weighty
<pb facs="tcp:970:269"/>
cawſe) engendreth a preſumpteouſe boldnes, and maketh a waie by ſubtile and wilie meanes to take the lawe quite awaie, and to bring in tyrannie. And although there came none other inconuenience of it, yet at the leaſt it diſordereth the common weale.</p>
            <p>Nowe this, whiche is to be feared about the innouation of lawes, is to be determined about religion ſo muche the more conſtantly, the greater the perill is to offend in religion, then in anie other thing. This thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered the fownders of common weales of olde time, puniſhed ſuch, as brought in anie new tricke of religion out of other places, with death or baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and decreed, that the rites or faſhions of the countrey ſhoulde be moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reteined. Wherin, although they had ſhaped them ſelues a religion after a very bad ſort, and liued in great errours, yet was this their ordinaunce not altogether voide of good reaſon
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:970:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and conſideration. For if it were poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſome one religion might be more commendable then ſome other, he, that ſhould take awaie an old reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whiche were not vngodly, to ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p an other religion, that were but a litle better, ſhould do a ſhrewd tourne to the common weale.</p>
            <p>Whie ſo, ſaie you? Bicauſe he ſhould bring in a cuſtome to alter Religion, and, by conſequent, to bring Religion into contempt. And ſo it might come to paſſe, that diuers and ſundrie reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions coming in one after an other, being either deuiſed by craftie wittes, or els taken out of other countreis, might moue great debate about the eſtabliſhing of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and while euery religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould diſprooue one an other, the matter might by litle and litle ſo fall out at the length, that all religion hould come to naught.</p>
            <p>The which thing being true, (that we maie retourne to our diſputation
<pb facs="tcp:970:270"/>
againe) how is this to be taken, that a religion, which, is moſt true, holy, and auncient, approoued and confirmed by the teſtimony of God, by the bloud of Chriſte, by the faith of holie men, ſhoulde be diſcredited by reaſon of a new goſpel deuiſed bi the wit of a ſort of filthy varlets? Is it not a conſequent (as we now ſee it fal out euery where) that there ariſe a nomber of religions of diuerſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ortes, all vngodlye and naught, yea and iarring within them ſelues? That they ariſe one againſt an other? That euerie one of them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the folie of others? That neuer a one of them being able to mainteine it ſelfe by grownded reaſon, and ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g argument, they come all at the length to be deſpiſed and ſet at naught?</p>
            <p>By theſe ſteppes or degrees are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come to that point at the length, that manie a one raiſeth vp the damned ſprites of Arius, Sabellius, and other moſt deteſtable heretikes from holl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

againſt all right and reaſon, againſt the inuiolable reuerence of moſt pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, againſt the ordinaunces of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God: you haue taken awaye the moſt holy dignity of the high biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprike from the lawful biſhops, and haue tranſpoſed it to be adminiſtred by a woman. The which, I ſay, was a moſt wicked deede, a moſt barbarouſe acte, a moſt deteſtable and curſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Whereby it may be gathered, that mans heart can imagine no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe ſo horrible and diuelliſh, that theſe flatterers wil not take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them to practiſe it, with deſperate boldneſſe and impudencie.</p>
            <p>Here do I paſſe ouer many thinges, and vnto the railing words, which you heape together againſt me, I anſwere you nothing, for in deede I regard them not. Neither is it my meaning to confute your railing wordes, but to take vppon me the defence of moſte holy Religion, for the which it were

a goodly matter for me to die. Al other thinges therefore I let paſſe, that I may come to that place, in the which you drawe bloud of your owne body, yea and geaue your ſelfe a deadly wound with your owne handes. Your wordes are theſe.</p>

which, of a mad and vngodly minde, haue not ben aſhamed to impute the cauſe of al ſynne and wickedneſſe to God that moſt perfecte goodnes, from whome no euil can proceede: which, (whereas they tooke vppon them to ſcoure or purge the goſpel throughly, and to repaire the Churche agayne, which tendeth to ruine) haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not perfourmed ſo muche, as they prowdly and raſhly promiſed to doe, but haue moreouer beraied the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che (the vncleanes whereof religious menne could not beare before) with much filthineſſe of vice and naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and haue brought it to be rent and riuen in peaces.</p>

            <p>Laſt of al, are you wel aſcerteined, what alteration one day, or rather one hower, may bring vnto your ſtate? Wherefore are you then ſo bragge? Wherefore do you vaunt your ſelfe ſo farre beyonde all modeſtie, as though you were free and paſt al daunger, yea

If I haue donne any good, it will appeare at the lengthe. If I haue donne none, yet the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my good heart towardes her, can not be but wel taken of her, if ſhee wil continue in her accuſtomed cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and gentlenes.</p>
            <p>You ſaie, I ſhall not bring her to be of myne opinion, no, althoughe I ſhould write ſixe hundred millions of Philippicall Orations.
