            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruly Honorable, whose
Father is God, and
whose Inheritance a
Kingdome; the diuers sparks of
holy fire, which haue issued from
the Spirit that baptizeth with
fire, I haue gathered together;
by their vnited heate, to kindle
a flame where is none, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
it, where it is alreadie
kindled. This blessing must
come from God, and therefore
of God haue I desired it. And
<pb facs="tcp:91:3"/>
surely the best, as ye well know,
haue turnes of winter, euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their hottest zeale, and then
woe to him that is alone, for how
should he haue heate? Therfore
if in the time of cooling, some
spirituall worke be ioyned to the
heart, it may bee warmth will
grow betweene them. So haue
I often from <hi>Elisha</hi> applied,
euen some Prophet of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
life; and I wish, that
some quickning may proceede
also from this worke; which in
all writings is more or lesse, as
the Spirit therein more or lesse
speaketh.</p>
            <p>These Meditations are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
diuers in their matter,
being diuersly borne, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of time and occasion; yet
tend they to one ende, and this
profit often comes from variety,
<pb facs="tcp:91:3"/>
that some one thing among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
fitteth euery one, and giues
an answere to the particular
question of his heart. The glorie
of God by your benefite, is that
which I seeke, desiring also to be
holpen by you, both in prayer
and exhortation. As for an idle
name, made vp still, of perishing,
and often of corrupt breaths, I
leaue it to them for an end, to
whom God is not an end suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
But let our chiefe ioy and
glory be to glorifie God, and by
being written in heauen, to bee
admitted vnto the beholding of
his glory. To that mark, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
let vs steadily aime, and
sending our hearts before vnto
Christ, let vs goe on lustily
to ouertake them. Let vs
draw hard vp the hill toward
heauen: and though the flesh
<pb facs="tcp:91:4"/>
presse downe, the world and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
draw backe; yet strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Spirit, incouraged by
the word, and fortified with the
mutuall and vnited force of
mightie loue, let vs carry the
Arke of God, euen the soule
(wherein Gods Image dwells,
and his will is written) from the
Countrey of the Philistims, to
the Land of promise. And
though heere our fleshly bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Ismael</hi> and his heires,
mocke and despise vs, though
<hi>Esau</hi> with his foure hundred
men looke big vpon vs: yet are
we sure that their time is short,
and but for life; whereas wee
haue an inheritance eternally
glorious. Thither the sonnes of
the flesh, though with long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrees,
and large treasures, can
neuer enter; but sitting without,
<pb facs="tcp:91:4"/>
where is weeping and gnashing
of teeth, they shallsee despised
holinesse, triumph vpon magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
and powerfull wickednes.
God our strength, whose cloud
and pillar guided Israel to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
guide vs to the heauenly
Ierusalem, by the grace of his
Spirit. This I humbly desire
through Christ his first borne,
the purchaser of our inheritance
and doore of all the mercy
that issueth from God
vnto man.</p>

            <p>THe maine Faultinesse
of these Times, is a
Disproportion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Knowledge
and Action; or rather a
meere resting in knowledge
short of Action. So are we
come from no knowledge,
to knowledge alone, which
will not lessen, but increase
our iudgement; and from
the ouerualuing of workes,
to the Neglect of them.
Surely the errour of workes
without knowledge, is lesse
dangerous then the error of
knowledge without works:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:91:6"/>
But this is the best of it, it is
the doctrine of our Nature,
not of our Diuinitie. For
while it is taught, that
workes deserue not, some
are content to thinke they
are vselesse; others being
truly perswaded of their vse,
yet slouthfull to goodnesse,
lie down in knowledge, and
will not goe on to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of action. But as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
the paine will follow
the fault, so now let the
shame: for certainly it is a
great shame, that so much
knowledge should be idle,
and that skilful men should
sleepe in this Midday light;
for the light was made for
walking and working, not
for idlenesse. The Father
sheweth his will, because he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:91:6"/>
will haue it done; wee are
called to be sonnes, because
we should do the will of our
Father: and <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
giues the greatest title,
when hee calls the three
children the seruants of the
most high God. In the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
wherein is Life, is also
Actiuenesse: If we nourish
not the actiuitie of it, we
decay the Life, &amp; so kill our
selues with eternall Death.
Christ hath no dead or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
Limbes, they all
beare fruite, or are not his;
and Faith which our slouth
would magnifie, by resting
in her, thrusts vs on for her
life to action; for shee liues
onely when she is actiue. If
then faith not working, bee
dead, and dead faith quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:91:7"/>
not; the vnactiue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer
may speedily with a
Heathen see himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
life. As these things may
driue vs, so the value of
workes may draw vs: for by
Christ who worketh them
in vs, they are accepted of
God, and haue a valuation
stamped vpon them, by his
Grace for Grace. And first,
though workes iustifie not
vs, they iustifie our Faith,
&amp; in the day of iustice they
shall goe so farre toward iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
vs, that they shall
declare vs iust. In the meane
time, they please and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
God, the giuer of such
gifts vnto men, and then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the least of them shall
haue a reward of glory,
which they shall set as a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:91:7"/>
crowne on their heads that
wrought them. Let vs not
therefore bee wanting to
this glorie belonging to
God from vs, and issuing
from God to vs. Besides, if
we will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what works
are in themselues, we shall
finde that they are streames
of the Deity, their fountain,
and sparkes of that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and eternall fire. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
they present and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
something that is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
and supernaturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;
whence it was that a
Reuerend Ancient wel said:
The deedes and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Primitiue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
had in them a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
and sweetnesse, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
those with whome
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:91:8"/>
they conuersed. And how
can it otherwise be, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he that is blessednesse, and
excellence, powreth vertue
from himselfe into these
workes; they must needs
haue a resemblance &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of their original. And
surely there are two things
in them, which as they are
the most pleasant of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
so they most resemble,
and approach to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
One of these is Light,
and the other is Loue; both
which put life and soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euery good worke. God
is Light, and God is Loue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and it is a pleasant thing to
behold the Light; and Loue
is as the precious oyntment
which was powred on the
head of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Wherefore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:91:8"/>
good workes beeing a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
&amp; heauenly off-spring,
let them bee highly respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and carefully cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by vs. Againe, workes are
to vs strong euidences of the
Spirit of Life, and therefore
as sure as wee would be of
our saluation, so carefull let
vs be of good works: shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
it were for them who
are so scrupulous and eagre
for security co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
things, not to bee
more eagre for the ensuing
of their Election. Lastly,
they are excellent in regard
of the benefite they doe to
mankinde, which also is
manifold. They doe good
by the worke wrought, and
so they are as the dewe of
Heauen, which refresheth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:91:9"/>
and nourisheth the drie and
thirstie land. Surely to a
good Christian there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more pleasant then to
do good. For as he especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delighteth therein, to
please his Maker, so he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
reioyceth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to profit his neighbour.
They doe good also by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
for they come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men as patternes; their
sound goes forth and tels
mankinde what should bee
done, what may be done;
and so they palpably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
men to be followers
of them, that are followers
of Christ. Againe, workes
doe good vnto men, while
they are mooued by them,
to lift vp their hearts and
eyes vnto the heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:91:9"/>
to glorifie him that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
such gifts to earthen
and corrupted vessels. And
whensoeuer God is glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by man, man that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
him shall be blessed of
God; whensoeuer glorie is
giuen to God on high, peace
and good will shall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on Men below. If
these things will not yet
mooue vs, at least, let vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
the taking away of our
candlesticke &amp; the remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of it, to a nation that
will bring forth more fruite.
Let vs preuent the scandall
and shame, which we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
to our selues from the
enemies of our Religion.
Let vs preuent the vpbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saida,</hi>
Finally let vs preuent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:91:10"/>
that fearefull sentence: <hi>I
know ye not, depart from me all
ye workers of iniquitie.</hi> This
shall we doe, if wee becom
right Christians in whome
faith worketh by loue: For
the soule that is rooted in
Christ, hath from this root,
the life of Loue, Diuine, and
Humane, which expresseth
it selfe outwardly in the
fruite of good actions.</p>

            <p>It is a great vnhappinesse
to many, that they mistake
good nature for grace: For
so doing they set vp their
rest in it, thinking they are
gone farre enough towards
God, because they wish all
well, &amp; no hurt to any. But
it must bee knowne that
good nature at the best is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:91:10"/>
not grace, yea it is full of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
that fight against
Grace. For though it bee
somewhat apt and appliable
to the second Table, yet it
is euer far short of the first,
not hauing in it that true
knowledge &amp; loue of God,
nor that inward purenesse
which therein is required.
So the obseruing of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Table, is faulty, for
want of the first; for if a
man do neuer so many see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
good workes, if they
proceede not from a heart
truely sanctified by God,
they are glittering sinnes is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing

worshipping him as god, yea
it is peruerted from God, &amp;

know whether there bee in
vs something more then
Nature, and by which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self may be rectified
and directed to the true

God. If there be in vs this

let vs water it, let vs cherish
it, as the life of our life; if it
be not in vs, let vs violently

be an opening to our knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
a giuing to our ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and vntill they that

if in a lazy contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
we lie along vpon the

the strength which must do

and how canst thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

That which is ours, is onely

And that we may be

            <p>The nature of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
subiect to passions, is
very apt to amend one vice

from one extremity, iust as

and spirituall powers are
two, that may and would
well liue together, in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

But in the first times after

mightily destroyed, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished
the spiritual, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

as partriches on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.
After this the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
hauing gotten power
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:91:16"/>
enough at least to right

the limits of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralty,

the very sword and

it was mightily purged, and
now it concernes the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whose turne is next to
be faulty, to looke to it self,
that it continue not these
circular euils. Likewise the
Papists digged downe the
foundation, to build vp
the walles, they tooke from
Christ to magnifie workes.
Now let vs take heede that
we make not all foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so indeede make no

not a foundation to them
that build not vpon him.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:91:17"/>
The Popish Cleargie coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their people with

bee it from vs, so to hate
blindnesse, that we doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Light on earth is a guide to
light in heauen, but it is no
guide to them that doe not
follow it; yea to such in the

darknes should bring forth
more workes then light,
yet <hi>Hagar</hi> may not boast

Secondly, nature spreads o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

            <p>When a Christian hath
committed some notable
sinne, there presently open
before him two dangerous
gulfs ready to swallow him;
one of them is Despaire, the
other, Presumption. Hee is
tempted to beleeue, that he
cannot be forgiuen, or that
he is very easily forgiuen;
and so Gods mercy is too
much assumed or refused.
But against presumption,
should bee set as a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyse,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:91:18"/>
the Maiestie and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the great God that
is offended, the foulenesse
and deformitie of sinne in
the sight of that God, the
breach of the Couenant
made with God, both at
the outward, and inward
Baptisme; the grieuing of
the Spirit, with which wee
are sealed vnto redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and finally, the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
punishments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God chastiseth his
transgressing seruants, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
not iudging, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
or chastising them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Surely God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
in Maiesty, the heauen
of heauens cannot containe
him, the Angels cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
behold him, the Sun and
Starres are not pure in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:91:19"/>
of him. The same
God, is a iust &amp; iealous God,
visiting sin and iniquity: for
sin is more lothsome in his
sight, then the most abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
filthinesse, or foulest
soares, are in the eies of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
As for thy Couenant, thou
hast mightily broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: thou
gauest thy selfe to God in
generall, and now thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
thy selfe from him in
particulars: thou madest an
agreement with him to bee
his seruant, if he would bee
thy God; he is become thy
God, and thou failest in thy
promised seruice. Besides,
thou grieuest the Spirit,
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts thee: thou art
a great vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him, who
is thy chiefe consolation:
thou frettest that which is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:91:19"/>
thy life eternall, and goest
about to quench him, who
would quicken thee vnto
glorie euerlasting. Lastly,
that the punishments of sin
may come within thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
remember <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
for whose adultery and
murder, his child of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
died; his wiues were
polluted with incest, and
himselfe by his owne bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
was driuen from his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
into the fields of the
wildernes. Remember <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
for the lifting vp of
whose heart, the Treasures
must be carried into Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.
Remember the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
of whom many were
sicke and many slept, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had sinned, and
slept in their sinnes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:91:20"/>
make hast, run to God
right early, acknowledge
thy sinne against thy selfe,
and humble thy selfe vnder
the mightie hand of God,
that in due time he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
thee. That is the onely
right exaltation which is
done by God, and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thy selfe is the onely
way to it: but an exaltation
of thy selfe without God,
will turne to an humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by God, if not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
But if thou wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
away the pleasure of
sin, by the sorrow of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
if thou washest away
the pollution and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of sinne, by cleannesse
of heart, and rightnesse of
Spirit, then mayst thou lay
hold on the satisfaction of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:91:20"/>
Christ to wash away the
guilt of thy sin, and so thou
art wholly made cleane. As
God will not haue his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to bee made an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to sinne, so hee
will not haue his iustice to
bee a discouragement to
them that turne from their
sinnes: but iustice belongs
to the presumptuous to
humble them, and mercy
to the humble and broken
hearted to refresh them.
Come therefore thou that
art heauy laden, which fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
thy sinnes as a burden
intolerable, take the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which belongeth to
thee; and looke not on the
terror of iustice any longer,
which belongeth to the
presumptuous, and not to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:91:21"/>
thee. God will not that the
reed brused by the Law,
should bee vtterly broken,
but that it be healed by the
Gospell. Gods aime in thy
humbling is not despaire,
but Faith, Hope and Loue;
his end is thy amendment,
and not thy torment. But if
thou doubtest that so great
a sinne hath cut thee off
from Christ, and therefore
thou darest not to make
vse of his merits, know this,
that by thy faith, which
made a generall surrender
of thee vnto Christ, thou
wast ingrafted into Christ;
Christ was thine, and thou
wert his. Now this Vnion
is indissoluble, nothing can
put asunder what God
hath thus put together. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:91:21"/>
Christ in his Vnion
with thee, did not wholly
take away thy wilde nature,
but powring in a godly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
left also some remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of thy former wildnes.
If then this wilde nature
bring forth the fruit of the
wilde oliue, it is no wonder;
for it is so left, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
when God hideth his
face, it may leade vs away
captiue vnto the execution
of sinne. Yet the Spirit of
Christ euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liueth in vs,
though in bondage, for the
time; and grace is then not
put to death, but only made
prisoner. The seed of Christ
remaines immortal, he is stil
in thee, though sometimes
thou bearest thy own fruite
and not his. A generall
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:91:22"/>
dominion of sinne, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a generall dominion
of Christ: but a particular
sinne may yet leaue a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
dominion to Christ.
Thou mislikest thy selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou art not holy in
all things: thou dost well to
loue and desire perfection;
yet though thou offendest
in some thing, doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire,
for God hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
any man in this life so
much grace, as may giue
him a generall rest from sin;
he leaueth this world as a
place of battaile and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and referreth perfect
rest vnto the world to
come. Now the same God,
though in iustice hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a full obedience, yet
in mercy he accepteth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:91:22"/>
to that wee haue;
&amp; hee knowes we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but what wee haue
receiued, and we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
only so much grace,
as may exclude the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of sinne, but not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the being of it. Let vs
therfore not so much busie
our selues in superfluous
and vnprofitable vexation
of our own soules, as in the
study of purging our selues
from our sins, that wee may
bring forth more fruit. This
is it which God especially
lookes for after sin, and so
doing we shall vndeniably
proue to our selues, that we
are still the liuely branches
of Christ. A mans seruant
doth sometimes his owne
worke, yet if he presently
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:91:23"/>
returne to the worke of his
Master, and makes that his
chiefe and maine employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he ceaseth not to bee
his seruant, since most hee
serueth him. So and much
more is it betweene Christ
and vs; We are his, though
somtimes seruing our selues
especially being held by
him, out of whose hand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can take vs. Therfore
thou distressed soule, goe
thy waies, and indeuour to

thy faith shall make thee

Let vs pursue truth as

            <p>There is a great craft of
Satan, which passeth too
much vnmarked, or vnresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
and this it is; That he
seekes by all meanes to
keepe his owne kingdome
whole and vndeuided, and
to diuide by schismes and
contentions, the kingdome
and body of Christ; that by
the malice of such conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:91:31"/>
the flocke of Christ
may bite one another, and
consequently deuoure one
another, and so doe Satans
busines for him. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
Christians to note
this his cunning, and with
detestation to beware, that
they be not Satans in stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
nor become those
mad members which fight
and strike one at another,
and seek to teare that asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which God hath vnse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
ioyned together.
And lamentable indeed is
this madnesse and folly: for
the main busines of Christ,
effected by a bloudy death,
and bitter passion, is, to set
in vnitie and peace, the
things in heauen and earth.
Besides, he hath left as a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:91:31"/>
to his Church, the
preseruation and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the vnitie which
himselfe began; As I haue
loued you, so loue yee one
another. Againe, Christ
hath prayed to his Father,
that we may be one, as hee
and his Father is one. Now
cursed is hee that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to breake this three-fold
cord, and endeuours
to frustrate the death of
Christ, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement
of Christ, and the prayer of
Christ. But thou wilt say, I
diuide my selfe from him,
and oppose my selfe against
him, because he opposeth
himselfe against Christ in
some vncurable errour. But
take thou heed that this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
separate him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:91:32"/>
and remooue the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
else thou canst not hate
him. For when men agree
in the sauing foundation,
they become one body and
one building, vnited vpon
that foundation, and vnto
it. Now when men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
Christ, in whom
is the Trinitie vnited to
man, to be happinesse, and
the onely meanes of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
euen the Doore, the

this Christ wholly resigne
and surrender themselues,
to be iustified, to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by him; these haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
into themselues, the
roote of Life; they are one
with Christ, and one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselues. But that

somthing lesse in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

hate and reuile one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
should shunne mutuall
conuersation, should prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
and persecute one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
with enuenomed
tongues, is most vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and lamentable. Is not
the solide vnion betweene
them a more cause of loue,
then the slight difference a
cause of hate? Nay, will
Christ allow, that there is
any cause sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to make
his members hate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:91:33"/>
whom he hath tied in
the bond of peace, by such
mighty knots? Especially
right lothsome is it to him,
to haue his name vsed for a
pretence of such hatred,
which aboue all names, is
the name of loue and peace.
Surely Christ knowes, that
when men in this kind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to serue Christ, they
indeede serue Satan. Hee
knowes that vnitie is the
preseruation of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and diuision, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of all kingdomes.
Therfore if thou wilt please
Christ, preserue his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
by preseruing vnity;
it pleaseth not the head, to
haue his member, brused,
bitten, or hurt. He allowes
not the member of greater
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:91:33"/>
knowledge, to bee proud
ouer a member of lesse
knowledge, much lesse to
make their difference of
knowledge, a ground of
hatred. He himselfe forgiues
this ignorance and errour,
for which thou hatest thy
brother, and offers vp his
bloud to the Father that he
may be forgiuen. Yea hee
loueth this brother not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his error, and
what art thou then to hate
one whom Christ loueth?
Euen thy selfe also (though
perchance thou thinke it
not) art by Christ, borne
with, and forgiuen for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
errours and ignorances;
for of thee and vs stil, Christ
knowes this to be true, that
yet wee know but in part.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:91:34"/>
Therefore thou that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest
to please thy Head,
bee truly conformable to
him, and thou shalt indeed
please him. Loue where he
loues, and beare with him
with whom he beareth. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
that new commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his, That yee loue
one another. Expresse this
loue in instructing thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if he be ignorant; and
hate him not, though he be
so weake, that hee cannot
receiue thy instruction. He
is yet grounded on Christ,
hee is yet a liuing member
of Christ, he is still a souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
for Christ; therefore still
ioyne with him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him in the battels of
the Lord. Take heed thou
quench not that which
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:91:34"/>
smoketh, nor beate downe
the weake hands, which
should be lifted vp against
Satan, and that thou dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

God; and ouercomming,
may be admitted to eate of

and to reigne with Christ

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:91:39"/>
glory from it selfe, vnto
God. Therefore according
to Gods speech of <hi>Gideons</hi>
armie; They are too many
for me, to ouercome <hi>Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
by them, wee may say
of these iolly men: They
are too good for God to
worke his glory by them:
yet humility acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all sufficiency to bee
from God, and to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without him, might
take them downe, and so
make them fit for God. But
as for the finding of God in
Christ without his owne
light, surely they may as
well finde the Sunne in the
night, and the secrets of the
spirit of man, when the
man himselfe is silent. God
must shine, if hee will bee
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:91:40"/>
seene; he must both tell his
secrets, and giue an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to conceiue them,
if man shall receiue them.
As no man can see God &amp;
liue, so no naturall man can
see Christ who is God, as
long as he liues a meere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
man. He must dy; and
especially to his owne wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and his very sight,
which hee magnifies, for
clearnes, must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for blindnesse, and
be brought to be cured by
the lightsome Spirit of
Christ, which then will
shew him from whome it
selfe proceeded.</p>

            <p>The Scripture hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:91:41"/>
&amp; selfe-vpholding
in it selfe, because it is the
word of God; and this it
hath, and is, whether men
receiue it or not. Truth is
as much truth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not
acknowledged, as when it
is. But the true manner of
receiuing it is this. At first
the Church inlightned by
Gods Spirit, saw &amp; beheld
in it the truth of God, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
it, and commended it
to all to be beleeued. Now
the learners of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
receiue it first on this
commendation of the
Church, before by it they
receiue the Spirit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
it; As children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
rules giuen by their
Masters vpon trust, before
that by the rules, they come
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:91:42"/>
to the knowledge that they
are right rules. But after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
beene inlightned by
the Spirit, they receiue it
then, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as the first Church
did. And thus proceeding
they come at last to iudge
the Church it selfe, by that
word, which before they
receiued from the Church.
So while I am a naturall
man, I receiue the word of
men; but when I become a
spirituall man, which discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all things, I then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
it to be the word by
the Spirit. And the beleefe
which comes from this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
discerning, is truly
and onely faith, the former
is only credence and trust;
the one hath the very
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:91:42"/>
word for the obiect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the other, the persons of
men. Now miserable is the
estate of that Church that
hedgeth in men within that
trust, and neuer doth suffer
them, or at least incourage
them to proceede to faith.
Where it is taught that it is
sufficient to beleeue the
Church, there mans minde
is perswaded to rest in that
beleefe, and careth not to
beleeue the word for it
selfe. Such a perswasion
fastneth the eye on men,
and turneth it from the
word of light which giueth
light to the simple, and
might, and would be seene
it selfe. Indeede it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
couer for a bad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
for it keepes men
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:91:43"/>
within the pale of securitie
since they must aske their
teachers only whether their
teachers bee deceiued. By
the same rule may the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran
also be established, or
any the most pestilent He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie,
if men must bee boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by their teachers, and
not looke beyond their
teaching. But farre more
blessed are they, if they be
also blessed with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
who may looke Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
truth in the face, and
loue it for the beauty
which themselues behold
in it. And as men haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
hereby, so hath God
his glory, who scorneth that
his word should haue men
to giue their word for it. It
is a word that standeth by
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:91:43"/>
it selfe, it approoueth it selfe.
And lest men should say,
that the former trust helpes
the weakenesse of men, and
not of the word; they shold
know, that God hath taken
course himselfe, that man
should not still continue in
such a weaknesse, that still
might neede such helpe.
For as he giues the word to
shine from without, so hee
giues his Spirit to shine
within, that the light of the
Spirit might apprehend the
light of the word. Let vs
not therefore forsake this
inuincible rocke of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religion, euen a self-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing,
and selfe-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
authority of the word.
For as hreby it is strong in it

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:91:44"/>
it selfe vnmoueable, against
all exception, so herein it
excelleth all errors and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,

            <p>There are in man natu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally,
three knowledges of

which is true, as farre as
reason guides it. Another
of instinct, imprinted into
the nature of man at his
creation; such a knowledge
thinks it good to loue our

Rom. 1. but in this some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is excesse, sometimes
defect; and therfore it must
be aduanced or lessened, as
the measure of reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
A third is of lust,
and somtimes called by vs

things good or euill, out of

for any reason or iust cause.
So some loue killing, and

            <p>The things of the next

these heere: for the same
word that said, Let these be,
and they were; saith also,
There are such incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
things prepared
for them that loue God.
They are as certainely
known by faith, as these by
sight; as truly, though not
so largely. For <hi>Moses</hi> saw
them certainely; else per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
for them would he
not haue forsaken the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
pleasures of sin. And
the Word saith, that his
faith truly saw God; and no
one true thing, is more true,
then another. Againe, the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:91:45"/>
things inuisible, are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
better then the visible:
for holy men haue euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
the present for those
to come. The hart can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
temporall things, but
not eternal; and that which
is of God, is infinitely infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to God himselfe. But
what is the reason then that
we chuse them not, being
certainly knowne, and farre
better? The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our station is natural,
elementarie and grosse, and
likenesse makes loue onely
to like. Therefore also the
things aboue being super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
and pure, must haue
a minde of like temper to
loue them. There must be
a new station, a second
worke, euen stinting and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:91:46"/>
crossing nature. Yea, wee
must haue a minde lifted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
nature, to loue things
aboue nature, wee must bee
raised aboue flesh into an
heauenly knowledge, to see
heauenly truth, not sinking
with beasts into the low re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of seeing, touching,
and tasting. Thus lifted vp
and made spirituall, we shal
discerne and approue spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
things, as the naturall
man doth the obiects of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Therefore let vs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
God, the Father of
this better nature, that hee
will distill into vs some
drops of that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly dew,
which may giue vs heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mindes, and make vs to
loue the things of heauen,
as much as flesh and blood

vntill then, the wise Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist,

            <p>The Church truely and
rightly calleth God her sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
By God is not one
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:91:47"/>
person only meant, but the
whole three persons. For
God the Father, through
his Son, by the holy Ghost,
saueth vs. God the Father,
principally out of a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
loue elected vs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
&amp; gaue the means,
by which this election
might produce saluation.
God the Sonne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
did put himselfe into
the very work of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and became the maine
matter, meanes and treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thereof. God the holy
Ghost principally distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and imparteth by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
gift and application,
the saluation, which was
fore-ordained by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and is treasured vp in
the Sonne. So the whole
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:91:48"/>
Trinitie ioyneth together
in this our happinesse, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absolutely necessarie
toward our saluation, that
there should be an election
and appointment of the
meanes, an actuall exhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the meanes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and an actuall applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the meanes exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Therefore when wee
say, we are saued by Christ,
we meane not, that wee are
saued by the second person
onely, and the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vnited to him: but with
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> we meane, that
whole God was in Christ,
and reconciled the world to
himselfe. Accordingly in
our due thanksgiuings, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we praise God for his gifts
toward the new life, we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:91:48"/>
glory to him for our
Election, for our Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for our Regeneration,
which are the maine works
of our saluation, and are the
ioynt-workes of the vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
Trinitie. But yet we
can follow this truth no
farder, then it goes before
vs. Therfore when we come
to regeneration, there must
we stop and looke no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for saluation, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is our saluation accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
and all the parts
thereof perfected. If after
we will goe on to workes as
to further causes of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
we goe beyond the
truth, being past the God-head,
and come vnto man.
For though it may be said,
that God worketh these
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:91:49"/>
workes in man, yet man
ioyneth therein with God.
Now the saluation of man
is deriued into man from
God alone, and is then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and full in parts, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Election, Iustification, and
Regeneration, the absolute
and only workes of the
Trinity, haue wrought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. For regeneration
hauing put into man, the
seede of God which is the
seede of life; Man is then
translated from death to
life; and hauing begotten
him the Sonne of God, hee
is then the heire of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
glory and eternitie. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
works comming after
the state and right of life
and glorie, their goodnesse,
as it comes from God, so it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:91:49"/>
shall be rewarded by God,
increasing the degrees of
that glory, wherein before
we had an vndeniable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and title. Therefore
works adde not a new part
of saluation but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the issues, and fruit
of a part formerly posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Accordingly doth the
Diuine song of that rauish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
soule, orderly declare
Gods sauing of vs from our
enemies to goe before our
seruing of God, in holinesse
all the daies of our life: So
workes themselues are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
as fruits of our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore the glory
giuen to workes, is but as
the fruite of the fruite of
saluation. But why then
shall it be said; Come yee
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:91:50"/>
blessed, for ye fed mee; and
blessed are they that keepe
the commandements, that
their right may bee in the
tree of Life; So that good
works seeme to iustifie and
saue in the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Herein comparisons
may inlighten, though not
prooue. If a man haue a
wife of a suspected life,
whose many children when
the dying husband calleth
before him, hee saith to
those that liuely represent
him; Come to mee the true
sonnes of Mee your Father,
you truely resemble mee,
therefore to you shall bee
giuen the inheritance of
your Father. Here for their
countenance and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the inheritance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:91:50"/>
to them, yet is it not
for that indeed giuen them,
but because thereby they
are iudged to be sonnes, for
which Son-ship, the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is verily giuen them.
So doth God in his great
iudgement, he will iudge
men to bee his sonnes by
their good workes, it being
impossible that good works
can come from any cause
but Regeneration, and for
the regenerate sonnes, was
the kingdome of glorie
long agone prepared euen
by that election which was
before the world. So the
word, For, doth not still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the cause it selfe, but
sometimes an inseparable
signe annexed to the cause,
as if it should be said: My
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:91:51"/>
sonnes are heires of my
kingdome, &amp; those which
are my sonnes, and they
only bring forth the works
of loue; these workes haue
I seene in you, therefore do
I acknowledge you to bee
my sonnes, enter into your

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:91:53"/>
righteousnesse; so after the
committing of euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
sin, we shold go ouer it
with a particular iudgment
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law, wherby acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
it to be a worke of
death, wee should flie to a
particular applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
great Baptisme: that so put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away the particular
guilt of that sinne by the
washing of Christs blood,
and the particular vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of that sinne by the
washing of Christs Spirit,
we which before were gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally
clensed and iustified,
may also haue a particular
and continual clensing and
iustification. For our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
though at once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
is of continual vse,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:91:54"/>
and daily wee must haue a
recourse thereto (to wit by
the outward remembring
and passing to the inward)
that the stocke of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and sanctification at
first imparted may be daily
applied, and distributed to
our particular necessities.
And thogh being in Christ
we haue in him iustification
and sanctification, yet God
expecteth wee shall not let
either of them shift for it
selfe, and to worke on vs,
not working therwith. But
hee looketh that daily sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
against him, we should
daily offer vp to him the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Christ to purge
away the guilt of sinne; and
daily request of him the
Spirit of sanctification, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:91:54"/>
the increase thereof to
purge away the defiling of
sin. Thus doing we keepe
our selues in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and to be pure wee
must do thus; And because
the latter is most painfull
but absolutely necessary, we
must giue great heede ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
For all sinne leauing on
vs guilt, and a staine, the
guilt is not ordinarily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
except the staine bee
taken away; therefore as oft
as we would be forgiuen of
the guilt by Christs bloud,
let vs aske Christs Spirit to
wash away the spot contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by sinne. When <hi>Dauid</hi>
will hopefully pray to bee
deliuered from bloud-guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse,
hee must pray also,
Create in me a cleane hart,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:91:55"/>
and renew a right spirit in
me. Thus must the sonnes
and daughters of God put
away euery vncleannesse
from among them, beeing
perfect in their purposes
and endeauours, as their
heauenly Father is perfect.
And when they intreate
this Spirit to clense the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
of their soule, they
must doe it with a submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the spirit, to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guided &amp; changed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and particularly to haue
that very sin slaine, which
before defiled them; that
the spirit may be as it were
reuenged on the sin which
grieued it, and that it may
be restored to the true place
and power thereof, euen of
raigning &amp; dominion ouer
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:91:55"/>
vs and our sinfull lusts;
from which it was degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by that rebellious sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which therefore must
now bee subiected and cast
downe vnder it.</p>

            <p>Death in respect of this

is a gate, whose neare side,

man to die, which

Breake not this appointed

one thing tendeth
to eternitie, and to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in eternitie. Againe,
these many things leading
to vanity, hinder much that
one thing which leadeth to
eternall felicitie. Let men
therefore chuse that one
which is easie, and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:91:58"/>
with happines, rather
then the many which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

But especially let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
that with those many
things of vanitie they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and hinder not that one
thing of felicitie. Let them
beware, that with temporal
trouble, they purchase not
trouble eternall; and so take
paines neuer to bee out of
trouble. Many there are,
who haue a smoking flaxe
of religion in them, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
or couetousnesse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth
them to put into

things so possesse the heart,
that the one thing is thron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
out, and the smoke
which might haue been a
fire, is no longer a smoke.
Thus doe they kill the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
life which began in

buy death eternall. But pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
your selues, O ye sons of

            <p>Mankind hath rooted in
it a facultie, or rather an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie
of desiring, which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:91:59"/>
cleaueth fast to him through
his whole life. Whatsoeuer
outward changes befall, or
whatsoeuer prosperity with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
change, there is a roote
of lust and desire in man,
which still will bud foorth;
and if it fasten on nothing
to be desired, it is in paine,
and desireth earnestly to
desire something. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this, is the saying of
Christ, That which is born
of flesh is flesh: to wit, that
which is borne of fleshly
lust, is lustfull flesh, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is like the cause. Hence
are those endlesse desires,
which are euer reaching,
though without need, with
out vse. Hence it is, that the
man who is ignorant of his
owne nature, so often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:91:60"/>
himselfe, while as
often hee telleth himselfe,
that such a thing had, hee
will leaue desiring. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
after that had, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
afresh, and on that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thing ofttimes whereby
hee thought to bound the
old, he raiseth a new desire:
the whiles hee perceiueth
not, that himselfe is still the
cause of his desires, and not
the obiects; so that whiles
he is himselfe, hee shall still
desire: Indeed when a thing
desired is enioyed, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
seemeth to cease, and
then man thinkes hee will
desire no more. But that is
but one single desire, which
ceaseth by the obtaining of
that his obiect, the power
of desiring still remaineth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:91:60"/>
vnslaine, and is no more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, then a roote by
the breaking of a single
branch; therefore it still
newly buddeth out, and
makes endlesse worke, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ende of one desire,
sending foorth a new. But
what remedie is there to
this euill? Surely we must
not run so much to obiects
thereby to satisfie and quiet
desires, which is endlesse;
as to our selues, to kill them
all in the roote. But this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
cleaueth so fast to man,
that except man can be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twined
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himself (which
is also very hard) it seemes
impossible to bee cleared.
And this very thing that
is impossible to man, is
possible to God, and done
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:91:61"/>
by God. He by regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
putteth a new man
into vs, which eateth
out the old man corrupt
through these deceiuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
lusts. This new man
teacheth and mooueth vs
to denie the lusts which
fight against the soule. It
changeth vs and our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and makes vs dead vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
lusts, and aliue vnto
truth and reason. Therfore
if wee will bee at rest in our
selues, and keepe a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Sabbath in our soules,
let vs pray for this godly
nature vnto God the father
of it, which may free vs
from this slauerie of lust,
(that like the Egiptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
still sends vs about to
seeke worke for our selues)
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:91:61"/>
and may put into vs holy,
reasonable, and measured
desires. Let vs giue our
selues wholly to be led by
the light and motion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
taking no care to fulfill
the vnlimited lusts of the
flesh; And surely this world
of vanitie is not worth a
long or large desire, neither
is the lustfull desire of any
thing, more then a sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
&amp; labor of the mind,
and no helpe to the thing

For first by the old man

they haue a taste wholly
bitter put vpon them; they
are to it proposed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
as punishments, euen
the strokes of God hating
and afflicting. This made
many holy men cry out in
their agonies that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, that hee did set
them as Markes, that they
were borne vnto sorrow
and darkenes. But the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

from Christ, touching these

of Marah into whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

euen vpon his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

since with naturall men, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall

is the height &amp; vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

This being chiefest, to that

shadow, and being, for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
Now if we inquire in

what estate this enioying is
greatest, we shall finde in
that wherein naturall, and
as we terme them, kindly
affections, and desires, haue
most satisfaction. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede

it is not amisse for men

            <p>The affections of man
are vsefull and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
meeting with fit occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and limited by due
measure. But they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
inordinate among
vs, and lay hold on wrong
obiects, or on true in wrong
measure. Ioy is good, yea
necessarie, when Gods loue
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:91:68"/>
is beheld and considered.
And ioy is good, when
Gods blessings are powred
vpon vs, for euen that ioy is
the gift of God: but ioy
oft transgresseth; for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth
more in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
then in God; and it is
too liuely in temporall
things, and too dull in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
Yea, it reioyceth som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in sinne, our owne or
others, which is a ioy in the
place of sorrow. For sorrow,
though hated, is also very
profitable, and excellently
meete for the sinfull and
miserable estate of man.
Sinne, when it hath myred
the soule, by repentant
sorrow hath the filth,
(though not guilt) washed
away, and indeed the guilt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:91:69"/>
is not washed away by
Christ, vntill the filth bee
washed away by spirituall
sorrow. For as long as the
dregges of sinne lie on the
soule vnbathed in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
so long the blood of
Christ, as it were, lotheth to
come neere it. Againe, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
fitteth excellently the,
estate of vanity and misery,
that our looke being sad,
our heart may be made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and that griefe may
stirre vs vp to apply our
hearts to wisedome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee may escape through
vanitie and misery, into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie
and happinesse.
But sorrow is often faulty,
when it sorrowes more for
losses, then for sins; which
in effect is more for losses
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:91:69"/>
of this life, then of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
It is faulty also, when
it is stubborne against spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ioy, and will not let
the hart reioyce in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, though he bid it
reioyce continually; yea
hatred it selfe is good, yet in
one only cause, when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
men that hate God;
for then may we hate both
their wickednes, and them
as our vtter enemies. Yet
wee must beware wee hate
not men for some single
sinne, who otherwise striue
to liue vprightly; for in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things we offend al, and
haue need our selues in such
cases often to be spared. To
such belongs the Spirit of
meekenes to restore them;
and if <hi>Dauid</hi> say, I haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:91:70"/>
against God, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
must say, Thy sinne is
also forgiuen thee. But the
habitual and greedy sinner,
that putteth God far from
him, and in defiance saith,
Who is the Lord; this man
is odious, and <hi>Iehosaphat</hi>
shall be bitterly chidden if
he loue them; yet the bond
of charitie may still hold
on, which must watch that
our hatred be for Gods sake
onely, and not our owne
(for man ought not to hate
man in his owne behalfe.)
Beside this, charitie must
pray for the amendment of
him; for charitie to man
desireth the preseruation,
not the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man,
as farre as it may, without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
offending the charitie of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:91:70"/>
God. But summarily to
bring all affections into
their true vse and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
let vs finde out both
their vse and measure in the
word of light, kindling or
quenching them, lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or shortning them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the direction

            <p>The best knowledge hath
been anciently thought to
be mans knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
but the best know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
indeede being the
knowledge of the best,
which is God, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of man comes next
in worth, who is the next
best in this lower world,
and whom God knowne,
teacheth and commandeth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:91:71"/>
to know himselfe, and who
by knowing himselfe shall
the better know God. Now
the immediate vse of this
knowledge being to better
the knower, hee that will
make most vse therof, must
learne to know himselfe
most in those parts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
which are of most
vse and excellence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on the soule, let the
soule of man especially fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
her eies, that knowing
herself with a right and true
knowledge, she may finde
what is right in her, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
and confirme it; and
which is crooked and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
to auoide &amp; amend
it. But to do this clearely,
she hath need of some light
aboue her owne; for it is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:91:71"/>
hard for the blind soule to
see her owne blindnesse.
Therefore begging for that
eye-salue of the greatest
Light, and so hauing obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it, let her goe on to a
true search and inquirie of
her selfe. In this inquirie,
let her generally compare
the resolutions of her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of her will, with the
lawes of her Maker. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the soule did, and shold
beare the Image of God,
which Image, the lawes of
God truly and vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
expresse: it is a certaine
truth, that wherin the soule
differeth and boweth from
these lawes, in vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
or will; therein, and in
so much, the soule differeth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:91:72"/>
from God, and hath abated
and altered his Image. And
this is indeed a chiefe and
most worthy employment
of mans time on earth,
when the soule lookes into
Gods loue, as into a glasse,
and thereby trimmeth
and fitteth her selfe for her
Maker, against the day of
her appearance before his
glorious Selfe, who cannot
abide to see any thing neere
him that is vnlike him.
Now there are some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
and remnants of this
Law, yet remaining of the
first writing in the nature
of man: but if we will reade
profitably therein, we must
take heed we follow it not
too farre, but still compare
it with the Law written, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:91:72"/>
there are but small
broken and corrupted pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereof. While we are
in this search, as generalitie
and custome are great bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the soule vnto error
and corruption, so a suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that a generall estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things may proceede
from the vnderstanding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
or the will corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
may be a great helpe to
bring the soule into her
place and true estate. For
to suspect deceit, is a first
and excellent degree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
being vndeceiued; &amp;
vnto this suspicion of mens
wisest and most esteemed
opinions, the word of truth
giueth vs a good foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
while it sayes, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things which are highly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:91:73"/>
esteemed among men, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
in the sight of
God. And of this againe,
there is an vnfallible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
euen the corruptnesse
of the soule by the fall of
man. For this deprauation
mightily possessing the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
makes it in the
best iudgement thereof, to
think deceitfully of things,
and withall to thinke these
deceiued thoughts wise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it knoweth nothing
beyond them. But let the
soule that prepareth her
selfe for God, vntie her selfe
from her selfe, as from a
thing corrupted, and from
the world, as from a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of such things as her
selfe is; equally blinded,
and walking in the same
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:91:73"/>
darkenesse, though among
themselues they be agreed
to call it light. Thus putting
off her own corruption and
that of the world, shee is fit
and ready to be new stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with the image of her
Creator, and to be inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with truth in her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
and to put on
rightnesse in her wil, which
let her learne from the law,
and desire to haue ingrauen
in her by grace. In this
course there will bee many
Rubbs, the glorious folly
of the world will mocke
thy particular and desolate
wisedome, it will disswade
thee from singularity and
desire, or prouoke thee to
erre with company; it will
aske thee whether the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

doe beleeue as thou
doest; yea thine owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
will somtime strike
thee into astonishment, and
make thee muse and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whether thou art in a
right minde and purpose.
But goe on vnchanged,
knowing that thou seekest
not what is vsuall, but what
is right, and the patterne to
which thou art fitting thy
selfe is not man but God;
euen a patterne of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
beyond all exception.
This is also their duty if
they considered it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let them that would
turne thee, returne to thee,
Returne not thou to them.
When thou shalt present
thy selfe before God, the
more holy and vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:91:74"/>
thou art, the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

but wil know and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his sonnes by their

reward them as that
is more or lesse; &amp; then shal
it be no sorrow of heart to
thee, that thou hast gone

            <p>God is the iudge of the
world, and iudgeth it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
by two kinds of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The first is by Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and so by Kings, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
and Iudges, he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
mankinde. It is the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:91:75"/>
iudgement of God which
is committed to them, and
they are his mouth to the
people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How wicked and
false are they then, that out
of the mouth of God giue
not the iudgement of God,
but of their owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!
that seeke not what
God iudgeth of the case,
but what themselues may
iudge, corruptly, if couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
These are in the ranke
of the old false Prophets,
which said the Lord saith,
when hee speaketh not by
them. Thou standest ô cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
man, in the place of
God, to represent him, but
thou actest this part ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouredly,
and insteede of
representing the pure, and
by-bribes-vnflexible Lord
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:91:75"/>
of the world, thou plaiest
the part of a base and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-harted
slaue; so doest
thou expresse thy owne
vice not his iustice, and wee
receiue that iudgement of
mony, not of God. Yet is
that indeede thy God, and
tells thee what sentence
thou shalt giue; and all this
is wisedome if concealed
from the eyes of men. But
euen for that point also
know this, that thogh thou
art only in that place depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to iudge, yet many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
particulars beeing
heard, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; do iudge as wel
as thy selfe: these see &amp; feele
when the bias of couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and corruptions, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thee from the straight
line of iustice; they feele
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:91:76"/>
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudge is some way
allyed to the cause, &amp; hath
some feeling of it, because
hee or his haue felt some
thing for it; yea generally
they talke of it, though out
of hearing; for corruptnesse
though it haue no other
goodnesse, hath yet some
modestie, and is ashamed to
heare it selfe spoken of, for
it knoweth it selfe to bee a
vice: yet this is one more
vice of that vice, to rage
more against others that
reueale it, then against the
owner of it, that did such a
thing which might iustly
shame the Author of it, if
reuealed. Let such a one be
rather angry with himselfe
for doing ill, then with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
for speaking truth.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:91:76"/>
But because through this
net of humane iustice and
deputatiue iudgement, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
guilty, if profitable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
breake out and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape,
God hath another
greater net which he casts
without these, wherein hee
takes both the escapers, and
the giuers of leaue to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape;
This is the great and
generall iudgement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God in person will sit as
iudge, and will examine the
iudges themselues and the
iudged. Then the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Iudge of the world,
shall iustifie the iudges that
haue iudged righteously in
this world; But there they,
that now are wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
shall iustly bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and the mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:91:77"/>
Iudges that missed
their part, and changing
iudgement, spake from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
when they should
haue spoken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, shall
haue their faults repeated
vnto them, if vnrepeated;
and by the iust mouth of
God himselfe, shall with
their faults be deliuered to
Satan the iayler, who shall
carry them to the dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where the worme dyeth
not, nor the fire goeth out.
But because such men doe
fortifie their consciences, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the terrors of the
Lord, and his fearefully-great
iudgement, and put
the euill day either wholly
or farre from them; that
they bee not vtterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feare in this world, God
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:91:77"/>
doth many times by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
iudgements strike, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
them, their issue, or

in minde that hee which
now iudgeth some, shall
hereafter iudge all sinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
equally odious in all,
and equally lyable to iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Hee strikes not all,
yet, because generall iustice
is reserued for the generall
iudgement; But he strikes
some, that their iudgement
might to al be an earnest of
a generall iudgement, and
might in the meane time
terrifie men from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
by present plagues,
who feare not the future.</p>

            <p>When <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
there was no corrupt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:91:81"/>
lust: when there was no such
lust, there was no shame;
generation was cleane, and
meerely pure: and when ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
was pure, then the
neerest kindred could not
defile themselues with it,
for pure things defile not.
Therfore rightly God, who
had aboundance of Spirit,
made but one male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
who could haue made
many more: for though
there were inforced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
an intermarriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
brethren and sisters,
yet thereby was inforced
no incest; for when mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and generation were
pure and without shame,
then the brother discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not the shame of his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
which is the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:91:81"/>
and vnlawfulnesse of
incest. And thus might the
state of generation haue
continued in all posterities,
if the state of the creation
had continued: But man
by his fall brought in lust,
and thereby shame, and by
both a necessitie of incest,
which was not before. For
God made onely a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that brethren and sisters
should purely and holily
marrie together: but man
turned this necessitated ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
into incest. For a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a sister being one
flesh, it is a ground of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the same flesh
should couer the shame of
the same flesh; which hee
that doth not, goes so farre
toward incest, as hee goes
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:91:82"/>
from this couering. Now
the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> being
brought by <hi>Adam</hi> into this
necessitie, were suffered by
the patience of the God of
long suffering, who might
still require his first course
well instituted, that now by
manis corrupted. After that
some of the Fathers may be
thought to haue done the
like by a spirituall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that they might marry
within the Church, and not
with the daughters of men;
or by diuine indulgence
and dispensation, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>The course of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God through this
world vnto heauen, is the
very course of the Israelites
from Egypt to Canaan. Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
is born in Egypt vnder
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:91:83"/>
the seruice of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and
brought from vnder him
by a mightie and outstret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
Arme, escaping the
death of Egypt by the
blood of the Lamb. Gods
children are begotten in the
Kingdome of Satan, and
drawne from his subiection
by his mighty power, who
can onely bind the strong
man, and take away his
goods. By the blood of the
Lamb, Christ Iesus, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
escape that death which
is due to them, by being
borne in the kingdome of
Satan. The Israelites by the
red Sea were cleared from
the prosecution and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Egypt, and through
it found a path toward the
land of promise. The true
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:91:83"/>
Israelites by spirituall and
inward baptisme are dead
vnto sinne and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Satan, and by that
death escape from them;
hauing also a way painted
out by the sanctification
thereof to the Kingdom of
blessednesse. Forty yeeres
long after their man-hood
did the Israelites wander in
the wildernesse, vntill they
came into Canaan: and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeeres are the vsuall
time appointed to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God to trauell in
this world, before they
come to rest. And in this
fortie yeeres, the onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
food of Israel that
gaue them life and comfort
was Manna from heauen:
and the chiefe food of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:91:84"/>
regenerate is the Spirit of
Christ, which dwelleth in
them, and is their life and
comfort. Slender and light
did that Manna seeme to
the Israelites, yet sufficed to
bring them to the land of
Promise: and small doth the
life and comfort appeare of
this Spirit to fleshly reason,
euen of the regenerate; but
it will serue to bring them
to heauen, and to comfort
and strengthen them by
the way. Manna shewed,
that man liueth not by
bread onely, but by euerie
word which proceedeth
from the mouth of God; to
teach vs, that by this Spirit
which proceedeth from the
breath of God, we haue as
certaine a life, as wee haue
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:91:84"/>
by bread. But as at first
there was an host to fetch
Israel backe into bondage,
and at last there were hosts,
giants, &amp; gates of brasse to
keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the possession
of the Land of Promise. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
when Christians
are escaped from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Satan by regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and walking to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
which is aboue, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
and armies of wicked
spirits, the gates of hell, yea
<hi>Og</hi> the King of Basan, the
huge Prince of hel, and the
Principalities of darknesse
fight against them, and seek
to turne backe, and stop
their progresse vnto rest.
But vnto Israel their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were as bread, euen a
prey and a triumph; and to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:91:85"/>
vs the God of peace will
tread Satan vnder our feet,
the gates of hell shall not
preuaile against vs, but their
temptations shall bee our
aduancements, and their
resistance shall giue vs the
title of conquerours. And
that we may make full be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of this example, let
vs especially be carefull to
walke like those Israelites,
which continued and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
their course from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt
to Canaan; the chiefe
resemblances among the
Israelites of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
among vs. Let vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
the sinnes of them,

feeding, comforting, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:91:85"/>
contenting our selues in all
estates therewith; in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
trials, and changes.
For this small dram of our

that they should not

them downe by setting
them together by the eares
betweene themselues. Not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:91:90"/>
to mention the too-much
opposition betweene the
reformed Christians, I can
example it in the quarrels
which haue been betweene
faith and workes, prayer
&amp; preaching, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of the learned
workes of some, in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue
despite of as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
works of others. But
this is an vnkindly debate,
and issueth by no meanes
out of the nature of the
things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, but from
mans contentiousnes, want
of iudgement, or ouer-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our owne apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Each vertue hath her
seuerall place, and in that
place shee excelleth &amp; hath
commendation, and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
out no other vertue
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:91:91"/>
either from place or worth.
The place of faith is first in
the vnderstanding, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
downward on the wil
and affections, it ioynes vs
to Christ; so is it the hand
of the ingraffer, it sets the
eye of the soule euer on
God in Christ: it is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
for vnion, &amp; for all the
benefits and fruites com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from that vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
workes are a part. The
place of workes is chiefely
in the will and affections,
yet grounded in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
&amp; springing forth
at the members: They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the vertue of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they praise and glorifie
him that bestowed this v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
they are excellent as
fruits, but they haue both
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:91:91"/>
being &amp; excellence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him
whom faith apprehendeth.
Preaching deliuers words
of knowledge, of reproch,
of comfort, of exhortation,
to our ignorance, to our
sinnefulnesse, to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire,
to our deadnesse of
heart: yea it teacheth vs
how to pray, it perswadeth
vs to pray; prayer fetcheth
downe grace from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of grace, by which,
preaching it selfe is made
profitable, and life is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the dead letter; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides
vs for hearing, and
makes vs able to doe what
we heare. In summe, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
helpe in all things
from him, without whom
we can doe nothing. Thus
it seemes both faith and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:91:92"/>
workes, prayer and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
bee of kinne, mutuall
embracers, and farre from
that contention which is
fastned to them: each desire
that their fellowes may
haue appointed time and
place, because in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
themselues doe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
Now for the last kind
of debate, which hath been
set betweene excellent wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
discretion and charitie
might serue for a full reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
If any one bee in any
thing good and profitable,
charitie and wisedome will
rather comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that worth
of his, then obscure it by
comparisons: if another be
more learned, it may bee
the lesse learned doth more
edifie; and sure it, is that such
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:91:92"/>
contention doth not edifie
at all. The Schoolemen are
excellent in subtilties, they
search how things are, they
dig for the roote; and in
sum, if sifted from errors,
and clearely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued, they
may giue great light to the
vnderstanding. Another
Diuine goeth more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to worke, he sets foorth
the matter without curious
search of the manner, hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shewes that it is, then
how it is; yet he shewes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for saluation, hee
shewes enough for the most
general capacitie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he mooues the will, and
stirres vp the affections to
receiue life, &amp; refuse death.
The first make a few men
excellent, but find not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:91:93"/>
a fit great audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; they
are good teachers of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.
The later doth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
profit, he goeth into
the wil &amp; affections, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes
the heart for God,
the seate where he delights
to dwell. Of this kind hath
this age most neede of, of
which prophecies foretold,
that the loue of many shold
now waxe cold, that men
should loue their pleasures
more then God: and of
which experience telles vs,
that knowledge hath farre
out-run obedience, which
should follow close at the
heeles of it; and therefore
of the two, lacks most nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Generally, let them
that build the house of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:91:93"/>
God, if they hold a sword
in one hand, yet hold it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the enemy, not one
against another: much lesse
let the by-standers take
their swords out of their
hands, and fight for them,
when they will not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
The building is not
promoted by this meanes,
but hindered, yea, pulled

            <p>The euils of this life are
great and many, whereof
some are immediately from
the hand of God, others
from the wickednesse of
men, others from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of Satan; and of these
also God hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
These euils are by
men diuersly receiued, some
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:91:94"/>
entertaine them only with
passion, and these cure one
vexation with another, and
adde sorrow to sorrow.
Some by reasons morall or
naturall, seeke to preserue
their owne quietnesse, and
these obtaine not often
what they seeke; and if they
doe, they haue but a fading
and transitorie rest, which
being past, is all one with
sorrow past; for then they
are both like vanitie and
nothing. But a third sort
of receiuers are they, that
receiue them with faith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a beleeuing soule, whose
obiect is God in Christ, and
which looking vp to God,
both sees him, and in him
sees what hee sees in these
euils: this is the going into
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:91:94"/>
the Sanctuarie, where the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
of this life are only tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerned, and so thereby
conquered. For looking vp
to God, we see him our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
Father, vnchangeable
Sauiour, and our stedfast
happinesse: we see that the
euils which he sends, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
to vs, are rods of loue,
and their stripes are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;
they punish the flesh,
and that but temporally,
that the spirit may liue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
And for the wicked,
who are somtimes gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners,
he tels vs, that
he beholds their wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
that they stand in the
slipperie place of a transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and dying life, and that
they and their works shall
come to iudgement; and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:91:95"/>
then their wrongs shall
turn into eternal torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to vs into eternal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And euils thus receiued
are comfortable euils, for by
faith, we see affliction to be
a treasure euerlasting, farre
better then treasures of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;
they are edifying e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils,
for they build vs vp;
being beaten downe in the
body of sinne, wee are built
vp in grace and truth. So
these beleeuers onely make
benefit of euils, and in stead
of being vexed by them, or
receiuing no aduantage of
them, they turne them into
spiritual nourishment; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs goe still armed
with this faith, which only
ouercommeth the world,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:91:95"/>
and makes it seruiceable. It
is the onely strength and
support of a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this
vale of miseries, and that
which keepes him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
oppressed of them, and
that helps him to suppresse
and vse them. As much
faith as wee haue, so much
strength we haue; and if we
lack strength, we lack faith.
If then euils pursue thee,
and thou faintest vnder
them, know that thou wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
faith, as surely as <hi>Peter</hi>
did, when he began to sink.
For how can the beleeuing
soule be ouercome, which
beholdeth the Almightie
on her side, euen when ten
thousand hemme her in?
yea, which then beholdeth
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:91:96"/>
these euils short and transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
yet by transitory light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
working eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Beleeuest thou these
things, and yet art thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid?
it cannot bee that
thou shouldest be afraid of
happinesse, though entred

that thou dost not verily

Therefore hencefoorth in

setling his hope and heart
thereon, know him to bee
the great spirituall foole,
and his good successe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

folly. For his deceiued hart
feedeth on dust and vanity;
he hath forsaken the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

hath hath made cesternes
for waters that faile: this the
end will make euident; for
then it will appeare euen to
the foole himselfe, that the
foundation can no longer
stand, then the thing on
which it was founded. But
in the ende the earth shall
melt away, &amp; the elements
shall consume with heate;
and therefore the hopes
built on earth, and earthly
things must needes fall

downe, and wholly be rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But that infinite and
eternall happinesse, whose
name is, I am, hee is for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
The hopes built on
him cannot be shaken, the
heart fixed on him, cannot
be ouerthrowne; that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
remaineth sure, and
the building thereon is
Mount Sion, which cannot
be moued; he will bee left
after all things, to receiue
and crowne thee. Be wise
therefore, O ye Princes, yea
be wise, O yee wise men of
the earth. Kisse the Sonne,
euen that eternal wisedom,
be yee instructed by him,
and then ye shall be truely
wise; his Spirit will teach
you that truest wisdome to

which containe those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

            <p>A great burthen of this
Iland is blasphemy, &amp; the
prophanation of the name
of God: a heauy, yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
sinne it is, by
which God is dishonoured,
and man damned at a very
low rate. So doth this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
sel himself for nothing,
and as seekers of death, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then they will not die,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:91:98"/>
they will anger God of set
purpose, and without profit
procure their owne destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Surely, as it hath bin
well obserued, this sin hath
a more pure corruption
and venome in it, then
most of his fellowes; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinnes haue common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
some sensible profit or
pleasure to Midwife them
into the world: but this in
it selfe is neither pleasing
nor profitable, but issueth
out of the meere prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of hart, euen of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse
and contempt of
God. For how can it be, but
God is exceedingly despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and neglected, when
his name is vsed to make
vp idle places of a hollow
or vnfilled sentence, or to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:91:99"/>
vent or vtter with some
grace &amp; force the choler &amp;
malice of a displeased man:
But be it knowne to thee,
O man, of what sort or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
soeuer thou bee, that
God made thee to serue
him, and in part of seruice
to feare and sanctifie his
name; &amp; indeed thou art not
of thy self worthy to serue,
or to name him: How then
darest thou to make him
and his name to serue thee,
thy prophane discourse, &amp;
thy rash and vntempered
anger? It was written anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
Holines to the Lord;
and surely where God is,
holinesse is about him;
where God will bring any
to him, hee puts holines vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; and where his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:91:99"/>
name is, he will haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
applied and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to it. Therefore his
name must bee brought
foorth onely in holy vses,
and an extreamely vnfit
match it is, to ioyne the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
name with the vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
and prophanest passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and speeches. If thou
wearest but the vizard of a
Christian, and a man should
aske whether thou canst
say the Lords Prayer, and
the ten Commandements,
thou wilt extremely scorne
the question. But assure thy
selfe, that God infinitely
more scorneth, that in that
prayer, one should offer vp
a petition to him, that Gods
name should be hallowed,
who cares not whether hee
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:91:100"/>
haue his petition granted
or not, yea many times
takes paines to make it
void. And much he scornes
that any shold say his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
that care not
to doe them; and that the
same tongue which saies,
Thou shalt not take the
name of God in vaine, shold
presently take the same
name in vaine, and so bee
contrary to it selfe, giue the
lye to it selfe, and dishonour
the name which it falsely
pretended to reuerence.
But if thou wilt needs loue
this sinne more then God,
the same God who now
endures thy blasphemies
with a limited patience, wil
one day when that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is come to the full
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:91:100"/>
bounds thereof, ransome
his name from thy vnhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
throate; and he who
is a consuming fire shall
make euery touch of his
name to burne in thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.
Then it shall bee felt,
though not now beleeued,
that God is still actiue, and
either sanctifies or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
wheresoeuer hee is;
and if he haue been in thee
much but not sanctifying,
he shall be in thee much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
but consuming. Hee is
too strong for vs, and so
cannot suffer of vs; and
though he seeme to doe it
by being taken at will into
our licentious mouthes, yet
it is but as the taking of a
coale or hooke, which
burne, and bite, &amp; take the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:91:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
takers: so thy owne wicked
words shall fret into thee
and become thy snare and
consumption. But that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one may know his part
and interest in this sin, and
the iudgement of it, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
degrees thereof doe
readily appeare. There is
one sort of prophaners
that keepe open house of
blasphemies, and the name
of that God which dwells
not in their hearts, yet issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
still at their mouthes:
these are in the depth of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and be the eldest sons
of hell. And it is to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
if they beleeue not
that there is a God, how
they speake so oft of him;
and if they beleeue God to
be, how they feare not to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:91:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dishonour him: who if hee
be, must needs bee iust to
himselfe, and take his owne
part against those that thus
abuse his name. Another
sort there is of them that
leauing the name of God,
yet vse other names and
words in stead thereof, and
so by an euill idolatrie,
translate the honour of
God to creatures or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of their owne. A
third sort is of such as in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
idle exclamation or
admiration, at any vnusuall
or odde matter, take vp the
name of God, altogether
vnprofitably and vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably:
who is not to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
but with reuerence,
and for the bettring of our
selues or others. For as oft
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:91:102"/>
as we are not the better for
naming him, wee are the
worse. These wil sometimes
say, if thou admonish them,
that they meane no ill; but
they must neither meane
ill, nor doe ill; and because
by carelesnesse &amp; vnwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
of speech this often
happeneth, let those that
feare God, watch their
mouth, that they offend
not with their tongue. And
generally let al those whom
God hath mooued to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him, and to speake good
of his name, teach the
same to their children, that
we may leaue a godly seede
behinde vs in our roome; it
being a complaint of this
time, that childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too much
learne to speake English
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:91:102"/>
and oathes together, and so
to blaspheme God almost

them.</p>

            <p>Custome of euill hath
sundry great euils belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to it; one that it selfe is
a long succession of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
and offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God: Another, that
growing into familiaritie
with men, at length it
comes to the reputation of
no vice, if not of a vertue.
A third, that it takes roote
and establishment by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
and growes so
stiffe and immoueable, that
it is like the lawes of the
Medes and Persians which
may not bee altered. This
course and sway it hath
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:91:103"/>
both in the liues of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men, and great Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and that to so great a
conquest of mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as well as their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that they haue enacted
a law, that an euill well set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ought not to be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
This the Church of
Rome practiseth; but as we
see in the thing it selfe, that
it is a wisedome which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth
from below, and is
diuellish and sensuall: so by
the consequence of it wee
see it is temporally dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to them that hold it;
For this position brought
that Church to this present
weaknesse. Ambitious and
commodious errors had
crept into that Church, to
which, time had giuen such
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:91:103"/>
strength and estimation,
that it was a very espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
wisedome to holde
them vntouched and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued.
But they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
iust things, often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
to the taking away of
them and more; as tyranny
often hath driuen away
kingdomes. And somwhat
accordingly, while they
would keepe their errours,
they haue prouoked men
to take from them that
which once was held law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
though as things now
stand, they may seeme to
haue lost edification. So
with their supremacy, they
haue lost Patriarchy, &amp; the
ten tribes are rent from
that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> which wold
not ease the burden of his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:91:104"/>
fathers. This may serue for
an example euen to our
Churches, whereby they
may learne, not to establish
themselues by establishing
any sinfull corruption, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such shall appeare: for
that very corruption by
which men shall thinke to
strengthen themselues, is
likely to prooue their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
and destruction. This
was the iustice of God of
old against the Calues of
<hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and of late against
the whoredome of Rome.
Therefore according to
wise <hi>Salomon,</hi> be not wise in
your owne eyes, but feare
the Lord, and depart from
euill; Let all your wise poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
bee grounded, or at
least subordinate to true
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:91:104"/>
pietie. Doe not by defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a knowne sinne, giue
a handle to a rough amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who taking a Church
by the blemishes thereof,
may perchance pull out
them and the sound flesh
which hangeth to them.
The Ancients knew the
corruptnesse of mankinde,
that it still brought forth
tares among wheate; and
therefore appointed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and particular Synods
for the rooting vp of them;
our age is latter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
worser: if wee grow in
diseases, let vs not abate in
the remedies. If we cannot
haue generall Councels, let
vs make true vse of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
sinods by serious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
in them, not so
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:91:105"/>
much what euill customes
it might seeme policie to
maintaine, as what custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie
drosse it were true
and spirituall wisedome to
refine. In like sort, a remedy
of euill customes is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to euery member of the
Church; If thou hast done
euill, amend that which is
past by future goodnesse,
and adde not to thy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
returning. But let all
especially shun and kill the
beginnings of such wicked
customes; for the more
they continue in them, the
stronger they make a chaine
for themselues: so that at

thereby, and are
still further from escaping.</p>

            <p>The roote of all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and fulfilling the law,
is the loue of God: if wee
loue God truly, we keepe
the first Table, and we will
doe what wee can to keepe
the second. For how loueth
any man God whome hee
hath not seene, who loueth
not his brother whome he
hath seene? And who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
God <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> will not please
him &amp; keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements?
That this work of
loue which of it selfe is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
&amp; whose yoke is light,
may by vs pleasantly and
easily to be performed, let
vs consider partly, (for wee
cannot fully) wherfore God
is bee loued. God is to be
loued first for himselfe. For
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:91:106"/>
he onely is the fulnesse of
happinesse, and all suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie,
since in him onely is
Being, Light, Life, Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Glory, Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Other things which
carry these things names,
haue them not indeed; for
nothing created hath any
of these of their owne, but
in him and his they haue
all that they haue, and they
be that which they be. So
God is, and there is nothing
beside him. Secondly, God
is to bee loued for the loue
which he hath expressed to
vs; for loue deserueth loue,
and chiefely a great loue
deserueth a little loue; but
most chiefely that greatest
loue of the Creator, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues
the greatest loue
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:91:106"/>
(which at greatest is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in comparison of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
of the creature. Now
if I shold go about to shew
the loue of God to man, I
should labour to bring infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitenesse
within measure,
and to bound within the
knowledge of man a law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible.
This in
summe may be conceiued:
That God loued vs when
he had but foreknown and
foreappointed our beeing,
when we were not at al, but
only in his purpose: Then
he loued vs with a loue that
marked and sealed vs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
happines. This loue
produced our Creation in
an excellent image, &amp; this
loue to man falne from that
created image, gaue him
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:91:107"/>
the greatest gift that is or
may be, euen his owne Son
to cleare him from the
guilt of his fall by a bitter
satisfaction; and to imprint
a begotten image stedfast
and permanent, instead of
the created image mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and decayed, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
regeneration. Thus
from God the Father with
the gift of the Sonne, haue
we also the holy Ghost: so
is the whole Trinity impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to vs, and what more
can he doe for his beloued?
Yet his loue ceaseth not,
but proceeds to guide, to
purge, to increase, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
to cherish, as a father
nurtureth his sonne, and as
an Eagle stirreth ouer her
yong. Much is our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:91:107"/>
&amp; much he strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs; many are our fals,
and he forgiueth vs much:
many are our dangers, and
troubles, and the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers
vs out of all. Let vs
therefore loue the Lord our
strength, let vs loue him
much who forgiueth vs
much: Let vs loue the Lord
because hee receiueth our
Prayers, and deliuers vs in
the time of trouble. Let vs
loue him first for that
which he is, for he only is
worthie of loue; his courts
only are truely delectable,
and his presence amiable:
There only dwelleth the
fulnesse of ioy, &amp; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of eternitie. Next, let
vs loue God for his loue to
vs, and be glad that so great
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:91:108"/>
a loue will bee contented
with a loue so narrow and
scant. Let our loue be raised
to the highest, and let vs fit
it to him as much as wee
may, that the narrownesse
may bee caused rather by
the lownesse of our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and beeing, then the
straitnesse of our will: so let
it be with all the soule, and
all the strength. Againe,
since our loue is chiefely
expressed in pleasing him,
and hee is chiefely pleased
in keeping his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
Let vs as much as
we loue him so much desire
to please him, in a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
obseruation of his
commandements. If this
we doe, we shall haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
assurance of enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:91:108"/>
him whom we loue, and
then are wee happie aboue
our fellowes: the oyle of
gladnesse is powred vpon
vs, and according to Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> we may reioyce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.
For if we be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to see and enioy God
our perfect hapines, what
sorrow can ouer-way this
ioy, what losse can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaile
this gaine? Surely
we may be contented with
whatsoeuer wee haue, for
godlinesse hath brought
vs, the chiefest and most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
gaine. If wee
shall haue the greatest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
how can any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
thing make vs mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?
If then wee grieue
much, we esteeme not this
happinesse as we should, or
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:91:109"/>
we turne our eyes from the
assurance thereof. But ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our eyes beeing fixed,
and not on any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

this is matter for humilitie
against presumption, and
for comfort against despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Thy goodnesse is
altogether of God, hee first
powred it into thee, when
he new begat thee Againe,
the continuance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall

from God. So what hast
thou of thine owne, or what

not receiued of God? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be humble, as a thing
which in it selfe hath no

            <p>Death, at <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> diuels first
bringing in of it, was a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
punishment, cutting off
man from all ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
But when God in his
mercy annexed infinite and
euerlasting ioies vnto death,
death became then aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and that an especiall
one, as being the gate of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
happinesse. But the
naturall man seeing onely
with naturall eies, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
therfore only the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and visible comforts
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:91:112"/>
of this life, not knowing
the second ioyes; wherfore
his desire being bounded
with his knowledge, resteth
onely in them, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he accounts death
a chiefly miserable &amp; feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing, by which he must
be depriued of such ioyes.
But the spirituall man by
the spirituall eye of faith
(which the other hath not)
discerning spirituall things,
beholdeth euidently the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
&amp; endles ioyes which
are in the glorious presence
of the highest happines, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
God the Creator: and
valuing them according to
the ods of their worth, hee
longeth after them, he thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
to inioy them, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
death that which
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:91:112"/>
it is, euen a great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
as that which doth
not take away life alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
from a Christian
man, but most happily
changeth it, turning a life
fraile, miserable and sinfull,
into a life mortall, secure,
holy and happie. And as
that which doth not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ioy, but changeth it,
turning the impure narrow
and the interrupted ioyes,
which here we take in the
creatures, into a pure, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,
&amp; incessant ioies
in God the Creator. Now
herein is the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betweene a naturall
man and a Christian. The
naturall man is in bondage
while he liueth for feare of
death; hee goes on, casting
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:91:113"/>
an eye still on this vizard, as
a thing of terror &amp; affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;
he is troubled with the
darknesse of not being, the
fearefull shadow of death.
But the true Christian is
bold as a Lion, hee treadeth
vpon death, as hauing lost
the sting, by which it may
kill vnto a second death: he
gladly makes vse of it, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
giuing himself to it as
to a messe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of God, which
comes to fetch him from
earth to heauen, from mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to felicitie, from the
workes of the sixe daies
which could not blesse
their daies, to that blessed
rest of the Maker of those
workes, which rest blessed
the seuenth day; it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
blessednesse it selfe,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:91:113"/>
and there being no other
blessednesse but it selfe. Be
it therefore the high priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Christian, to
enioy death, to reioyce in
it, &amp; to account it the dore
of felicitie. And that euery
Christian may make vse of
this priuiledge, this must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
be the practise of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
euen often with the
eie of faith cleared by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and meditation, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the ioyes which are
at the right hand of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the glory of the new
Ierusalem, whereof God is
the Sunne. For as much as
we se it, so much shall we see
it to surmount all worldly
ioy; and as much as we see it
to surmount, so much shall
our desire to it, surmount
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:91:114"/>
our desire to the world, and
finally so much greater shal
be our loue of death, as our
desire to that ioy is greater.
Wherefore if thou louest
death but a litle, thy sight of
that ioy is but little; but see
it more, &amp; thy affection to
death shal be more. If nature
run to the eie and eare, to
draw thee to life, run thou
to the word &amp; spirit to draw
thee to heauen. These will
shew thee more reason why
to desire God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flesh can
why to loue this life. But
thou likest, as thou saist, the
bargaine well, and dost ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it gainfull exchange:
but thou likest not the
means; death is painful, and
thou art not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to be
happy by paine. Surely sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:91:114"/>
is paine, but death abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
in it self seemes not to
be paine. For the setting of a
ioint is many times more
paine, then death by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.
The conuulsions
which appeare, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the strife of nature
with diseases; but death
followeth vsually after na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ouercome, and then
life goes out gently like a
consumed taper. But if it
must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, that there
is paine in the sicknesse of
death, or in death it self, get
thou again into the spirit, &amp;
yet shalt thou see, that death
is adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage. Al the suffrings
of this life, are not worthy of
the glory that shal be reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
For the weight of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> ioy
is an exceeding weight, and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:91:115"/>
ouerweyes farre all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and momentany afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Therefore if by lesser
weight of temporall griefe,
thou purchase <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> exceeding
weight of eternall ioy, thou
art yet a great gainer, thou
hast made a most profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
exchange, thou maist
yet reioyce, and goe gladly
through paine vnto a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
happines. Go thou
therefore, and follow the
patterne of our faith Christ
Iesus, who for the ioy set
before him, endured the
crosse, &amp; despised the shame.
Follow the seruants of
Christ, who reioyced in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,
and went ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through all persecutions,
scourgings, stonings, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and death it selfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:91:115"/>
that glory which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue.
Yea, let vs say with
the seruants of God, If God
commanded vs yet a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
should we not doe it?
for the end shall abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
recompence the way;
the end which is happines,
the way which is griefe, and
the way passeth away, but
<hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> end is endles, &amp; endures
for euer. Let vs go on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hopefully and cheare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
through al sorrowes &amp;
bitternesses, limited &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory,
vnto happines large
without end or bound; solid
without lightnes, &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
without cessation: let
<hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> sight of this felicity coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise,
yea ouerwey with

            <head>56</head>
            <p>A main cause of much
of the griefe and folly of
men is this; That men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
to make something of
this world. They raise great
plots vpon it, and intend to
bring it into a Method; and
out of things so ordered to
draw some great happines
and contentment. But God
hath resolued the contrary;
to make nothing of the
world, but to turne it into
vanity of vanities: he hath
set it forth as a thing to be
shaken, to be remooued, to
resolue with the lost fire,
and only to be a schole and
nurcery for the next world.
Therefore doth hee suffer
things in this world of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to run without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
yea often without
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:91:116"/>
present iustice, and often to
perish, to be ouerthrowne
and to vndergoe great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations.
Now mans mind
being prepared to receiue
comfort from the world
fitted vnto it selfe, &amp; Gods
minde beeing to let the
world run into many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
destructions, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnto vanity it self; it must
needs bee that men often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
haue their purposes
crossed by the purpose of
God, &amp; their courses ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
by the ouerruling
destiny of God. One hath
gotten him a good wife, a
good house, and a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanes,
and is, as they call
it, well setled to liue; he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
comfort in the course
which hee is entring into,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:91:117"/>
and he hath bespoken his
heart to bee merry and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce.
But behold, sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the disease of the world
layes hold on his estate, on
him or his wife; and then
the plot is mard, the ioy is
lost, for the foundation
therof is ouerthrowne. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
what weeping, what way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
what sorrow &amp; brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of hearts? hope is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into griefe, and the
more the hope was, the
more is the griefe. But the
only way to preuent this,
is, that the purpose of man
agree to the purpose of
God, and accordingly that
man expect no more from
the world then God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the world to giue.
Therfore let him perswade
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:91:117"/>
himselfe, that whatsoeuer
part of this world he hath
gotten into his vse, that
part is subiect to the law of
the whole, which is bound
vnder change, perishing,
and vanity. And conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
let him expect no
other certainty from it,
then such as may be from a
state of vncertainty. If he
haue a house well fitted, a
wife well conditioned, a
large demeanes, beautifull
and towardly children; let
him know his house may
burne, his wife may die, his
land may bee taken from
him, by publike, or priuate
enemies; his children may
by sicknesse put on ashes
for beautie, and become the
children of death, yea of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:91:118"/>
               <hi>Belial.</hi> Let him therefore
build his hopes on these
things, as men vse to build
scaffolds for spectacles, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with a certaine expectation
of taking downe when the
spectacle is ended. Let him
vse the world as if he vsed
it not, or as readie not to
vse it; because the forme of
the world passeth away.
When Gods prouidence
calles, we must looke for
their departure; and if thus
expected to depart, they
fall from vs ripe, and are not
pulled from vs as greene;
but if not expected, they
depart as things glewde to
the hart, which teares away
some of the heart at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Thus not vsing this
world as a place of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:91:118"/>
and rest (which it is not)
yet let vs vse it as a Nurce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Schoole for heauen,
which it is. Let vs learne
here of the Spirit, of the
word, of the sacraments, of
affliction, and euen of the
generall condition of the
world it selfe; For since the
world is so full of miserie,
incertainty, and vanity, it
teacheth vs to set our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on another world,
euen that continuing Citie
which is aboue, heauenly
Ierusalem, where is stabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
perpetuity, and glory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coprehensible.
Let vs pray,
let vs striue in this world to
be fitted, to be trimmed, for
that world, as abride for the
wedding-chamber, though
through a thousand chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:91:119"/>
a thousand crosses; for
if wee become inwardly
faire, the King of heauen
will haue pleasure in our
beauty; we shall be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a crowne of ioy
immarcessible, we shall be
filled with the glory of
God, and the blessednesse
of his presence, which is
perfit happinesse.</p>

with the cockelshell
of his owne wit, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
with his iudgement
he walkes ouer the length
and breadth thereof, laying
his high and mighty cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
vpon it. The honestie
of Diuines he debaseth, and
preferreth that of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher:
the religion of
Palestine hee condemnes,
but commends the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religion as a thing
well contriued. Yet his
commendations seeme not
to be heartie, since vnder
them there passe from him
certaine vndermining sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
which strike at the
maine Pillars of that which
he commends. The odious
comparison of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and Mahumetane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:91:120"/>
because the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetane
succeedeth the
Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the pretence of
a greater perfection, as the
Christian doth the Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
may passe the more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resisted
because it is apt of
it selfe to fall. For it easily
appeares that therein the
diuel was lesse then Christs
Ape, mentioning only and
not performing an imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For Christ hath really
out-gone the Law: First, he
hath iustly abolished the
types and shadowes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
by bringing in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Secondly he hath
taken away the ignorance
vnder the Law, by giuing
such a knowledge, that the
least in his kingdome is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:91:120"/>
greater then the greatest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law: and thirdly, he
hath amended the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Law, by giuing
strength to his seruants to
performe what the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could onely teach. But
in which of these points
hath <hi>Mahomet</hi> made any
probable progresse beyond
Christ? Types and shadows
of future things he cannot
take away; for there are
none in the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Ignorance, hee is so
farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amending, that he
is the very man that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
counsell by words
without knowledge; wee
heare of fables and vnlikely
visions, but in sum, hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
knowledge, hateth
the light, &amp; al examination
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:91:121"/>
of his religion. Lastly, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead
of strengthening men
in the accomplishing of the
Law, hee weakeneth them,
by giuing them the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of lust in polygamie;
and impossible it is he can
goe beyond Christ in any
precept of holinesse, who
commands vs to loue and
serue God with al our soule
and all our strength, and
more then all can no man
giue. So doth <hi>Mahomet</hi>
onely speake of perfection,
but performeth it not.</p>

               <head>2. Part.</head>
               <p>But with two points es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
he seems to wound
the Christian Religion,
though like a Parthian
looking another way: One
is while he iudgeth it a loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:91:121"/>
thing that God shold
bee satisfied and appeased
with bloud: which though
it seeme mainly to bee bent
against common sacrifices,
yet being spoken without
exception (as it is there) it
striketh at the very sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Christ performed in
bloud; and that there was
such a meaning this also
addeth probability, because
in his directions of Pietie
while he speaketh of sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
hee aduiseth not his
pious or godly man to
make himselfe acceptable
to his Creator, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of any such
bloudy sacrifice, but being
altogether silent in that
point, he saith, the most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
sacrifice is a pure,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:91:122"/>
true and humble heart. A
second is while he iudgeth
it a strange thing that the
Spirit of God should be in
fraile, weake, and vnperfect
men. Yea he seemeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him from all men: for
he saith, where the spirit is,
it would produce some
strange effects, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing
of mountaines; it
wold appeare in the whole
course of man, and nothing
in the world could shake
vs.</p>

               <head>3. Part.</head>
               <p>To answer these things
first in the roote: The very
roote of this kinde of say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and misbeleefes, is the
naturall wisedome of man,
which is indeede folly. For
it selfe thinking wisely of it
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:91:122"/>
selfe, and making it selfe the
measure of all things, yea
of the Diuinity it selfe, it
contracteth or disposeth,
that, and all other things
according to its owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and iudgement. But
herein are two faults; The
one is: Because the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of man, at the best is
narrow and shallow, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the wisedome of
God, and cannot pierce vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the depth, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the breadth of that
which is deeper and larger
then it selfe: yea in familiar
and daily things, our wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
lyeth downe, being
dazled and amazed. So that
if God please to set forth
any deepe iudgement or
wisedome of his, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:91:123"/>
&amp; without our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
therefore can they
see nothing therein, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are offended with it.
Then the truly wise man
cryeth out with Saint <hi>Paul:</hi>
O the depth of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God! and so lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
with admiration; and
then the foolish wise man
saith, That which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
not, is not, but
that the very wisedome of
God is foolishnesse: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fault is, because our
wisedome besides the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownesse
and narrownesse
thereof, is corrupted and
peruerted: The flesh lyeth
on the soule, as a finger vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the strings of a Lute, and
makes it to sound, speake
&amp; to be wise, according to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:91:123"/>
the nature of that which
stoppeth it. Now the flesh
hath this corruption in it,
that it is auerted from God
our true soueraigne good,
&amp; turneth to the creature,
setting her happinesse ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
This it soundeth still
vnto the vnderstanding on
which it lyeth; this way it
turneth stiffely the will, so
that the wisedome of God,
which teacheth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is lothsome to it, it is ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and condemned of it.
And ouercome with these
two infirmities, it seemes
this man hath by them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
these great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of God: Whereas by
strong mortification of this
fleshly wisedome, and the
helpe of the Spirit obtained
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:91:124"/>
by earnest Prayer, hunger
and thirst, the flesh beeing
made quiet &amp; vnmoouing,
and the Spirit opening the
blind eyes of his, and our
soules, hee and we might
perceiue a high wisedome
in these matters of God, yea
and we shall perceiue the
reason why wee could not
before perceiue them.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="part">
               <head>4. Part.</head>
               <p>But particularly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the branches: For the
first, there is no reason why
God should bee imagined
without iustice, and why iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
should be considered
without a will of punishing
faults, and why the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of faults committed
against God the chiefest es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
shold not be a chiefe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:91:124"/>
punishment euen of bloud
and death, which is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for offences against men.
And proportionably belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
mercie to bee in the
same God, we may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beleeue that mercy may
take the punishment of one
for another, this other bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnited to that one, and
so consequently, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
beeing one the
same, they both being made
one. Againe if there may be
such a sacrifice of one for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
why should not the
bloud of beasts, serue to
teach men that sacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their eternall preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
aswell as bee daily shed
for their temporall nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
man being their end,
&amp; God their Creator, who
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:91:125"/>
therefore may appoint this
vse of them, vnto man as
well as the other? Now for
the second branch, that the
Spirit of God would shew
wonderfull effects: First
who hath tyed God to giue
such a measure of his Spirit
as this man listeth? But it is
still in the hands of God to
dispose his gifts in his own
measure. If it please him he
may separate the gift of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
from the gift of
miracles, giuing one &amp; not
the other: yea in very san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification
hee may kindle
vs sometimes as flaxe that
doth but smoake: and shall
I say then, that except I see
the flame I will not beleeue
that there is any fire? Yet
his graces in many are so
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:91:125"/>
strong, that they are plainly
apparant, and cry out loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the power of God, &amp; not
of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For is it not a power
euidently supernatural, that
men truly possessed of their
wits, seeing and willing,
fight, subdue and forsake
their owne deerest affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and sweetest pleasures,
which they see and feele;
yea, leaue the world, and
life it selfe, to please God
whom they see not, to serue
him, to obtaine him: where
as the generall world, yea,
and the wisest of them
doth cleane contrary? Doth
not this shew they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with a spirit different
from the spirit of the world,
yea, &amp; contrary to it, which
is a diuine Spirit? For
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:91:126"/>
nothing but God can turne
mans hart vnto God, being
naturally fixed and nailed
to the world.</p>

               <p>But true it is, that God
hath so disposed of this
grace, that he leaueth in vs
infirmity still to combat
with it, and sometimes to
quaile it for a time. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
hereof are diuers: first,
hee will get glory by our
weaknes; for we being in a
fight with our neerest flesh,
and the next world, and the
diuell, the Prince of this
world; strong, mighty and
ouermatching enemies; the
glorie must needs bee his, if
wee that are too weake for
them, ouercome them. And
againe, the lesse power hee
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:91:126"/>
performes the victory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
the more is his glory; for
thereby it appeareth, that
the weaknesse of God is
stronger then the strength
of Satan. Again, this world
is a place appointed by him
to bee blotted out, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
it is to man a
place of vnrest, of fighting,
of striuing; his rest is aboue,
his victorie is aboue. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God setteth vs not
here in a steady, victorious,
and glorious grace, lest with
<hi>Peter</hi> wee should desire to
build Tabernacles heere,
where the foundations
must bee remooued: but
hee keepeth rest, triumph,
and glorie for vs in the
world to come, wherein
is the perfect rest, euen
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:91:127"/>
the pure Sabbath of God.
Then shall it apparantly be
his glorie, that hee hath
made so small a seede of
grace, to bring foorth such
a haruest of glorie; and that
with Manna, which to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
men seemeth a light
bread, he bringeth men to
Canaan, euen the land of
rest and happinesse.</p>

               <p>Now to returne him
some trafficke for his obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations,
three notes and
markes I will here set vpon
carnall wise men, each of
them being an imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which spoiles their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of Diuinitie, and
Christ the chiefe part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
euen the ignorance of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:91:127"/>
three things, which few of
them haue the knowledge
to see, consider, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
yet are they certainely
true, and truly shewed in the
doctrine of Christ, and
therefore commends this
doctrine aboue all other.
One is the storie of mans
fall, a true and vnmoueable
ground of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and whereon Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
is to be brought in
to satisfie for the faults, and
to rectifie the crookednesse
thereof. Now this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to vs, only by the word
of life, yet it is necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
on any cleare vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
For it may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
seene and belieued, that
a creature so wicked, so
blind, so subiect to euery
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:91:128"/>
passion and vice, was neuer
let out, as he now is, from
the hands of a most wise,
and powerfull essence; and
that to gouerne a great
world, whereof hee is not
worthy, as he is, to be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
he being so extremely
vitious and corrupt, and
most creatures being more
orderly then himselfe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="part">
               <head>7. Part.</head>
               <p>Againe, another folly
and blindnesse of theirs is,
that they see not the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:
it is impossible, that
the end of mans bodie
should bee this present life.
For then might we say with
these Author, that there
might be some pleasure ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
aboue in the torments
here below. For what gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:91:128"/>
doe wee see here but
miseries, paines, oppression,
diuers tortures, diuers
deaths, diuers heart-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings,
care within, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
without: a few onely
liuing in some ease, of
which again but a few scape
a great taste of miserie. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
were there no life but
this, we might verily think
that man was appointed to
be borne, to liue and die in
a Iayle, wherein hee is tied
and bound vp to miserie;
and that this world was set
forth for a spectacle of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
&amp; massacres: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
wee should infinitely
wrong the infinite wisdom
and goodnesse of the great
cause of al things. But as we
haue learnd of God our own
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:91:129"/>
fall and present miserie, so
withall wee haue learned a
remedie for our fall, and a
way out of this miserie into
felicitie. We know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue,
that the bodie dying,
returnes into that which it
was, and that is dust; and if
being dust at first, it was
then quickned; wee know
hee that quickned dust at
first, can quicken dust at
last, hee being the same for
euer; yea, wee know that
small portion of his Spirit
which is in vs, is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
able to performe it. Wee
doubt not, but a little pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
included in an Acorne, is
able to raise out of it a
mightie Oake, because wee
see it; and we may as easily
belieue, that this Spirit
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:91:129"/>
which now shewes a farre
greater power in our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
may also raise out
of our dust, a heauenly and
glorious bodie. To him
that hath done so great
workes daily seene, there
wanteth no power to do as
great things yet vnseene.
For God hath not bounded
his power by his works, but
if his wil be to worke more,
his power is still sufficient
to proceede in working.
Now that it is his will, his
word doth plainely shew:
blessed bee hee, who hath
both willed it, and shewed
it; and God, the Author of
these and all other good
gifts, stablish vs which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to him, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and embracement of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:91:130"/>
this his sauing truth, that
liuing and dying therein,
we may passe from this life,
which is worse then death,
vnto a true life of blisse and
happinesse.</p>

               <p>Another thing which
flesh and blood hath not
fully discouered, and which
hath been the author both
of our fall and miserie, and
implieth a necessitie of a
preseruer and redeemer; is
a State, body politicke, and
kingdome of euill spirits,
which effectuall in craft,
mightie in power, diligent
in watchfulnesse: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
all these their powers
emploied and moued by an
endles and great malice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind, go stil about
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:91:130"/>
seeking the mischiefe and
ruine of weak &amp; silly man,
vnable of himselfe to stand
against this Leuiathan; and
therefore necessarily wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the helpe of a preseruer
and redeemer. Without a
preseruer we cannot preuent
the euils to come; for against
so mighty enemies, we must
bee hedged about with a
prouidence mightier then
the force of our enemies; els
can we not be safe from our
enemies, but shold be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
deuoured by them.
And we neede a redeemer,
for <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> euils already by these
enemies brought vpon vs:
for these euils we our selues
can by no meanes take
from our selues, nor free
our selues from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:91:131"/>
which Satan hath
alreadie brought vpon vs.
Therefore this strong man
must bee bound by some
stronger then himselfe, and
so we which were before
his possession, may be made
free from that bondage.
Now the highest power
only is master of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of darknesse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he only must performe
this worke. Some short and
small viewes of some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
bodily and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
workings of these
Principalities, the Heathen
haue obserued in their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of witchcrafts, oracles,
and apparitions; which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
against themselues;
that there are such a people,
and that at times they are
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:91:131"/>
very mischieuous and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious;
but the craft of this
kingdome is so great, &amp; the
ignorance of man so grosse,
that sometimes vnder the
shew of doing good, as cures
and the like, and sometimes
by foretelling future euents
(so hiding still their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
malice, which was to
the soule and eternall life of
man) they haue won silly
men to take them for gods,
who are their sworne and
most fierce enemies: so farre
are men from knowing,
they are a kingdome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
against mankind.
But Christ by his doctrine,
and the doctrine of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
the Apostles, hath
described them by name,
hath shewed their nature,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:91:132"/>
hath set foorth their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and rage against man,
which begunne with the
first man, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from thence increase
now towardes the last
of men. Hee hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
set foorth a remedie
against all his hurt and
power, and that is euen
in this flesh which in the
first man the Diuell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.
For God will shew
to his owne glorie, and
the vtter confusion of this
proud &amp; malicious Prince,
that by that verie weake
creature, which no way
heeretofore was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to match with him,
God is able to breake his
head, if hee doe but v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and ioyne himselfe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:91:132"/>
therewith. And that of
these men which thus were
in the first man foyled
and ouercome, hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to set vp a kingdome
mighty and durable, which
shall stand invincible in
this world against the
powerfull kingdome of
Satan, and the vnpreuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
gates of hell, and
shall at last (ouercomming
these mightie enemies)
passe victorious vnto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and life euerlasting.
Euen this performe in vs
O Lord thy weake ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants:
weake in our selues,
but strong in thee. Let
thy power in vs, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
that power, which
without thee, would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
vs. And let vs
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:91:133"/>
being strengthned by thee,
march valiantly against our
enemies, being assured of
conquest, through that
mightie one who loueth
and supporteth vs.</p>

            <p>The end seemes to vs to
bee caused by the meanes,
and so at last it is; but the
end is indeed first, and most
chiefely the cause of the
meanes: for God propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his end, this end caleth
out such meanes, as shall
accomplish it selfe, so that
it causeth that to be, which
causeth it selfe. So in the
Scripture, when diuers
things happened, it is said,
that they happened, that it
might bee fulfilled, which
God had before purposed:
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:91:133"/>
so that Gods purpose was
the cause of the beeing of
those actions which fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his purpose. Therefore
if we go to the roote of the
matter, wee may perceiue
that foolishly wee reason,
when we are discontented
with the meanes, saying, If
this meanes had not beene,
this action had not come
to passe; whereas we should
reason this, If this action
had not beene appointed
to come to passe, these effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
meanes had not falne
out. Then run we to see the
true cause of things, euen
to Gods prouidence and
purpose, which to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is a sure rest and refuge,
since therby al euents must
turne to the best to Gods
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:91:134"/>
children, though effected
by the malice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of men. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of God is rooted in
Loue, and loue purposeth
all for the good of that
which it loueth: so through
whatsoeuer kinde of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it passeth, it still remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
one &amp; vnchangeable,
bringing forth stedfastly
fruit proportionable to the
roote of loue. Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
cannot be hindered or
altered by men, but passeth
along conquering and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing,
vnchanged it selfe
and changing all things, to
it selfe, and it owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
So <hi>Shimei</hi> his cursing

               <p>It is a strange thing that
in this broad day light, any
man should stumble at the
Popes supremacy in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
much lesse in temporall
matters. If with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
wee will but testifie
what we see, we on whom
the truth clearely shineth
cannot chuse but see that
this supremacy is a thing
much yonger then the
Christian Religion; which
prospered before it was,
and that much better then
since Religion was put out
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:91:135"/>
to nurse vnto it. If we will
begin with Christ, Christ
equally endoweth his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
with power of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and loosing; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
appoints al nations
vnto them. If Christ should
haue said, That on <hi>Peter</hi>
he would build his Church
(which he speaketh of him
only who only is the Rock,
1. <hi>Cor. 10.</hi>) yet <hi>Peter</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for all, should receiue
this in the behalfe of all, for
whom hee answered. For
since it was forbidden to
all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tell who Christ
was, it seemes all ioyned
with <hi>Peter</hi> in the knowledg
and confession of Christ,
and so all had interest in the
benefit of that knowledge
and confession. Againe, if
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:91:135"/>
at that time it should only
haue beene spoken only to
<hi>Peter,</hi> wee haue another
Scripture which equalleth
the other Apostles with
him, euen in the building
of the Church; while it say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
the Church is built vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the foundation of the
Apostles: so that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
are ioyned together
promiscuously, not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
towards the making
vp of the foundation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<hi>Paul</hi> plainely answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that he is not a whit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the chiefest of
the Apostles; that he had of
<hi>Peter</hi> the right hand of
fellowship, not of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority:
&amp; which most cuts
off the Pope from claiming
vs who are Gentiles by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:91:136"/>
and turnes him ouer to
fetch his especiall claime
by <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> saith that the
Apostleship of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
or Iewes was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>Peter,</hi> and of the
Gentiles especially to him:
To this <hi>Eusebius</hi> giues his
testimony, saying, that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
though co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming among
the Gentiles, yet preached
only to the Iewes, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
brings forth his first E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
as that which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
particularly to his
own charge the Iewes. And
this indeede best fitteth
with the History, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>
exercised their Apostleships
together at Rome, which
might most orderly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
if the one taught
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:91:136"/>
there the Circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; the
other the Gentiles. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let the Pope take heed
how he robs <hi>Paul,</hi> to giue
vnto <hi>Peter;</hi> for hee robbes
his best title, to giue to his
worse; but hereafter let him
find some new exposition
of building the Church so
vpon <hi>Peter;</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> also
may haue a great part in
the foundation wheron the
Church is built. Now if we
descend from the Apostles
(betweene whome if there
be any oddes in right to vs,
it appeares to be on <hi>Paules</hi>
side) to examine whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such supremacy descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from among them, to
the succeeding ages, wee
shall finde none in diuers
hundred years. The church
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:91:137"/>
of Rome indeede was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Church, founded by
the Apostles, flourishing
with godly Bishops and
Martyrs, and full of Saints;
and therefore by many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, great and large ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
were giuen to her, and
her Bishops, in letters and
writings. So might shee for
the eminencie thereof, be
called the first Church or
the chiefest Church, and
the Bishops, the Bishops of
the chiefest Church; but a
meane vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding knows
there is great oddes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
being first in order,
and a head in gouernment.
And this the practise of
those times plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
for though they had
giuen neuer so many good
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:91:137"/>
words to the Bishops and
Church of Rome, yet as
soone as the Bishop of
Rome intermedled with
their gouernment, they
prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly rose vp against him:
so did <hi>Cyprian;</hi> yea a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of African Bishops, and
among them <hi>Saint Austin,</hi>
walled vp their countrey
from the command of the
Romane Bishops. Euen in
the very matter of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
wherein is the
pretented emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their
power, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> a Bishop of
France &amp; the Popes neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
reprooued <hi>Victor,</hi> a
Bishop of Rome for exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
the Churches
of Asia vpon the obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Easter. And when
<hi>Constantinus</hi> vniustly chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:91:138"/>
                  <hi>Liberius</hi> the Bishop of
Rome for maintaining the
cause of <hi>Athanasius</hi> with
these words, How great a
part of the world art thou,
that thou alone shouldest
iustifie a wicked man, and
trouble the peace of the
world? neither <hi>Constantinus</hi>
acknowledged any supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
in <hi>Liberius:</hi> neither
did <hi>Liberius</hi> in his answer
(though hee had occasion
giuen to tell how great and
Catholike a head hee was)
thereby iustifie his doings.
To conclude, (for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
are infinite, and this
matter is commonly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;)
at length by a councel,
Christendome was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to fiue Patriarches;
of Rome, Constantinople,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:91:138"/>
Alexandria, Antioch, and
Ierusalem: of which Rome
was the first, but had no
more authoritie ouer the
rest, then the second had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the third; the authoritie
of no one being subalterne,
or subiect to other. And the
proportionable practise of
diuers of these Patriarches
yet standing, giueth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
confirmation. But the
same corruption of mans
nature, which in a clowne
stirreth vp an ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be a gentleman, of a
gentleman to become a
nobleman, and of a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to become a king; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Pope as much as in
other men, hath wrought
the same effect in him, that
it hath in others. And so
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:91:139"/>
from being a Patriarch he
hath laboured to bee the
head of the Patriarches,
that is, an vniuersall Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch;
and from being and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall
Patriarch, to be an
vniuersall Emperour. So
Ambition still ascends, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
one degree of honor,
but a stayre whereon to
mount it selfe vp to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and by this meanes at
length hee is come to that
all-comprehending toppe
wherin he meetes iust with
the title prepared for him
by <hi>Saint Paul:</hi> As God, in
the temple of God, aboue
al that is called God. But he
must remember that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
are annexed these two
other titles, the man of sin,
and the sonne of perdition.</p>

it is that there should bee
plotted and deuised an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
so grosse that it
seeth them not; that there
should bee miracles by the
diuell wrought or forged to
stand betweene the eyes of
men, and this reuealed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist:
that there should
be distinctions coined sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
enough for lesse subtill
soules, to distinguish to the
manifest Antichrist from it
selfe. Yet all these things are
prouided by the seruants of
this sonne of perdition,
and so powerfull, that it
is Gods election onely
which mainely preserues
those that stand and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:91:140"/>
this Mysterie of
Satan. And indeede how
can that ignorance, which
is inioyned to the disciples
of Rome, be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through
by them, which are bound
thereunto by a solemne
vow, and vnder feareful pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties?
They must know
but what deceiueth them,
vntill they be so throughly
deceiued, that it is almost
impossible to bee vndecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
againe. But this let
them take with it, that the
same ignorance will serue
to breede vp a man in any
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be it neuer so grosse;
and at this day it equally
serues the diuels turne to
nurse two of his goodliest
children, the erroneous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:91:140"/>
Pope. Yet lest ignorance
should faile, and perchance
a glimse of light might
shine in vpon the seeled
eies, there are miracles dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prouided to set before
the sight of men. These
draw them to say, that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Magus</hi> is the great
power of God: but wee are
taught to goe from these
signes to the Law, to the
Testimony, to the Word;
and this Word telleth vs,
that miracles in the latter
times, shall be fixed and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
companions of
the man of sin. So in stead
of conuerting vs, they are
acknowledged by vs, to be
the badge of Satan, fastned
on Antichrists sleeue, and
they tell vs to whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:91:141"/>
Wee neede no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
now, but to reueale
Antichrist; for wee beleeue
the doctrine of Christ once
fully confirmed by his own
miracles. Lastly, if yet some
greater light dazle the eies,
which neither ignorance
can keepe out, nor miracles
employ in drawing the eies
wholly to themselues; then
are there prouided subtill,
nice, and sublimated distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and reasons, whose
office is to confound and
intangle the vnderstanding
rather then to enlighten it.
Falshoods are purified and
refined, and made as like
truths, as possibly they may,
that the vndistinguishing
mind may equally accept
them, and so led by a little
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:91:141"/>
mistaking vnto a grosse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
And hereof at this time
is there a stedy forge in the
Church of Rome, which
doth but expect what the
Pope and his Priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
say, and instantly they
are ready with their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
inuentions, to prooue
it the voice of God, and not
of man. Surely the wit of
man is a powerfull thing in
regard of man; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Spirit which
made it, alas weake it is, and
the effect cannot striue
with his cause, which is
mightier then he. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Babel of mans wit
built vp against the Lord,
must needs be destroied by
the Spirit of his mouth. In
the meane time vntill this
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:91:142"/>
victory of Christ vpon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist
be fully performed,
let vs pray vnto God, that
he will adde easily vnto the
Church, those who belong
vnto him; and that they
may plainely see, that hee
who seeketh earthly things
more then heauenly, is of
the earth, earthly, and farre
from being the Deputie of
the Lord of heauen.</p>

            <p>The second resurrection
needes not to seeme very

whereas there is naturally
in vs but a carnall wisedom,
that seeth and alloweth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

for happinesse, wee haue in

blotting out the former

We haue also in stead of our

            <p>Because wee see not
God, or at lest we do not see
how he seeth vs, wee rather
thinke that he sees vs not,
or are careles of his seeing:
So our blindnesse toward
God, casteth the likenesse
of it selfe, on God towards
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:91:143"/>
vs, and imagineth him to
bee vnto vs, as we are to
him. Herein men are to
God, as some birds are to
men, who hiding their
heads from seeing men,
think that men the whilest
doe not see them. But since
the knowledge of God is
the cause of men, the being
of men can reach no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then the knowledge
of God. So whosoeuer
takes the knowledge of
God from him, takes
from himselfe his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for where the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God ceaseth to
know him, there he ceaseth

man, who is but the effect
of Gods knowledge go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then his cause, which
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:91:144"/>
cannot be. But surely God
that made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
knoweth the man
that he hath made; he hath
not placed him out of his
owne reach; but as at first
after he made his creatures,
he saw euen through them,
that they were throughly
good; so for euer, he veweth
and pierceth them, search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all things by that very
wisedom which made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Since then we are manifest

            <p>The very being as well
as the discoursing of our

prooue, that man was not
made onely for this world.
For if first it be granted, that
a great and excellent wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
created this Vniuerse
which the curious subtiltie
of the parts and frame ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
will inforce vpon vs; it
must also be belieued, that
wisedome doth all things
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:91:145"/>
wisely, both in regard of
order, and end, euery thing
bringing forth his like: now
the beasts hauing a more
easie and vninterrupted en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying
of the world, as not
tilling, or reaping, neither
building Barnes nor filling
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; not foreapprehending
griefes, nor long retaining
them? what doth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
soule in man (I
speake of the generall) if his
bound be this world, but
teach him how to labour,
how to vexe himselfe, and
how to grieue, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
how to bee more
miserable then the beasts
themselues? But a soule
more excellent then the
beasts cannot be imagined
to be giuen for this vse by
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:91:145"/>
so perfect a wisedome, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extremely contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
wisdome, that the beasts
shold serue a creature more
base and miserable then
themselues; that man shold
be both aboue them, and
below them: and that man
should haue reason, thereby
to be worse then he should
be without it. Therefore it
strongly followeth, that
this aduantage of reason
was giuen by wisedome to
man, for some aduantage of
man. And if beasts enioy
the world as much as man,
and yet man hath a soule
more excellent then they;
that this soule hath some
happines aboue the world,
which is the especiall end
and marke thereof. To this

happinesse therfore, let our
soule lift it selfe vp that it
may verily tend toward the
end thereof, that it be not a

and misery, sinking downe
below the beasts, but that
reaching beyond them, it
lay hold on that blessed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing

            <p>A dissembler &amp; hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,
is a thing most odious
to God, and so should he be
to men, especially to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
who next to God
knowes best how wicked
himselfe is. First, he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
lyer, &amp; his outward
profession, is nothing but a
continuall publisher, and
perswader of vntruth. It tels
euery one the man is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
that shewes it, and lies
all the while. This lying in
deeds, is at least as wicked
as lying in words, &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
should be hated. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the dissembler is an
idolater, for he sets man in
the place of God, and God
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:91:148"/>
in the place of man. His
best side he shewes to man,
&amp; that is his outside; and
the worst side, he turnes to
God, and that is his heart:
Accursed man that seekest
to please him who is but
thy fellow, and neglectest
him who made both thee
and him, euen the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
Lord of all things. That
God who is ielous and will
not giue his honour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
cannot but be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offended with thee, for
preferring man before him;
and to him shalt thou giue
an account for this corrup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
and withdrawing of
thy heart, Gods chiefest
part. Thirdly, the dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
is an idoll, for he being
nothing in the world sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:91:148"/>
vp to bee worshipped. By
his outward shew he calles
in the countrey to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
him for the goodnes
which is not in him, he sets
himselfe vp on horse-backe
as <hi>Haman</hi> wold haue done,
his hollow profession cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before him; This is the
man, whom God will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
But this man, the
whiles is the very man
whome God especially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
and whom with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
he will cast downe on
the threshold of hell gates,
breaking him in pieces,
when none shall deliuer
him. And this fits wel with
him, for now hee is not a
whole man; but pieces of
two men tied together, the
outward piece is a piece of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:91:149"/>
an honest man; the other
and that the greater piece,
is a piece of a Reprobate, or
rather of a diuell. Lastly, he
is a very foole, for of that
which is good hee chuseth
onely to haue the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and of that which is
naught to haue, a full and
whole possession. Thou
foole, if the shew of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
be so good, is not the
thing it selfe much more
good? &amp; if the shew of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes
be odious, is not the
wickednesse it selfe much
more odious? But thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisely
art contented to be
rotten, corrupt, and filthy,
so the world see nothing in
thee, but an outward pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of purity, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
so thou maist be to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:91:149"/>
them a perfume, thou wilt
be to thy selfe a kennel. But
rather turne from thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
and liue; get the
reall possession of that,
whereof the very appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is so beautifull and
pleasant; let the shew make
thee in loue with the thing,
&amp; get a roote to thy bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Otherwise thy vizard
shall bee pulled from thee,
and thou shalt bee stript of
thy shewes, &amp; be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for that which thou
art. Thou shalt be far away
from these whom thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentest,
and shalt be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
among such as thou art
indeede: there shal be taken
from thee, that which it
seemes thou hast, and thou
shalt bee cast into vtter
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:91:150"/>
darkenesse. Surely if to men
the looking asquint of the
eies, be ill fauoured and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant,
much more ougly
vnto God is this squinting
of the soule while it casts
the eye on goodnesse, but
the sight on wickednesse:
Therefore reconcile thy
self to thy selfe, become one
man and differ not in thy
selfe: for if thou agree with
thy selfe, bringing thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side

The hardnesse here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:91:153"/>
is, that such standing in
the place of natural parents,
should do that right to the
child in cold reason, which
the other would doe in the
heate of affection. Now
men saile with affection,
but row hard with reason,
yet the worth and reward
counteruaile the labour. It
must needs be a matter of
excellent worth: for God
is the God of the fatherles,
and hee ioyneth with God
that helpeth them; hee is
Gods instrument, and hath
a deputiship vnder God; as
for the reward, mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth
mercy, temporall, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.
Thou maist well
hope, that God who is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with thy goodnesse to
the children of others, will
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:91:154"/>
raise vp the goodnesse of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to helpe thy children;
and himselfe will become a
father vnto thee and thine.
But if thou liftest vp thy
hand against those, whom
God hath taken into his
protection, feare thou the
Iudgement without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for shewing no mercy;
and that while thou art a
very father in law to others,
God will be a father in law
to thee and thine, which
makes men of al others the
most miserable Orphans.</p>

            <p>Marriage of all naturall
actions is of most conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
yet is it the worst
done of any other. For men
doe not commonly make
marriages, but bargaines,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:91:154"/>
and the bargaine being
made, the marriage comes
in vpon the bargaine. But it
was not so from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
In the first marriage,
the woman was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
part proposed to the
man, and in her chiefly the
Kingdome of God, and the
righteousnesse thereof. So
it should be still, the great
matters of the Law should
be preferred before Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
and Mints, yet these
need not altogether to bee
neglected: howsoeuer, that
which is absolutely and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessarie, must bee held
whatsoeuer become of that
which is but conuenient.
Examples of holy Scripture
shew vs plentifully, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
issues of marriages
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:91:155"/>
made not in the Lord,
which might be so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to future times.
In the first world, wicked
wiues, euen the daughters
of flesh and blood, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the sonnes of God,
brought in the Flood. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
the most wise of
onely men, <hi>Solomon,</hi> by ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
wiues, was bowed
aside to the worship of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
from the seruice of the
true God, who appeared to
him twice: wherefore God
did rent his kingdom from
him, and gaue it to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant.
But a spectacle of
long miserie, and as long
wickednesse, was that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
marriage betweene
the sonne of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> and
the daughter of <hi>Ahab;</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:91:155"/>
was <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> himselfe
drawne into danger and
losse, and into the cause of
them, worse then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
euen to the loue of
them which hated God.
Thereby the sonne of <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat,</hi>
yea his sonnes sonne
became wicked and vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
generations, this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
waiting on their sins;
for the one had the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Ahab</hi> to wife, and the
other was counselled by his
mother to doe wickedly.
Let men therefore be afraid
to infect themselues and
their posterity, by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
one flesh with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse;
to marry vnto a
leprosie of the soule is worse
then into that of the body.
A woman is a needle to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:91:156"/>
pierce into the heart and
affections of man, and if
she be wicked, the diuell is
the thread which followes
after. This knowes the
tempter right well, therfore
by <hi>Eue</hi> hee got within <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi>
by <hi>Dalilah</hi> hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Samson;</hi> by the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Moab,</hi> he got power
on the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> to
inspire into them idolatrie,
one of his chiefest poisons.
Therefore let no man for
money take vnto him a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
for the diuell, lest
thereby the diuel attended
with the curse of God,
(which euer followes him)
enter in vpon him and his
posteritie. The remainder
of flesh in the best regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
though but a part of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:91:156"/>
him, is alreadie too great a
friend to our greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie;
let vs not adde to this
fleshly part a whole body
of flesh to increase the
griefe and incombrance of
the Spirit of God in vs, and
to increase the force of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and of his temptations
against vs. But let them
that do so, know, that they
seek the ruine of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
by the same meanes, by
which they seeke to raise
them. For though Satan
bee a strong man able to
keepe a house in peace, yet
there is a stronger then he,
who often bindeth this
strong man, and taketh his
house from him; or if hee
leaue it to him still to bee
maintained (as indeed hee
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:91:157"/>
is allowed to be a kind of a
Prince in this world) yet
miserable is that standing,
and worse then falling,
which stands by Satan; for
there comes a day wherein
his principalitie it selfe shall
fall and bee ouerthrowne,
and al that it doth sustaine.
And in the meane time,
what a bettering of an
house is this, to increase the
liuing, and to corrupt the
liuers? to grow outwardly
in wealth, and to decay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in grace and vertue?
to lose in our selues, &amp; our
posterity, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> we may adde to
the estate of our selues, and
our posteritie? The true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of marriages was the
first, made by God himselfe;
and therefore to be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:91:157"/>
by the children of God:
therin God gaue man a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
fit for him; fit she was to
help him in spiritual things,
euen the seruice of God, &amp;
fit to help him in temporal
things, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those of this life.
Such is <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> wife described by
<hi>Salomon,</hi> fit to do her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
good al the daies of her life:
good to his soule, good to
his body; for she feareth the
Lord, &amp; therfore is praised.
This paterne being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
wee may certainely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that he which allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and blessed the first, will
also allow and blesse all
those which are like it. He
will behold such a marriage
with pleasure, while it is
making; he will be present
at it, for his good will was
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:91:158"/>
principally sought in it; and
he will prosper it, that men
shall haue cause to say; Lo,
thus shall the man bee bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that feareth the Lord.
But because goodnesse in
any sexe is ouer rare; and it
may seeme a hard matter to
get one, that may fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
the patterne; first, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
whose gift a good
wife is, and seeke to him,
from whom commeth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good gift. Surely it is to
be feared, that many haue
bestowed themselues ill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they sought not to
him, who onely could haue
bestowed them well, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they sought him
more for outward aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
then for inward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Secondly, if thou hast
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:91:158"/>
done this, and yet thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
not that one among a
thousand; and need so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
that thou must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in thy purpose: when
thou canst not get a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
lamp, get thee a smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
flax, if not one that is
expert, and by long custom
exercised and vsed to strong
meate, yet one that desires
the sincere milke of the
Word to grow thereby.
Take one that is likely to
become a Temple for the
holy Ghost, and this likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
find not in thine own
presumption, but in her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
That this may be
really performed, let vs first
discerne a mind teachable,
and willing to learne. It is
a first and chiefe step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:91:159"/>
God, to hearken after
God. Therefore wisedome
euer begins her speech with
this; Heare yee children,
and incline your eares to
wisdome, and, He that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
is wise, and wil increase
in learning. Next, let her be
humble and meek; for such
a spirit is a fit receptacle for
God, it is before God a
thing much set by, and to
such, God will reueale his
secret mysteries. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
man is weake, and his
affections rob him of his
iudgement, making him to
thinke that partie excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
to whom hee hath an
excessiue affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Let God
bee instantly sought to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
weake and deceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
man; let him be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:91:159"/>
that he wil not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to that, which much
concerneth his glory and
seruice, and the good of his
seruants. And these things
thus ordered, strong hope
may be conceiued, that he
who heard <hi>Abrahams</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
when hee intreated a
wife for his Masters sonne,
will giue such a wife as shee
was to the sonnes of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi>
and he who gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ruth</hi> a mighty man of
wealth, and one blessed of
the Lord, because she resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that the God of Israel
should be her God; will also
giue the like blessing vnto
the followers of <hi>Ruth.</hi> But
while I sing the Songs of
Sion in a strange land, the
Chaldea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s or wizards of this
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:91:160"/>
world vnderstand not the
language; the naturall man
perceiueth not the things
of God, neither can Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by any meanes make
him leaue a good bargaine.
Therefore will hee still in
spight of heauen, marry his
land to his neighbors great
portion: I meane his Son,
that would perchance bee
better then himselfe, to his
neighbors daughter, which
perchance will make him, if
she can, worse then the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
These exchangers of
money by bargaines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated
in the Temple,
since the Word (which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
the house of God
to bee made a denne of
theeues) cannot driue them
thence, it may he a whip of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:91:160"/>
cords will. And surely in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
daies experience, such
a one is laid soundly on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their backes. And
therein a twofold cord, that
breaketh both bones and
hearts is especially remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
One is the often dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
betweene such vnhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
or at least, vnequall
parties. Religion is the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and strongest bond of
loue; where that failes, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is next, which is most
corrupt. Nature delightes
in new lusts, and so runnes
after that which it hath not,
neglecting what it hath.
Hence hath that cursed
speech issued from one of
her followers: That hee
could loue his wife aboue
any other, if shee were not
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:91:161"/>
his wife; making that a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of hatred, which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
makes chiefly a reason
of loue. And when this loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the partie posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
hath brought forth the
desire of another, and that
desire, obtaining; what hart
is then great inough to
beare the vexing and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
thoughts that
swell therein by this forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king?
if it be the wiues part,
as most often it is, shee still
beholdeth with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the lothing of her selfe,
the losse of her right in him
for whom she forsooke all
others, and his giuing of
himself away to a stranger.
These meditations eate vp
her heart, and then she cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the time of her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:91:161"/>
and all them that
made it. When this newes
commeth home to the
churle her father, he doubts
at last his daughter is cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
which he might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
haue doubted before,
and much more profitably,
for then he could haue hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
it. And now when she
sitteth as a Nun forsaken of
the world, breaking her
owne heart, and somewhat
her fathers; miserie beateth
into them, that instruction
could not teach them; that
marriages made without
God, are wordes, not acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
since such a woman
hath had much money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on her to bee called
a wife, and yet shee hath no
husband. Another cord
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:91:162"/>
wherewith this kind of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
whippeth it self is, when
the partie which was taken
into this match for the
greatnesse of estate, by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
wasteth the estate
which onely made the
match. This to the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
father, is the worst di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce;
for hee married his
daughter to the wealth, not
to the man, and that wealth
is separated from her. After
this, the man is found, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to bee wicked, which
he was indeed before, but
his wealth gaue his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
such a golden luster,
that couetousnesse could,
or would not see what it
saw: but now neglected
wickednesse begetting po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:91:162"/>
makes him odious,
whom wickednesse could
not, and the robbed child is
returnable to the parents
wanting another portion
for maintenance. In this
case also, religion would
haue been a remedie, which
takes men, though not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustfull
and vnbeleeuing,
yet prouident for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.
These be the stripes
of gracelesse marriages,
which afflict both the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
parties and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and would, if obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
teach wisedome good
cheape to others, as they
dearely and deepely haue
imprinted it into these. But
this is the pitty, that mony
is so pleasant and glorious
a thing, that it casteth Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:91:163"/>
on euery person
that hath it, be he neuer so
base; and the yong womans
father hath his thoughts so
cheared therewith, that he
must needs hope the best
of his sonne in law, though
nothing but money giue
him such aduice; wherefore
it is yet to bee feared, that
many gazing &amp; gaping on
wealth, wil follow it so close,
that they shall stumble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same ditches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they haue seene many of
their neighbors wallowing.
This makes sport for the
diuel, and thus is man most
truly fayry-led, euen led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
by the spirits of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
into the wandring
waies of <hi>Balaam</hi> the sonne
of <hi>Beor,</hi> who made Israel to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:91:163"/>
sinne. But this makes bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
lamentation, euen the
mourning for sonnes and
daughters in the Church of
God; for hereby hath the
Church lost many, both
sonnes and daughters, some
being turned from a good
profession, others being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
bred in Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,
hauing no difference
from heathen, but onely in
the saying of a <hi>Pater noster,</hi>
a Creede, and it may bee,
the ten Commandements.
Therfore the Church takes
vp her complaint, and in
sorrow of heart cries out:
The Nation is increased,
but her ioy is diminished,
there are children borne
but not to her; therefore
as <hi>Rachel</hi> she praieth, Giue
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:91:164"/>
me children or else I die, or
else with <hi>Rahel</hi> she weepeth
and will not bee comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

yea of naturall things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

confession of hidden and

ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed is a great

misery, &amp; folly reignes
in the world; and he must
know into what kinde of

learne on what conditions
he doth liue. Thirdly he
must see the impotence
and weakenesse of man, to
lift himselfe aboue himself,
and to adde one cubite yea
one finger to the height of

he can get very little
aboue the ignorance, or the

this knowledge is not that

            <head>69</head>
            <p>To perceiue and finde
the truth of Christ, we must
not looke into our selues,
but into Christ and the
doctrine wherein he is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
and which he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
For if we looke into
our selues, we can see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in our selues, that
may prooue the gift of
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:91:166"/>
Christ vnto vs. We may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
see, that we neede those
effects, which by Christ are
performed, euen redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and regeneration; but
that the Sonne of God
should take vpon him the
nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to effect this,
in our selues wee cannot
finde. For first, man was
created without any neede,
or helpe of this incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and therefore there was
no instinct of such a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
planted in him at his
creation, as there was of the
Deity. Againe, man being
falne, he could not see any
perfect way out of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie,
as appeareth at this
day among the Heathen
that know not Christ.
Thirdly, were man neuer so
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:91:166"/>
intelligent, yet being but a
creature, which cannot
comprehend his Creator,
how could man compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this mystery, which
was a secret purpose flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of the vnsearchable
will of God, whose Spirit
none knowes but his owne
spirit? so that what issueth
therefrom, is such as the
eye hath not seene, the eare
hath not heard, nor the
heart of man conceiued;
and among these principall
is this mysterie of our salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Christ. Wherefore
going out of our selues, and
not seeking Christ in our
owne wisedome, which
comprehendeth him not,
let vs goe to him and to his
doctrine; and therein wee
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:91:167"/>
shall finde admirable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
excellent iustice,
deepe mercy, infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
perfect holinesse, and in
summe a mysterie becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
God as the Author of
it, and fitting aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the miserie of decaied
and wretched man. If we
looke into this mystery, we
shall see him restoring man,
by whom man was made,
and who better then he?
we shall see man die for the
sinne of man, &amp; how could
Gods iustice bee otherwise
satisfied, there hauing been
a vow that man should die
when he did eate? We shall
see the Spirit of puritie
which first made man to
Gods image, renewing and
sanctifying him aboue the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:91:167"/>
first strength. We shall see a
Law of perfect holinesse
taught and prescribed by
Christ, fit for God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and for man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to his God. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
Christ bringeth vs to
the presence of God our
Soueraigne good, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vs in the way from
our ouer-mightie aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the diuels and their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
whom also at last he
wholly suppresseth. These
things are in the doctrine
of Christ: Things necessary
to bee done for the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of man, but not done at
all, if not done by Christ;
for in no other wee finde
them performed. And if we
looke into some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of this doctrine, we
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:91:168"/>
shall finde that Christ was
prophecied of inparadise by
God: in Egypt by <hi>Iacob,</hi> in
Iudea by the Prophets, the
Iewes the enemies of Christ
confirming it. Besides, the
story of the fall we finde fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to agree with our present
condition, and that is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
onely in that storie
wherein also Christ, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of the fall is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Wherefore one issuing
from God, the other also
hath the authoritie of the
same reporter. And though
Christ haue no need of the
diuels acknowledgement,
yet their testimony may
serue against themselues;
and it was from below if
not from aboue, that the
<hi>Sibyl</hi> cited by <hi>Virgil</hi> foretold
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:91:168"/>
of Christ: Christ being on
earth, was confessed by the
diuels; and wicked spirits
at this day trading with
witches, seek to draw them
from Christ to themselues.
Lastly, the prophecies of
Christ himselfe concerning
Ierusalem, concerning the
succession of his owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
of his disciples and
beleeuers, became true in
the euent, and as it was
prophecied, to this religion
and doctrine the diuell op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
himselfe aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

it was aboue all other,

God beginneth with the

Gospell: but the diuell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
with the Gospel, and
ends in the Law. God saith,
When ye eate ye shall die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Christ to restore him.
The diuel saith, ye shall not
die at all; yet when man (by
his temptation being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
mortall) should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
by Christ, he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to kill that Christ
which was to be the life of
them, whom he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that they should not

we sinne he saith to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

And to them that sinne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

remaines no more sacrifice

we must cure our selues by

is contrary to Satans. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of faults and errours,
they desire to raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
aboue the writer. But
I must borrow leaue here
to vse the words of Christ,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:91:170"/>
I tell you the Publican re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes

then the Pharisie: The

the proud Scribe, and the

with <hi>Mary</hi> hath made the
better choise, there beeing
no comparison betweene
the increase of life eternall,
and the puffing vp of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
and vaine glory.
Wherefore let vs couet the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:91:171"/>
best gifts, and though wee
need not put out our eies,
not to discerne faults when
we meet them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it is both
needlesse, foolish, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to vse our eyes to that
purpose onely or chiefely.
But the whole and chiefe
ayme of man in all things,
beeing the kingdome of
God and the righteousnes
thereof, let him in reading
keepe that still fixed before
him, as his especiall marke,
fitting and leuelling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
euery thing that will
serue to this end. If thou
meetest with errors in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
thou maist warne
thy selfe &amp; others of them;
but if onely with slips of
infirmitie, couer them to
thy selfe and others, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

that thou also art a

thy selfe &amp; others. For that
which is read by an vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
sweetned and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with humility and
charitie, discouers to such a
reader the whole beautie,
treasure and goodnesse it
hath, and bestoweth all on
him. But to the proud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitor,
it hideth much of
itselfe, being vailed and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
with an apparance of
euill cast vpon it by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

            <p>A setled and resolued
purpose to bee rich, is the
fountaine of infinite euils.
For this resolution once
being fixed, presently the
eyes, and the eares are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into meere intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and suruaiors. They
are wholly imployed to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:91:172"/>
seeke &amp; search whatsoeuer
lyeth fit, and whatsoeuer is
profitable; And withall the
heart greedily stands ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to deuoure whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of this fit and profitable
comes within reach. The
difference of things (as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
&amp; vnlawfulnesse)
is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away; for the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
&amp; eagernesse of the desire
digests all alike into nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
as a mightie Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
doth meates both
raw and rosted. It is a heart-breaking,
not to adde som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
continually; and if
<hi>Nabothes</hi> Vineyard come
not, being called for, it is
death to looke vpon it.
What though the getting
of it cost the death of the
owner, yet the couetous
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:91:173"/>
man must saue the life of
his lust; and indeede his
owne life, which he saies,
profiteth him not, except
he satisfie his lust. Hence it
is so many widdowes grone
toward heauen for the help
which they cannot haue
on earth, so many father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
children are ready to
die in the streetes for want
of bread; and so many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined,
sacked, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacked
families, being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
from their own homes
wander vp and downe to
seeke a couering for their
heads from raine and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest.
Iustly therefore that
holy Apostle and out of
diuine inspiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
this as an infallible and
neuer failing positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: They
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:91:173"/>
that will be rich, fall into
temptation and snares, and
into many foolish and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
lusts which drowne
men in perdition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
And how can it
be otherwise? The end and
marke being fixed, the eye
is still ayming, &amp; the hands
are still working toward
that end: And this end be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
riches, and not God (for
a man cannot serue two
masters) thither tend the
whole endeauours of the
hungry &amp; couetous soule.
If an vniust profit bee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
or rather vnoffered
may bee hooked; the eye
lookes on riches, and not
on God: and accordingly
God &amp; his will being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
riches are taken
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:91:174"/>
howsoeuer displeasing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. God must beare
with him; for hee must bee
rich. That plot must go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the resolution is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
God must giue place, he
doth not see it, or will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
forgiue it. But
whiles thou not seeing, or
at least not regarding God,
thinkest God therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not thee; he sees thee
verily, and will bring forth
thy workes of darkenesse
into light euen starke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and they shall bee thy
perdition and destruction.
But rather breake in pieces
this thy resolution, O man
of earth, whosoeuer thou
art. Fasten not thy soule to
riches which are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of thy soule; neither
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:91:174"/>
make them thy marke and
end, which were made for
thee: know thou that God
alone is thy end, and thou
art made to serue him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that God is thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and it is thy only feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to enioy him: that God
is thy chiefest treasure, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fixe thy heart resolued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on him, remoouing it
from riches. Change thy
couetous, and be strongly
couetous after God, and
by godlines, euen faith and
a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science draw him
more and more into thee:
and so godlinesse shall be to
thee the greatest gaine, for
it shal get thee the best trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
As for riches, make no
couenant with them, fasten
not thy heart on them, lest
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:91:175"/>
withall thou fasten thy hart
to many noisome lusts, to
many cares, and finally, to
perdition it selfe. The holy
and most quiet way is to
put contentednesse in the
place of couetousnesse, and
then godlines will appeare
that which it is, euen the
greatest gaine. This thou
shalt the better doe, if thou
consider the ende of thy
creation, that man was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
not to be rich, neither
is that the busines appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him by his Creator: But
the Creator himselfe is the
end of man; neither hath
the Creator made any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
that a man should
be rich: for foode and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and satisfaction of
naturall necessities, is his
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:91:175"/>
chiefest drift and purpose
of worldly things. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the last iudgement
when it shall be demanded
of thee, how thou hast
spent thy time in the world,
and what thou hast done
there; shalt thou not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
then to say, I haue
there done all that I could
doe to bee rich? For then
shall that plainly appeare,
which now is true, though
not appearing: The man
hath mistaken his busines,
that onely studieth riches;
for then it shall bee said to
the couetous, That man
was not made to bee a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
of mettall, nor a filler
of bags, nor a ioyner of
hedge to hedge; much lesse
to be a prowling vermine, a
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:91:176"/>
rauening wolfe, or a roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Lyon to deuoure
the weake, the distressed
and the helpelesse. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of our naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
as vnderstanding,
or strength, in lawfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to procure mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for our selues and our
families, shal then be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For this maintenance
is the supportation of Gods
Church in this vale of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
and so tendeth to
God. But a desire of riches
for themselues, or for the
outward glory of them,
and that setled purpose to
be rich, shall be condemned
in the great and terrible day
of the Lord; and then chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in condemnation, and
of any of their ranke next
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:91:176"/>
the diuell in torment shall
they bee, that haue made a
prey of miserie; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
miserie is to goodnesse a
ground of mercy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
these haue made it a
ground of oppression, so
adding sorrow to afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
making miserie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was somewhat
wretched, perfectly misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
To these shall also the
perfection of miserie be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for a portion, euen
pure and cleare iudgement,
without the mixture of any
mercy; and so their owne
measure for qualitie being
returned to them, (but in a
farre greater quantitie) they
shall then taste how bitter
the cup is, which they haue
giuen others to drinke; and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:91:177"/>
they shall by experience,
but helpelesse and remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
know the grieuousnes
of their owne workes. And
because this day is by such
put farre from them, and
they comfort themselues in
the delay of it, let them
know also, that some sinnes
are partly iudged afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
euen in this world:
And among them, very
commonly, the sinne of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
For often is it
seene, that the fathers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
hath been powred
out on his owne sonne; and
riches gotten wrongfully

wrongfully taken from
them, for whom they were

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:91:177"/>
iudgement, and in meere

the goods of wrong and

For vengeance and they

that still inuenteth

to present occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Among diuers other
changes, hee changeth his
persecutions, a principall
part of his battering ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
When God lets him
loose, then hee sheweth the
whole malice of his nature,
hee appeares in the very

frieth, burneth men,
made vp in the likenesse of

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:91:178"/>
muzles and binds him, that
hee cannot bite, nor teare
with his teeth, and his
clawes, then he putting off
the Lyon, vseth the craft
and tongue of the Serpent;
euen malicious cunning, to
fret into the Church of
God, and vndermine it by
little and little. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at this time of outward
peace, he sets his malignant
souldiers among vs newly
on work, especially in three
things, which though they
are become somewhat fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shionable,
yet be they very
mischieuous to the Church
of God. A first is to put
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt on the Ministery,
which are Gods Colony on
earth to keepe his subiects
in obedience, and to beate
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:91:179"/>
off the enemies; the Salt
that keepes men sauourie
and vntainted of Satan; the
shepheards which keep the
sheep from the wolfe: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if these may be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
discouraged, or taken
away, how must not the
Church of God become a
prey? How neere is Satan
then to a full principalitie
on earth? Yet these are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly
afflicted, debased and
troden downe. I passe by
their owne mutual harmes,
which as griefe wishes
might neuer haue bin, that
they might neuer haue bin
spoken of; so now it desires
to couer with silence. But
the lay seruants of Satan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
them diuers waies.
And first they let flie at the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:91:179"/>
very calling it selfe, by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Ministerie into an
ignominy and reproch. If a
man be a Minister, he hath
deserued at the next quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
pickt at him, to be cald
pild Priest. And when this
is done, it is to be thought
hee hath beene cald worse
then rescall, euen as <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, the very scumme of
the earth. But where liue
we the whilest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and among
what people? It is thought
among Christians. But
are they Christians that
thus tread downe those
messengers of Christ, which
outwardly by Baptisme
make them such Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as they are, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the word, make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christians then they are
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:91:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet? Are they Christians
that being begotten by spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
fathers, will raile on
their fathers that begat
them? surely it shewes they
were neuer truly begotten.
A Christian honoureth
Christ, by whom hee bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> name of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He
honoreth him so, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
bringeth Christ to
him, and him to Christ, hee
honoureth them also. Christ
himselfe was a Preacher,
and the founder of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie:
if thou then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisest
the Ministerie, thou
despisest the very function
of Christ, and the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ; yea, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisest
Christ himselfe, and
then without question thou
despisest thy owne saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:91:180"/>
Take heed therfore thou
run not against this sacred
Priesthood of the Gospell,
for it is rocky; and whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
runneth against it, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
himselfe in pieces. It is
rockie, for Christ the rocke
is the foundation of it; and
what is built on it, is rocky,
as <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Petra.</hi> But
some will say, They despise
not the Ministers for their
office, but their liues; and
consequently not the good
but the bad. Surely as this
on the one side, preferres a
petition to the reuerend
Fathers, to admit, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
none of scandalous
life, so otherwise it giues vs
this answere; that these are
<hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> more mannerly kind of
men that so say; for there is
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:91:181"/>
a number, which if they see
but a man in black, in their
brauery come off presently,
There goes a Priest; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the meaning is, There
goes a man of contempt,
<hi>per excellentiam.</hi> But if thou
which excusest, despisest
onely the men, why castest
thou a reflex of thy malice
on the calling, by reuiling
him with the name of a
Priest, as with a reproch?
VVhat is the chaffe to the
wheate? Is he euill? He can
neuer defile that excellent
calling, though hee may
scandall it; the euill is from
himself, not from his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie:
yea, the Ministerie is
good, though tied to an ill
person; therefore is not the
Ministerie of a good man
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:91:181"/>
any way within reproach
for the faults of a bad one.
Let his person beare his
faults, and not the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which is not the cause of
them; Let him beare it him
selfe, and not other righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
men with him, which
hate his conditions honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

for God, and he is counted
mad or base if he will turne
Minister. But know, thou
puffe of flesh and bloud
whosoeuer thou art, that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:91:182"/>
the seruice of God is the
end of man, and there is no
man good inough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
imployment in his
seruice much lesse to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
it. Thy meanes are
giuen thee for helpes, and
aduancements in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
not for discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and he that made
both them and thee, lookes
for glory to himself of both
and that with al thy might,
not ease and idlenesse only
to thy selfe. If thou haue
gifts for such a seruice, and
imployest them not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
thou that wouldest
not serue his mercy, shalt
serue his iustice, and the tree
that would not beare fruit
in his field, shall beare the
fire in the place of torment.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:91:182"/>
Why cumbreth it the
ground? Hew it downe and
cast it into the lake that
burneth for euer. It is a due,
and necessarie course for
parents concerning their
sonnes, and sonnes when
they come to iudgement
concerning themselues, to
waigh and consider where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
and in what way such
sonnes are most fit and able
to serue and glorifie their
Maker. In that way let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be placed, for it is a way of
safetie, protection &amp; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse.
Any way besides
that, is a way of dragons, it
is the broadway, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to destruction. If this
were obserued, God should
haue the due vse of his own
creatures. Many Alehouses,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:91:183"/>
play-houses, yea many Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets
would be emptie that
now are filled; mechanicall
soules should not so oft be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Ministers, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
&amp; able soules wold not
so oft turne Lawyers, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
yea earth wormes,
and Priests of Mammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet
blessed be God, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  </hi> hath not
giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al times &amp; places ouer
to this high Treason &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity;
for eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nobles who
now too much behold this
profession a far of, haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by seruing
a greater King the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any they

creepe to serue Gentlemen
of great possessions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

God with their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:91:183"/>
&amp; imployed it in the
Ambassage of the most
High. And no maruaile, for
if we plainly knew &amp; saw,
what a glorious King our
god is; what a pretious thing
a soule is, what the truth, not
the name of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were,
we should account it a high
dignitie, to be imployed by
God in his busines; a great
gaine to turne one soule to
righteousnes; &amp; a right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
&amp; natural duty of a true
Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to resigne himselfe
ouer wholly to Christ to be
bestowed by him in any
function, since he is his, by
couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; marke,
&amp; not his own any longer.
Be it therefore a law for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to the vpright of heart,
that a good Minister is an
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:91:184"/>
honourable man, being an
Ambassadour of Christ, a
successor of Christ, a factor
for the King of heauen, to
returne soules the most
pretious Iewels into his
kingdome of glory; and
howsoeuer, they are here
couered with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temt, they
shall breake out in the daies
of glory shining like the
Sunne, as hauing turned
many soules to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But that honour may
continue safe to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
God perswade them
to bestow that labour in the
word and doctrine, which
deserueth double honour;
to liue as those that adorne
the Gospell of Christ; and
themselues to bee humble,
rather receiuing honour,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:91:184"/>
then snatching at it. For
honour is best deserued,
when it is least intended;
to seeke our owne glory is
no glory; and to honour
our selues, is no true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

               <p>Another new engine of
Satan is the impouerishing
of the Ministery. The diuell
knowes that the Minister
hath a bodie, which must
bee maintained by bodily
sustenance, and where this
sustenance is not, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
the Minister continue.
Heretofore when diuinitie
was inspired, not studied:
an Apostle though his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

of his wages, might bestow
his worke without any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:91:185"/>
and get wages by the
work of his hands; But now
the study of diuinitie chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
the whole time of
a man, so that a Diuine can
hardly mingle any other
calling with it, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury
vnto it. Therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that only function, by
that &amp; for that he must be
sufficiently sustained; so is
there absolutely no hope of
a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual Ministery, where
there is not a continued
maintenance. Then how
many waies haue these last
times holpen the diuell to
breake off and discontinue
the Ministerie? It is too wel
known that the bellies of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi>
friers 1. began to rob both
the back &amp; the belly of the
Ministery. And that when
these theeues were arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:91:185"/>
&amp; conuicted, the goods
were not restored to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

so hereby many miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of the ordinary means of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

euen a hart-breaking consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
it is, to them that
haue any fellow-feeling of
the misery of those, who lie
in the bondage of Satan,
when they see many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
like lampes without

How ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there preach,

How can they beleeue

that except he be taught to

               <p>But this disease being
shewed, what remedie is
there for it? Surely the Lord
of the haruest being first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
in heauen, there
seeme two remedies on
earth; one is Law, another,
Conscience. But how shall
there be any hope in Law,
since it is Law that hath
done the hurt? Surely as a
Law begotten in the times
of ignorance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath hurt the
Church, so a Law borne in
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:91:187"/>
the times of knowledge
may heale it. Let vs shew
our faith by our works, and
shame the workes which
haue beene done without
faith by exceeding them; if
wee haue the light of the
Gospell, let vs make statutes
of light, and not continue
the lawes of darkenesse. If
wee feele any comfort of
light in our selues, let vs
with our blessed Sauiour
pittie them that sit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and in the shaddow
of death. I separate law
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conscience; for though
conscience bee the truest
fountaine of lawes, yet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke
consideration is very
often the cause of them.
Now it is not the worst po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie,
but indeed the best, to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:91:187"/>
lay a sure foundation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in the hearts of the
people. For from true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
groweth the strongest
branch of obedience: true
religion hath wherewithall
to confute treason, though
masked in a vizard of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It will allow the Pope
few subiects in another
mans Realme: It will keepe
them for the right owner.
In summe, the end of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
being the Church,
and the end of the Church,
the glorie of God by faith
and holinesse; how doth
that kingdom pierce it selfe
through with many darts,
that suffereth this faith and
holinesse, the life and soule
thereof, to bee slaine by
wickednesse and vnbeliefe?
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:91:188"/>
Surely there is a fulnesse of
sinnes, which is the greatest
rebellion in the world, for
it ouerthrowes kingdomes,
and lets out Vineyards to
new husbandmen. This do
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and bewaile; <hi>Ieroboam</hi>
cursing the basenesse of his
new deuised Priesthood,
and <hi>Ahab</hi> defying the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of men, it being a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
to destruction, to bee
politicke against God. But
if it be demanded whence
such maintenance shold be
raised? Surely for worldly
and temporall ends, the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of huge summes by
Parliament, are well impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and contentedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued;
&amp; is there no way
to raise one summe for the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:91:188"/>
God of heauen? When
<hi>Moses</hi> prouided for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
there was offering
euen to abundance. When
<hi>Dauid</hi> prouided for the
Temple, there were many
thousand Talents offered
willingly, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
heart. VVhy should
not we much more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contribute toward the
building, not of Temples
made of hands, but of the
liuing Temple and Church
of the euerliuing God? If a
towne bee destroyed with
fire, all men take pitty on
the ruine thereof, and from
that pittie issureth reliefe.
When whole Townes and
Parishes are besieged with
hell fire, how do we not pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
&amp; succour such spirituall
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:91:189"/>
desolations? Then let that
place which made the law
of substraction, redeeme it
by making a law of retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by some diuine
subsidie granted to the
King of heauen, regaine
part, or all of the ancient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the Church, or
procure some new susten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the stead thereof.
But if mens hearts shall
herein be generally harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
against God, against the
soules of their brethren,
yea, against their owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
and denie this iust
and necessarie helpe: Let
those that are merciful, and

expresse this excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:91:189"/>
the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds which the Leuits

him, who beheld euen them

and said vnto them, Liue.
Let co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science remedy what

by the working of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone

Accordingly should it bee
a sweet smelling Sacrifice,
acceptablie ascending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the presence of God;
if those who are both
spirituallie and temporally
rich, should out of their
spirituall treasurie, send
foorth that most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
charitie, which might
conuert some of their
temporall and transitorie
treasure to this soule-sauing
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:91:190"/>
end. Herunto God through
mee doth beseech them, as
inwardly no doubt he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the same vnto them
by his spirit. Obedience to
God and his spirit is the
most excellent offring, and
a soule turned to God, is the
ioy of heauen; but propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
quenching the
spirit by disobedience, is a
heauie sinne; and too quiet
suffering of the death of
soules, where means would
giue hope of life, is the gall
of bitternesse, and the stone
of the heart. Our Aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
did set vp both Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and Churchliuings, a
great and a large work was
performed by them; we are
but to keep in reparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
they haue built. Indeed this
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:91:190"/>
ouer boystrous tempest hath
ouerthrowne a great piece
of this building, yet but a
piece, not by many degrees
so great, as that work which
they raised. If they haue
done all, it is a shame wee
should not doe something;
wee should rather bee glad
(though not of the cause,
yet of this effect) that there
is matter left for our chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to expresse it selfe in this
kind; and to let blind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
know, that, if our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
had not founded
such spiritual maintenance,
it might and should yet
haue bin done by vs. There
are many godly &amp; deuout
persons, who haue in these
daies of light, made and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
dwellings &amp; portions
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:91:191"/>
for the bodies of the poore
and needy. Excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is this worke, it is a
blessed thing to giue, and
blessed are they that feede
the hungrie, and clothe the
naked. But yet of all Almes
houses, the spiritual Almes-house
is the best, and <hi>Paul</hi>
that willeth you to desire
the best gifts, would haue
you vse your gifts to the
best aduantage. Wherefore
I shew you a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
way. As the soule is
infinitely better then the
bodie, and life eternall, then
life present, so the food of
the soule is farre better then
that of the body, and the
sauing of the spirituall life
better then the preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the temporall life. If
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:91:191"/>
thou giuest to the body,
thou dost well, but thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
to that which shall die:
but if thou giue to the
soule, thou dost better, for
thou giuest to that, which
by thy gift may liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
in happines, and make
the body liue for euer in the
same blisse with it. If thou
giue naturall bread, thou
dost well; but thou giuest
that which perisheth with
the vsing: but thou most
resemblest Christ thy head,
and giuest the best Almes,
when thou giuest the bread
of heauen. What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
and ioyfull thing
to thy soule and heart
will it be to see a whole
Congregation fed on Gods
holy day with thy Almes?
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:91:192"/>
to see many soules recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
saluation as it were
from thy hand, to heare
many blesse &amp; glorifie God
for his gifts to thee, &amp; thine
to them? yea to blesse thee
therefore in the name of
the Lord? Surely such ioy is
infinitely better, sounder,
and fuller of waight, then
the ioy of mony, corne, and
oyle; but the ioy that God
shall giue thee in the great
marriage day, in the day of
the gladnes of thy heart, in
that day will againe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
exceed this. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shal
Christ say vnto thee, come
thou blessed of my Father;
for when I was hungry, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and cold in the very
soule of my little ones,
thou diddest buy Manna,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:91:192"/>
long white robes &amp; fire of
the Altar, to feede, cloth &amp;
warme me; thou gauest the
best gifts, and which most
nearely and inwardly che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
me, therefore shalt thou
haue the best reward; come
and sit nearest vnto me. But
if some backeward &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
hearts in whome
God hath no delight, put
this grace and glory from
themselues, by a perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that this businesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
them not, but that
euery horse should beare
his owne burthen, and each
congregation maintaine a
Preacher for themselues:
Let them know, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
men not vsed to instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for want of it, haue
no desire to it: Things not
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:91:193"/>
known are vnsought, much
lesse will a naturall man
part from things knowne
for things vnknowne. It is
the propertie of teaching
to make men desire to be
taught: expect not then this
desire from them, which
haue not the meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it; the sweetnesse of
the word must be first soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their eares, before
they will loue the sound
thereof: it must teach them
the worth of it selfe, before
they will part from any of
their worth for it. He must
be partly or wholly a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
man, that hungers for
spirituall foode vnto the
losse of his temporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
and how shall many
such be expected where the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:91:193"/>
word, by which the spirit
entereth, hath not bin fitly
opened vnto them? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if thou wilt haue them
doe for themselues, do thou
something first, though but
a little for them whereby
they may heare the word:
And then it is likely the
word heard will make way
for it selfe, and perswade for
increase of maintenance;
for it perswades the truly
sanctified to a farre greater
degree, euen to fell all, to
giue life &amp; all, for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of happinesse Christ
Iesus; whome lying more
closely in the Cabinet of
the word, preaching deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
vnto vs opened and
displaied in full glorie and
Lustre. Yea it may bee by
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:91:194"/>
the word so communicated
by thee, there wil be some
prouoked, to doe that for
others which thou hast
done for them; and so a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of goodnesse may
bee continued of which
thou hast beene the father;
and a chaine of good works
may be lengthned, of which
the first linke framed by
thee, is both the beginning
and cause. Hereunto may
be added this other reason
of forrein helpe; That such
places beare already as
great a burden without the
benefite of preaching as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do that haue it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>Saint Pauls</hi> rule of

their throats to the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
and thou hast done
worse then slaine them; for
thou killest them with
death eternall. Christ hath
said, what shall a man giue
for his soule, yea to giue a
whole world and to lose
his soule is a bad bargaine:
but what a beggerly and
bloudy bargaine hast thou
made which for litle pieces
and shrids of the world hast
sold many soules? But to
what end is it to speake to
a man of clay, that hath no
sense nor feeling of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen?
To what end is it to
speake to a mule that hath
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:91:196"/>
no vnderstanding? Such
men are more dead, then
the Altar which heard the
word of the Lord. They
are stonie at the very heart,
and nothing but mony
makes any sound by stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
such a heart. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
euen to common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it wold grosly appeare,
that a lanterne without a
candle can giue no light,
that a man without sight
cannot bee a guide to the
blinde; &amp; that men led by
such guides, must needes
fall with their guides into
the pit of eternall destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But if it happen that
a man of some sufficiencie
hath like the Centurion by
a great summe obtained
the freedome of this Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:91:197"/>
then is the Patron
readie to go into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with the Pharisie, to
giue thankes that hee is
not like other men: There
is a fit man in the place,
and hee hath taken no
mony for the Benefice
but for the Aduowson,
which a man may honestly
doe. But know thou Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuenter
of thy owne
soule: That if it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to sell an Aduowson,
thou shouldest sell it at the
price of an Aduowson.
To finde out this, consider
what either thou payest for
the patronage, and so make
some proportion by that,
or what a lay-man would
giue for it, that would make
no vse of it, but the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:91:197"/>
For whatsoeuer is giuen
beyond that which a man
would giue to haue the
meere naming of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
is the price of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice,
and not of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowson;
it paies for the
profit of the liuing, &amp; not
for the particular appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the man. Mingle
things as cunningly, and
confusedly as thou canst,
the iudgement of God shal
single the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as perfectly, and
the euill shal be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out &amp;
shewed thee by it self in the

do I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> selling
of Aduousons though at
the easier rate; for a Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
is an excellent priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
a patrone hath the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:91:198"/>
power of a great and high
worke, euen in the chiefest
businesse of God. Why wilt
thou for a little mony let
another doe God accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seruice, when thou maist
do it thy selfe? Or why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
dost thou suffer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
to doe Gods seruice
negligently and corruptly,
when thou maist doe it
faithfully? Take heede here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;
for if by thy sale, the
sheepe be vnfed, for whome
Christ died, thou maist go
among the cursed to whom
it shall be said, When I was
an hungrie thou hadst food
in thy hand, and yet thou
fedst me not.</p>

hauing paide the Patron

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:91:199"/>
some tithes, yet to
make a good bargaine with
the Minister, and to get
somewhat by him; and if
he will not bee so wrought
on, he must goe for a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
and hard man. But O
thou ouerthriftie Tither,
what thinkest thou, while
thou dealest thus? hast thou
a soule or not? If thou hast
none, at least, if thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
so, words wil be vseles,
vntill thou feele one day
by the torments of thy
soule that thou hast one;
and then they will also bee
vselesse. But if thou hast
one, it is better then thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which is also better then
thy goods. Thou gladly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
to the Phisition to
maintaine the health of

thy body, and to the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
to preserue thy goods:
how doth not thy hand
willingly &amp; chiefly stretch
foorth it selfe to him which
saueth thy soule, which is
infinitely better then these?
It sheweth too euidently,
that thou valuest things
backwards, since thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemest
not thy soule, as
thou dost thy goods and

haue had a glimse of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

thereof, and in disdaine
say, Is it a great matter to

such men know, they
cannot giue so good things

to them, as they receiue

would euen take out of
their owne bowels to doe

by all meanes desire, that
they might liue plentifully

               <p>A third cunning of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
is to make sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an odious thing, and to
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:91:201"/>
fasten on it some vile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch,
that men may bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to serue God, and
to be saued. And that this
may worke the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
he suffers many to
goe so farre in religion as
they may, without losing
them, that is, in a morall
and ciuill profession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
but that degree, beyond
which indeed is onely the
very life and power of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
is very offensiue
to them, and appeares to
such to bee but hypocrisie
and scrupulositie. Hence it
is, that among most of these
ciuilians, regeneration and
sanctification, which they
attaine not, is Puritanisme,
and a true Saint is called a
Puritan; which in their
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:91:201"/>
English, meanes a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
or scrupulous fellow.
And this being the verdit
of those, who account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
for honest men, and
their neighbours think the
same (to whom these ciuill
men are almost Puritans)
like a kennel of dogs, they
runne away with the crie,
and barke out this terme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
euery honest man
they meete. But a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
persecution of tongues
is this the whiles, especially
among Christians, that a
man should be reuiled for
being a Christian; and that
regeneration, the worke of
the holy Ghost, should bee
reproched. Cursed is hee
that despiteth the Spirit of
grace, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Spirit which
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:91:202"/>
gaue his tongue that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
by which hee is able to
speake against the Spirit.
Cursed is hee that reuileth
the holy Ghost, and raileth
on the power of the liuing
God. Know that the time
shall come, when thy words
shall returne vpon thee, as
so many Lyons; yea, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
who now sets thee on
worke, shall come to worke
vpon thee with torments:
but especially that blessed
Spirit, whom thou hast
reuiled, shall come against
thee, and teare thee in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and there shall be none
to deliuer thee. Thou seest
in the whole course of
such a mans life, a maine
current of honestie and
goodnesse; and who would
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:91:202"/>
thinke that any should bee
so shamelesse to raile on
goodnesse, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
against it? For the
verie opposing against
goodnesse, giues thee the
title of wickednesse, which
alone is the enemie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
It shewes thou art a
souldier of the Dragon,
who goes out to make
warre with that blessed
seede, that keepes the
commandement of God.
But I doe know thy vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
defences: thou wilt say,
that there are none worse,
then such as make such a
shew of purenesse, and
withall thou art furnished
with some merry tales, that
shew many mad trickes of
these ouer holie brethren.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:91:203"/>
Heere a little discretion and
iudgement in stead of salt,
would be of very good vse
to amend the sauour both
of thy heart and tongue.
For an vpright iudgement,
as it findeth many truths,
so toward the true discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of this businesse, it fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
these. First, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is indeed good, shall
and must also seeme good;
for his works wil praise him,
whether he will or no; his
fruits wil shew what tree he
is, they must shine before
men, that men seeing them,
may glorifie God their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father. Hence first we
conclude, that euerie one
that seemes good, is not an
hypocrite, but contrarily
he may bee one of Gods
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:91:203"/>
chiefest seruants. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou canst not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fall to thy nickname
only for the shew of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Secondly, that there
is indeede a dissembled ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
worne for a cloake
to wickednes, that the shape
of an Angell of light some
times couers a foule diuell,
yea, the foulest diuels are
they that most vse, &amp; need
this couer. Now for this fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
if thou findest him, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is too good a name for
him; for the Scripture hath
sharper names, as, generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Vipers, Wolues in
Sheepes clothing, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Sepulchers full of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
bones. These bee
they, whereon the diuell
sets the one foote, when
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:91:204"/>
he kickes at true Christians
with the other, iustifying
by these, his railings on
those who especially hate
these, as the diuels chiefest
seruants. But now there
needs some discretion to
know these from the other,
that thou call not good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
nor euill good; nor a
Christian Hypocrite, nor
an Hypocrite, Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
this thou must looke
to the fruites of both, and
that not a few particulars,
but to the generall. For a
Godly man is subiect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,
&amp; hath some fals;
and an Hypocrite knowes
that to couer his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
hee must shew some
goodnes. But looke to the
continuall course of both,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:91:204"/>
and thou shalt finde, one
good generally, though
sometimes fraile; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
often grosly transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
though much coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his rotten heart. The
things wherein especially
thou shalt try the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
may be these. First a
loue to Christ: secondly, a
loue of Christs voice: third<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly,
a loue of the members
of Christ, and a reioycing
in them who excell in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Now these things will
againe appeare if for the
loue of Christ, the loue of
his word, and the loue of
his members, a man be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
contented to lose
sinfull profits or pleasures,
and with the steward to
write 50. for an 100. This
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:91:205"/>
is the touchstone of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
euen the taking vp of
the Crosse, forsaking all,
and following Christ. But
this the hypocrite cannot
abide, he serues Christ, that
Christ may serue him, to
get pleasure and profit by
him, not to lose by him.</p>

               <head>Part. 8.</head>
               <p>But now heere come in
the many stories, which
condemne these purer men
to bee guiltie against these
duties, and so to be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.
Yet runne not away
too fast with this neither,
but euen in the point of
hearing reports, take also
some discretion with you.
For against good men very
commonly, are bold and
confident slanders raised,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:91:205"/>
which by their stoutnesse
might seeme to bee truth it
selfe. But let not the wise
beleeue them before exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
For most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the very telling of
them, will appeare a venom
and malice, the true issue of
the old Serpent: and vpon
farther triall, falshood and
lying, the naturall brother
of the former, and a truly
begotten sonne of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
of the Brethren. He
began the rule in Paradise,
and will continue euen to
the new Ierusalem; lie bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for some of it will sticke
fast for euer. And how can
it be otherwise, since the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
of men is such, that
they will beleeue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
at the first telling, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:91:206"/>
then trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to examine and finde
out the truth, which onely
should be belieued; &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
their maliciousnesse is
so great, that they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and readie to receiue
euill reports, yea, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in them. But the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of Christ know, that
the last iudgement shall be
by words, and that a rash
and a bitter iudge shall,
though not rashly, yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely
be iudged. Therefore
according to the Psalmist,
The good man is merciful,
and guideth his words with
discretion. He inclineth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
to beleeue good ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then euill; yet auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to condemne the iust,
hee also shunnes to iustifie
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:91:206"/>
the wicked. Therefore that
his iudgement may bee
righteous, hee searcheth
both the matter how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it is in it selfe; and
next he examineth the re-reporters,
whether they bee
those, in whom the truth
dwelleth, and who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
haue a good report of
the truth; not being like
<hi>Pilate,</hi> ignorant, and yet to
learne what is truth. For it
is a kind of murther of our
neighbour in his name and
reputation (which is almost
as his life) both to beare
false witnes, and to receiue
false witnesse against him.
Lastly, a good man, if hee
may conueniently, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of the partie himselfe,
or of some of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:91:207"/>
whether such things
haue beene done by him;
and if done, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and vpon what occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for many times the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of things wholly alters
the matter, and the matter
may be good, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which it was done,
yet euill in the manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on it by the repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Againe, the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true, yet the occasion
and cause may, though not
iustifie, yet excuse the fact;
for many euill deeds are
done by infirmitie, which
yet prooue not the men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
that did them. It were
pittie that men should go
to work this way with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
and onely iudge of him
by his murder and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:91:207"/>
but it rather becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vs,
to see whether his course
of life being different from
his fact, do not manifestly
prooue, that these sinnes
were of infirmitie; of sinne
cleauing to him, not reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in sinne. And in this
point should euery man be
the milder; for as it is said
commonly in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
it is euery mans cause;
this mans to day, and thine
to morrow. And though
thou sweare with <hi>Peter,</hi> that
if al the world deny Christ,
thou wilt not denie him,
yet I wil neuer beleeue thee
no more then Christ did
<hi>Peter;</hi> for in many things
we sinne all, and as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
said, <hi>We are also men,
subiect to the same infirmities.</hi>

such a one as the diuell and
his followers hate; for hee

when men speake all euill
of thee falsely, and know
thou art now a brother of
Christ and his Saints in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation,

him, thou shalt also bee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified

with him. The spirit,
whose shame now thou
bearest, shall hereafter cause
thee to beare his glorie; and
the more shame for his
sake, the more glorie. So
shall these <hi>Balaams,</hi> whose
hearts are so ready to curse

very meanes to procure a
blessing vnto them. For so
many curses, so many bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings;
therfore if there were
no offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to God, nor hurt

pride, that any man takes
in his seruice toward God.
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:91:210"/>
For first, the whole man
being from God, wee can
giue him out of man no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but his own. Againe,
the whole man being due
to God, there can returne
no good thing from man
to God, but what is his due.
Thirdly, it is Gods free
choise, that vouchsafeth to
vse thy seruice, who refuseth
the imploiment of many
men, excellent in naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.
Certainly, we haue
seene many such of great
hope turned into earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any, or small vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
God Al-sufficient, who can
raise vp seruants of stones,
thus often sheweth, that
men haue need of God and
his choise, to doe him any
good seruice; but hee nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:91:210"/>
not them. Therefore
let vs rather thanke God,
then boast before him, if
he imploy vs in his seruice.
Let vs with humilitie readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performe it, as to that
great Lord, who hath refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
infinite better, to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by vs; and whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to serue is a happines &amp;
priuiledge of ours fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
not a benefit of ours to him</p>

heardsmen, this rule is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.
But now there is a
kind of equality in number,
that euery one might haue
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:91:211"/>
his mate diuidedly, without
diuiding with another. And
this which was indeed best
was first; for then there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but one woman to one

vnlawfull, was then vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
What bare necessitie
was to man by creation,
let necessarie obedience
vnto God bee to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of regeneration; whose
speciall vertue, is to auoide
the ill which may be done.
Surely as running after lust

            <p>When a man is possessed
by any lust, be it of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
concupiscence or

image in him, though not a

a God. This image wholly
filleth his minde, to it he

he offereth his whole heart
in sacrifice to it; and if he
can obtaine the thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

For if some temporall

yet in God they are

hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

when he withholds them,
hee doth it as not beeing

while our flesh by nature is

Surely it is a great fault of

            <p>It is a good degree of
happinesse to haue a nature
inclining, yea in different to
those waies to which the
spirit bends it selfe, and
would bend it. Thence it
seemes a great aduantage
when a man hath in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
a coldnesse to Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to the glory of this
world, to the pleasures of
the world, and when it
draweth, and contracteth
it selfe into a narrower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
being satisfied euen
with things necessarie. For
if we haue not this natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:91:215"/>
make it naturall by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
because there is an
absolute necessity that wee
be such, or still striue to bee

in vs, but by moderating
&amp; guiding the minde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compasse of reason,
curbing and restraining
wilde and inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?
And this it seemes
is much the end of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the men whom God
loues, that there by taming,
swaging, and cooling their
nature, and as it were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
and taking away by a
priuation, the head-strong
affections which it beareth
to the world; the spirit
may vnresisted enter in, and
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:91:216"/>
quietly worke his nature
into the afflicted. And as
for these naturall vertues,
though they bee not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
nor in themselues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, while
they are meerely mooued
by nature, to a naturall
mans ends; yet when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is mooued to do them
by the spirit, from a right
cause which is the loue of
God, vnto the right end
which is the glory of God;
then the actions so done
by the seruice of nature, are
good &amp; acceptable to God.
As for those whose croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

against the discipline of the

            <p>The wisedome of man

are exceeding different, and
no maruaile: one being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
pure, and purely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite;
the other narrow, but
great in corruption. As in
all things therefore wee
should forsake our owne
wisedome, and leane vnto
Gods; so not with the least
care in the matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge;
when thou hast suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
some euill, thine own
wisedome bids thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
euill to the doer, but
the wisedome of God bids
thee to returne him good
notwithstanding this euill.
Hereat thou wondrest, and
thy flesh finds no wisdome
in this to returne good for
euill, to helpe him who
hurts thee: yet is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:91:217"/>
of thy wisedom, indeed
folly, &amp; this of Gods, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
wise. For 1. in reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
thy self, thou dost foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly;
for God hauing taken
to him self alone, the name
&amp; power of being iudge of
the world, thou steppest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this place and wilt bee
thy owne iudge. And God
hauing delegated part of
this power for a time vnto
Magistrates, thou intrudest
into their place, and so art
Rebellious both against
God and man. And indeed,
as thou hast made thy
selfe a iudge, so thou makest
thy selfe an executioner,
and art the hangman to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
the sentence of thy
own malice: surely if a man
had robbed thee though
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:91:218"/>
with some blowes, and were
apprehended and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Magistrate, thou
wouldest take it a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to be appointed for a
hangman, or executioner
of him, who thus offendeth
thee; yet heere is nothing
but iustice: but when thine
owne wrath vsurping the
place of Iudgement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes
a man for a blow
or a word to die, then it is a
part of honour, to bee the
executioner of thy own vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust
and vnlawful sentence.
Be not deceiued, this latter
is the worse hangman of
the two. But to examine
thy folly neerer, how art
thou indeede auenged by
this, which thou thinkest
and callest reuenge? By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:91:218"/>
into Gods office,
thou hast taken the matter
out of Gods hands into
thine owne: but so where
before a God, and an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
God was thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Iudge, who in his
wrath could cast both soule
and bodie into hell fire;
now a man hath vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
him, who hath onely
power on the bodie, if yet
he haue so much: so instead
of a reuenger, thou hast
done the part of a redeemer,
and goest about to helpe
him, whom thou though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to hurt. Againe, where
God was before angry with
him alone, now he is angrie
with thee also, and so hast
thou lost thy aduantage,
which thou hadst vpon
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:91:219"/>
him. Thou hadst the best
friend in the world for thee,
and against him: and now
thou hast by thy reuenge,
lost him equally with the
other. And lastly, him
whom thou censurest to
haue done euill, thou goest
about to imitate, and to
make thy selfe as bad as he.
And now that Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
to recompense good for
euill, is excellently wise, it
appeares hereby: certaine it
is, and to the godly certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowne, that the eies of
God behold al things done
on earth; and he which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
all things certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
shall as certainely iudge
all men, for all things done
in their flesh. Therefore if a
man wrong thee, know that
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:91:219"/>
this wrong is seene, that it
is recorded, that it shall bee
iudged. And if thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
now but see, or right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagine that terrible
iudgement, which shall bee
inflicted on those which
touch Gods anointed, thou
wouldest pitty them, whom
now thy vengeance would
punish. Surely fire and
brimstone, cries and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
darknesse and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
are their portion;
though it bee not present,
yet it shall be present, and
the weight of the paine shal
recompence the stay. Again,
the moore good thou art,
the more God will pitty
thee, the more God will
plague him that wrongeth
thee. For the more good,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:91:220"/>
the dearer to God, and the
more odious are those that
offend thee. Therefore if
thou wilt bee reuenged on
thy enemie, bee still doing
of good as to all, so to him
among all; and thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
shall bring God the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger
vpon him, and shall
heape coales of fire vpon
his head, in the day of the
highest vengeance. Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
thy soule in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
in patience, and
bee not mooued from thy
place to doe euill; then shalt
thou dwel assuredly in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
and shalt see thy

whatsoeuer the wicked do,
thou knowest thy part;
though he doth the works
of a wicked man, thou still
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:91:220"/>
art to bring forth the fruits
of a good man; hee doth
what belongs to a seruant

belongs to the seruice of
thine, and at last thou shalt
see his Lord and himselfe
made the foote stoole of thy
Lord, and cast downe into
vtter darkenesse, where shal
be weeping and gnashing
of teeth. Then shall this
thy Lord, who casteth him
into hell, exalt thee into
heauen: and as your waies in
this life were diuers, so shall
they bee in the next; and
then shall it be no griefe of

            <p>The nature of man by
the corruption thereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a God of whatsoeuer

is Idolatrie by the Apostle,
reckoned among the works
of the flesh, it being a work
to which the flesh is prone.
This hath the wicked cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of mankind grossely
declared, while some make
their wealth a god; some
haue taken men for gods,
as the Barbarians did <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> and some
haue made gods for all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
as did the Romans.
But among the rest, this
corruption of the flesh, hath
a speciall lust and desire of
some glorious and faire
image, to make to it selfe a
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:91:221"/>
God. And this it doth not,
by beleeuing the outward
substance, as gold or wood,
to be a God of it selfe, but
that some diuine spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiteth
and possesseth it,
and so maketh it diuine
by dwelling in it. This
inclination and readinesse
of man to idolatrie is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
often in Scripture
<hi>Ieremie 10. Ezechiel 16.
Iudges</hi> 2. Yea, it hath so
farre preuailed, that men
haue beene inflamed with
Idols, vnder euerie greene
tree, burning in lust to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them; yea they haue
adored and worshipped
the very images of their
friends which they kept
as remembrances of them,
<hi>Wisd.</hi> 13. 10. and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:91:222"/>
the image of the
serpent which healed them,
2. King. 18. If this was the
inclination of mans nature
in former times, how can
wee but still looke for the
same fruites of the same
roote? The same corrupt
nature, yea worse in these
last times still dwelleth in
vs; it is as neere kin to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols
as euer it was, and the
diuell rageth more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
hee did, knowing his
time to be short. Therefore
if an image was a stumbling
blocke, and a teacher of
lies, how do they teach the
truth, that teach images?
Where they are publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proposed vnto corrupt
and fraile mankinde, yea
where they are proposed to
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:91:222"/>
be worshipped with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
due to the patterne,
yea where they doe or are
said to do great and diuine
wonders, what can be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for, but that the same
mankinde which worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
images in old time, and
by that worship were idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
will worship images
with the same worship
now, and now also become
idolaters? The same man,
the same image, and the
same idolatry. But now
they are taught not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
them with diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And then they were
taught by the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
them at all. Thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of them doth draw
men more to them, then
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:91:223"/>
thy teaching doth deterre
from them. Say what thou
wilt, if thou put an image
before a man of flesh. Flesh
and the image will toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commit idolatry. Wilt
thou take thy faire wife, and
leaue her with a lustfull
man, and tell him he shall
only passe the time with
her in ciuill conference.
The Lord of hosts, is as ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of his spouse, as thou
of thy wife; he wil not haue
temptations set before her,
and therefore forbids alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the making of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
for any worship. Besides
the ignorant man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
not the difference
betweene <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Latria,</hi>
but falls heartily to his
businesse, and thinkes he
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:91:223"/>
cannot do it amisse if he do
it with all his heart. And if
hee did vnderstand it, yet
when it doth miracles, how
can they not worship it?
since euen for that Israel
worshipped the serpent,
which their story told them
to haue beene made of

different in the apparance
of outward glory. And in
this way, those that are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
aboue necessity and
miserie, haue so confused,
vnknowne, &amp; mixt a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that they still turne
our thoughts forcibly from
themselues, and send them
beyond themselues vnto
another kinde of beeing, to
finde fulnesse and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
The higher estate,
which is that of power and
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:91:224"/>
action, pleaseth it selfe in
the preheminence thereof,
and beholding it selfe a
cause &amp; moouer of effects.
But the end of a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the excellency &amp; crown
thereof, and the naturall
end of action, and motion
being rest, it seemes that
the lower estates enioying
this most, enioy most the
chiefest, and haue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of the fruite, while
the other hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
roote. Yet the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
are most contented to
be so, and the lesser might
be contented, but they will
not; and so is there a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
herein: that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
maketh some conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with labour, while more
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:91:225"/>
substantiall rest, will not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
others. Besides this
vexation of minde, there is
another: That to be farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
miserie, is a miserie:
and desires preuented, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
much of the trouble of
desires vnsatisfied. For man
being made of lust, it is a
torment to him, not to
lust; and so while men hunt
after an excesse of fulnesse,
they hunt after their owne
torment: yet is there a great
path beaten by these run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
after extremities, who
know not the sweet bound
and point of enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which, their striuing
is labour for losse. Againe,
the supposed excellency,
and highest perfection of
mankinde, being common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:91:225"/>
imagined to bee at the
state and ripenesse of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
yet in that indeede is
man most miserable, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then lanched forth like
a full built ship into the
world, a sea of cares and
sorrowes; Then also know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
increased, increaseth
sorrow, giuing man a more
full taste of his owne mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
But youth is free from
care, and hath strong enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of smal &amp; easie things;
for youth couers all things
with its own pleasantnesse,
whereas age is sad in spite
of obiects, colouring them
also with it owne deadnes:
Yet youth desireth man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and is tormented for
lacke of it, and after is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with hauing it. If
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:91:226"/>
then the ripenesse of man,
euen mans best, is a station
of care; if he grow from
pleasure as he groweth into
manhood, and yet tendeth
vnto manhood as vnto his
perfection; it seemes the
very being and perfection
of man is a beeing of care
and trouble, and that man
is verily borne to labour as
the sparkes flie vpward.
Now what is there left to
be thought of man? but
that he was not made only
for vanitie and miserie, and
that this miserie hath a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and a better end, euen
happinesse it selfe. We are
here brought into a state of
trouble, and straitnesse, but
it is, that seruing God first
in labour, we should after
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:91:226"/>
come to his rest; and that
the consideration of this
rest should be our comfort
in the time of our labour.
Let vs therefore worke on
strongly in the worke of
God imposed vpon vs,
knowing that after the sixe
daies labour, commeth rest
of the seauenth. And let our
eyes be continually on the
ioyes which follow, and
not on the paine which is
present: the ioyes beheld
must needs incourage vs,
for their sight is comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and especially because
wee are sure they are ours.
The paine neglected and
vnregarded, cannot be very
disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable; the thought
not beeing grieued with
that which is not beheld
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:91:227"/>
by it. Thus did Christ
looke stedfastly on glorie,
and so despised the shame,
and endured the crosse; and
so doth God himselfe, in
the sufferings of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.
The world indeede
wonders who sees but halfe
of the matter, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
the sufferings of iust
and holy men. They won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that God takes no more
pitty on them, but suffers
the fire, the axe, and the
tormenter to haue power
ouer them. But then God
who beholds at once the
whole estate of a Christian,
sees both the torments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and the glory follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and hee iudgeth the
short and finite torments to
be the gaine &amp; aduantage
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:91:227"/>
of his seruants, since they
cause a great accesse of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
glory. Therefore let
vs be so minded as God and
his Christ are, and walke
on valiantly in sanctified
miserie vnto true felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

            <p>Most men in part, or in
whole are Gadarens, or
Capernaites. The Gadaren,
if hee lose any thing by
Christ, desires him to depart
out of his coasts, and will
lose Christ, rather then his
swine. The Capernaite fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
Christ, but it is to be
filled; so he seekes Christ
for his belly, and makes his
belly the ende of Christ.
These things are too vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:91:228"/>
to shrinke from Christ,

by which wee should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend

But miserable and foolish
man, thou both robbest &amp;
destroiest thy selfe with this
thy policie. Christ would
haue done farre greater
things for thee, and thou
wilt onely haue him helpe
thee to the lesse: he would
haue giuen thee an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Kingdome, a Treasure
that is farre aboue theeues
and rust; but thou hadst ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
receiue lesse and worse
things from him, transitory
honour, and rustie treasure.
Thou art a child in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
thou takest an
apple, and refusest a iewell:
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:91:229"/>
But he that is verily Christs
Disciple, auoids these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
He knowes Christ
to bee such an inestimable
Pearle and happinesse, that
if hee haue Christ, though
with the losse of father or
mother, wife or children,
life or land, yea, with perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions;
yet the possession
of him yeelds a hundred
fold more comfort in this
life, and in the life to come
eternall felicitie. He is still
a gainer amid all his losses,
yea he gaines by his losses;
for losses for Christ gaine
great comfort and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in this world, that the
losers are accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to lose any thing for
Christ; and hereafter in the
next world, shall they gaine
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:91:229"/>
an exceeding reward of
glorie. The same Disciple
also out of the same estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ, highly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth
to make any other
end of Christ, but Christ
himselfe. Yea hee so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preferreth Christ aboue
all things, that he accounts
all things dung, so he may
win Christ; Christ is the
marke of his desires, hee
sees nothing beyond him,
but all things farre short of
him: He knowes Christ to
be infinitely better then all
things, and therefore vseth
the worse as helpes to the
better; but farre it is from
him, to propose the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
only as a meanes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worse. So he passeth
through all other things as
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:91:230"/>
a Pilgrime, but takes vp his
rest in Christ alone. He
walkes along treading on
earth, and earthly things,
with his eies and heart fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on his Sauiour in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
To conclude, he is so
farre from selling Christ, to
get any thing, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

            <p>The naturall man hath

and sometimes
though he haue therby no

he proud of a proud horse,
of a rich iewell, of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered

hee attributeth
more glory to himselfe, for
possessing them, then to
the Author and giuer, for
creating and giuing them:
yea commonly all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to himselfe, the standing
poole, and none to the

euen the new borne
sonne of God, rips vp this
swelling deceit, and striues
to free his soule from it, and
to bring her to a true and
iust discerning of things.
To this end bending her
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:91:231"/>
eye to the contemplation
of truth, shee findes that
chiefe and only glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to the giuer, not to
the receiuer; to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
not to the thing made.
Shee sees no reason that she
should boast of anothers
worke, nor that shee should
be proud of what shee hath
receiued; but rather shee
seeth great reason, that the
creature should giue all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Creator, and the
receiuer to the giuer. For
the borrower is a seruant
to the lender, his receiuing
is an implied subiection,
and hee oweth to him the

And, Thou art worthie ô

the almesman of God. And
thogh knowledge by mans
corruption is made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of puffing vp, yet
knowledge pursued to this
point by sanctification,
would humble and abase.
For it would shew vs that

But miserable and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

thou art proud of a

wilt thou bee of a greater

which other giue thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
from thee to thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
who only is the true

so maist thou aspire by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
which is the only ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
yea most ready way
of aspiring. But if thou doe
it not, know that pride is
the especiall barre of Gods
mercies; Pride keepes out
God, and many might haue
beene farre more sanctified,
if they had beene farre lesse
proud. For God enters not
into the soule that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
not him nor his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;
those that are farre
from beholding him, hee
beholdeth afar off. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the humble soule, that
giueth him abundance of
glory; he enters with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of grace, sowing

there, and there only plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Now let vs beware that

intend to vse the
meanes, a speciall part of
that meanes will bee a true
search and notice of the
lustes which he must denie,
and chiefly of the chiefest;
which excell in force, or in
height of corruption. For
this must he looke into the
nature of man in generall,
into the nature of the men
of that countrie or place
where he dwelles, and into
the custome (which is also
a nature) of men at that

into the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which

&amp; especially men
of that country men of that
time, and wherein his owne
hart. And this being found,
he hath then his worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, he sees what hee
must generally denie, and
what parts of the generall
with his chiefest strength
he must resist; and what he
thinkes fit to resist himself,
let him also prouoke others,
to resist the same. If wee
make not this search at all,
lust may come to our harts
not known to be lust, but in
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:91:237"/>
the shape of righteousnes, or

If wee make this

we may indeed find al vices
and so may bee mooued to
make a general resistance to
al. But yet if we make not a

more setled &amp; strong against
the stronger, (such as are
those of our nation, time &amp;
person) by not matching
them, wee our selues are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermatched,
and so ouer
maistered. This knowledge
as it is in it selfe necessarie,
so it may be knowne to be
such, because our mercifull
God, by a long succession
of Prophets, taught and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

to disswade the
wicked that he turne from

And as those Watchmen of

errours or maliciousnesse
may be purged, as soone as
mixed. And indeed what
worke doth more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
imploy the skilful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-builders
and edifiers,
then the finding and repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the ruines of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of God? That is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
indeede, to bring a
stone into a decaied place,
not to fill vp that which is
already full. That is most
properly fortifying, which
giues strength, to the place
that needeth it, not to that
which is alreadie safe.
wherefore let both Prophets
and people labour herein,
vntill time shal be no more,
that the breaches of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
may bee both found
and repaired; that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:91:239"/>
bee kept out at his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of aduantage, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
may haue no new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
but that there may be
a defence readie against it;
vntill our Lord Iesus, the
founder and foundation of
his Church appeare. Who
now building by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie
of his Prophets, will
then commend and exalt
those that haue been the
wise and faithfull builders,
and will lift vp the whole
Citie once perfectly built
into the safetie and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his owne presence,
for euer and euer.</p>
            <p>The Spirit and the Bride say,
Come, euen so, come Lord
Iesus.</p>
