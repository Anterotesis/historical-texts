            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A full Account of the Apprehending of the LORD CHANCELLOR, in <hi>Wapping</hi>; As he was deſigning to make his Eſcape: As alſo the Manner how he was brought before the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; and from thence committed to the <hi>Tower, December</hi> 12. 88.</head>
            <p>IT is a generally receiv'd Maxim in this Kindom, That no Man ſtruggl'd with the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> but he got a Fall: Of which you have new a great Example in the preſent Lord of <hi>Wemm,</hi> Lord Chancellour of <hi>England</hi>; who ambitious of Honour and Grandeur baulk'd at no Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ancient and Fundamental Laws of this Realm, to hoiſt himſelf into Exorbitant Power. His Bold and Lofty Deportment, when Chief Juſtice, and his Domineering Pride, when Lord Chancellor, are too well known, and he is now become himſelf an Example, That Breach of Law in <hi>England</hi> is but a Sandy Foundation. For after all his Ranting Vain-Glory and Imperious Pomp, finding <hi>White-Hall</hi> too Hot to hold him, he was forced to quit his glorious Purſe and Mace, and ſo flunk away, with a Reſolution to leave the Nation, which he has Diſturb'd with his Pernicious Counſels; and to avoid the Reward of his Miſdeeds, by ſeeking Shelter in a Foreign Climate: For Flight, by the Law of <hi>England</hi> always implies Guilt.</p>
            <p>To this Purpoſe, laying aſide his Gold Frogg-Button Gown, he put himſelf into the Habit of a Seaman, with a Fur-Cap, inſtead of his Beaver and Diamond-Buckl'd Hat-Band; and for the preſent took Sanctuary in <hi>Anchor and Hope-Alley,</hi> perhaps, becauſe he thought there might be ſome kind of Spell in the Sign, and Willing ſtill to have Hope for his Friend, left his Heart ſhould break. There he ſent for the Maſter of a Collier to bargain with him, for the Hire of his Veſſel to carry him beyond Sea, out of Harmes Way.</p>
            <p>But the Mate more cunning then the Maſter, ſmelt a Rat, and full of Suſpicions, goes and informs the Headborough of the Place, of the whole matter: Who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the preſent Condition of Affairs, reſolv'd to ſee whether it were a Man or a Mouſe, who was making ſuch haſte out of the Kingdom. And ſo taking his Staff of Authority, went to the Houſe in <hi>Anchor and Hope Alley</hi> aforeſaid, in the Hamlet of <hi>Wapping</hi> aforeſaid; and going up Stairs, found a certain Perſon in Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Habit, as aforeſaid, laid upon a Bedd, between two Blankets (without any other <hi>Wapping</hi> Accommodation, ſo far as we can hear of, for his Spirits were low) upon which, whether it were by Inſtinct, or by ſome Private Whiſper of my Lord's Fate in his Ear, he gave him a broad-ſide Queſtion, and ask'd him, Whether he were not the Lord Chancellor or no? To which the Man between the Blankets reply'd, <hi>He was.</hi> With that the Headborough thought it his Duty to apprehend his Lordſhip; and ſo having feiz'd him, carry'd him to one Captain <hi>Jones</hi>'s Houſe, a Maſter of a Ship, till he could get a Coach and more Aſſiſtance, and then brought him to the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor's Houſe in <hi>Grocers Alley.</hi> It is not to be imagined what a Train his Lordſhip had to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, all the way from the Place, where he was taken; which caus'd a great Fear in his Lordſhip; and made him earneſtly deſire the Headborough, To ſecure him from the Fury of the People, not valuing the Expence of his Protection, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might be. Upon which there was a Perſon ordered all the way to ſit in his Lap before him, to receive the Mire and Dirt, if the Mobile ſhould prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly.</p>
            <p>When he was brought to <hi>Grocers Hall,</hi> the Multitude that follow'd him, fill'd all the Court to that degree, that there was no going in or out: To whom the Lord Mayor, appearing from his Balcony, deliver'd himſelf in few Words to this Purpoſe, <hi>That he deſir'd them to let him but have free Paſſage to and fro, to his own Houſe, and he would take Care to acquaint the Lords of the Council, that they might have Juſtice done; and a good Account of their Priſoner.</hi> And theſe Words his Lordſhip was forced to repeat twice, by reaſon of the Noiſe below in the Yard. From thence the Lord Chancellour was ſent to the Tower; where we leave him at preſent to his own ſerious Thoughts and Conſiderations.</p>
