            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Propositions relating to the Doctrin of the <hi>H. Trinity,</hi> were but Twenty-one when the <hi>Manuscript</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Title-Page,</hi> was writ against them: But all the Twenty-eight, which since came out, are implyed in them. And I acknowledge that those Written Papers occasioned my making them so many more, to put the <hi>Explication</hi> more out of danger of Misconstruction.</p>
            <p>There is likewise some difference in the <hi>Wording</hi> of those Twenty-one and the <hi>Title,</hi> and two or three small Additions, but the <hi>Sence</hi> of both is Exactly the same. Those I drew up in Compliance with a Gentleman of as great Worth as Quality, who requested me to give him in Writing the Sence, he once heard me Affirm to be the most Ancient, of this Grand Article of our Faith; and in my Opinion incomparably Preferrable to the Later Hypotheses. And falling into this Method, of Expressing, Clearing, and Confirming the Fathers Notion of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> by Propositions, I delivered, when I had finished them, a fair Copy of them to that Gentleman, and gave my foul one to a Friend, who needed Satisfaction about this Great Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95338:3"/>
This Person, some time after, brought me from a <hi>Socinian</hi> Acquaintance of his, an Answer to my Paper, Concealing his Name from me: and I sent him my Thoughts of his Performance, as soon as my Occasions would permit me to Consider it; which are contained in the next following <hi>Defence.</hi> Only in what I now Publish, I abridge a little in a few places of what I writ, nor is there any other Considerable Alteration.</p>
            <p>And as I Printed not more than an <hi>Hundred</hi> Copies of the <hi>Propositions,</hi> till I Reply'd to the <hi>Answer</hi> to them, a while since Publish'd by Another Hand; So the now Coming Abroad of <hi>This</hi> Answer, is <hi>Solely</hi> Occasion'd by the <hi>New Reflections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it be thought no fair dealing with my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that I do not Publish also <hi>his</hi> Papers, I have this to Say, I have them not to Publish, but returned them at <hi>His</hi> desire, who brought them to me, not thinking it worth the while to take a Copy of them, since I had not then a Thought of ever Printing my Reply.</p>
            <p>But if I have played any <hi>Tricks</hi> in Transcribing what I Animadvert upon (which is the Substance of the Whole) both my Adversary and his Friend are able to let the World be Acquainted with them. But I Abhor such Doings.</p>

            <head>The Twenty Eight <hi>Propositions.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Name of <hi>God</hi> is used in more Sences than one in Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The most Absolutely Perfect Being, is God in the highest Sence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Self-Existence</hi> is a Perfection, and seems to be the Highest of all Perfections.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God the Father alone, is in reference to His <hi>Manner of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi> an Absolutely Perfect Being; because He alone is <hi>Self-existent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. He alone, consequently, is absolutely Perfect, in reference to those Perfections, which do presuppose Self-Existence.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Those Perfections are <hi>Absolute Independence,</hi> and <hi>Being the First Original of all other Beings:</hi> In which the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are comprehended.</p>
            <p n="7">7. All <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do acknowledg, That these Two Persons are from God the Father. This is affirmed in that Creed which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and in that which falsly bears the Name of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius:</hi> tho' with this difference, that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is asserted in them, to be from the <hi>Son</hi> as well as from the <hi>Father.</hi> Wherein the <hi>Greek</hi> Church differs from the <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. It is therefore a flat Contradiction, to say that the Second and Third Persons are Self Existent.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And therefore it is alike Contradictions, to affirm them to be Beings Absolutely Perfect in reference to their <hi>Manner of Existence;</hi> and to say that they have the Perfections of <hi>Absolute Independence,</hi> and of being the <hi>First Originals of all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Since the <hi>Father</hi> alone is a Being of the most Absolute Perfection, He having those Perfections which the other Two Persons are uncapable of having; He alone is <hi>God</hi> in the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Highest Sence.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And therefore our blessed Saviour calls <hi>Him, The Onely True God,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. <hi>This is Life Eternal, to know Thee the onely True God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.</hi> And it is most Absurd to think, That in these Words, and the following Prayer, He did address himself to the Three Persons of the Trinity conjunctly, since throughout the Prayer He calls this <hi>Onely True God</hi> his Father; and calls Himself twice His <hi>Son,</hi> before these Words. Not to mention the Absurdity of making our Lord to pray to Himself, or of distinguishing Himself from those Three, of which Himself was One. If such a Liberty as this, in interpreting Scripture, be allowable, what Work may be made with Scripture!</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb facs="tcp:95338:4"/>
12. Our Lord calls the Father, <hi>The Onely True God,</hi> because He only is <hi>Originally,</hi> and of <hi>Himself</hi> God, and the First Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all Beings whatsoever. As he calls him the <hi>Onely Good,</hi> saying, <hi>There is none Good but God,</hi> because He alone is <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> so, and the Spring of all that Good which is in other Beings.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The God head, or God in this Highest Sence, can be but <hi>One Numerically.</hi> Of which the best Philosophers were satisfied by their Reason; and therefore the <hi>Oneness</hi> so frequently affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Him in <hi>Scripture</hi> is a <hi>Numerical</hi> Oneness.</p>
            <p n="14">14. There seems to be neither Contradiction, nor Absurdity, in supposing the First Original of all things, to be productive of other Beings so Perfect, as to have all Perfections, but that of <hi>Self-Existence,</hi> and those which are necessarily therein implyed.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Supposing any such Beings to have immediately issued forth from that infinite Fullness, and Foecundity of Being, which is in the Deity, each of them must have a Right to the Name of <hi>God,</hi> in a Sence <hi>next</hi> to that in which it is appropriated to the <hi>Father;</hi> since they have all the Perfections of the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> but those that must of Necessity be peculiar to <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. It is evident from the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> That the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> are <hi>such</hi> Beings, <hi>viz.</hi> That they have all Divine Perfections but the forementioned: Such as <hi>Unlimited Power, Wisdom, Goodness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="17">17. And they are always spoken of in Scripture, as <hi>Distinct Beings</hi> or <hi>Persons,</hi> according to the Proper Signification of this Word, both from the <hi>Father</hi> and from <hi>Each Other.</hi> Nor are so many Men or Angels more expresly distinguished as different Persons or Substances, by our Saviour or his Apostles, than the Father, Son and Holy Ghost still are.</p>
            <p n="18">18. It is a very presumptuous Conceit, That there can be no way but that of <hi>Creation,</hi> whereby any thing can be immediately and onely from God, which hath a distinct Existence of its own. Or, That no Beings can have Existence from Him, by way of <hi>Necessary Emanation:</hi> Of which we have a <hi>Clearer Idaea</hi> than of Voluntary <hi>Creation.</hi> It is the Word of the Ancients both Fathers and Philosophers; nor can a better be found to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press what is intended by it, <hi>viz.</hi> A more excellent way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting, than that of <hi>Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. It is no less presumptuous to Affirm, That it is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to suppose, That a Being can be from <hi>Eternity</hi> from God the Father, if 'tis possible it may be from Him, in a more Excellent Way than that of Creation. And we have an Illustration
<pb facs="tcp:95338:4"/>
of both these Propositions, by something in Nature. For, according to our Vulgar Philosophy, <hi>Light</hi> doth exist by necessary Emanation from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and therefore the Sun was not before the Light which proceeds from thence, in Order of <hi>Time,</hi> tho' it be in Order of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> before it. And the Distinction between these Two Priorities, is much Elder than <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> or <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> or any <hi>School-man</hi> of them all, or <hi>Christian-man</hi> either.</p>
            <p n="20">20. And if any thing can be from another thing by way of Necessary Emanation, it is so far from a Contradiction to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that it must only be in order of nature before it; that 'tis most apparently a Contradiction to suppose the contrary.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Our 18th. and 19th. Propositions do speak our Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the H. Trinity, to be as contrary to <hi>Arianism</hi> as to <hi>Socinianism;</hi> since the <hi>Arians</hi> assert, That there was at least a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, when the Son was not; and that He is a Creature.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Altho' we cannot understand, how it should be no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to affirm, That the Three Persons are But <hi>One Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> Being, or Substance; yet hath it not the least shadow of a Contradiction to suppose, That there is an unconceivably close and inseparable <hi>Union</hi> both in Will and Nature between them. And such a Union may be much more easily conceived between <hi>them,</hi> than can that Union which is between our <hi>Souls and Bodies;</hi> since <hi>these</hi> are Substances which are of the most unlike and even Contrary Natures.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Since we cannot conceive the First Original of All things, to be more than <hi>One Numerically;</hi> and that we acknowledg the now mentioned Union between the three Persons, according to the Scriptures, together with the intire dependence of the two latter upon the First Person, The Unity of the Deity is, to all intents and purposes, as fully asserted by us, as it is necessary or reasonable it should be.</p>
            <p n="24">24. And no part of this Explication, do we think Repugnant to any Text of Scripture; but it seems much the Easiest way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling those Texts which according to the other Hypotheses, are not Reconcilable, but by offering manifest violence to them.</p>
            <p n="25">25. The <hi>Socinians</hi> must needs Confess, that the Honour of the Father, for which they express a very Zealous Concern, is as much as they can desire taken care of by this Explication. Nor can the Honour of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> be more Consulted, than by ascribing to them all Perfections, but what they cannot have, without the most apparent Contradiction ascribed to them.</p>
            <p n="26">
               <pb facs="tcp:95338:5"/>
26. And we would think it impossible, that any Christian should not be easily perswaded, to think as honourably of his Redeemer and Sanctifier as he can, while he Robs not God the Father for their Sake; and offers no Violence to the Sence and Meaning of Divine Revelations, nor to the Reason of his Mind.</p>
            <p n="27">27. There are many things in the Notion of <hi>One God,</hi> which all Hearty <hi>Theists</hi> will acknowledg necessary to be conceived of Him, that are as much above the Reach and Comprehension of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Understandings, as is any part of this Explication of the <hi>H. Trinity.</hi> Nay, this may be affirmed, even of the Notion of <hi>Self-Existence;</hi> but yet there cannot be an <hi>Atheist</hi> so silly as to question it: Since it is not more Evident, that <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Two</hi> do make <hi>Three,</hi> than that there could never have been <hi>any thing,</hi> if there were not Something which was always, and never began to be.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Lest <hi>Novelty</hi> should be Objected against this Explication, and therefore such should be prejudiced against it, as have a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Antiquity, we add, that it well agrees with the Account which several of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, even <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself, and others of the Ancients who treat of this Subject, do in divers places of their Works give of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> as is largely shewed by two very Learned Divines of our Church. And had it not been for the <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bull.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>School-men,</hi> to whom Christianity is little beholden, as much as some Admire them, we have reason to believe that the World would not have been troubled since the fall of <hi>Arianism,</hi> with such Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies about this great point, as it hath been and continues to be.</p>
            <p>This Explication of the <hi>B. Trinity</hi> perfectly agrees with the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Creed,</hi> as it stands in our Liturgy, without offering the least Violence to any one Word in it. Which makes our Lord Jesus Christ to be from God the Father by way of <hi>Emanation;</hi> affirming Him to be <hi>God of God, very God of very God,</hi> and Metaphorically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing it by <hi>Light of Light;</hi> answerably to what the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> saith of Him, <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>viz.</hi> That He is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Effulgency of his Glory,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Character of his Substance:</hi> And so is as much <hi>Of one Substance with the Father,</hi> as the <hi>Beams</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> are with the <hi>Body</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And since there have been of late so many Explications or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts Published of this most Adorable Mystery, which have had little better Success than making Sport for the <hi>Socinians,</hi> I thought it very Seasonable now to Revive <hi>That,</hi> which I affirm with great Assurance to be the most Ancient one of all; much Elder than the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> and to have much the fewest Difficulties in it, and to be incomparably most agreeable to <hi>H. Scripture.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have perused your Friends Answer to the Paper I put into your hand, and here hope to give you a satisfactory Reply to it.</p>
            <p>I shall dispatch his <hi>Preface</hi> in a few Words.</p>
            <p>He saith, that <hi>The Trinitarians have in Vain tryed their Strength against their Adversaries.</hi> And there's no doubt of it, if <hi>their Adversaries</hi> may be Judges.</p>
            <p>As to his saying, that <hi>The Vanquished Victors are (viz.</hi> among the <hi>Trinitarians) for each buys his Victory with the loss of his own Explanatory Hypothesis;</hi> I confess I have that <hi>soft place in my Head,</hi> which in his great Modesty he saith <hi>our Education has given us,</hi> that disables me to understand the <hi>Sence</hi> of that saying: And am inclined to think, that the <hi>inversion</hi> thereof would have been <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Sence, how <hi>true</hi> soever it would have been, <hi>viz. The Victors vanquished are;</hi> since it follows, <hi>for each buys his Victory,</hi> &amp;c. And whereas he saith, That <hi>in their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Tracts, they have thrown a stone of Contention among the Trinitarians, and this stone has committed them among themselves:</hi> To pass by the <hi>Conceitedness</hi> of this <hi>latter</hi> Phrase, and the Paedantry of affecting to speak <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi> Phrases, sound they never so untowardly, I may I hope without Offence tell him, that neither are the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> at a perfect Agreement in <hi>their</hi> Notions: As particularly in that Question relating to the <hi>H. Ghost, viz.</hi> Whether He be a <hi>Person</hi> or no; or a meer Divine <hi>Vis</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95338:6"/>
or <hi>Energy:</hi> The Followers of Mr <hi>Biddle</hi> asserting Him to be a <hi>Person,</hi> viz. an <hi>Angel.</hi> Nor need I tell him what a Controversie hath been among them, about the <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability of our B. Saviour;</hi> wherein they are not of a mind <hi>yet,</hi> and I doubt never will be. And many <hi>more</hi> disagreements in their Opinions, may be instanced in, if I cared to go on upon <hi>this</hi> Topick. But what tho' the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> differ in some Particulars, in their Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> so long as they agree in the <hi>main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance?</hi> I mean, what if they differ in Certain Notions relating to this Doctrine, wherein the H. Scriptures are <hi>Silent,</hi> so long as they are agreed in what the <hi>Scriptures Expresly say</hi> of it, or of any <hi>One</hi> of the Persons of which the Trinity consisteth? And they <hi>All</hi> agree in giving Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections to <hi>each</hi> of them; which the Scriptures most expresly do. And in affirming them consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be each of them <hi>God,</hi> which also they believe the Scriptures affirm them expresly to be. And farther they agree in believing them to be <hi>one</hi> God; tho' they are not all agreed in what <hi>sence</hi> they are <hi>one;</hi> nor in the Notion of the Word <hi>Person,</hi> as relating to them; nor in their Opinion about using that Word. But if any of them have such a Value for their own Explications, as to be <hi>severe</hi> upon such as dissent from them in any of the <hi>less certain</hi> Parts of them, I will not, I cannot, Apologize for <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Sir, I follow your Friend from <hi>his own Preface, to my Papers Title,</hi> which is this: <hi>An Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Doctrine of the Trinity in Certain Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which speak it to be Agreeable with Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and therefore intelligible, tho' not Comprehensible by our shallow Capacities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here he is pleased to exclaim somewhat Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, against my distinguishing between <hi>Intelligible,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95338:6"/>
               <hi>Comprehensible. I am,</hi> saith he, <hi>perfectly Amazed at this his Distinction.</hi> I will not say, that I am Amazed at his Amazement, but it seems <hi>somewhat strange</hi> to me, that <hi>First,</hi> He should call this <hi>my</hi> Distinction, when I should think he hath heard and read it a <hi>thousand</hi> times; Since there is no Distinction more common. And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he should be <hi>Amazed,</hi> nay <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> Amazed at it. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he should be so, for such a Reason as this that follows, <hi>viz. That which makes a Doctrine unintelligible, is its disagreeableness to Reason; therefore if the Doctrine of the Trinity be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to Reason, neither is it unintelligible; and if it be not unintelligible, neither is it incomprehensible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, That I think the <hi>Obscure Expressing</hi> a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine may also make it <hi>Unintelligible:</hi> But this his <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> may be Expressed in these fewer words, <hi>I am perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Amazed at this Mans distinction between Intelligible and Comprehensible, because they ought not to be distinguished:</hi> Or, as he adds, <hi>because they are Synonimous, and signify one as much as the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But sure your Friend cannot think, I should have such an Opinion of a Perfect <hi>Stranger,</hi> as to be Satisfied with his <hi>bare Word</hi> for this. He is Perfectly Amazed at my distinguishing betwixt <hi>Intelligible</hi> and <hi>Comprehensible:</hi> I ask Why? He Answers, because they <hi>Ought</hi> not to be distinguished. But I am so Impertinent as to ask again, <hi>Why</hi> they ought not? And he so Magisterial, as to let me have no other Answer than, <hi>I say they ought not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he needs not be told, That tho' these <hi>two</hi> words are <hi>sometimes</hi> used in the same sence, yet not <hi>always;</hi> but have <hi>most frequently</hi> different Significations. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible</hi> always implyes <hi>Intelligible;</hi> but <hi>Intelligible</hi> is found Innumerable times, not to imply <hi>Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And therefore <hi>Comprehensible</hi> is taken either in a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95338:7"/>
               <hi>Larger,</hi> or a <hi>Stricter</hi> Sence: And in <hi>my Distinction,</hi> as he calls it, 'tis taken in the <hi>Stricter,</hi> as for <hi>the most Part</hi> it is. Even his <hi>Dictionary</hi> will tell him, that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendere</hi> signifies something, that <hi>Intelligere</hi> doth not. And according to the <hi>most Proper</hi> Acceptation of the word, there is as much difference between <hi>these two,</hi> as there is, between <hi>Seeing</hi> a thing and looking <hi>through</hi> it; or <hi>Understanding</hi> it, and <hi>Compleatly</hi> Understanding it, and having an <hi>Adoequate</hi> Preception of it. And <hi>indeed,</hi> if your Friend had Learnt <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>first Lesson,</hi> he would acknowledg himself so <hi>short-fighted</hi> a Mortal, as, tho' he <hi>Understands</hi> many things, not to be able to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend</hi> the <hi>most Obvious</hi> ones. He would acknowledg that in <hi>this</hi> State, things are only to be Understood by their <hi>Properties,</hi> and certain <hi>Modes,</hi> and that the <hi>Naked Essence</hi> neither of a Spirit nor of a <hi>Body</hi> is known to us. In short, had I distinguished between <hi>Intelligible</hi> and <hi>Apprehensible,</hi> your Friend might have had more Cause for Amazement.</p>
            <p>Next he saith, <hi>That the Incomprehensibility of God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self implyes no more, than what the</hi> Apostle <hi>Expresseth, when he saith, His ways are past finding out; we cannot understand them, that signifies as much as, we cannot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them.</hi> Now it is my turn to be <hi>Amazed;</hi> at least this Sentence must be greatly <hi>Surprizing</hi> to more Heads, than those that have (like <hi>Trinitarians)</hi> a <hi>soft place</hi> in them. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Who hath so <hi>hard,</hi> or so large a Head, as to find only the <hi>Ways</hi> of God incomprehensible to him? As to be able to Comprehend Gods <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Attributes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second,</hi> If <hi>Comprehending</hi> must needs be no more than <hi>Understanding,</hi> there cannot be a Proposition <hi>less true</hi> than <hi>this,</hi> That we cannot Comprehend Gods <hi>Ways;</hi> for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95338:7"/>
is Capable of <hi>Understanding</hi> them, Or GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty would never have appealed to the <hi>Jews</hi> as He did, about the <hi>Equity</hi> of His Ways. And therefore when the Apostle saith, <hi>His ways are past finding out,</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must be, they are not to be <hi>Comprehended</hi> by us, in <hi>our</hi> sence of the word: We cannot Grasp, or <hi>Fathom</hi> them; they are of too great a <hi>Depth</hi> for us to dive to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>now,</hi> Sir, I believe you are sufficiently Prepared to <hi>Wonder,</hi> if not to be <hi>Amazed</hi> at this following Saying of your Friend, <hi>viz. It were a very hard thing, that a Law should be passed, postnate to a Crime, on purpose for the taking off one particular Offender; and 'tis as Unreasonable, that a Distinction should be Coyned (viz.</hi> this between <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible</hi> and <hi>Comprehensible) purely for the service of a particular Mystery; and when that is done, can be of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use, unless new Mysteries were to be Created.</hi> And I Appeal to <hi>your self,</hi> as much as you may be byassed by Affection to your Friend, not only whether <hi>All</hi> he hath said about this Distinction, be not unaccountably strange, but likewise, whether I have not given a <hi>more</hi> than <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> Answer to the Request he makes me in <hi>these</hi> words: <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or <hi>Unthinking People, may be Cheated with an Empty verbal distinction, but since</hi> A. T. (by which Letters he all along decyphereth me, and I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand he means by them the <hi>Anonymous Trinitarian) offers his Explanation to satisfie men that are Knowing, as well as Religious, Scholars as well as Christians, I must beg him to assign the difference between these two words, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible and Comprehensible.</hi> And he guesseth what Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer I will make, in <hi>these</hi> words; <hi>I am apt to think that he will tell me, we can well understand that this Proposition is true,</hi> Three are One; <hi>but we cannot understand the</hi> Manner <hi>how Three should be One:</hi> And then makes this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95338:8"/>
Reply upon me, <hi>Now he might as well say, we comprehend the Truth of this Proposition, but we do not understand the manner; but then what becomes of his Distinction?</hi> But he might have saved himself the pains of putting words into <hi>my</hi> Mouth, and then Replying upon them: For you have seen he is much out in his Guess what I would Answer; and if he were not, I should be content to be told that I have more than <hi>One soft place in my Head.</hi> For what should ayl me to offer at an Explication <hi>of the Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> agreeable with Natural Reason, if I did <hi>Think</hi> what he would have me <hi>Say,</hi> That 'tis impossible to understand the <hi>Manner how Three should be One?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now he saith, <hi>He will take his leave of my Title, with these two Propositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Three are One, is not true in a sence that is disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reason; and the sence of a Proposition that is not disagreeable to Reason is Intelligible and Comprehensible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which he must needs, by <hi>this</hi> time, expect <hi>this</hi> Reply, It is Intelligible, but 'tis not therefore Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He that understands the Truth of a Proposition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the manner in which it is true; and he which does not understand the manner in which a Proposition is true, does not understand the Truth of a Proposition, but takes it on Authority.</hi> This Proposition of his is word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very <hi>oddly,</hi> I cannot make better sence of it, than by thus expressing it: <hi>He who assents to the Truth of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, understands the sence in which it is true; but he that does not understand the sence, does not assent to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, but assents to it upon Authority.</hi> Now the <hi>former</hi> part of this Proposition is <hi>sence,</hi> but nothing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>purpose;</hi> but the <hi>latter</hi> is neither to the <hi>purpose</hi> nor <hi>sence;</hi> as I need not inform you. And now, Sir, your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95338:8"/>
Friend is at length come to <hi>my Propositions.</hi> As</p>
            <p>Prop. 1. <hi>God is a Being Absolutely Perfect.</hi> To <hi>this</hi> he saith <hi>All Theists agree it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prop. 2. <hi>That Being which wants any one Perfection, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Absolutely Perfect.</hi> That is, in the <hi>strictest</hi> sence of that Phrase, as I afterwards explained my self. And he saith, that <hi>this Proposition is self-evident;</hi> as who sees not that so it is? But his <hi>Consequence</hi> is so far from being so, that it is a <hi>false</hi> one, <hi>viz. Therefore our B. Saviour is not God, but in a Metaphorical sence,</hi> &amp;c. But had he had but a little Patience, he might quickly have seen, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Our Lord is not <hi>Self-Existent,</hi> there is no necessity of his being God only in a Metaphorical Sence.</p>
            <p>Prop. 3. <hi>Self-Existence is a Perfection, and seems to be the Highest; it being an Abatement of any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections Greatness and Excellency, tho' in it</hi> self <hi>Bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, not to be Originally in Him who hath it, but deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>this</hi> he saith, That <hi>Self-Existence does not only seem, but</hi> is <hi>the Highest Perfection. This</hi> he might perceive I could have told <hi>him,</hi> as well as he <hi>me;</hi> but 'tis no fault to express our selves a little Modestly, tho' <hi>he</hi> all along seems to be of another mind. But whereas he here saith, that <hi>Creatures Perfections are improperly so Called, with respect to the Creatures;</hi> as he afterwards found, I by no means acknowledg, either the <hi>Son,</hi> or. <hi>H. Ghost</hi> to be <hi>Creatures,</hi> so we have only <hi>his</hi> word for it, <hi>that the Perfections of Creatures are improperly so called with respect to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prop. 4. <hi>God th Father alone (strictly speaking) is a Being Absolutely Perfect, because he alone is Self Existent; and all other Beings, even the</hi> Son <hi>and</hi> Holy Ghost <hi>are from</hi> Him. <hi>This All</hi> Trinitarians <hi>do acknowledg, and is Asserted both in the</hi> Nicene <hi>Creed, and that which bears the Name of</hi> Athanasius.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95338:9"/>
This Proposition too must needs <hi>down</hi> with your Friend, but he likes not the Parenthesis, <hi>Strictly Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and saith <hi>he is very suspicious of it, not that he thinks</hi> A. T. <hi>inserted it to help a Cause off the Weakness, whereof he was Jealous, but yet to make his Scheme the more Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thank the Gentleman for being so Modest in <hi>this Wipe;</hi> but he could not wonder, had he read to the end of my Propositions before he Entred on his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions, that I should here insert the foresaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis. For I do affirm the Son and H. Ghost to be Absolutely Perfectly Beings, in reverence to the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their <hi>Nature;</hi> that is, that they are all <hi>Boundless</hi> and <hi>Infinite;</hi> and that they have <hi>All</hi> perfections they <hi>Can</hi> have, without a Contradiction; and those are all but <hi>Self Existence,</hi> and what necessarily follows upon it, <hi>viz. Being the First Original of All things;</hi> and I add too <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute independence.</hi> But more of this anon.</p>
            <p>The Four next Propositions, he hath no Controversy with me about.</p>
            <p>But now, Sir, Comes a Proposition that makes your Friend <hi>tearingly</hi> Angry, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prop. 9. <hi>A Being which hath all the Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are Capable of being Communicated, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly said to be Essentially God, upon the account of those Perfections; or to be indued with the Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> he calls a <hi>Gross Proposition, because it Contradicts, not only Common Sence and Reason, but even all that</hi> A. T. <hi>hath Advanced.</hi> This is, Sir, a Heavy Charge, but we must <hi>wait</hi> a while before he makes it out, that This Proposition is Contradictory to <hi>Common Sence</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> for he thus goes on: <hi>He had advanced, that God is a Being Absolutely Perfect: That a Being which wants any one Perfection, can not be Absolutely Perfect: That</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:95338:9"/>
               <hi>Self-Existence is the Highest Perfection: That Jesus Christ and the H. Ghost are not Self - Existent: That they depend on God the Father: That God the Father is the Original</hi> (he should have said the <hi>First</hi> Original) <hi>of all things: And that He can be but one Numerically.</hi> He should have said, that God, in this <hi>Highest of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> can be but one Numerically. And now he saith, that <hi>Point-blank against all this,</hi> A. T. <hi>affirms that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is not Absolutely Perfect, which wants Self Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, which wants the Highest Perfection, which derives it self from God, which depends on God the Original of all things, who is but one</hi> Numerically, may be Properly said to be Essentially God, upon <hi>the account of some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections (for two it seems are not Communicated) or to be induced with the Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, what a Multiplying of words is here! <hi>Which wants Self-Existence, Which wants the Highest Perfection, Which derives it self from God;</hi> as if these <hi>Three</hi> were more than <hi>One</hi> thing: Tho I had no such Expression neither as, <hi>derives it self from God.</hi> And he is a little Injurious to me too, in representing me as Saying, that the Son and Holy Ghost have only <hi>some</hi> Perfections, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the following Parenthesis; whereas he knows he ought to have represented me as saying, That they have all that are <hi>Capable</hi> of being Communicated; which are all but <hi>Self-Existence,</hi> and what is necessarily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Implyed. And I say, that <hi>this</hi> is not Capable of being Communicated, because there is not a more Gross Contradiction, than to say it is.</p>
            <p>But how is <hi>this</hi> Proposition <hi>Point-blank Contrary</hi> to my <hi>foregoing ones?</hi> This Question he Answers by <hi>Ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> Questions.

               <head>Quest. 1. <hi>Doth the Divine Nature Comprehend all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; or can it want one or two of the Chiefest, and be still the same Divine Nature?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Answer, that the Divine Nature doth Comprehend <hi>all</hi> Perfections; but <hi>Self Existence</hi> is a Perfection rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting immediately to the Fathers <hi>Existence;</hi> not to His Nature or Essence; it speaking the most Excellent Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Existing peculiar to Himself.

this Question, because it seems to suppose Prae Existent Beings to which the Divine Nature is Communicated.

                  <hi>Non-sence</hi> and a Contradiction to Natural Reason, as much as it is <hi>above</hi> the Comprehension thereof; and is every whit as intelligible as are many Notions relating to the <hi>DEITT,</hi> in which all true <hi>Theists</hi> as well as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> are agreed; and also as are not a few relating to our <hi>own Souls,</hi> their Powers and Faculties, and their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with, and influence upon, our <hi>Bodies;</hi> and as are <hi>innumerable</hi> Notions too relating to <hi>Material</hi> things, which an Experimental Philosopher cannot doubt the truth of.</p>
               <p>In the next place, Sir, your Friend saith, <hi>he despairs of hearing a wise Word answered to these Questions,</hi> viz. the forementioned. But I will not say, where was <hi>his</hi> Wisdom then, when he <hi>askt</hi> them; because you will Reply, they are however wise <hi>Questions,</hi> if they serve to Expose the Trinitarian to whom they are put, and to make his Explication of the Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty down right Non-sence. But I Reply, let the <hi>Unbyas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> Readers judge of <hi>this;</hi> and Sir I heartily wish, that your <hi>Self</hi> may be one of them.</p>
               <p>And whereas he saith, that <hi>he will do what he can, to prevent troubling</hi> (that is <hi>my</hi> troubling) <hi>the Questions, with Confused Empty Jargon:</hi> My Answer is, That I think I have not at all troubled the <hi>Questions,</hi> whether I shall trouble <hi>him</hi> or no, by my Answering them. But I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he will tell you, that my Answers are <hi>Confused Empty Jargon,</hi> and if he will please to tell <hi>me</hi> so, I shall give him no Rougher Reply than <hi>this,</hi> Sir, This is a rare demonstration, that your self is one of those <hi>Anti-Trinitarians,</hi> whom you Extol in the beginning of your Answer to my Propositions, as <hi>having Modestly, as well as Learnedly and Piously, and Strongly Impugned, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received Doctrine of the Trinity.</hi>

But how does he Endeavour to prevent my troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Questions, with <hi>Confused Empty Jargon?</hi> He does it <hi>thus: By Essence, I suppose he means Nature.</hi> I Answer, I am willing to do so too. And, saith he, <hi>in that respect perhaps</hi> 3. <hi>Men who have the same Nature, may be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to be Essentially one, but not Essentially one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> I Answer, this may be more than a <hi>Perhaps;</hi> but he may perceive by my <hi>15th. Proposition</hi> (now the 22.) that I am far from thinking the 3. Persons in the H. Trinity to be in so <hi>low</hi> a sence <hi>one</hi> as 3. Men are. But, proceeds he <hi>The Nature of the Self-Existent God, is above the Nature of all Beings which proceed from Him; and it can not be Communicated.</hi> I Answer, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Nature of the <hi>Father,</hi> is not a <hi>Divine</hi> Nature more truly than <hi>that</hi> of the Two other Persons: But how does he prove that His Nature cannot be Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated? Why, saith he, <hi>we have no other Notion of the word Communicate, but to</hi> Impart <hi>or</hi> Give; <hi>and what one Person does Impart or Give, of any Essential and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular thing, that himself hath not, but he hath it to whom it is given. It may be some will say, Thus it is among Finite Creatures, but the Essence of God is not of the same Condition,</hi> &amp;c. But as God said to <hi>Job, Who is this that darkneth Councell by words without knowledge?</hi> It may be replyed to this Man, <hi>Who is he that multiplyeth words without knowledge?</hi> For it is not <hi>thus,</hi> as he positively asserts, Even among <hi>Creatures.</hi> For there is not a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that Generates another of the same kind, but may be properly said to Communicate its own Nature, and yet notwithstanding it <hi>foregoes</hi> not its own individual Nature, nor any part thereof. What a Boldness then is it to Affirm, that the <hi>Infinite Creator</hi> Cannot do the like! <hi>He that Planted the Ear shall He not hear? And He that formed the Eye shall not he see?</hi> He that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95338:12"/>
a Generative Power to the Meanest of Creatures, or Creatures that have the lowest degree of Life, shall not <hi>He</hi> have the Same Power Himself? I mean A Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of doing that which may be called Generating His own Essential Likeness, in an inconceivably Infinitely more Excellent manner. I wish, Sir, your Friend would well lay to heart that Old Maxim, <hi>Temerè Affirmare, vel Negare de Deo Periculosum est.</hi> Which I will English to you, who I doubt are no great <hi>Latinist, 'Tis a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to affirm or deny any thing rashly of God,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>little</hi> that remains upon <hi>this</hi> Proposition, it consists of a <hi>Repetition</hi> of what <hi>I have</hi> Answered, and of what he repeats upon the next Proposition, which I <hi>will</hi> Answer. And indeed, Sir, your Friend is Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently good, next to <hi>Dareing</hi> Assertions, at <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,</hi> and saying things, that are nothing, or very little, to the purpose. But you will find Every thing, to have more or less spoken to it, that is but <hi>one remove</hi> from what is nothing but <hi>mere Words.</hi> And <hi>now</hi> to what he Animadverts on the <hi>10th.</hi> Proposition.</p>
               <p>Prop. 10. <hi>There seems to be no Contradiction, nor the least Absurdity in asserting, that God is able to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Every one of His Perfections, Except those of Self-Existence,</hi> and <hi>Being the First Original of all things.</hi> By the way, my meaning in these words, appears plainly by other following Propositions, to be <hi>this.</hi> That there is no Contradiction or Absurdity in asserting, That such Beings may have their Original from God the Father, as have all Perfections but <hi>those two;</hi> and which indeed (as I have said) do amount to but <hi>one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what faith your Friend to <hi>this?</hi> He tells us in the <hi>first</hi> place. <hi>That for the same reason that these two are Incommunicable, all the Other Divine Perfections are likewise so.</hi> And whereas he assigns <hi>two</hi> Reasons, why
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95338:12"/>
God cannot Communicate <hi>these two,</hi> he saith <hi>for the same Reasons, he cannot Communicate any of His other Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> But how Egregiously Absurd is it, to go about to give <hi>Reasons,</hi> why God cannot Communicate <hi>His Self-Existence,</hi> and <hi>His being the First Original of all things?</hi> Since that He cannot Communicate these, is a <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Self-Evident</hi> Principle: And therefore is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, as all such Principles are, of being <hi>demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> as Every Body knows that understands, <hi>What</hi> a <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Self-Evident</hi> Principle is; which Every one must understand, that can understand any thing. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is Capable of being <hi>proved,</hi> must be <hi>less</hi> clear, than is the Argument by which it is proved; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Proposition is <hi>so,</hi> cannot possibly be a <hi>First</hi> or <hi>self-Evident</hi> Principle; as no man in his <hi>Wits</hi> does need to be informed. And therefore no such one will go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove <hi>this</hi> Proposition, <hi>The same thing can be, and not be, in the same Moment.</hi> And the <hi>foresaid</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is Every whit as self-Evident as <hi>this:</hi> and the <hi>denial</hi> thereof as Manifest a Contradiction. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a greater, or clearer, Contradiction than to say, That God can Communicate <hi>Self-Existence;</hi> it being to say in other words, That God can be the cause of that which hath <hi>no</hi> cause. Nor than to say, That God can make a <hi>First Original of All things;</hi> since this is to say, that He can make a thing to be before Himself, and to be the Original of Himself; For what is not so, cannot be the First Original of <hi>All</hi> things. <hi>And</hi> therefore, whereas his <hi>First,</hi> Reason, why God cannot Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate these Perfections is, <hi>Because it is a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so to do;</hi> he might as well have said, 'Tis a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to say that God can do a Contradiction. That He <hi>can</hi> Communicate them is <hi>Contradictio in Terminis;</hi> and therefore 'tis absurd to give it as a Reason why He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95338:13"/>
do it, that <hi>'tis a Contradiction.</hi> For you may as well ask, why God cannot do a <hi>Contradiction?</hi> And if a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be given for <hi>this,</hi> you may ask a Reason for that Reason; and so in <hi>infinitum.</hi> But if it were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Contradictio in Adjecto,</hi> I acknowledg, that because such Contradictions are not manifest at <hi>first hearing,</hi> at least to Every Body, 'tis proper to give Reasons to shew that there are Contradictions implyed in such Propositions. But if, any man should ask me a Reason, why <hi>Two and two do not make Twenty,</hi> I would bid him <hi>Go look,</hi> instead of telling him, that it is a <hi>Contradiction</hi> that they should; since I had as good tell him, <hi>he has a Nose in his Face,</hi> and better too. But that God can make a <hi>Self-Existent</hi> Thing, or a <hi>First Original of All things,</hi> are Every jot as Evident Contradictions, as that <hi>Two and two do make Twenty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Sir, your Friend saith, that, <hi>'Tis Equally Absurd and Contradictions, to suppose more than one infinitely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, wise and Good Being.</hi> If he means by <hi>Equally</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and Contradictions as <hi>Evidently</hi> so, sure he is the onely Man that will say so, nor can he <hi>think</hi> so, <hi>say</hi> he what he will. But how does he <hi>prove</hi> this? <hi>This</hi> is the argument by which he does it, <hi>viz. infinite Power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fnite Wisdom and infinite Goodness go together, and may all of them, as well as either of them, be in all Beings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, as well as in more Beings than one.</hi> But what if I say That <hi>this</hi> is as much needs to be proved, as <hi>that</hi> which it is brought to prove? His onely Answer is like to be, <hi>you must take this upon the Authority of my Lord of Canterbury.</hi> For he onely goes about to Confirm it by a passage in His Sermon on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. p. 13. But I not having that Sermon by me, and he making no Marks to distinguish between, what is his <hi>Graces</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95338:13"/>
what is <hi>his own,</hi> it is Enough to give him <hi>that</hi> for an Answer.</p>
               <p>His <hi>second</hi> Argument, whereby he Endeavours to prove the forementioned Self-Evident Proposition, is, <hi>That Self-Existence is indivisible, and Gods Self-Existence is necessary; and therefore if he should Communicate His Self-Existence to Another, He Himself should remain not self-Existent, which is a gross Absurdity, and a manifest Contradiction.</hi> O Wonderful! is it so indeed? I marvel who told him so; it may be he takes <hi>this</hi> too on the Authority of some Great Man, since he troubles not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>make it out.</hi> But there is as great a necessity of proving <hi>this</hi> also, as of proving <hi>that</hi> of which it is a Proof. And he makes this brave Argument to prove too, That <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power is as incommunicable as self-Existence, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom and Goodness, because these are also indivisible.</hi> But the Trinitarian is not so knockt down by this <hi>Unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Argument</hi> (to use a phrase of his <hi>own)</hi> but that he may soon rise again. Nay, as Goodluck would have it, 'tis so weak a Blow, that he has not <hi>felt</hi> it. And 'twill be found weaker than a Puff of Breath, by that time I have askt him this one Question, <hi>viz.</hi> Is not also the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Nature of Every living Creature indivisible? But, as was before said, Even the lowest Sort of them can propagate their own Nature, which is the same thing with <hi>Communicating</hi> it; and therefore methinks it should not be so <hi>great</hi> a Contradiction to say, that He who gave Being to those Creatures can do the like. Or if you please, <hi>thus:</hi> 'Tis therefore no Contradiction to say, That God the Father may be the Original of a Being, which hath power to do all things possible to be done, and hath unlimited Wisdom and Goodness. As to the <hi>rest</hi> of this Animadversion, I will not spend one Minute so vainly as to take notice of it; for half an Eye must see
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95338:14"/>
it to be nothing better than (to give it his own word) <hi>mere Jargon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prop. 11. <hi>It seems Evident from the H. Scriptures, That the Son and H. Spirit have all Divine Perfections but those two, such as Unlimited Power, Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Unspotted Purity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to <hi>Unspotted Purity</hi> he grants, that <hi>the Scriptures do plainly assert it of our Saviour,</hi> but faith, that <hi>that is but the Perfection of a Man or Angel, not an infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a God.</hi> I Answer, that <hi>this</hi> he onely with his usual Confidence saies, but tells us not how he <hi>comes</hi> by this Confidence. But suppole he could demonstrate <hi>this,</hi> yet the Unspotted Purity of the <hi>H. Ghost</hi> one would think to be the Purity of <hi>a God,</hi> since we are so assured from Scripture, that He is the Author of all that Purity and Holiness, which Is or Ever shall be found in Men. And he must have a large stock of Confidence, who dares say. that the Purity which Excells not that of a Man or Angel, is sussicient to qualify a Person to be the Sanctisier, of all that are or shall be Sanctified. And if the Purity of the <hi>H. Ghost</hi> be the Purity of a <hi>God,</hi> I hope the Son's Purity may be acknowledg'd so to be too: Surely those <hi>Socinians</hi> who believe the H. Ghost to be a <hi>Person,</hi> will not make him to Excell the <hi>Son</hi> in Holiness.</p>
               <p>Next he Cavils at my saying, that this <hi>11th.</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Seems</hi> Evident to me, and saith that <hi>Seems</hi> and <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, are two words very ill put together; because that which doth but</hi> seem <hi>Evident is not really so; and that which is Evident doth more than seem so.</hi> I see, Sir, I must not hope to Please this Friend of yours, I verily thought he was about to <hi>Praise</hi> me for my <hi>it Seems Evident:</hi> For he saith upon it, That <hi>[Seems] is a word that Speaks the Modesty of an ingenuous Enquirer after truth;</hi> and on the Contrary, That <hi>Evident fills the mouth of a man of</hi>

                  <hi>Confidence;</hi> as by the way I must tell him he knows by Experience. Yet <hi>for all this,</hi> the good Man designed to <hi>Expose</hi> me for my <hi>it Seems Evident;</hi> and those two Sentences are <hi>Fleering</hi> ones, and were intended for <hi>Scoffs.</hi> But I pray him to <hi>Mock on</hi> after I have told him that, First, He knows I did not say, it <hi>but</hi> Seems Evident. And that, Secondly, 'Tis utterly <hi>false,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> which <hi>is</hi> Evident doth <hi>more than</hi> seem so to all Persons. There are many <hi>Evident</hi> Truths, that to those who Shut their Eyes against the Light, may not so much as <hi>seem</hi> so; and there are <hi>those</hi> who being sensible of the weakness of their understandings, may say of <hi>Very Evident</hi> Truths, <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that seems</hi> or <hi>appears</hi> Evident to <hi>them.</hi> But we shall not in haste, Sir, Catch your Friend at the Extreme of Modesty. For whatsoever <hi>seems</hi> not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with <hi>his</hi> Reason (which we have found to be a Clear and Strong Reason indeed) must be immediately Contrary to <hi>Natural</hi> Reason. And he is onely puzled at Comprehending Gods <hi>ways,</hi> not <hi>God Himself</hi> and <hi>his Glorious Attributes.</hi> And he can <hi>Comprehend</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he <hi>Understands.</hi> And now follows Another of his Modest Sayings, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Proposition we are now upon, <hi>does not so much as seem Evident from Scripture.</hi> And he wishes <hi>I had Cited some of the plainest Texts to my Purpose.</hi> But he hath had Enough of those Cited by <hi>other</hi> Trinitarians; many of which the <hi>Socinians</hi> so play the <hi>Criticks</hi> upon, that should the <hi>same</hi> liberty be taken as to all other Texts, which are Capable of having the same work made with them, the Scriptures would be made a mere <hi>Nose of Wax.</hi>

And by our Saviour <hi>Himself</hi> too, Rev. 2. 23. <hi>I am He which Searcheh the Reins and Hearts.</hi> And the Apostles saying, that in Christ <hi>are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledg,</hi> doth sure <hi>seem</hi> at least to Speak His <hi>Wisdom and Knowledg</hi> boundless or infinite. And those words Rom. 9. 5.—<hi>of whom as Concerning the Flesh Christ came, who is God over All Blessed for Evermore,</hi> do at least <hi>seem</hi> to Speak Him to have the Divine added to the Humane Nature. And those words, Coloss. 2. 9. <hi>In Him dwelleth all the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the God-Head bodily:</hi> And Christ's giving Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the <hi>Title</hi> that is Proper <hi>to God,</hi> in his Saying, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last,</hi> doth likewise <hi>seem</hi> at least to assert the same thing. And so doth <hi>God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi> saying of His <hi>Son, Let All the Angels of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Him;</hi> Especially since it is said, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him onely shalt thou serve.</hi> And the same thing <hi>seems</hi> at least to be implyed too, in that Saying of Christ, <hi>That all men should Honour the Son, as they Honour the Father;</hi> which is, I think, with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honour;</hi> and must at least <hi>seem</hi> to this <hi>man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> so to be.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95338:15"/>
                  <hi>All things were made by Him,</hi> &amp;c. Compared with V. 14. <hi>And the Word was made Flesh,</hi> &amp;c. Do not <hi>these</hi> words at least <hi>seem</hi> to speak the same thing? And <hi>Socinus</hi> his Exposition of them, would at least <hi>seem</hi> to be no true one (tho' there were no such gross Absurditys as the <hi>Arch Bishop,</hi> among others, hath shewn it to be guilty of) since he himself does acknowledg, that he was the First Inventer thereof, and therefore not known till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Fifteen Hundred Years after the Coming of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>And those words, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 6, 7. do <hi>seem</hi> at least to be a Prophecy of <hi>Christ,</hi> viz. <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given. He shall be called Wonderfull, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is it so much as a <hi>Seeming</hi> Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> urge against these words being a Prophecy, that the <hi>first</hi> do run in the <hi>Present</hi> Tense, <hi>viz.</hi> To us a Child <hi>is</hi> born, a Son <hi>is</hi> given, since in that Unquestionable Prophecy of Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. Several of the Praedictions run in both the <hi>Present</hi> and <hi>Praeterper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Tense: As He <hi>is</hi> despised and rejected of Men.

Nor is any thing more Common than this Enallage of <hi>Tenses</hi> in the Hebrew Language. And their rendring the words next following, so as to adapt them to K. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> instead of our Saviour, is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful instance of their offering violence to Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for thus they read them, <hi>The Wonderful Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, shall name him</hi> (viz.

Years. See this in the <hi>Brief History of the Unitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> so much magnified by them, <hi>P.</hi> 20. of the 2d. Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I have, Sir, now given your Friend a Taste, and a <hi>mere</hi> Tast of the plainest Texts to my purpose, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his <hi>Wish;</hi> and notwithstanding my <hi>seems,</hi> which he makes such <hi>a do</hi> with, I am as <hi>Certain</hi> as I can be of any thing of this nature, that <hi>these</hi> Sriptures and Abundance more, do much more than <hi>seem</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of this <hi>Proposition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>H. Ghost,</hi> I need give no other Proof, of His having all the Perfections of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> than what hath bin already said of His being the <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> for since this speaks Him Infinitely Pure and Holy, and I may add too, <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> he must needs have all the other, according to your Friends Assertion, <hi>viz. That they cannot be some in one, and some in another, but must be inseparate, and go together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he <hi>now</hi> betakes himself to Cite Texts <hi>against</hi> Christs having Unlimited Perfections, but he gives us only <hi>two;</hi> one to prove His <hi>Power,</hi> and the other His <hi>Wisdom</hi> to be Limited. That for the Limitedness of His Power, is that saying of our Lord to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Garden, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 52. <hi>Put up again thy Sword,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thinkest thou that I cannot now Pray unto my Father, and He shall presently give me more than Twelve Legions of Angels?</hi> But 1. There is no necessity, that it should be implyed in these words, that Christ had not power to deliver Himself without Praying to His Father for the Help of Angels, or any other help, since Unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Greater Works are Recorded of Him, without any mention of His Praying for Ability to do them: And since he had <hi>twice</hi> before done this very work, when he was as much as <hi>now</hi> in the hands of His Adversaries; as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95338:16"/>
may be seen <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 30. and <hi>John</hi> 10. 39. 2. Our Lord's whole Power being Originally from the Father, he, we find, took all opportunities of giving <hi>Him</hi> the Glory of whatsoever he did. 3. He <hi>now</hi> thought fit to declare in the Ears of His Enemies, how Dear He was to <hi>God,</hi> as much as they Hated Him. And therefore, whereas <hi>One</hi> Legion of Angels could have delivered Him, as well as <hi>Twelve;</hi> nay, one <hi>Angel,</hi> as well as so many <hi>Legions;</hi> yet He saith His Father would send Him <hi>Twelve Legions,</hi> upon His Praying to Him; <hi>i. e.</hi> supposing He could stand in need of them. 4. Our Lord did Industriously Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the <hi>Highest</hi> sence in which He was the Son of God, from those who were so far from being Capable of then receiving that Doctrine, that He knew they would make Him so much the greater Blasphemer upon that account. Nor would it have been so Congruous to His State of Humiliation, for Himself <hi>then</hi> to have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed His Divinity; but <hi>after</hi> His Glorious Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and sending the H. Ghost, according to His Promise, was the <hi>Season</hi> for the doing hereof by the <hi>Apostles:</hi> As particularly St <hi>Chrysostom</hi> hath shewed, in more than one of his <hi>Homelys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Sir, your Friend Attacques Christs Infinite <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> from its being said of the Child Jesus, That <hi>He grew in Wisdom.</hi> But does he think us to have <hi>so</hi> Soft a Place in our Heads, as to believe the Humane Nature of Christ capable of all the Wisdom of the <hi>Divinity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to United? No he does not, for foreseeing what Answer was ready for him, he saith, <hi>If it be Replyed that His Wisdom as God was Infinite, the Scripture does not so much as seem to tell us any thing of Christ, with distinguishing respect to a Supposed Divine Nature, in opposition to an acknowledged Humane.</hi> To pass over the Odd Phrase <hi>[with distinguishing respect]</hi> what if the Scripture saith
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95338:17"/>
nothing of Christs having a Divine Nature in <hi>Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to His Humane, does it not therefore so much as <hi>seem</hi> to tell us any thing of His having a Divine Nature <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> from His Humane? That Text, <hi>God was manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Flesh,</hi> doth <hi>seem</hi> so to do, but I will despair of understanding much of Scripture, if several of the forecited Texts do not much more than <hi>seem</hi> to do it.</p>
               <p>But I have slipped <hi>one</hi> Passage, which 'tis Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to take some notice of, viz. But it may be said, that <hi>all Power in Heaven and Earth, is Committed to Christ.</hi> And he answers, <hi>Tes, to fit Him to be the Great Minister by whom God will Judge the World.</hi> I will interrupt him but while I tell him, I wonder it should not <hi>seem</hi> to him and Every Man, not only strange but impossible, that a <hi>mere Man</hi> (tho' in an Extraordinary manner Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) should be a subject Capable of <hi>Receiving all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Heaven and Earth,</hi> and of Judging the World, both Men and Angels. But he <hi>thus</hi> Proceeds, <hi>But when that Great Day shall be over, that Power, that Fulness of Power, shall be given up to the Great God again.</hi> And I Answer, To what purpose should a Power (or Authority) be longer retained, than while there is any occasion for the Exercise thereof? The Authority rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Christs Mediatory Kingdom must Cease, with the Ceasing of that Kingdom it self. I did not Cite that Text among those I instanced in to prove the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power of the Son of God, and <hi>industriously</hi> declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it upon Considering, That Christ speaks in <hi>those</hi> words of a Power <hi>Committed</hi> to Him, and therefore not <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> in Him; and that by <hi>Power</hi> here is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>Authority,</hi> and a New Authority relating to a New Kingdom. And now what hath he to say to my <hi>12th.</hi> Proposition?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95338:17"/>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 12. It is intolerable presumption to Conclude, that there can be no way besides that of <hi>Creation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by any thing can be immediately and onely from God, which hath a distinct Existence of its own: Or that no Beings can have their Existence from Him, by way of <hi>Necessary Emanation;</hi> since there is a Resemblance of such a thing in <hi>Nature,</hi> viz, The issuing forth of Rays from the <hi>Sun.</hi> And now see a Rare, and as <hi>Charitable</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque upon the <hi>first</hi> words, <hi>It is intolerable Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There is,</hi> saith he, <hi>the very Spirit of the Church in it.</hi> Well, what means he by the <hi>very Spirit of the Church?</hi> it follows, <hi>The Spirit of Degrading and Scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Spirit of Jayling a man, and Ruining his Business; the Spirit of Fining him, and starving his wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: the Spirit of Burning him, and (if anger could do it) Sending him to the Devil.</hi> And instead of sending <hi>me</hi> to the Devil, he makes a <hi>very Devil</hi> of me (which is the <hi>worse</hi> Punishment of the two) as mighty <hi>Good</hi> as he has thought me sometimes, when he and I have had the good luck to jump in our Notions. But why must I be such a Devillish Persecutor merely for <hi>one word?</hi> cannot <hi>this [Intolerable]</hi> bear a more merciful interpretation? I was very unlucky in lighting upon this Epithet, if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; for time has bin, when I <hi>could</hi> have bin a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor but <hi>would</hi> not (and that is more than the <hi>Socinians</hi> can say) nor have I <hi>since</hi> Ever Changed my mind. But I am old Enough to be assured from my own obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, That there is no being secure of any party, that they will never persecute till they have been <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And there is no party (the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves not Excepted) but hath decryed Persecution, while it hath had no <hi>Power,</hi> to Persecute. But, Sir, I will take leave to tell your Friend, that, as great an Enemy of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution as he professeth himself to be, he is <hi>himself</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95338:18"/>
 and a pretty <hi>Fierce</hi> one too. There are more ways of Persecuting than <hi>One,</hi> and a man may Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute with his <hi>Tongue and Pen;</hi> and whosoever can do so with <hi>either of these,</hi> I won't be bound for him, that he will not do it with his <hi>Hand</hi> too, when he hath an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Now <hi>he</hi> Persecutes with his Pen, who Employs it in heavily Censuring his Brother without just cause, but so hath <hi>he</hi> Employed it now against <hi>me.</hi> For I meant no more by <hi>intolerable,</hi> than a <hi>most high</hi> Presumption; nor did you, Sir, I dare say, understand it otherwise; I will not descant upon his <hi>very Spirit of the Church,</hi> I am sure it shews <hi>his</hi> Spirit sufficiently. But, Sir, I thank your Friend for the <hi>Charity</hi> he next expresseth towards his <hi>Persecutor. Let us try,</hi> sayes he,, <hi>whether we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him to himself, and the Spirit of Meekness.</hi> But if I am <hi>restored</hi> to that Spirit, which he cannot say I ever <hi>lost,</hi> it must be by one, to whom I can't reply, <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian heal thy Self.</hi> And do you judge, Sir, whether there is more Heat in my <hi>Propositions,</hi> or <hi>his Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions.</hi> But how will he allay the Fury I have Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>those</hi> words, or rather in that <hi>one</hi> word? He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts it by Saying, <hi>That the Socinians know of no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way but that of Creation, whereby any thing can be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and onely from God.</hi> But I did not say, that 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Presumption not to <hi>know</hi> any other way, but to Conclude there <hi>can</hi> be no other. And I still say, 'tis a wonderful Boldness (to wave <hi>intolerable</hi> because 'tis so <hi>intolerable to him)</hi> so to Conclude, tho' no other way should be known to <hi>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the way of <hi>necessary Emanation,</hi> he saith <hi>it is the Supposal of a thing, where of we have no Idea.</hi> Well, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this, is it <hi>impossible</hi> for a thing to be, of which <hi>we sorry</hi> Mortals have no <hi>Idea?</hi> Is God Almighty bound to give us <hi>Ideas</hi> of the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> how any thing <hi>can</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95338:18"/>
be Produced by him? Or <hi>how</hi> what we know does Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist <hi>is</hi> Produced? Or to give us Ideas of Every <hi>thing</hi> that he can Produce? Or of Every thing that He <hi>hath</hi> Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? Sure your Friend will not dare to answer <hi>yes</hi> to the two <hi>latter</hi> of these Questions, and much <hi>less</hi> (then) to the two <hi>former.</hi> And if he be not <hi>So daring,</hi> with what face could he object against the possibility of a <hi>Necessary Emanation</hi> from God, because we have <hi>no Idea</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? But I tell him, we have Every whit as much an Idea of <hi>Necessary Emanation,</hi> as of <hi>voluntary Creation,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thereby <hi>the making of Something out of Nothing.</hi> Which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Followers thought an <hi>impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Ex Nihilo nihil fit;</hi> or <hi>Nothing is made out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> being a Maxim of theirs. And therefore they held both the Eternity and Self Existence of the Matter of the World. And the <hi>Platonists</hi> thought the Idea of <hi>Necessary Emanation,</hi> at <hi>least</hi> as Clear as that of <hi>Creation;</hi> and the Younger Platonists for the most part held <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls</hi> to be by Such an Emanation from the Deity, and therefore to be <hi>Eternal,</hi> tho' not <hi>Self-Existent.</hi> But he saith, That <hi>something should come from God which wants some Perfection that God has, is</hi> AT's (that is <hi>my) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Supposition, under the name of Necessary Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>I say,</hi> it would be a Prodigious Supposition <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> that any thing should come from God, that hath the Perfection of His <hi>manner of Existence;</hi> or that any thing can have it's Existence from <hi>God,</hi> and be <hi>Self-Existent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, <hi>he will display,</hi> he saith, <hi>the Absurdity and impossibility of this Necessary Emanation, in two or three Questions;</hi> and, I thank him, in Consideration of <hi>my Soft place,</hi> he himself answers them for me. Q. 1. <hi>Was God Conscious to the Emanation?</hi> Yes saith he, <hi>Else His un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95338:19"/>
                  <hi>is not infinite.</hi> Q 2. <hi>Was He sensible of the Necessity? Yes</hi> again, for the same reason. And I answer <hi>yes, yes</hi> too, though he has Excused me. But now, when I have most need of his help, he leaves me to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for my Self, to a stabbing Consequence from those Concessions, viz. <hi>But then it follows, that he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to one thing, and sensible that He was so.</hi> I will <hi>here</hi> too adventure to give him <hi>two more Yesses. Then,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds he, <hi>there is some Power above Him, or such a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is the Law of His Nature; the former,</hi> he saith, <hi>cannot be, because God is the Supreme Being.</hi> And he would have done like himself, had he given us a <hi>reason,</hi> why nothing can be <hi>above</hi> the Supreme Being. <hi>Nor,</hi> saith he, <hi>can the latter, because neither Reason, nor Scripture, describes God by any such Law.</hi> But, being aware that this is too difficult for <hi>my</hi> Brains, he tells me, <hi>he'l make the matter Plain by a Question.</hi> I see he's Excellent at <hi>Questions,</hi> and his Question is <hi>this, By what Evident Principle of Reason, or what Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, does it appear to be the Law of an Infinite Nature, to beget Infinite Power, Wisdom, Goodness; and that in a Being that must want Self-Existence, and being the Maker of all things?</hi> I answer, That if he hath any Idea of the thing called <hi>Non-sense,</hi> and any true <hi>mark</hi> to find it by, he cannot <hi>miss</hi> of it in this Question. But <hi>who</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver talked of the Fathers Begetting infinite Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodness in any Being; or otherwise than of His Begetting an infinitely Powerful, Wise and Good Being? And now comes a <hi>Third</hi> Question, <hi>Does the Idea of an infinitely Perfect Being, Evidently imply the Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Emanation of another Being?</hi> This Question, sure, he asked for <hi>askings sake;</hi> For he knows I desired to have no more granted me, than that it is not <hi>impossible,</hi> or there is no <hi>Absurdity</hi> in it, That Beings may have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95338:19"/>
from God by way of Necessary Emanation. And now for the 13. Proposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 13. It is no less Presumption to Affirm, That it is a Contradiction to say, that a BEING can be from all ETERNITY from God the Father, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it Possible that it may be from Him, in an higher and more Excellent way, than that of <hi>Creation;</hi> since the <hi>Sun,</hi> tho' it is the <hi>Cause</hi> of Light, is onely in order of <hi>Nature</hi> before it. To <hi>this</hi> he saith, <hi>First, That for one Being to be from all Eternity from the Eternal Father, is a Contradiction one degree more Absurd, than barely two Eternals.</hi> Not to tell him, that <hi>I</hi> have hitherto thought, that <hi>all</hi> Contradictions are <hi>alike</hi> Absurd; how does he <hi>Prove</hi> this to be in <hi>any</hi> degree an Absurd Contradiction? He saith, that it is so, is <hi>the most manifest thing in the World.</hi> If I demand a Proof now hereof, I should affront him, had I not already Catcht him at proving (after his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) <hi>the most manifest thing in the World.</hi> But I need not <hi>demand</hi> a proof hereof, for he presently sets about it. And the <hi>Argument</hi> whereby he proves this <hi>most manifest thing in the World</hi> is <hi>this, We neither have, nor can have, any notion of Proceeding, or Being from Another, but what implyes the Proceeder who derives his Being, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi> (he should have said <hi>Posteriour) to that other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in order of Time.</hi> In truth, 'tis a pleasant thing to see Men <hi>all of a Piece.</hi> This is perfectly like <hi>his</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing; that is, Proving <hi>the most Manifest</hi> thing, by what is <hi>less</hi> manifest; nay, this is proving it by what is <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry false.</hi> He saith, we have no Notion of such a thing, and I have already told him, that a thing may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless <hi>be,</hi> for <hi>our</hi> having no Notion of it. But he also saith, we <hi>can</hi> have none; here's <hi>Confidence</hi> too like his own, but let him speak for <hi>himself,</hi> and not say <hi>We;</hi> for <hi>I</hi> both <hi>can</hi> have, and <hi>have</hi> some Notion of such a thing,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95338:20"/>
and so may any one that pleaseth; for such a thing is a daily Object of our <hi>Sight?</hi> Of which <hi>anon,</hi> after I have Considered 2. <hi>more</hi> of his Wise sayings. <hi>The Absurdity and impossibility,</hi> saith he, <hi>of deriving Existence from God, by a more Excellent way than that of Creation, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made manifest.</hi> But if any Man of sense be found to be herein of his mind, I will never trust <hi>my</hi> sense more, in the most Manifest matters. And <hi>then</hi> he sayes, <hi>I therefore Conclude, that Eternal Generation cannot be proved by it, unless it can be made to appear, that a true Notion is a necessary Consequence of a false.</hi> But, Sir, Can you think it possible, that your Friend should do such mighty Feats as he makes his Brags of, since he cannot distinguish between, <hi>Denying a thing to be Contradictions and Impossible,</hi> and <hi>Asserting the truth of it.</hi> And if he knows not, that the <hi>Proof</hi> of such a thing as <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation,</hi> was now none of <hi>my</hi> business; and much more, if he needs to be told, that I only affirmed that there is no Contradiction therein to Natural Reason, 'tis hard to say, whether <hi>he</hi> was more weak in offering to Animadvert on my Propositions, or <hi>I</hi> in troubling my self with taking any notice of his Animadversions.</p>
               <p>And now we come to the Instance I give in <hi>this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> of an Effect every whit as Old as the Cause of it; and your Friend being come to it too, asks me <hi>How I know, that the Sun is the cause of Light?</hi> And adds, <hi>by the Revelation of School-Divines perhaps, not by the History of the Bible; for, if the Account of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in</hi> Genesis, <hi>be to be taken in a litteral sence, that will Convince me of a Philosophical Errour; for there 'tis said, That God made the Light the first day, the Sun not till the fourth.</hi> But, Sir, did you ever meet with such Triflng? <hi>First,</hi> He saith, perhaps I have learnt that the Sun is the cause of Light, <hi>from the Revelation of School-Divines.</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95338:20"/>
How well was this Flurt bestowed on <hi>me,</hi> since he knew what a Veneration I Exprest for those Divines, in my last Proposition? <hi>Secondly,</hi> He saith, I could not have this rare Notion, <hi>from the History of the Bible; because the Book of</hi> Genesis <hi>saith, that Light was made the first day, and the Sun the fourth.</hi> Admirable I profess! Sure this Man hath himself been dabling with the School-men, he's so Subtil. But what if I grant him, that <hi>that</hi> Light which was Created before the Sun, the Sun was not the cause of? Does it follow thence, that the Sun is the cause of <hi>no</hi> Light? My <hi>Candle</hi> is the cause of the Light I now write by, therefore the <hi>Sun</hi> is not the cause of <hi>any</hi> Light. But whereas I humbly Conceive (after all) that the Sun <hi>is</hi> the Cause of Light, I owe this my Opinion neither to the <hi>History of the Bible,</hi> nor to the <hi>Schools,</hi> but to a certain thing called <hi>Eye-sight;</hi> and for this Satisfaction he owes me thanks. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> saith he, <hi>The Sun is the Cause of Light! He may as well say, The Sun is the Cause of the Sun; and the Light of Light; or any thing whatsoever is the Cause of its own Nature.</hi> But why so I beseech him? Are the Sun and Light the self-same thing? Then a <hi>Glow-worm</hi> hath the Sun in the Tayl of it. And then, the Light was <hi>not</hi> made 3. days before the <hi>Sun,</hi> for all the Book of <hi>Genesis.</hi> But if he please to give any Credit to his own <hi>Eyes,</hi> he will be tempted to think, that the Body of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the Light which comes in at his <hi>Windows</hi> are <hi>two</hi> things. But at last we find him in a <hi>good humour;</hi> for, <hi>well then,</hi> saith he, <hi>be it granted him, that the Sun and the Light which proceeds from it did begin to Co-Exist in the same moment of time, but then they cannot be the cause of one another.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> must be <hi>still</hi> a little Cross, and say, <hi>First,</hi> That I will not have it granted me, that they did begin to Co-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist in the same moment, for I am satisfied to have them
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95338:21"/>
begin only to <hi>Exist</hi> in the same moment. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall he grant it to me, that therefore they are the Cause of <hi>One another;</hi> for I was so reasonable as to be Content to have but <hi>one</hi> of them the Cause of the <hi>other.</hi> But now <hi>he</hi> is Cross again, and saith, <hi>That thing which is the Cause of another, must be in respect of Time before the other thing, whereof it is the Cause.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In sober Sadness, my Friend, he might have spared all his other Wise talk, and only have told me <hi>this</hi> and he had done his Business. For 'tis as much as if he had said, <hi>Let the Sun be the Cause of Light, with all my heart, and let them begin to Exist together too, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I would have you know, that whatsoever thing is the Cause of another thing must be in order of Time before it: And for once take my word for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, to my Comfort, we are Come to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> of this Ammadversion, <hi>viz. What</hi> A. T. <hi>means by Order of Nature, I am not sure that I can guess, for I am not much Versed in School-Jargon; yet guessing at his meaning, I tell him, That I can no more Conceive the Sun without the Light which proceeds from it, than the Light that proceeds from the Sun, from whence it does proceed. This</hi> Sentence is long Enough too, to be taken to pieces.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He saith, <hi>he is not sure that he can guess,</hi> and yet <hi>does</hi> guess. But my School-learning tells me, that if he is sure he <hi>does</hi> guess, he is sure he <hi>can</hi> guess.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He saith, he is not much Versed in <hi>School-</hi>Jargon, that is to say, he is Verst in <hi>Jargon,</hi> but not in <hi>School-</hi>Jargon. And, because we will part fairly I am willing he should know, that I believe <hi>both</hi> these Propositions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He saith, <hi>he is not sure that he can guess, what</hi> A. T. <hi>means by Order of Nature.</hi> As if Priority in order of Nature, and in Order of Time were a Distinction of <hi>my</hi> Coyning, like <hi>that</hi> of Intelligible, and Incomprehensible.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95338:21"/>
I perceive he is as great a Philosopher, as School-Divine if he never before met with <hi>that</hi> Distinction, which is much more Ancient than the <hi>most</hi> Ancient of the <hi>School-men,</hi> or than <hi>Christianity</hi> it self. But if he hath Ever met with that Distinction before, he might have Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, that what <hi>I</hi> mean by it, is but what <hi>other</hi> Folk have Ever meant.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He saith, <hi>I can no more Conceive the Sun without the Light that Pooceeds from it, than this Light without the Sun.</hi> No nor can <hi>I</hi> neither, for I can Perfectly well Conceive them <hi>both.</hi> I can Conceive the <hi>Sun</hi> abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from any other Light, than what is in the <hi>Body</hi> of it; and I can Conceive too Every jot as well of the Light in <hi>my House</hi> at Noon-day, abstracted from the <hi>Sun:</hi> And so can <hi>he</hi> too, if his great Modesty would but let him think so. But we must not forget the <hi>last</hi> words of this his Conclusion, <hi>viz. Thus I reckon to have done Justice to</hi> A. T's. <hi>13th. Proposition, not forgetting the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Similitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>I</hi> reckon I have done no <hi>injustice</hi> to his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions, on <hi>this</hi> or any other of my Propositions; and whether <hi>he</hi> be out in <hi>his</hi> Reckoning, or <hi>1</hi> in <hi>mine,</hi> let any man of his <hi>own</hi> Chusing be judg, that has but <hi>Common-sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 14. Those two Propositions do Speak our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the H. Trinity, to be as Contrary to <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi> as to <hi>Socinianism;</hi> since the <hi>Arians</hi> assert, that there was at least a Moment of time, when the Son was not, and that He is a <hi>Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On this he sayes nothing, that I can be Concerned to reply too, unless I delighted in Exposing him, for Exposings sake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 15. Tho' we cannot understand, how it should be no Contradiction to affirm, that the three Persons are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95338:22"/>
but one numerical Being, yet hath it no Appearance of a Contradiction to say, That there is an Unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably Close and inseparable Union, both in <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> between them. And <hi>here</hi> too is very little to draw a Reply from me, Except I delighted in <hi>Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi> as much as <hi>he</hi> does; but two or three Passages I can't well let go. He saith, <hi>It is a very Stange Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for men to determine, that such or such a Notion is true, which they cannot Conceive is true.</hi> But I. How comes <hi>Boldness</hi> all oth' suddain to be such a <hi>Crime</hi> with this Gentleman? 2. How comes that Proposition by such a Remarque as <hi>this?</hi> since it Speaks nothing of the <hi>Truth</hi> of any Notion, but affirms one Notion, to have no Appearance of a <hi>Contradiction</hi> in it. Nor does he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a <hi>word</hi> to shew that there is any Contradiction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or any <hi>Appearance</hi> thereof; which a <hi>Wise</hi> man would believe to be his <hi>onely</hi> Business, could such a one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take Confuting of this Proposition. 3. Who are they that <hi>determine</hi> any Notion to be true, while they cannot <hi>Conceive</hi> it to be so?</p>
               <p>And another Saying he hath here, which further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates what a deadly Enemy he is to <hi>the</hi> Crime <hi>Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> viz. <hi>A Close and inseparable Union between God and Christ, there cannot be; unless he means such a Union as is between different Natures; but that will not content him, yet 'tis all that can be granted.</hi> But I much doubt, that <hi>this</hi> is much <hi>more</hi> than <hi>he</hi> will grant; I fear he will not grant, That God the Father and his Begotten Son, are as Closely United as are <hi>his Soul and Body,</hi> the Natures of which are as different, as the Natures of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny two Created things can be; and their Union with Each other so <hi>Close</hi> (tho' not inseparable) that he is as unable to give an account of <hi>this</hi> Union as of <hi>that</hi> which Trinitarians do believe to be between <hi>God the Father, the Son and the H. Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95338:22"/>
But he saith, <hi>The Nature of God the Father includes Perfections, which are not in the Nature of Jesus Christ;</hi> and from thence Concludes that such a Union as the forementioned cannot be between them. To which, I am loth to repeat what I have so often said, That the Fathers Self-Existence, with what is there in imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is a Perfection immediately relating to <hi>His manner of Existence</hi> But however, are there not many Perfections, or Excellent Powers and Properties in <hi>Souls,</hi> which are not in <hi>Bodys?</hi> And yet the Union between them (as was said) is too <hi>Close</hi> for us to give an Account thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 16. Such an Union as this between them, being acknowleg'd by us, together with the forementioned intire Dependance of the <hi>Son</hi> and H. <hi>Spirit</hi> upon the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her;</hi> the <hi>Unity</hi> of the Deity is as fully, to all intents and purposes, asserted by us, as it is necessary or desirable it should be. But to <hi>this,</hi> Sir, as he saith very <hi>little,</hi> so not a <hi>line</hi> that I can reply a new word to; nor a <hi>Syllable</hi> is here of <hi>Confutation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 17. And no part of this Explication, do we think Repugnant to any Text of Scripture, but it seems to be the best and <hi>Easiest</hi> way of Reconciling those Texts, which according to the other Hypotheses, are not Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable, but by offering Extreme Violence to them.</p>
               <p>Now to <hi>this</hi> he saith, That <hi>he is infinitely certain, that this Explication is in a great part Repugnant to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Texts of Scripture, and to many Self-Evident Principles of Reason.</hi> But not <hi>one</hi> of those many Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, does he instance in, and we have <hi>seen</hi> what work he makes with <hi>Self-Evident Principles.</hi> Nor is <hi>here</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Offer at a <hi>Confutation,</hi> Except his calling me an <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malite Trinitarian</hi> be so, <hi>whose hand is against all the Heads of the Trinitarian-Expositors, and all their hands against</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:95338:23"/>
                  <hi>me;</hi> and a scareing Threat, how <hi>Merciless—would Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose me,</hi> and that he would do it <hi>at another kind of rate than he hath done.</hi> But I say, should he Expose me at the <hi>Same</hi> rate, he would be merciless to <hi>himself</hi> onely. But since he saith, that <hi>my hand is against all the Heads of Trinitarian Expositors,</hi> 'tis Enough to tell him that 'tis <hi>false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 18. The <hi>Socinians</hi> must Confess, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Father,</hi> is as much as they can desire taken Care of by this Explication; nor can the Honour of the <hi>Son and H. Ghost</hi> be more Consulted in any Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the H. Trinity, than it is in <hi>this?</hi> It ascribing to them all Perfections, but what they cannot have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the most Manifest Contradiction. Now the <hi>first</hi> thing he here saith, that I ought to take notice of, is, <hi>That he who gives more to an Excellent Person, than of Right belongs to him, may perhaps be in a great part Excused for the sake of his good intention, but must never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless always be chid for the injury he offers to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by giving too much to him, he brings the just mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his real Excellency into Question.</hi> Now instead of an <hi>Answer,</hi> I would ask <hi>him</hi> one Question more, who has askt <hi>me</hi> so many, <hi>viz.</hi> which is the Safer of the <hi>Two Extremes,</hi> To think of the <hi>Son and H. Ghost more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> honourably than we ought, Provided that God the <hi>Fathers</hi> Honour be not in the least intrenched upon? Sure, 'tis impossible for any sincere Christian <hi>not</hi> to Chuse to Err on the <hi>Right-Hand,</hi> if he must Err on <hi>One.</hi> On <hi>that</hi> Hand we chuse to Err in our Opinion of <hi>whomsoever</hi> we have a Respect and value for. Now if the Honour of the <hi>Father</hi> be as much as can be taken care of in this our Explication; and we believe <hi>it is,</hi> since he is made the <hi>Original</hi> of all the Excellencies and Perfections, that are in the other Persons, and of their <hi>Existence.</hi> And
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95338:23"/>
since there are so great a Number of Texts, which have more than seemed to the Generality of Christians (and to all but a <hi>small handful</hi> since <hi>Arianism</hi> went off the Stages to give the Perfections of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> to <hi>these</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, surely the <hi>Love and Esteem</hi> which all good Soul) must necessarily have for them, must needs byass them towards the Understanding of Scripture in <hi>that</hi> sence, which makes <hi>most</hi> for their Honour, provided it be not Forced and too Artificial; and Provided, I say again, the <hi>Father</hi> loseth no Honour thereby.</p>
               <p>Again he saith, <hi>That, to his knowledge, the</hi> Socinians <hi>are not willing to Confess that the Honour of the Father is as much taken care of in this Explicaiion, as they do wish it were.</hi> But he offers not at any reason, <hi>why</hi> they are not willing to Confess <hi>this.</hi> But sure they will not say, that their <hi>own</hi> Hypothesis doth give more Honour to the Father, than <hi>that</hi> which speaks him the Author of <hi>all</hi> that the other Persons either <hi>have</hi> or <hi>are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, he saith, <hi>That the Scripture no where tells us, that Jesus Christ, or the Holy Ghost desired to be accounted God: That Jesus Christ did not command nor desire Divine Honours to be paid Him is plain, in that when he taught His Disciples to Pray, He did not propound Himself as the Object of Prayer, but directed them to Address them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Father.</hi> To <hi>this</hi> I Reply,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That suppose neither of these Persons is said in Scripture to <hi>desire</hi> to be accounted God, are there there fore no Texts which speak of either of them as God? I have I think sufficiently minded him of the Contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How can he say that Jesus Christ desired not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honours to be paid to Him? (Except he means, that he desired none to be paid him while He was on <hi>Earth)</hi> when He hath told us <hi>John</hi> 5. 23. that <hi>The Father hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Judgment to the Son; That all Men should Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95338:24"/>
                  <hi>the Son, even as they Honour the Father.</hi> And are not all the <hi>Glorious Angels Commanded by the Father to Worship His Son?</hi> Heb. 1. 6. And is not <hi>Eternal Glory</hi> given to Him, <hi>Apocal.</hi> 1. 5, 6. <hi>Now to Him that loved us, and washed us from our Sins in His own Blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God, and His Father: To Him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever?</hi> And will not all such Texts speak Him an Object of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, because that in the Days of His <hi>Humiliation,</hi> He expressed no desire of being so; but still gave all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of whatsoever He did to His Father?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I doubt from <hi>this</hi> Passage, that your Friend is gone <hi>beyond</hi> his Master <hi>Socinus,</hi> and denyeth the <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rability of the Son of God,</hi> for which <hi>he</hi> was a Zealous Champion. I am heartily Sorry for him, if it be so; this being (to speak modestly) to make a very large Step towards being no Christian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 19. And one would think it impossible, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christian should not be easily perswaded, to think as Honourably of his Redeemer and Sanctifier, as ever he is able, while he Robs not God the Father for their Sake; and doth not offer any violence either to the sence and meaning of Divine Revelations, or to the Reason of his Mind. To <hi>this</hi> he Replys,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That <hi>Saving the Honour of the Father Intire and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>injured, the</hi> Socinians <hi>think as Honourably of the Son, as any Men whatsoever.</hi> I Answer, Surely the <hi>Arians</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Him is far more Honourable than the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who will not allow Him to be other than a <hi>mere Man,</hi> nor to have had a Being before He was in the Womb of the Virgin; whereas the <hi>Arians</hi> Doctrine is, that He hath a <hi>Super-Angelical</hi> Nature, and that He was <hi>before all Worlds,</hi> and that the Father Created them by <hi>Him;</hi> and yet they Consult the Honour of the <hi>Father,</hi> as much as the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> can no; they making <hi>all</hi> that belongs to the <hi>Son</hi> to be from <hi>Him.</hi>

II. He saith, that <hi>some of the</hi> Socinians <hi>think as Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably too of the H. Ghost; tho' 'tis to be Confessed, that others do think the H. Ghost to be a Divine Energy or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and not a Person; whether of the</hi> two <hi>is not plainly revealed, and my Antagonist does not tempt me to dispute the Question.</hi> Not to Reflect upon your Friends wisely calling me <hi>his Antagonist,</hi> who had nothing <hi>then</hi> to do with him, don't those <hi>Socinians</hi> that believe the <hi>H.

And whereas he saith, <hi>It is not Plainly revealed whether the H. Ghost be a Person or no?</hi> I say, it is as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed, as that the <hi>Father himself</hi> is a Person; nor can any one be more plainly spoken of as a Person, than the <hi>H. Ghost</hi> still is by our <hi>B. Lord.</hi> But some Men will dispute <hi>any</hi> thing; and <hi>some</hi> too, who <hi>little understand</hi> the Knack of disputing.</p>
               <p n="3">III. He saith, <hi>That to think as Honourably as possibly we can, of any Person, besides God the Father Almighty, is not our duty.</hi> But I hope I need not tell him, that <hi>Id Solùm Possumus, quod Jure Possumus. We can only do that, which we can lawfully do.</hi> And he knew I could mean no other by <hi>Possibly</hi> can, than <hi>Lawfully can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. He saith, <hi>We are to think but just so Honourably of Jesus Christ, as God directs us in the New Testament.</hi> And I say, what ever directions we have what to think of Him in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> too, are also to govern our thoughts concerning Him. And we are wholly led by the <hi>H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to think so much more Honourably both of <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>H.

               <p n="5">V. He saith, <hi>That we must leave it to God, who will be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured above all things He hath made, and will not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate His Honour to Another, to appoint what Honour</hi>

                  <hi>shall be done to His Son.</hi> And <hi>we</hi> say so too; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wholly take our direction in this Point from Divine Revelation. And that saying of God Almighty's, that <hi>He will not give His Glory to another;</hi> or to any one of His <hi>Creatures,</hi> Confirms us in our Belief, that the Son of God is not a <hi>Creature;</hi> since <hi>He will have us to Honour Him, Even as we Honour Himself.</hi> And whereas the <hi>Socinians</hi> say, that God will have Him so Honoured, as He is His Ambassador, and Representative, I Answer, that so An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have often been too, and yet (as I need not tell them) it was ever <hi>Idolatry</hi> to pay Religious Honour to them, upon any account. An <hi>Angel</hi> that was sent on an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy to St <hi>John,</hi> said to him, upon his falling down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>See thou do it not, for I am thy Fellow-Servant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Worship God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus have I replyed to every thing in <hi>this</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion too, that I have not already spoken, more than once, to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 20. There are many things in the Notion of <hi>One God,</hi> which all hearty <hi>Theists</hi> will own are Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be Conceived of Him, that are every whit as much above the reach and Comprehension of Humane Understandings, as is any part of this Explication of the Trinity. Nay <hi>this</hi> may be affirmed, Even of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Self-Existence:</hi> But yet there is not an <hi>Atheist</hi> so silly as to call it in question; since it is not more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Two</hi> do make <hi>Three,</hi> than that there could never have been <hi>any</hi> thing, if there were not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Being, which was <hi>always,</hi> and never <hi>began</hi> to be.</p>
               <p>To <hi>this</hi> he only replys, <hi>That there are many things di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary, to Self-Evident Principles in this Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and he trusts he hath Plainly proved it.</hi> And, Sir, do you judge, as much as he is your Friend, how he has Proved it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95338:25"/>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 21. Lest <hi>Novelty</hi> should be Objected against this Explication, and so such as have a veneration for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> (as it becomes <hi>all</hi> to have) should be prejudiced against it, we can make it Evident, that it very well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the Account, which the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself) and others of the Ancients who have treated of this Subject, do in divers Places of their Works, give of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> And had it not bin sor the Subtil <hi>School-men</hi> (to whom CHRISTIANITY is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beholden) we have reason to believe, that the World, since the Fall of <hi>Arianism,</hi> would never have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with such Controversies about this great Point, as it hath bin and Continues to be.</p>
               <p>Now to <hi>this</hi> your Friend saith,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Novelty is the least Objection I have against his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, but 'tis a good Exception, which he will never be able to answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>this</hi> Proposition tells him, I am prepared to shew, that this Explication agreeth very well with the Account that the <hi>Ancients</hi> do give of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> And therefore he might have had the Patience to have seen whether 'twas a Vain Boast or no, before he had so Confidently Pronounced me forever unable to answer the Objection of <hi>Novelty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He saith, <hi>I can hardly think that his Hypothesis, take it altogether, will down with any</hi> Trinitarian. But I Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy that if he did not Mistrust it would down with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he would not be so Angry, as he <hi>is,</hi> with it. And now,</p>
               <p n="3">3. He gives me his Parting Blow, and it is a <hi>Stunner,</hi> viz. <hi>And as for Ancient Fathers, how weak a thing is it, to seek Credit to An Hypothesis, upon the account of their Concurring!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:95338:26"/>
But, but now, <hi>Novelty</hi> he acknowledg'd to be a <hi>good Exception,</hi> tho' the <hi>least Objection,</hi> of which Distinction between <hi>Objection</hi> and <hi>Exception,</hi> himself must have the Honour, and 'tis as <hi>Wise</hi> a one, as <hi>mine</hi> between <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible</hi> and <hi>Comprehensible</hi> is a <hi>Weak</hi> one; but how is <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty</hi> any <hi>Exception</hi> against an Hypothesis, if the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Judgments of <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> can give <hi>no Credit</hi> to it? But whereas I called this Blow a <hi>Stunner,</hi> I was in too good Earnest,; for these his last Words do as Perfectly Amaze <hi>me,</hi> as my now mentioned Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did <hi>him.</hi> And since <hi>Stunned</hi> People are not good at Talking, I have no more to say, but that I know not, whether there be more of Arrogance than Ignorance, or of Ignorance than Arrogance in <hi>these</hi> words.</p>
               <p>And now, Sir, if you shall think that I have Treated your Friend with too much Freedom, and have given him too Course a Farewell, the onely Apology I can make for it, is, That I find him such a sort of Adversary, as would not Permit me to Treat him otherwise.</p>
               <p>However, the Liberty he hath taken with <hi>me,</hi> hath not the least Influence upon my <hi>Spleen,</hi> and I wish him as well as you <hi>know</hi> I do <hi>your self.</hi> And particularly, that he may learn to be more Modest, and think it Possible that those Opinions which he takes for most Evident and most Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Truths, may be as Gross and Dangerous Errors; and that his Understanding is not so much above the Pitch os other fallible Mortals, but that he may be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily Mistaken when he is most Confident. And I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily Pray, that you <hi>both</hi> may with all Sincerity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality Consider what is here offered to you, and that God would give us all a right Understanding in all Divine Truths.

            <p>THERE are other <hi>Trinitarians</hi> Concerned with me, in this Gentlemans Book of <hi>Reflexions</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Title-Page.</hi> His <hi>7th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Conteins those he hath made upon the 28. <hi>Propositions,</hi> which consists of 15. <hi>Sections,</hi> that begin with <hi>Numb.</hi> 56. The <hi>First</hi> is no more than a <hi>Recital</hi> of 3. or 4. of my Propositions. The Writer saith upon them,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 57. 1. <hi>That two Infinite Substances should E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane from one Infinite Substance, is so gross a Notion, that I wonder any Man of Sense should be guilty of it: And my Reason is, because all Infinites, of what sort or nature soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, are equal; for if one Infinite be less than another, there must be some</hi> Terminus <hi>Bound or End of it, and Consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cannot be Infinite, of which there can be no Bound or End; or if one Infinite were any ways more than another, there would be somewhat more than Infinite; which is Evidently Absurd: Therefore to suppose two Infinites to Emane from one, is to suppose two to Emane from one, when each is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the one from which it Emanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, and in the remaining part of this <hi>Section,</hi> is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration with a <hi>Witness</hi> against the Ancient Fathers Hypothesis, of the <hi>Sons and H. Spirits being from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity by Emanation;</hi> and against <hi>my</hi> Hypothesis, of the <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility hereof.</hi> I will take a little more Liberty with this Subtil Gentleman, when I am better acquainted with him (as I shall be quickly) than I will at <hi>present.</hi> For he may think it no good Breeding to tell him <hi>homely</hi> all my mind, at our very <hi>first</hi> Meeting. But now a <hi>Complement</hi> is more
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95338:27"/>
Civil, as I thank him, he begins with too great a one to <hi>me.</hi> And my Complement is, <hi>Sir, I Commend your Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Changing all along</hi> my <hi>Phrases,</hi> viz. <hi>Beings whose Perfections are unlimited,</hi> and <hi>who have all they can have without a most manifest Contradiction,</hi> for a Phrase I not once use in my <hi>Propositions,</hi> viz. <hi>Infinite Substances;</hi> because I understand it nothing so well as those Phrases. And I say he did <hi>Wisely</hi> herein, Since had he used <hi>my</hi> Phrases, this Section would not have looked quite so scaringly. But let the Reader still put one of my Phrases in the place of <hi>Infinite Substances,</hi> and then Consider whether Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions would so Immediately and at first Sight seem to appear in this <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I shall deliver my mind a little more freely to him, relating to the matter of <hi>this</hi> Section when I come to his 63d.</p>
            <p>But I have not so done with <hi>this,</hi> but shall farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it sayes. And be he pleased to take notice, that there is <hi>nothing</hi> in this Acute Arguing, except he means by <hi>Infinite Substances,</hi> Substances of an Infinite <hi>Quantity,</hi> or Bigness. But I hope he will be so far from attributing Quantity or Bigness to the Substance of the <hi>Deity,</hi> that he will not do it to the Substance of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> or <hi>Humane Soul.</hi> 2. It next follows, <hi>To suppose one Infinite Substance to Emane from another, is to suppose the whole entire Substance to Emane from it self.</hi> But this I deny, and do Acknowledg that if I granted it, I must without any farther troubling either <hi>him</hi> or any of his Brethren, bid adieu to the <hi>Fathers</hi> Hypothesis they are so displeased with, as a plainly Contradictions one: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it asserts a real Distinction of the Divine Substances, tho' no Difference in them. It follows 3. <hi>And what makes it stranger, is, that the two Infinite Substances Emaned from the Fathers single Substance, yet there was no diminution</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95338:27"/>
               <hi>in the Substance of the Father; it is as Infinite as it was at first.</hi> But how should <hi>this</hi> make the Hypothesis <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> when it would be the Strangest thing in the World, if the Divine Substance were Capable of the least Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution, since those that believe <hi>Spiritual</hi> Substances, know that none of <hi>them</hi> are: But <hi>anon</hi> a little more of <hi>this. But it may be said,</hi> saith he, 4. <hi>Why may not one Infinite, as well as one Finite, proceed from another?</hi> And then he thus answers himself, <hi>But nothing can be more absurd, than to suppose one Finite (much more two) to Proceed from one but of the same Bigness.</hi> Yes, I'le tell him what is <hi>more Absurd,</hi> viz. To suppose one or more <hi>Infinite</hi> Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to Proceed from another <hi>Infinite</hi> Substance of the <hi>same Bigness.</hi> This is more Absurd, because there is one more Contradiction in <hi>this</hi> Supposition than in <hi>that, viz.</hi> That Bigness belongs to a Spiritual Substance; which kind of Substance, I hope he will acknowledg to be <hi>alone</hi> Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Infinity.</p>
            <p>But as notable Work as our Author makes, at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating the Absurdity of two infinite Substances Emaning from <hi>one,</hi> I fancy I know those who may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as much put <hi>him</hi> to it, to defend the <hi>Non-Absurdity</hi> of a <hi>Sparks</hi> being kindled by (or <hi>Emaning</hi> from) a Spark (both being of the same bigness) as a <hi>Trinitarian</hi> shall need to be by <hi>his</hi> Arguments (I will not be so <hi>rude</hi> as to Call them <hi>Cavils)</hi> against the Possibility of the Other Emanation.</p>
            <p>But to use his <hi>own</hi> Phrase <hi>infinite Substance,</hi> 'tis so far from being impossible, that an infinite Substance, should Emane from an infinite Substance, or (to use the <hi>Scripture-</hi>Phrase) be <hi>begotten</hi> by it, that if any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can Emane or be begotten by an infinite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, it <hi>must</hi> be infinite too. For, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> saith, <note place="margin">Orat. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>It is impossible that that which is begotten, should be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:95338:28"/>
               <hi>Essence from that which Begat.</hi> The Reader may see what is farther said of <hi>Emanations,</hi> in <hi>2d Defence</hi> p. 26. I have abundantly too much business lying <hi>now</hi> upon my hands, to find Leisure for so Close a Consideration of all that this Gentleman hath reflected on the 28. Propositions, as possibly I might apply my self to, had I time to Spare. But the Truth is, I find his Arguing to be such, as if well followed upon Other Arguments, it might make those, who are willing to be so, down right Scepticks, as to almost Every thing.</p>
            <p>He needs not to be informed, what doughty Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a Sophister might shew in making it out, that <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a Perfect Impossibility:</hi> That <hi>Eternity in both the Notions thereof, is a Monstrous Contradiction to the Reason of our Minds.</hi> And that <hi>so</hi> is also the <hi>Notion of an Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Substance.</hi> And of <hi>Liberty,</hi> nay even in God Himself: And of <hi>the Divine Omnipresence:</hi> And that <hi>both parts of a Contradiction may possibly be true.</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a <hi>thousand</hi> other things, for which we have the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Rational</hi> Evidence, may be Exposed to Ridicule, by a Man who loves to <hi>Chop Logick.</hi> And likewise a <hi>many</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, the Contrarys to which, we have even <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> and the most <hi>Sensible</hi> demonstrations of, may one make such a shew of demonstrating, as to Baffle most men. As that <hi>there is no such thing as Motion:</hi> That a <hi>Body can have no influence upon a Spirit, nor a Spirit upon a Body: and much less can they be vitally U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited:</hi> That 'tis <hi>impossible that Will and Thought should Stir a Finger:</hi> That <hi>all Bodies are alike Big,</hi> &amp;c. I say most, if not <hi>all,</hi> these Strange Propositions, are Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being with as Plausible a shew of reason defended by a Subtile Sophister, as the <hi>Emanation of the Son and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost from the</hi> Father hath bin now <hi>Confuted</hi> by this Gentleman. So that I cannot but apply those words of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95338:28"/>
the <hi>Apostle</hi> to such Disputers, <hi>They have turned aside un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vain jangling, understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</hi> But I have said Enough to this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Each of the following, I shall (I think) dispatch as Easily.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 58. He saith, that <hi>whatsoever Emanes, or any way proceeds, from a Self-Existent Substance (except it were Created and then joyned to it) is as Self-Existent as that Substance.</hi> But I say with as great assurance, that whatsoever Substance Emanes from another, must Owe its Existence to that other; and the Contrary is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Contradiction. As to his Reason for thus asserting, viz. <hi>Because before its Emanation, it was a Part of the Self-Existent Substance,</hi> it is taken from Material Substances, which do Consist of Parts; but this cannot be said of Spiritual ones, because they are not <hi>divisible,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have <hi>no</hi> Parts. And it is Observable too, how well this Reason Suits to <hi>Eternal</hi> Emanations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 59. This Section hath several very Surprizing things in it. As 1. Our Author <hi>cannot see, since the Son and Spirit are necessary Emanations, how they owe their Origin more to the Father, than the Father Owes His to them.</hi> Which is as much as to say, since the Tree ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily issues forth from the Root, and the Rays from the Sun, therefore the Root owes its Origin no less to the Tree, and the Sun to its Rays, than the Tree to the Root, and the Rays to the Sun. 2. His Reason for that Assertion is, that <hi>the Father Son and Spirit are all three of a Substance, that is Self-Existent.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> say one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>two latter</hi> are so, for the First (as he needs not to be told) <hi>is</hi> the Self Existent Substance; not <hi>of</hi> or <hi>from</hi> such a substance. But if he asks me <hi>How</hi> they Emane from the Father, I know not which of us would be the more Presumptuous, <hi>he</hi> for Asking, and for Endeavouring to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95338:29"/>
Answer thatQuestion. But (on second thoughts) I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to Answer it, when he shall be pleased to Answer me <hi>this, How did your self come into Being?</hi> Or, What is the <hi>Modus</hi> how <hi>any</hi> thing comes to be what it is, or to be at all? 3. He adds, <hi>Nor could the Father more than They, be the cause of the Separation, since They necessarily Separated from one another.</hi> But can I need to mind him, that our Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis will not bear a <hi>Separation</hi> between the Divine Persons, and only asserts a Distinction betwen them? And sure I need not tell him, that <hi>he</hi> is not over-fit to Write Books, who knows not that Distinction, and Separation, and Difference too, are <hi>Several</hi> things. But 4. Whereas he saith that, no one of these Persons can be the cause of their Separation, because they <hi>Necessarily</hi> Separated, doth he think that God can be the <hi>Necessary</hi> Cause of nothing? Or that He is in His own nature <hi>Indifferent</hi> to every thing? If he believes (for Instance) that the Perfection of His Nature doth not Necessarily determine Him, to what is <hi>best;</hi> or to do whatsoever He in His Infinite Wisdom knows <hi>fit</hi> to be done, I hope there are not many of his mind. He saith, 5. That <hi>it is another Contradiction to Affirm, that an Infinite Substance is divided into Three Infinite Parts.</hi> How does our Author already <hi>run Taplash!</hi> But I will not therefore forbear Replying, and I Answer, No doubt it is a <hi>Horrid</hi> Contradiction so to Affirm. But how <hi>rank</hi> does this smell of the Gross thing called Body! His mind runs altogether upon Material Substances, which alone I say have <hi>Parts</hi> to be divided into. And if a Spiritual Substance cannot be divided into spiritual Parts, much less can an Insinite Spiritual Substance be divided into In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Spiritual Parts. And he who thinks that a <hi>Spirit</hi> can be divided into parts, had as good never take that word into his Mouth, and much less can he Pretend to believe it a thing of an <hi>Immortal</hi> nature, which whosoever
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95338:29"/>
does not, whatever Theologers they may be, I can't ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them for Philosophers. 6. He makes it in what follows an Absurdity to deny that whatsoever proceeds from another thing, must be in Order of Time after it. These are his words, <hi>Whatsoever Proceeds from a thing must first be in it, Except it can be in it and Proceed from it, at the same time.</hi> But as we never <hi>thought</hi> of such a thing, as the Two Persons so Proceeding, as to be <hi>Separated</hi> from the <hi>First;</hi> nor of any more than their having their <hi>Origin</hi> from Him, so <hi>this</hi> they may have and yet still be in Him, and might <hi>ever</hi> have been in Him. Can our Author think (not to trouble him too often with the <hi>Rays</hi> being from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and yet as <hi>Old</hi> as it) that all <hi>Thoughts</hi> must be Younger than <hi>Minds,</hi> because they have their Original from them. This can be denied by none, that make Minds to be <hi>Thinking Beings:</hi> I mean, that do acknowledg Thinking to be <hi>Essential</hi> to Minds. But <hi>this</hi> I have spoken to in the <hi>Preceding Defence.</hi> p. 29, 30, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 60. He saith, <hi>That it had bin Intolerable in the</hi> Pagans, <hi>to believe those Rays that come from the Sun, to be the Sun it self.</hi> And I need say no more, than that it is <hi>as</hi> Intolerable to believe the Son and Spirit, who have their Existence from the Father, to be the <hi>Father Himself.</hi> But I desire him to think sedately with himself, whether Gods <hi>Decrees</hi> could <hi>none</hi> of them be Eternal, I Phansy he is not so much a <hi>School-man</hi> as to answer, Gods Decrees are God Himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 61. He saith, <hi>what I further add are direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,</hi> reciting several more things Conteined in my Propositions; and this is the <hi>whole</hi> of this Section. Here is not one word of Proof, that any <hi>one</hi> of them is a Contradiction; and therefore I have nothing to add <hi>here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:95338:30"/>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 62. He affirms, 1. That <hi>Necessary Existence from Eternity is as great a Perfection, as Self-Existence.</hi> But not to tell him, that whatsoever doth <hi>necessarily</hi> Exist, must have bin from Eternity, and therefore such an Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence is never attributed to a Creature; I do absolutely deny, that necessary Existence from <hi>Another,</hi> is as great a Perfection as necessary Existence from <hi>Ones self.</hi> Can our Author in his Cool thoughts imagine it is? He saith 2. <hi>If the Father hath given Existence to any Being, which he cannot take away, He would Cease to be Almighty.</hi> But I conceive, that to suppose that the Father can make a Being to Cease, which hath a <hi>Necessary</hi> Existence from Him, would be a Contradictions supposal; and that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions being Objects of <hi>no</hi> Power, cannot be Objects of <hi>Divine</hi> Power; and that therefore the Almightiness thereof Consisteth in an Ability to do whatsoever Implyes not a Contradiction, or that <hi>Power</hi> can do: And so doth our <hi>Author</hi> conceive too. He saith, 3. That <hi>Self. Existence Separate from those Powers, which can only belong to a Self-Existent Being, is no Perfection.</hi> But I ask him, how Self-Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence <hi>can</hi> be Separated from those Powers? and if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, What does this saying Signifie? And it is certain it cannot. But if he means <hi>Abstracted</hi> by <hi>Separate,</hi> as he used a very Improper word to express his thoughts by, I deny that the Notion of Self-Existence <hi>abstracted</hi> from all other Considerations whatsoever, Implyeth no Persection. And I have as much Liberty to Contradict him without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my <hi>Reason,</hi> as he hath to Affirm this without giving <hi>his.</hi> But <hi>indeed</hi> this denial of mine needs no Reason, for that Self-Existence is as <hi>Such</hi> a Perfection is <hi>Self-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,</hi> or I know not what is so. But were it not that I find him in one of these Sections, asserting <hi>Creation out of nothing,</hi> this Passage would lead me to a very shrewd Suspicion, that he is of <hi>Wolzogenius</hi> his Mind, and some
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95338:30"/>
others of his Brethren, <hi>That God is not the only Self-Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent Being,</hi> but that the <hi>Rude Chaos</hi> was, and therefore <hi>all Matter</hi> now is, Self-Existent too. And if they could demonstrate <hi>this</hi> to me, I Confess I should do what lyes in me, to think Self-Existence to be no Perfection at all, in spight of its being Self-Evident that it is a <hi>great</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, if not the <hi>greatest.</hi> 4. He saith, That <hi>if the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have the some Unlimited Perfections, but their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of getting them was different, that would not cause any Inequality betwen them.</hi> But I say it <hi>would;</hi> that is in reference to their Manner of Existence, tho' not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their mere Essence.</p>

Spirit, and be the only Good, when they have the same Unlimited Power and Goodness?</hi> I Answer, They have an Unlimited Power, but not the <hi>Same</hi> Unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Power with the <hi>Father. Ad Extrà,</hi> or in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Creation,</hi> their Power is Unlimited; but no body will say, that <hi>ad Intrà,</hi> it is the same with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Except he can believe, that the Son could Beget the Father, as the Father hath Begot the Son. And as to the Fathers being called by our Saviour the <hi>Only Good,</hi> in that he saith <hi>There is none Good but God,</hi> I have said in my Propositions (with <hi>Grotius</hi> and others) that <hi>that</hi> Phrase must needs signifie the Only <hi>Original</hi> Good, or the Only <hi>Fountain</hi> of Goodness; which the Father may be, and yet not the onely <hi>Perfectly</hi> Good. And I think that the Perfection of Self-Existence belonging to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, and therefore those Perfections too, which do necessarily <hi>suppose</hi> Self-Existence, the Father may most truly be said to be greater than the Son and H. Spirit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the Perfections of <hi>these</hi> Persons are Unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95338:31"/>
 2. He asks, <hi>What greater Absurdity there can be, than that Beings which have Infinite Unlimited Perfections, should want some Perfections?</hi> I Answer, that indeed there cannot be a greater Absurdity than to say, that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which hath an Infinite <hi>Number</hi> of Unlimited Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, can want <hi>some;</hi> this would be an Ab'urdity with a <hi>Vengeance:</hi> But I doubt I am not <hi>Capable</hi> of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing where lyes the Absurdity of asserting, That a Being which hath not the Perfection of Self-Existence, and <hi>those</hi> that suppose it, may notwithstanding have in as high a degree as can be those Perfections which they have. 3. He saith, That <hi>a Being cannot be partly Infinite and partly Finite.</hi> And so he runs on upon <hi>Infinite, Infinite,</hi> which he all along does; and the reason of it is obvious enough, <hi>viz.</hi> because it is a rare Amusing Confounding Word, for <hi>my</hi> Brains, and the Brains of his Readers; there is not such <hi>another</hi> to be met with for the purpose. But <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity</hi> is not a thing to be made so bold with, or talk't of with such freedom and Confidence, as <hi>he</hi> still does, as if it were a very <hi>familiar</hi> matter. But I say again, it is no such Monstrous business to Imagine, that a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which hath not Every Perfection, may have those it is possessed of, in the Highest degree. If I cared to talk things which I understand nothing of, <hi>I</hi> could talk too of <hi>Infinity;</hi> and say, that there are several sorts of <hi>Infinity:</hi> That there is Infinity of <hi>Substance:</hi> And Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Quantity:</hi> And Infinity of <hi>Duration:</hi> And Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Space;</hi> and God knows how many more Infinities: And could shew that there is no Absurdity in saying, that all these Infinities do not necessarily belong to every one of these, and I should get great Reputation among Wise men for my pains, should they Catch me <hi>thus</hi> Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Tongue or Pen.</p>

But now I think better of it, I find I am not <hi>quite</hi> so Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as I thought I was; for I can tell this Gentleman, that a Being <hi>Can</hi> be partly infinite and partly not; since I have learned that Angels and Humane Souls are so: That is, with respect to the Infinity of <hi>Duration</hi> they are infinite <hi>à Parte Post,</hi> tho' not <hi>à Parte antè.</hi> And what a rare Notion is this!</p>

Considering what I have said to the <hi>Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,</hi> and already to <hi>this</hi> Person, relating to the matter of this Section, I shall onely observe upon it, 1. That I wonder how any man that hath a due Awe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majesty of God upon his Mind, can give himself leave to use such an Expression, as <hi>Tacking two Persons to God the Father.</hi> I scrupled a while, whether I might foul my Pen with Transcribing it. 2. He tells us that <hi>Nothing can be more Absurd than to say, that the</hi> 3. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are One God by Union, and yet are distinct from One Another.</hi> But is there no difference betwixt <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Identity</hi> or <hi>self samenefs?</hi> Is there not a real distinction between our Souls and Bodys, tho' United so closely as that <hi>he</hi> cannot conceive <hi>how</hi> closely, nor any Man else? If he shall say, that <hi>Union</hi> is but another word for <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,</hi> I shall say he is Extreamly out. <hi>Composition</hi> being a blending or mixing of the <hi>Parts</hi> of distinct
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95338:32"/>
things. The word is Commonly used onely of Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous things: Spiritual Substances therefore having no parts, are incapable of being Compounded. And, in my poor Opinion, tho' a Man Consists of a Soul and Body, he cannot be said to be Compounded of them, because onely <hi>one</hi> of these hath parts. Our Author 'tis like will Cry Mystery! Mystery! to this Talk; as he despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth <hi>Trinitarians</hi> for calling the Union of the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons a Mystery: But if even to the Union of the <hi>two</hi> Created Beings <hi>himself</hi> Consists of, he cannot <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> Cry <hi>Mystery,</hi> I know what I know of him. I will not say Every <hi>Witty</hi> Man, but I am sure <hi>Every Wise</hi> Man will cry Mystery! to <hi>Every</hi> thing, as ill as <hi>some</hi> can bear that word. I confess no Man shall perswade <hi>me</hi> any more than <hi>him</hi> and his Friends, to swallow a <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Contradiction</hi> by calling it a <hi>Mystery,</hi> till he can perswade me too that God Almighty indued me with false Faculties; and <hi>then,</hi> do what I can, I am like to believe but few things more than <hi>Cogito ergo Sum.</hi> But I am as certain as I can be of any thing but what I <hi>see</hi> or <hi>feel,</hi> that it is not more difficult to understand this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than Abundance of other things Relating to the Deity, and innumerable things which our Author must believe in spight of Fate, if he will be a Christian, or a Theist, or but a <hi>Man.</hi>

He <hi>here</hi> Banters the real Trinitarians, as <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very Wisely in supposing their three infinite Substances, to be as close together as can be, lest there should not be room enough for them, in but one infinite Space,</hi> &amp;c. And then he Enquires, <hi>if the Substance of the Father be Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, how the Substance of the Son can be every where too?</hi> I shall be a little closer upon this Gentleman for the strange liberty he takes in talking of <hi>Infinite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> as soon as I have done with his <hi>Sections,</hi> than
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95338:32"/>
I have bin <hi>yet</hi> or will <hi>now</hi> be. In the mean time, I will be satisfied to Reply <hi>thus</hi> to this <hi>Section,</hi> viz. Doth not this kind of Talk Suppose, that he takes the three Divine Persons (if he thinks two of them are <hi>any</hi> thing) to be <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> Substances? which is so <hi>gross</hi> a Conceit, and speaks such <hi>beastly</hi> Stupidity, that I would charge <hi>no</hi> Man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who doth not Expresly own it. But, hoping he doubts not of the <hi>Being</hi> of Spiritual substances, nor of the Divine <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> I ask him how the Substance of God the Father can be in those spaces which are filled with <hi>Bodies?</hi> Or how can his Soul and Body, or that part of his Body which his Soul possesseth (if his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy will permit him to think it doth not pervade the <hi>whole</hi> of his Body) how can they be, I say, in the Self-same place or <hi>Ubi,</hi> call it which he pleases? Surely, one would think, that several <hi>Spirits</hi> may be together in the same individual space, seeing the <hi>Penetrability</hi> of Spirits must be acknowledg'd by all that believe there are <hi>such</hi> Substances (except they have no manner of Notion of what they believe) as well as that a Spirit and an <hi>Impenetrable</hi> Body may be together in the same space. As to his adding <hi>[and after the same manner]</hi> to <hi>[at the same time]</hi> this can be onely for a <hi>Blind.</hi> But we may talk <hi>Endlesly</hi> upon this Subject, and little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand one another or Our selves; for this, for <hi>certain,</hi> is one of those things, which our minds were never made for any thing <hi>like</hi> a clear perception of; at least in these <hi>gross</hi> Bodies. And much more then (as he will be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anon) is the infinity of the <hi>Divine</hi> Substance to be reckoned of that number. And he is an intolerably Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited <hi>Fop,</hi> who will not Confess so much Ignorance, as to have no other Idea of Gods Infinity, than that He hath all Possible Perfections, and that all His Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Unlimited. And we are at a perfect loss what
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95338:33"/>
to say or think further about the Divine Essence. Nay, we have now no Cognizance of more than the Modes and <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>Bodily</hi> Substance, we have none at all of its <hi>Naked</hi> Essence. All we can say of Body as Body, is, that 'tis <hi>Extended Penetrable Bulk.</hi>

That <hi>the Trinitarians say, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are one God, as the Soul and Body are one Man:</hi> And then he Exposeth the folly of that <hi>Simile.</hi> But he might have saved himself this little labour; for as <hi>I</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver said so, so neither know <hi>I</hi> of any other <hi>Trinitarian</hi> that hath. The Creed indeed which is called the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian,</hi> saith, That <hi>as the Soul and Body are one Man, so God and Man are one Christ;</hi> but what is <hi>this</hi> to his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? But what <hi>I</hi> have said, is, That the Union between the three Divine Persons, is not more Unaccountable, than is the Union between the Soul and Body; and that in one respect it is <hi>less</hi> Unaccountable than <hi>this</hi> Union, <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>this</hi> is between Beings of perfectly <hi>Unlike</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; whereas <hi>that</hi> is between Persons of the <hi>same</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And why distinct intelligent substances, which is the onely definition I can give of <hi>Persons,</hi> may not be as closely United because they are all <hi>intelligent,</hi> as one intelligent Substance and a <hi>Body,</hi> is above the little Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy that I can pretend to be Master of, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. 2. Upon the <hi>Simile,</hi> of <hi>the Close Union of the Sun with its Light and Heat,</hi> as he words it; he saith, <hi>There are no such Perceptions as those we call Light and Heat, in any Beings, but those that are Capable of seeing and feeling; And that this every Common Systeme demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates:</hi> And <hi>that this is Obvious to all but Children and Metaphysicians.</hi> What a Wonderful Piece of Learning is here! 1. <hi>Light and Heat Perceptions!</hi> I have heard of Perceptions and Sensations <hi>of</hi> Light and Heat, but that they are Perceptions and Sensations <hi>themselves,</hi> I have
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95338:33"/>
hitherto bin to learn. 2. But they are not (tho') <hi>Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in any Beings, but such as have faculties Capable of See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Feeling.</hi> And 'twould be some what Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, if any thing could perceive Light and Heat, that can neither <hi>see</hi> nor <hi>feel.</hi> Yet I am a little mistaken, if Heat, and Light too, cannot have some Operation on Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which have never a One of the Five Senses. 3. He saith, that <hi>every Common Systeme demonstrates, that there are no such Perceptions as Light and Heat, but in things that are Capable of seeing and feeling.</hi> A <hi>goodly</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration! But the <hi>Commonness</hi> of it may make it the less Observable. But it is pretty much it should be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in <hi>Every</hi> Common Systeme, and I should never Light on it in any <hi>one</hi> Systeme. But 'tis no matter, since I am a little too Old to be a <hi>Child</hi> (unless <hi>twice</hi> one) and then to be a <hi>Metaphysician</hi> too; for I am told to my Comfort, 4. That <hi>this Notion is Obvious to all but Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Metaphysicians.</hi> Yet 'tis Obvious to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, <hi>tho'</hi> a Metaphysician; as I dare warrant him he is (whether he knows it or no, as 'tis like he does not since he so despising them) or he could never be so Notable at <hi>infinity,</hi> and other most Sublime and Abstruse Matters. 5. But in good Earnest, I am so dull as to be utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to imagine, but that <hi>Light</hi> would be <hi>Light</hi> (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is to be thought of <hi>Colours)</hi> tho' there were no Eyes to Perceive it: And such a Heretick in Philosophy (whether I am in Divinity or no) as to think, that it is an Aggregation of a certain sort of Particles, as much as <hi>Air</hi> is. And therefore I am not like in <hi>haste</hi> to be shamed out of the Fathers <hi>Simile,</hi> of Emanations of Light from the Sun. Nor do I think that our <hi>Author</hi> himself, will ever be able to demonstrate any Absurdity in conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Heat</hi> differs onely <hi>gradually</hi> from <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> from <hi>both:</hi> And that <hi>Fire</hi> is a fluid Constituted of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95338:34"/>
an Excessively small sort of Particles, and <hi>therefore</hi> very Active, Subtile and Piercing; and that a Collection of these Minute bodys in such a quantity, and so closely as to become an Object of Sight, is that which we Express by the words <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Flame;</hi> and a less close Collection is what we call <hi>Heat.</hi> And that <hi>Flame</hi> differs from Fire, as it is a more dispersed Collection of these Particles, than Fire; and <hi>Light</hi> from both, as it is a thinner Collection of them than either of the other: I say, I do not think that our Author, as Skilled as he is content to be thought to be in <hi>Physicks</hi> (tho' not in <hi>Metaphysicks)</hi> can demonstrate that <hi>these</hi> are Absurd Notions.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>With as Infallible Assurance, Sir, as you Talk of Infinite Substances, and Reason against the Possibility of the</hi> Sons <hi>and</hi> H. Spirits <hi>being Infinite Substances from the</hi> Nature <hi>of such Substances; I never yet met with your</hi> Fellow, <hi>if you will pretend to have a distinct and Explicite Idea of the thing call'd</hi> Substance; <hi>but I know not what</hi> Epithet <hi>to give you, if you can take the Liberty to tell me, that you have any such I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of</hi> Infinity, <hi>as it relates</hi> immediately <hi>to a Substance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You have indeed told us, that an Infinite Substance is that which hath</hi> no Bounds <hi>or</hi> Limits; <hi>but did you think you then gave us</hi> a Definition <hi>of an infinite Substance? No, you are a Wiser Man than</hi> so; <hi>or than to hope that the</hi> Construing of a Word, <hi>would pass with any but Children and Fools for a</hi> Definition of a thing. <hi>But suppose, Sir, that I were so Easy, as to accept of</hi> Boundlesness <hi>and</hi> Unlimitedness <hi>for a Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Description of</hi> Infinity, <hi>yet I should (Ten to One) put</hi> this <hi>Question (whether an</hi> Easy <hi>one or no) What is the Infinity of a</hi> Substance? <hi>You will not say, this is an Easy Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion because Answered already,</hi> viz. That the Infinity of a Substance, is the Boundlesness thereof; <hi>for you know you must tell us what a Substance</hi> is, <hi>before you can make us the Wiser, by discoursing upon</hi> Infinite <hi>Substances, Or the</hi> Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>of a Substance. If you will now be defining this Thing Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Substance, <hi>by certain of its</hi> Properties, <hi>I cannot for bear Proceeding to ask, What is the</hi> Subject <hi>of these Properties?</hi> Or, <hi>What is Substance Considered</hi> abstractedly <hi>from all</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents? If <hi>you tell me,</hi> it is something that doth <hi>Substare Accidentibus,</hi> and needs no Support it self, <hi>I must be Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with this Answer, since I know you will not</hi> Attempt <hi>to give a better. But however I will not be discouraged, from Asking</hi> on <hi>a while longer, tho' you should give me the</hi> Proverb <hi>for my Pains: And</hi> this <hi>Question next Occurrs,</hi> viz. <hi>Since</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95338:35"/>
               <hi>an Insinite Substance is something that hath no Bounds, must it not reach to all the dimensions of</hi> Infinite Space, <hi>which you were up with in your</hi> 68th. Section? <hi>One might be tempted to think, that after you had said absolutely, as you did</hi> Sect. 57. There can be no Bound or End of what is Infinite, <hi>you will grant</hi> this; <hi>for if it were Extended through the length and breadth of a</hi> Million of Worlds, <hi>if there be so many,</hi> this <hi>would not speak it to have</hi> no Bound <hi>or</hi> End; <hi>since all these Worlds put together will not fill a</hi> Boundless <hi>Space. But then I ask what is Space? Or (to speak a little</hi> Learnedly) <hi>What is the</hi> Ratio formalis <hi>of Space? And you have a ready Answer for me,</hi> viz. <hi>'Tis</hi> Vacuity <hi>or</hi> Emptiness. <hi>Then demand I, What kind of thing is</hi> Emptiness? <hi>And you have an Answer at hand to this too,</hi> viz. <hi>'Tis an</hi> Imaginary <hi>thing. And when I have asked, What is a mere</hi> Imaginary <hi>thing? I am much mistaken, if a Man of your Head-Piece will in the least hesitate at Replying,</hi> A mere Imaginary thing, is a real No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>And</hi> then, <hi>Sir,</hi> This <hi>is your Disinition of an</hi> Infinite Substance, <hi>It is a thing that is of Equal Extent with an</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Nothing. <hi>But</hi> hold! <hi>Cry you,</hi> Who gave you leave thus to ask <hi>me</hi> Questions, and then to answer them as you list for me? I would have told you, that my Phrase <hi>without Bounds or Limits,</hi> is not to be taken <hi>so Strictly,</hi> as to surpass the Space which holds All Worlds. <hi>But, Sir, will</hi> this <hi>Answer</hi> do? <hi>Is, after all your Arguing from the Infinity of the Divine Substance, your Notion of it onely</hi> this, <hi>that it is as much without Bounds as Gods</hi> Creature <hi>the</hi> Universe? <hi>And can this Consist with your having Asserted, that 'tis a</hi> Contradiction <hi>to say, that there can be more than</hi> One <hi>Infinite Being? But I foresee you will go near to Reply,</hi> My Notion thereof is far from being <hi>so scanty</hi> a one as you Imagine; for I hold, that the Infinity of the Divine Substance, Consists in its Power to Extend its Presence thro' all the parts of New Worlds, as they are Created; which God Almighty can if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95338:35"/>
Create to All Eternity. <hi>But then say I, will you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, Sir, to have any the least Idea,</hi> How <hi>the Divine Substance can do</hi> this? <hi>And is not this Dilatation and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expansion thereof, think you, Capable of being made as Ridiculous and Contradictory a thing, by such a Wit as</hi> yours, <hi>as you think you have made</hi> Emanations <hi>from thence to be?

Can such Persons read those Questions of <hi>Zophar,</hi> without Astonishment, which he put to <hi>Job,</hi> Ch. 11. 7, &amp;c. <hi>Canst thou by Searching find out God?

            <p>And now I have done with this <hi>Author,</hi> as well as with his <hi>Reflexions;</hi> who must not take it unkindly, that I have been so <hi>plain</hi> with him; there being not the least of <hi>Ill-Will</hi> in it, but the greatest <hi>Good-Will</hi> I am sure.

But rather shall think, I cannot do my self a greater Honour, as I cannot do a greater Right to Truth, than by publishing a Recantation.</p>
            <p>But I will not be so <hi>Idle,</hi> as to Contend for the <hi>Last Word</hi> with such Men as I know will never yield it me; I mean those who will not distinguish between <hi>dicibile &amp; dicendum,</hi> what it is <hi>possible</hi> to say and what <hi>ought</hi> to be said; but will adventure to say <hi>any</hi> thing, and turn Every Stone, and put their Wits to their utmost Stretch, to invent Replys and Rejoynders, rather than let their Pens <hi>rest;</hi> and much more, rather than they'l <hi>own</hi> the least Mistake.</p>

And where-ever I find a deal of Art and Subtilty, and mightily Laboured Oppositions, Defences or Provings, I cannot but Suspect, that the desire of Victory, and the Encreasing or Upholding of a Party, or Mens great Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own Understandings, have very much the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent of the Love of Truth.</p>

            <p>And it is certain, that the more Sincerely and Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Inquisitive any Man is after Truth, the less Stiff, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniative and Pertinacious he will be; and the less Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of those Notions which are very <hi>disputable:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such a man is no less acquainted, with the Strongest Objections against them, than with the best Arguments for them.</p>
            <p>And the more Extensive Knowledge any one hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, the more vigorously sensible will he be, that he knows but very little.
