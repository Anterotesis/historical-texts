            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THAT we love the Brotherhood, and be kindly affectioned to one another, is the joint and concurrent Language both of Law and Goſpel; It is one of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles which are naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven on the tables of the hearts of all men. The ways and methods of diſcharging our duty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing our good will to Mankind, are various and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, they run in ſeveral channels; one is mentioned in my Text, <hi>viz.</hi> by fraternal correption; a neceſſary, but a much neglected Duty. We are very prone and forward to reproach our Brethren for their infirmities, and to make a mock at their ſins; inſtead of going back, and throwing a Mantle over them, to hide and cover their nakedneſs; we rather draw the Curtain open, and with a ſecret titillation and pleaſure expoſe them to the obſervation and contempt of the moſt ſcornful <hi>Michal:</hi> Inſtead of burying, and Chriſtianly interring in ſilence, ſome of their ſlips and failures, men rather rake in the Grave, and tear up the Earth to give them an inglorious reſurrection.</p>
            <p>When we ſhould privately addreſs to our Brother with all imaginable Meekneſs, Pity, and Sobriety, to reſtore and recover him after ſome irregular ſtep, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109548:3"/>
unwary fall, men rather publickly proclaim and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge on the Houſe-top their Neigbours failing; and ſet it in ſuch a light where it may moſt eminently be ſeen.</p>
            <p>With what bitter taunts and cruel mockings, with what ſlanderous aſperſions and defamations do men proſecute one another? Yea, to that height of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs have ſome advanced in theſe low-running dregs of time, that inſtead of being grieved that their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has done amiſs, they could be glad if he had done much worſe. My Friends, is not this a great fault? have we thus learned either of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or Chriſt? This way of treating thy Brother will appear to be collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Blaſphemy, and virtual Murther: Let me ſhew you a more excellent way, by learning your Duty to him in the words of my Text:</p>
            <p>Which Duty is expreſſed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Affirmatively, <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. With an Argument and Motive perſuading us to it; <hi>And not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not wear out my little time in accurate and Logical Analyſing of the words, but ſhall conſider them as an entire Doctrinal Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Neg. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Meioſis:</hi> Thou ſhalt heartily love him, and do all good Offices to him, relating both to his Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>This is to reſemble God, who is always doing of good, and ſhowring down his Bleſſings and Mercies on our Heads; nay, in this work of Brotherly Reprehenſion we reſemble our Heavenly Father, who is ſaid to <hi>rebuke and reprove whomſoever he Loves,</hi> Rev. 3.19.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109548:3"/>
And if thou makeſt not Conſcience thus to Love and affect him, thou art guilty of his Blood, and wilt be eſteem'd, in God's account, his Murtherer; for he that <hi>hates his Brother</hi> is ſo, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the Text to the former Verſe, gives us full proof of it. Verſe 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſtand againſt the blood of thy neighbour;</hi> and this is one way of doing of it, by omitting rebuke. Well then, love thy Brother, get admiſſion into his heart and bowels; not by the point of a Baionet, or the force of a Bullet, that is a very ſtrange demonſtration of our affection to him (which by ſome has been practiſed); but get into him by mild and ſoft counſels, by wholeſom advice.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly, Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fail not at your peril; here's a plain injunction, no Man exempted, no corner to creep out at. It is not left to your will and pleaſure; no Pleas and Excuſes will ſerve your turn to juſtify your omiſſion. Neceſſity is laid on thee, <hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt <hi>in any wiſe</hi> do it: <hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt do it, Thou thy ſelf, not by thy Deputy or Subſtitute. Reproof is like the Peace-offering made by Fire, thine own hand muſt bring it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>Rebuke thy <hi>Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who is this Neighbour? It was a Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.29. The Solution may be gathered out of Chriſt's Anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the General. Every Man to whom I may be helpful. Our Lord proves a Stranger may be a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.36.</p>
            <p>All people that have the face of Man are called our fleſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. And our blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26. <hi>One blood;</hi> Couſins at a remoter diſtance. Any Man is our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in regard of the nearneſs of our firſt Original;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109548:4"/>
nay, not only a <hi>Stranger,</hi> but an <hi>Enemy</hi> may thus be our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that the Precept of <hi>Moſes,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the kind dealing of the <hi>Jews</hi> with other men, extended not univerſally to all,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</note> but peculiarly to their Country-men or Fellow-<hi>Jews;</hi> as for Aliens and Enemies they were not bound to be kind to them; nay, againſt ſome, <hi>viz. the Seven Nations,</hi> they were commanded to proceed in an hoſtile manner. <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.43. But our Saviour teacheth us to extend our kindneſs as the Bleſſings of Heaven, even to enemies and injurious provokers: In the ſame manner and meaſure as they do ill to you, do ye good to them, bleſſing, obliging, admoniſhing, reproving, praying for them, and making them no other returns for all their virulencies, and malicious behaviour toward you, but thoſe of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love, that ſo you may approve your ſelves to be the Servants and Children of the Moſt high God, and your Heavenly Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> There are more eſpecially Neighbours, who dwell near us, with whom we frequently converſe, and have repeated opportunities of ſhewing our love in this kind to them. There are alſo,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Spiritual Neighbours, begotten by the ſame ſpirit, to the ſame hopes; theſe are to have a ſpecial preferment in our affections: They have the ſame God to their Father, the ſame Church for their Mother, the ſame Houſe for their dwelling, and the ſame Inheritance for their portion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>And not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are various Readings of theſe words; ſome thus, <hi>Do not burthen thy ſelf with ſin for him,</hi> Non ſuſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies propter illum peccatum, <hi>i. e.</hi> Poenam peccati.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109548:4"/>
Take heed leſt by thy ſilence thou bringeſt the guilt of his ſin upon thee.</p>
            <p>Through the ſilence of one, we often ſuffer two to dye, our ſelves and our erring brother. Sure I am, he that ſaid, <hi>If thy brother repent, forgive him,</hi> ſaid alſo before that, <hi>If thy brother offend, admoniſh him:</hi> And it is as great a ſin, not to reprove our brother when he hath tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, as not to forgive him, when he hath repented. If we ſuffer ſin upon him, we our ſelves may ſuffer for his ſin. We neglect to do good, and ſo great evil comes of it.</p>
            <p>But the moſt general and proper reading of the words is, as in our ordinary Tranſlation, Thou ſhalt not connive at him, and thereo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> embolden him to continue in his ſin, augmenting the heap and number of his Tranſgreſſions, but ſhalt put a ſtop to him by ſeaſonable and timely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. Let no man tell me this is meer Morality, and prejudice himſelf againſt the benefit he ſhould reap. As God in his Law, ſo Chriſt in his Goſpel doth peremptorily exact and call for our compliance with this Precept in ſeveral places: <hi>If thy brother ſhall treſpaſs against thee, go and tell him his fault,</hi> Mat. 18.15. <hi>Warn them that are unruly,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.14. They are ſaid to be full of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who have <hi>the ability to admoniſh one another, Rom.</hi> 15.14. Ye count him as an enemy, whom you will not admoniſh as a <hi>brother.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Reprove the unfruitful works of darkneſs, Eph.</hi> 5.11. It was a Law in <hi>Iſrael, That a man ſhould not ſee his Brothers Ox or Aſs fall down by the way, and hide himſelf from them. Doth God take care for Oxen? nay, for us are theſe things written.</hi> But alas! we are fallen into thoſe latter days ſpoken of by our Bleſſed Saviour, wherein <hi>iniquity ſhould increaſe, and the love of many wax cold.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:109548:5"/>
What a ſinful baſhfulneſs doth attend us, ſneaking ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully from our work and duty of Reproof, when an helliſh impudence is in ſome profligate Wretches, that with open face, and brazen brow daily make breaches on God's Royal Law! How quietly and unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can we ſee ſome violent ſinners upon a full career in the broad way of Deſtruction, and never attempt to ſtop them, or throw in a bar or block to abate the ſwiftneſs of their feet, tho it be to the ſhedding of their own blood? Is this conſiſtent with the Love of God? with the love of thy brother's invaluable ſoul? or the happineſs and ſecurity of thine own?</p>
            <p>Having by this ſhort Paraphraſe taken off what of miſt and darkneſs might ſurround the Words, I ſhould deſcend to an Enquiry into ſeveral Particulars, each of which would require more time to diſcourſe of, than uſually is allotted to Exerciſes of this nature; yet I ſhall not totally omit them.</p>
            <p>As 1. I ſhould ſtate the nature of this Duty, and ſhew you wherein it doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On whom this Duty is moſt principally incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall demonſtrate the great Neceſſity and Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I ſhall lay down ſome Rules and Directions how to manage it ſucceſsfully.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I ſhall, laſtly, Apply it.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, for the Firſt Particular, I ſhall only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Three Words in the Scripture, which ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſs the nature of Reprehenſion.</p>

               </gap>, a bare minding and remembring, a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Mind in order by Advertiſement and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition. This is the moſt fair and favourable courſe, the moſt likely to prove ſucceſsful, that which primarily is to be uſed, the other only in extremities.</p>
            <p>The Schoolmen give many definitions of it, and the Ancient Fathers abound with variety of Illuſtrations, telling us, that great is the Affinity between Soul and Body, both as to their Diſeaſes and Remedies: That which Phyſick is to the Body, Reprehenſion is to the Soul, and the ſame rule and method muſt be obſerved in the application of the means of Cure. They reckon up three Parts of Phyſick, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by Diet, Medicines, and Chyrurgery, all which by way of Analogy and Proportion, are to be uſed in the Cure of Spiritual Diſtempers. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them together.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Admonition</hi> (he ſays) is the <hi>Diet</hi> of the Soul, forbidding that which is ſimply hurtful, or contrary to the diſpoſition of the Patient, and affording ſtrong and wholeſome nouriſhment.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:109548:6"/>2. <hi>Reproof</hi> is a <hi>Medicinal</hi> Potion, that hath always attending of it a tang of bitterneſs, which purgeth out the Morbifick Matter, and all peccant Humors and Corruptions of the Soul, and is a great Reſtorative.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Rebuke,</hi> if ſharp and keen, is the ſpiritual <hi>Chyrurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> which ſometimes is to be uſed cuttingly, with a ſharp Point and Edge. <hi>Intemperans aeger crudelem facit Medicum.</hi> Salt upon ſome occaſions muſt be rubb'd and chaf'd into ſome ſores and wounds.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Brotherly correption conſiſts in giving our Brethren neceſſary inſtructions in matters they are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of; in letting them have timely notice of their ſinful Affections, and Inclinations; and in a total break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off our intimacy of converſation, and ſociety with them, if they prove ſtubborn and incorrigible, ſtopping their ears againſt all wiſe Charms.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Particular, To ſhew <hi>who are the Perſons moſtly concerned in the diſcharge of this Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better to underſtand this, you muſt know that Divines generally diſtinguiſh Reproof into <hi>Miniſterial,</hi> and by way of Authority; and <hi>Fraternal,</hi> by way of Charity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Miniſters admoniſh by way of Office.</hi> The truth is, the work of Reproof belongs in ſome ſort to all men who have the uſe of Reaſon, becauſe it is a natural Precept, and a work of Mercy, a general Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice due from one neighbour to another. Hence Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels may reprove Believers; ſo <hi>Abimelech</hi> reproved <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> Gen. 20.15. Thus Inferiors may reprove their Superiors, provided it be done with Modeſty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. But principally this Duty is incumbent on three ſorts of Perſons.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:109548:6"/>1. On ſuch who in regard of <hi>Office</hi> are obliged to take the charge and care of others, as Miniſters and Diſpenſers of the Divine Oracles are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On ſuch who are engaged by bonds of <hi>Nature,</hi> and their Relative Stations and Capacities; thus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and Maſters ſtand more eſpecially concerned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. On ſuch who are <hi>qualified and fitted with Parts and Gifts</hi> to perform this Office with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a principal part of our Miniſtry to rebuke. Among Chriſt's Diſciples one was ſtiled a <hi>Son of Thunder;</hi> and what was ſaid of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> ought to be the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of every faithful Steward in God's Houſe, That he thunder'd in his Doctrine, and lighten'd in his Life. If we look through all the Old Teſtament, you will find that moſt of the Prophets Meſſages were ſevere Rebukes and Threatnings. The <hi>Jews</hi> call the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> the <hi>Book of Objurgations;</hi> and that Section which beginneth <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.15. they call the <hi>Section of Objurgations.</hi> The neceſſity of this Duty is ſuch to us, that God will require the blood of the People at the hands of their Paſtor, if he reprove not. The Shepherd was bound to make good that which was ſtollen, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did to <hi>Laban, Cry aloud, ſpare not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 31.19. Iſa. 58.1.</note> 
               <hi>lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and ſhew my people their Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins.</hi> 'Tis the Spiritual Father's charge to his own Son in the Faith, <hi>That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them that ſin, before all, that others may fear:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.20.</note> And this he muſt do without Partiality, not fearing the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, nor being deterr'd at the Greatneſs or any bold and open Tranſgreſſor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:109548:7"/>As this is required of Miniſters chiefly, ſo it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and demanded of <hi>Parents and Maſters;</hi> God hath made them Guardians of their Children and Servants. It is an idle conceit to think that we only are intruſted with the Cure of Souls; you will find it no excuſe for your negligence and omiſſion in the great day of giving up your Accounts at God's Tribunal; you are obliged to be keepers of their Souls, as well as we; nay, every man, in this ſenſe, ought to be his Brother's Keeper. As God hath ſet Conſcience to watch over the inward man, ſo for the converſation he hath ſet Chriſtians to watch over one another. Suffer me before I proceed any further, to improve this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſhould teach all Miniſters to be faithful in their places, and to take care that no man muzzle up their mouths.<note place="margin">Rev. 2.2.</note> See how the Holy Ghoſt commends the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus; I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil.</hi> Wicked men are ſometimes intolerable, not to be endured or bore with. It is no breach of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to be impatient againſt ſin and ſinners.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Suetonius,</hi> that he took the ſame liberty in writing the Emperors lives, that they took in lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Wicked men take liberty to licentiouſneſs in committing ſin, let us take as great a liberty in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, and let nothing either affright or allure us to a ſinful connivance at their bold violations of God's Law. We muſt not be dumb, tho they ſhould uſe us as the thief doth a dog, hold out a piece of bread to bribe us not to bark.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſhould teach the Great ones of the world to bear with Patience, and to receive with Meekneſs the word of Reproof. None are ſo high exalted as to be out of the reach of that Word which God ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:109548:7"/>None are more our friends than they are, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand by, and ſee us offer violence to our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holding of our hands, <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs; and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent oyl, which ſhall not break my head.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 141.5.</note> There may be ſmiting without violation of Friendſhip; and his wiſe Son <hi>Solomon</hi> preferr'd <hi>the wounds of a friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the kiſſes of an enemy.</hi> Theſe may be pleaſanter,<note place="margin">Prov. 27.6.</note> but thoſe will prove wholeſomer; there is Treachery in theſe kiſſes, but in thoſe wounds faithfulneſs. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Cyrus</hi> charged him who was to ſpeak to the King, to expreſs himſelf <hi>verbis byſſinis,</hi> in ſoft and ſilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en terms. 'Tis true, ſometimes we muſt come in the Spirit and Language of Love; but 'tis as true, there is oftentimes as great need of coming with a Rod in our hands, as a ſoft word in our mouths.</p>
            <p>Bad men love not a Correcting Miniſtry; like them, Amos 7.10. <hi>The land is not able to bear all his words;</hi> and ver. 13. <hi>propheſie not again any more at Bethel, for it is the King's chappel, and it is the King's court. They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, (i. e.</hi> the Judg that puniſhed ſin) <hi>they abhor him that ſpeaketh uprightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men will endure to hear new Notions and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Points; any Satyrical Reflections, and bitter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives againſt their brethren; but cannot brook to have their own Perſonal ſins roughly handled. Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful you do not <hi>Galatizare</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> phraſes it) <hi>hate him who tells you the truth;</hi> nor be like thoſe hearers mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 4.19, 21, 22, 28. While our Saviour preached the acceptable and glad tidings of Salvation, the good news contained in the Goſpel, all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Nazareth</hi> applauded his Doctrine, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109548:8"/>
at the bleſſed words which proceeded out of his mouth; but when he came to apply the word unto themſelves, they were filled with wrath againſt him, thruſt him out of the City, and would have broke his neck, by attempting to caſt him down headlong from the brow of the Hill, <hi>v.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>Have a care you reſiſt not ſuch a Miniſtry, which awakens the Conſcience, and ſets the worm on gnawing, altho it ſhould provoke thee to cry out with a loud voice, as he did who was poſſeſſed with an unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,<note place="margin">Luke 4.33, 34.</note> 
               <hi>Let us alone, art thou come to deſtroy us?</hi> God doth manifeſt his Preſence and mighty Power in ſuch a ſift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſtry; and the nature of Sin is to make men afraid of God's Appearance, and fooliſhly with <hi>Adam</hi> to attempt the ſecreting of themſelves from his All-ſeeing Eye.<note place="margin">Tit. 2.15.</note> We are commanded <hi>to exhort and rebuke with all authority;</hi> and you are enjoined not to deſpiſe and fret againſt the Doctrine we deliver, and that on pain of Everlaſting Damnation,<note place="margin">Prov. 15.10.</note> 
               <hi>for he that hateth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, ſhall dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed to the 2<hi>d</hi> Branch of Reproof, that which is <hi>Fraternal,</hi> and done in <hi>Brotherly Charity.</hi> Every Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian may bear the <hi>Perſon,</hi> tho not the <hi>Office</hi> of a Reprover; and this is founded upon undeniable Grounds, too large to be inſiſted on at this time, in one ſingle Sermon.</p>
            <p>Whether we conſult the Honour of God, or the neceſſity of a punctual conformity to his Will, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing his Commands, but obeying all equally; it nor diſputing any of them, but obeying all readily; it will appear to be our intereſt as well as our duty, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to comply with God's Will and Pleaſure: Or if
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109548:8"/>
we reſpect the happineſs and welfare of our Brother, exerciſing in this work the higheſt acts of charity and benevolence; for if he hear us, then we have <hi>gained our brother.</hi> When thou heareſt thy Neighbour ſwear, lye, ſlander, deride holineſs, perſecute with his Tongue the Man who is more righteous than himſelf, intreat him then to bethink himſelf what will be the end of ſuch Deviliſh practices; ſhew him his danger, and ſnatch him, if it be poſſible, out of the fire he is haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into. Thou haſt a heart of Stone, if thou art not concerned, and induſtrious to prevent his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruine; for he is riding poſt to the Devil, if a ſtop be not put in his way. It is no privilege to any Man to be out of the way of a Reprover; but a ſevere judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be told they ſhall no more be ſmitten with this Rod. God, to puniſh <hi>Judah</hi> for their Rebellion, threatneth to impoſe ſilence on his Prophet.<note place="margin">Ezek. 3.26</note> Let us make much of a blow and ſtroke of this nature, it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth healing with it.<note place="margin">Lib. 6. Conf. c. 9.</note> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives two inſtances of the happy ſucceſs of Admonition, the one given by himſelf to his Friend <hi>Alipius,</hi> who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reclaimed from the Theatre and Stage-plays; the other by a taunt and check given to his Mother <hi>Monica,</hi> who was thereby reclaimed from her Tippling.</p>
            <p>If we conſult in the next place our own private weal and happineſs, it will appear to be highly reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Hereby we prevent our being <hi>partakers of other mens ſins;</hi> ſo that if our Brother periſh, he periſheth to himſelf. This is the way to keep our ſelves <hi>pure from the blood of all men,<note place="margin">Acts 20.26.</note> by declaring to them the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God.</hi> This is the way to entail, God's Bleſſing on us: <hi>To them that rebuke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 24.25.</note> 
               <hi>a good bleſſing ſhall come upon them.</hi> Nay, it is not only the way to procure God's
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109548:9"/>
favour, but Man's too. A well-given reproof will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate the Reprover with the Reproved. <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh a man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 28.23.</note> 
               <hi>afterwards ſhall find more favour, than he that flattereth with the tongue.</hi> This is according to the former Obſervation, <hi>Rebuke a wiſe man, and he will love thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 9.8.</note> If we hereby be ſo <hi>wiſe</hi> as to <hi>turne many to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note> 
               <hi>we ſhall be ſo happy as to ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi> And one advantage more we ſhall gain, we hereby take a prudent courſe to provide for our ſelves a faithful Friend to perform the ſame kind office as occaſion ſerves. There is no member in the myſtical body of Chriſt, that may not need the aſſiſtance of another The eye hath need of the hand, the hand of the feet. We were ſometimes fooliſh and diſobedient; And had not we Preachers and Friends to admoniſh us? Freely you have received, freely give. Thy heart is not right, if thou who waſt a Stranger, cannot pity Strangers. Hereby alſo we ſhould countermine the Devil in two grand methods of his deceit, <hi>viz. The multitude of ſinners,</hi> and <hi>the Impunity of ſin.</hi> Reproof will abate the number of offenders, and ſhew the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent hazard and danger men run by continuing in their ſins. That impediment to the diſcharge of this Duty, <hi>viz. Singularity,</hi> would be taken off; weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians would be kept from being ſcandalized, and ſtrong ones from being grieved. If theſe Conſiderations are not ſufficient to ſhew us the neceſſity of taking up vigorous and ſpeedy reſolutions to live no longer in the neglect and ſinful omiſſion of fraternal Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, I know not what to add more that may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; But muſt leave ſuch to ſome other, and I fear, more dreadful way of conviction, when it will be too
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109548:9"/>
late to retrieve the loſs, either of their Brother or themſelves. I am forced to wave my Anſwer to the particular Cavils and Excuſes which many alledge for their diſcharge from this work. I therefore muſt come to the laſt particular propounded to be ſpoken to, which was,</p>
            <p>The giving ſome <hi>Directions and Rules</hi> how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Reproof in ſuch a manner, as that we rationally may expect we ſhall ſee it turn to account.</p>
            <p>It is a great Art to do it aright, <hi>like the Husband-man's skill which his God doth teach him.</hi> Every one can find fault and chide; but to reprove diſcreetly and effectually, requires much wiſdom:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.11.</note> 
               <hi>The words of the wiſe are as goads, and as nails faſtned by the Maſters of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I ſhall not multiply <hi>Rules;</hi> but among the great throng of them, which by many have been produced, ſhall ſelect theſe few following:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule</hi> 1. Let the Rebuker look to it, that he be free from that Sin which he condemns in another. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s Conſcience was pricked to the quick, from the conſideration of the holineſs and juſtneſs of the Baptiſt. Thus did <hi>Samuel</hi> deal with the people;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12.3.</note> firſt he clears his own Innocence, and then charges them with their Sin. God Honours his Servants in the Conſciences of their greateſt Enemies. To accuſe a Man for Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Covetouſneſs, or any other ſin, and yet to live in it thy ſelf, What is this, but with <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Parable, to pronounce the ſentence of condemnation on thy ſelf? With what a controuling, over-powering force did our Saviour tax the ſins of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he prefaced his Diſcourſe with that bold Challenge, <hi>Who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109548:10"/>
is there amongst you that convinces me of ſin?</hi> He that lives in the commiſſion of that ſin he condemns in another, muſt expect that his words will recoyl upon himſelf, as a foul Gun doth in diſcharging. Let us ſo walk that our feet caſt not dirt into our mouths. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſavoury truth is hindred in its operation, by the ſtinking breath of him that delivers it. Every one deſires, if he muſt be ſtricken, that it be by the hand of the Righteous. To ſee a <hi>Judas</hi> caſt a Stone at a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Man, a <hi>Phariſee</hi> at an Hypocrite, an <hi>Herod</hi> at an Adulterer, is a ſight that creates laughter and contempt. None ſpeak at ſo great an advantage, as they whoſe <hi>Hands</hi> are lifted up to God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whilſt their <hi>Tongues</hi> are rebuking the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule</hi> 2. As the Reprover muſt look to it that he be <hi>faultleſs,</hi> ſo he muſt be ſure that his Brother be <hi>faulty;</hi> for otherwiſe thou doſt not reprove, but reproach him; and inſtead of being a Wiſe Admoniſher, thou art an Helliſh Accuſer of the Brethren; thou doſt not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duty of a Chriſtian, but doſt execute the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Devil. Two things muſt here be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That it be a <hi>ſin</hi> thou reproveſt him for.</item>
               <item>2. That it be <hi>His ſin</hi> thou reproveſt him for.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. That it be a <hi>ſin;</hi> Be ſure he be a tranſgreſſor of the Law, before thou ſmite him with this rod. There muſt be a breach of ſome Command, Affirmative or Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; directly, or by conſequence; either the doing what he ought not, or the not doing of what he ought. To judge a Man for an Hatband or Cuffs, for a Lace
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109548:10"/>
or piece of Ribbon, for a Knot or a Feather, (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth ſort of men have of late done) ſmells rank of pride, cenſoriouſneſs and uncharitableneſs. But alas! In what an Age do we live, where mens quarrels againſt one another ſhall take their riſe from ſuch minute and inconſiderable beginnings, that a wiſe Man is aſhamed to name them, being as inſignificant and unedifying, as he who ſtudied Thirty years, whither <hi>Virgil</hi>'s name ſhould be written with an <hi>I,</hi> or an <hi>E.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reprove not therefore thy Brother for things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or indifferent, for trivial and undecided matters. Be ſure you have good ground to proceed on. Beware of ſevere cenſures, and contentious debates. Many a matter that kindles unnatural heart-burnings between Profeſſors of Religion, when it comes to be ſcann'd, and fully underſtood, proves either nothing at all, or at moſt, nothing to the purpoſe. It was the caſe of the <hi>Reubenites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joſh. 22.12.</note> The Army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was raiſed againſt them, nothing but War, Fire and Sword were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for their building an <hi>Altar of Teſtimony</hi> in their journey; when they met together, and had diſcourſed the matter, and came to a right underſtanding of their Brethrens end and intentions,<note place="margin">V. 35.</note> they were preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. Thus our Brethren ſuffer often through our ignorance; to ſuch Reprovers we may ſay, what <hi>Job</hi> did to his miſtaken friends, who upbraided him with hypocriſy; <hi>How forcible are right words!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 6.25.</note> 
               <hi>but what doth your arguing reprove?</hi> Some conceive that <hi>Jacob</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the myſtery of his Son <hi>Soſeph</hi>'s Dream (concerning the <hi>Sun, Moon and Stars making obeiſance to him)</hi> whence it came, and how it ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, when, he read his chiding Lecture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:109548:11"/>2. Look to it carefully that the thing be not only a <hi>ſin</hi> you reprove him about, but that it be <hi>his</hi> ſin. It was foretold of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 11.3.</note> that <hi>he ſhall not judge after the ſight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears.</hi> Jealouſies and conjectures, hear ſays, fancies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, are not ſufficient grounds for reproof. The Rule of Charity is, <hi>Quiſque preſumitur quod bonus eſt, niſi conſtat de malo.</hi> Thus we read, neither <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>mourning,</hi> nor Chriſt's <hi>piping</hi> could paſs their hard cenſures; but the one has a <hi>Devil,</hi> and the other is a <hi>Glutton, and Wine-bibber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho Chriſt came to fulfil the Law, yet there were that accuſed him as a deſtroyer of it. Tho he decided the Queſtion fairly on <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſide, in the grand Caſe of Tribute and Cuſtom, yet there wanted not thoſe who charged him with diſloyalty.

A trifling ſlight reprehenſion, like old <hi>Eli</hi>'s to his profligate Sons, (who only ſhaked his head at them, when their heads rather ſhould have been

ſtricken off) What doth it ſignifie or avail? Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth more harm than good, and rather em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens than reforms the Offender.</p>
            <p>It is a piece of great Wiſdom and Skill to commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate our rebukes to the temper of the offender, and to the nature of his offence. Commonly we are either <hi>too remiſs</hi> if we endeavour <hi>Moderation,</hi> or <hi>too auſtere and rough</hi> if we deſign <hi>faithfulneſs:</hi> But I think there is little need to caution any perſons againſt overdoing in this kind, it is an Extreme few fall into, there being more danger in our <hi>oyl,</hi> than in our <hi>ſalt,</hi> i, e. as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, in our <hi>ſmooth words,</hi> than in our <hi>ſharp rebukes.</hi> I fear the greateſt work that is done in this matter, is ſowing of pillows under ſinners elbows, when our duty ſhould be quilting of thorns to lay under their backs, that when the bold and contumacious ſinner retires to his Chamber, he may alſo retire within himſelf, and be kept awake in his bed here, that ſo his ſleeping an everlaſting ſleep of death, and making his bed in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable flames may be prevented. Command then thy brother in the name of God to be think himſelf, to repent and reform, to read what the God of Truth and Juſtice has threatned againſt him if he do not amend and turn; fight him with this glittering Sword of God's Word, and 'tis the likelieſt way to make his ſins fall before thee, and to give up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral other weighty Directions relating to the prudent management of this important duty of Fraternal Rebuke, which I muſt paſs by with a very little reference to them; that ſo as we ought to pray read, ſing, and perform all Chriſtian Offices with the Spirit, and with our Underſtandings alſo; ſo we may perform this in that manner, that it may not be a <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109548:13"/>
of fools.</hi> Let us apply our ſelves to learn that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is from above, ſo as to take the Sinner <hi>by a holy craft and guile;</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it.</p>
            <p>And here diſtinction ſhould be made between the Perſons and Crimes of Offenders, the proper Seaſons, and the particular Ways and Methods of Reproof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt diſtinguiſh between <hi>the Perſons.</hi> Of ſome we are <hi>to have compaſſion, making a difference.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a difference between men in publick and private capacities; <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 22.18.</note> 
               <hi>nor curſe the ruler of thy people.</hi> Rough and unhewn language is not to be uſed to them. <hi>Shimei</hi> ſaid nothing more in ſubſtance to <hi>David,</hi> than <hi>Nathan</hi> did, but it was in a very ſcurrilous and railing manner. Tho we may <hi>rebuke,</hi> we muſt not <hi>revile:</hi> Difference muſt be made between the <hi>tempers</hi> of ſinners. There cannot be an uniform proceeding with all, but we muſt vary according to their diſpoſitions. Some men are like Thorns, which if gently touched, hurt not; but if you graſp them with an hard and unwary hand, they will fetch blood: Others are like Nettles, which if they are nicely and delicately handled, ſting and prick, but if cloſely and roughly preſs'd and graſp'd, you may pull them up without pain or harm.</p>
            <p>Before therefore you reprove a ſinner, know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a <hi>Thorn</hi> or <hi>Nettle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Difference is to be made betwixt their <hi>Crimes.</hi> As the Offence is great or ſmall, ſo ſhould the reproof be <hi>ſharp</hi> or <hi>mild.</hi> There are Beams and Motes, Pimples and Plague-ſores, Scratches and Ulcers. We muſt not hang a man for filching a pin or a rattle, and whip him gently and tenderly for Murther and Treaſon. As
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109548:14"/>
the Offence is more ſecretly, or more impudently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, whether drunk in the Night in his Chamber, or at noon-day in the <hi>Exchange:</hi> Some ſin publickly, the greater is their ſin, and ſo ſhould their ſhame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they give the greater ſcandal; others ſin more privately; our Reprehenſion in this caſe ought to be auricular, and there is no better Sepulchre than that of ſecreſie, wherein to bury his more hidden failings. There is no need of going to the Houſe-top, when a Cloſet would be more proper. Thus we ſee, that tho all ſins want an equal Price and Merit for Atonement and Satisfaction, yet they require not equal ſeverity in our Rebukes and Admonitions. Some muſt have Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitives, others Corroſives. Superiors may be reformed by Exhortation, Equals by Friendly Admonition; and Inferiors (if in the higheſt form and chair of Scorners) by ſevere Reprehenſion. We muſt not indeed be fiery-hot in terrifying the meaner ſort, and look upon the rich as that Mount which muſt not be touched. We muſt not talk one half in the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the other in that of <hi>Aſhdod;</hi> but let us go to work impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, not executing the command, as <hi>Saul</hi> did againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> when he ſpared the fat and chief, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the poor and refuſe. This made that excellent Emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> have ſo great a value for St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> becauſe he was not affrighted with the huffing of the Proudeſt, and had great compaſſion to the ſouls of the pooreſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt make a difference in the <hi>ſeaſons</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; <hi>There is a time to ſpeak, and a time to be ſilent.</hi> It is difficult here to aſſign the <hi>mollia fandi tempora,</hi> the ſoft Articles and Opportunities wherein we are to ſpeak, becauſe variety of Circumſtances may alter
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109548:14"/>
the caſe; only all muſt agree to do it as ſoon as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently we may. Delays harden. As we muſt <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,</hi> ſo we muſt <hi>rebuke</hi> daily, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. Suffer not ſin <hi>to lye upon him,</hi> nor he in his ſin one day longer, if it be in your power to help it. But eſpecially avoid thy rebuking of him, when he is like the wild Aſs, with whom there is no medling while ſhe is in the heat and fervour of her luſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. but ſhe hath her parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular month to be taken in. <hi>Abigal</hi> deferred to reprove <hi>Nabal</hi> in his Wine; ſhe let him ſleep it out, thinking the beſt time to give him this Phyſick, would be when he was faſting in the Morning. Good Phyſicians eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate not the body in extremity either of heat or cold. Watch when thy Brother is <hi>himſelf,</hi> nay, <hi>more than himſelf,</hi> humble, tender, and pliable, then he is indeed a qualified recipient. Such are times of Affliction and Fear, Sickneſs and impending Chaſtiſements. But do not under pretence of a more convenient ſeaſon, total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect and ſhift off thy Duty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are to make difference in the ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of reproving; ſometimes <hi>plainly and directly,</hi> as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, Thou art the man;</hi> at other times more <hi>covertly,</hi> by intimation and circumlocution. The Sun keeps the world in good temper, by moving in an oblique Circle; and Ships (Mariners ſay) ſail beſt, and make the greateſt way with ſide-winds.</p>
            <p>I crave leave only to Apply what has been ſaid in theſe following ways, when I have laid down this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Caution, <hi>viz.</hi> That tho Reproof is then beſt taken, when it is beſt given, (according to thoſe Directions now given) yet no man muſt reject it, becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover wants thoſe due Qualifications to render him every way meet for his work. Good Counſel from a bad
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109548:15"/>
man muſt not be ſlighted; <hi>Balaam</hi> was a bad man, yet he had a good wiſh, and uttered a moſt excellent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie. A diſeaſed Phyſician may preſcribe good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; a lame Steward may diſtribute his Maſters Alms: Ungrounded is that Doctrine both of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> and ſeveral others, who tell us, That the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of God's Ordinances depends upon the goodneſs and <hi>right intentions</hi> of the Prieſt and Miniſter. What, ſhall I not be ſaved by hearing, unleſs the Preacher be ſaved, whom I hear? Is the Grace of God tied to the Miniſtry of man? Shall the Servant ſhare the Honour, and part ſtakes with his Maſter? Our Lord and Great Prophet taught the people to obſerve their Doctrines that ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair; tho without breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he called them Serpents and Hypocrites. <hi>Sampſon</hi> did not diſdain the Sweets, becauſe he found them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanly laid in the Lions Carkaſs. His diet was ſtrict enough, he might not eat that which ſavoured of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Impurity, yet refuſed not a Honey-comb, becauſe found in the belly of a dead Beaſt. Honey is Honey, tho in a dead Lyon.</p>
            <p>Having inſerted this neceſſary <hi>Caution,</hi> I ſhall in the Cloſe, ſubjoin Two or Three Things by way of <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, Reproof,</hi> and <hi>Advice,</hi> by way of more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</p>

woe unto us! we have ſtopped our ears againſt the loud and reiterated Rebukes of Heaven.

There are four ways, in a more ſingular and eminent manner, by which God has reprehended us.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By his Word.</item>
                  <item>2. By our Conſciences.</item>
                  <item>3. By the Examples of Good Men.</item>
                  <item>4. By his Judgments on Bad Men.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. By his <hi>Word;</hi> That is profitable for <hi>reproof;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> for reproof of Errors and falſe Doctrines; for <hi>correction</hi> of ſin and evil manners. Every one that doth evil, hates this ſacred Torch, <hi>neither cometh to this light,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. He reproves by our own Conſciences. How often do they check and chide us? 'Tis ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> as ſoon as he had cut off the lap of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment <hi>(his heart ſmote him)</hi> that is, his Conſcience recoil'd upon him. Conſcience is the great <hi>Regiſter</hi> and <hi>Recorder of</hi> the World; it hath the Pen of a ready writer; not a word or thought eſcapes its ſwift Pencil. It is God's <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographer,</hi> which writes not only <hi>Anuals,</hi> but <hi>Diaries;</hi> it hath its Book and Table, wherein it indelibly writes mens Tranſgreſſions and Swervings.

Play and Gaming, Muſick and Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Company and many diverſions of the ſame nature, have been caſt in to ſtill this importunate and offenſive babler, whoſe tongue will never lye ſtill.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God reproves by the <hi>Examples of Good Men. Noah condemned</hi> the old world for their ſecurity, by his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an Ark.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> A good man leads a <hi>convincing life,</hi> and there is an <hi>Elenctical</hi> Power in his holy deportment.

               <p n="4">4. God reproves by his <hi>Judgments on bad men;</hi> he reproves both by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Rod,</hi> as by the <hi>teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his mouth,</hi> ſo by the <hi>works of his hands. Thou haſt rebuked the heathen,</hi>

Whoſe Eye doth not weep, whoſe Heart doth not ake, to ſee the Miſery of ſuch a perſon, whom nothing cooler than unquenchable burnings, and nothing lighter than the heavy ſtrokes of an incenſed and Almighty hand, can make ſenſible of their ſinful Omiſſions of this, nature?</p>
               <p>We muſt all cry <hi>Guilty</hi> at our <hi>Arraignment</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment</hi> for our <hi>Copartnerſhip</hi> with others in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: we have not prevented that Sin we have had fair Opportunities to cruſh in the very Egg. <hi>Jeroboam made Iſrael to ſin:</hi> But how? He neither forbid them by <hi>Word,</hi> nor prevented them by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2.14.</note>It is ſaid, St. <hi>Peter</hi> compelled the Gentiles to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daize.</hi> How did he ſo? Not by what he <hi>preached,</hi> but by what he <hi>practiſed:</hi> They ſinned after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of their Spiritual Father's Tranſgreſſion. How many <hi>Tranſgreſſors have we beheld,</hi>

                  <hi>and</hi> never <hi>grieved becauſe they kept not God's Word?</hi> Doubtleſs not to do Good, is to do Evil. We have Sins enough of our own to anſwer for. <hi>Our Father, died in his own ſin,</hi> ſaid <hi>Zelophehad's</hi> Daughters. Our own Sins are ſufficient
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109548:22"/>
enough to our Ruine, we need not the <hi>additional aid</hi> other Mens; yet we every day call in for freſh Contributions to our own perſonal Tranſgreſſions, and no way more than this, by <hi>connivence</hi> at the Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and Tranſgreſſions of others, to whom we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently enough authorized to give check.</p>
               <p>Be not therefore deterred from your Duty, becauſe your habitual neglect of it has been of ſo long ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. You muſt force your ſelves againſt all preſenting Difficulties; the Objections of your own <hi>Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and the reproved Sinners <hi>Obstinacy,</hi> muſt not be entertained, but repelled with all Chriſtian Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. I acknowledge it is no eaſie matter to bear a Reproof well, tho never ſo well adminiſtred. No Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar can bereave a Pill of its natural bitterneſs; and it fares with Offenders, as with thoſe who are awakened out of their ſleep, they are unquiet, and ready to brawl at their beſt Friends. Dogs in a chaſe will ſometimes bark at their own Maſters. There are few like the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> who lov'd <hi>Christ</hi> the better for finding her out in her ſin. But remember, <hi>thy Lord will be aſhamed of thee, if thou art of him;</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is aſhame'd of his <hi>Commandments,</hi> is aſham'd of his <hi>Lord</hi> that enacted them. If They can boldly <hi>ſin,</hi> way ſhould not We boldly <hi>reprove?</hi> Only Sin is truly ſhameful; and it is a very commendable importunity to ſollicite men to be kind to themſelves, and to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb</hi> them till they conſult their own <hi>Everlaſting Reſt.</hi> For fear of offending thy <hi>Brother,</hi> wilt thou reſolve to offend <hi>God?</hi> Whoſe diſpleaſure is moſt to be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>God</hi>'s or <hi>Man</hi>'s? Remember he is far from being
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109548:23"/>
impertinent, who will not ſuffer his Brother undiſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedly to go to Hell: He is far from being a buſie-body, who engages himſelf to ſave his Brother who is on the brink of Ruine. To be employ'd where God calls, is ſufficient Commiſſion for any man to act upon. Do your Duty, leave the ſucceſs to God, who is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bleſs his own Inſtitutions. Reſolve upon a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy complying with your Duty. Life is uncertain; <hi>He</hi> may die who <hi>wants</hi> our Reproof, <hi>We</hi> may die who are to <hi>give it,</hi> and ſo be out of the reach of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: <hi>Our Mouths</hi> and <hi>Their Ears</hi> will in a ſhort compaſs of time be ſtopp'd with <hi>Aſhes.</hi> Do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſiſt in the neglect of this Duty any longer. <hi>Omiſſions</hi> will damn as certainly as <hi>Commiſſions;</hi> and it is all one whether we go to Hell for <hi>one Sin</hi> or <hi>many.</hi> Be not therefore too thrifty of thy Tongue, when a word may do much good. We are not born all to ourſelves, but ſomewhat to our Brother, Neighbour, and Friend; and we are guilty of the loſs of that Soul we might ſave, and do not.</p>
               <p>I am ſure <hi>(with the Apoſtle)</hi> that <hi>He cannot love God whom he hath not ſeen, who loves not his Brother whom he hath ſeen,</hi> and can endure to <hi>ſee miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In being thus Friends to <hi>others,</hi> we chiefly befriend <hi>our ſelves;</hi> and never let us think much of our pains, when we are rewarded with ſo great Bleſſings for our Work.</p>
