            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>Acts XIII. 39.</bibl>
                  <p>And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law of Moses.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE <hi>Subject,</hi> I have, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, undertaken to treat of, may peradventure, to some at first proposal, not seem altogether so proper and suitable to our present <hi>occasion.</hi> Yet when ye well consider the purport of the words I have now read to you, that <hi>Faith</hi> is the great instrument and advantage of a Christians life; for <hi>the just shall live by his faith</hi>: and that <hi>Justification</hi> or forgiveness of sins is the main comfort, any Christian can have at his death; inasmuch as <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, shall not die for ever, and though he die, yet shall he live</hi>; and over and above, that the <hi>Gospel-state</hi> affords us Christians that help


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37154:3"/>
towards these ends, which the <hi>Jewish oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> could not do to them: ye must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with me, there cannot be a more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual <hi>Exhortation</hi> for us that survive, then that of <hi>Faith</hi>; nor a fuller <hi>Consolation</hi> over our deceased Friends, then that of being <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified</hi>; whereby at our departure hence we have a prospect of ensuing bliss in the other world, by being assured through faith in Christ, of pardon and acceptance, and of escaping the wrath to come. This <hi>justifying</hi> faith, I say, is the ground of all a Christians present <hi>duties</hi> here in this life, and of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>expectations</hi> hereafter in the next. This it was made the Apostle say, <hi>To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain</hi>: a <hi>Motto</hi> which every Christian may bear upon his Scutcheon, and inscribe upon the shield of his faith. For <hi>by Christ all that believe are justified from all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> being in a Synagogue of the Jews at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pisidia</hi> on the Sabbath day, after the reading of the <hi>Lessons,</hi> out of the <hi>Law</hi> one, and the other out of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as their custom was; being desired by the Rulers of


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37154:3"/>
the Synagogue, the chief of the Assembly, to speak, if he had any thing to say for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the people, takes occasion, after he had given them a brief <hi>historical</hi> account of the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Common-wealth down to <hi>David,</hi> to preach unto them <hi>Jesus,</hi> and to assert his <hi>Messiaship,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his lineal descent from that King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> according to promise, <hi>vers.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>By the Testimony of <hi>John</hi> his fore-runner, <hi>vers.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>By the Completion of Prophecies in his <hi>Passion, Crucifixion, Death,</hi> and <hi>Burial, vers.</hi> 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lasty, and most especially, by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous <hi>Resurrection,</hi> whereof there were many witnesses still alive, <hi>vers.</hi> 30, 31 And that accordingly as <hi>David</hi> himself had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in his Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> particularly in the sixteenth, where he says, <hi>Thou shalt not suffer thy holy One to see corruption</hi>; which words in the 36. <hi>v.</hi> he says, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served before in his first Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. could not be meant of <hi>Davids</hi> own person, who having served his generation, died as other

men do, and never rose out of that sepulcher he was laid in; his body having long since moulderd into dust, and his monument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining still among them till that day. And now from all these <hi>Arguments</hi> he draws this <hi>Conclusion</hi> in this and the verse immediately foregoing. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto you forgiveness of sins. And by him all that believe,</hi> &amp;c. and then last of all he pursues and drives home this <hi>Doctrine</hi> with a vehement <hi>Application,</hi> in the <hi>two next verses,</hi> forewarning them to take heed of rejecting the Gospel, as we find they did on the next Sabbath-day, <hi>vers.</hi> 46. when upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward and unworthy carriage of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Apostle disclaims them, and turns to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I given you a short <hi>Analysis,</hi> and Survey of the Apostles whole discourse, the sense and main design whereof lies in the <hi>Text,</hi> that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was the expected <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> the Saviour of the world, by whom and by him alone <hi>Justification</hi> through <hi>Faith</hi> in him, and forgiveness of sins, which is the


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37154:4"/>
proper notion and importance of salvation, is to be obtained.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine of <hi>Justification</hi> by faith in <hi>Christ</hi> is set down here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Affirmatively, <hi>in Thesi, By him all that believe are justified from all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Negatively, <hi>per Antithesin,</hi> in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Mosaical</hi> observances; <hi>from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Affirmative part we have</p>
            <p n="1">1. A great <hi>Priviledge,</hi> or the <hi>Benefit</hi> it self, wherein Gods favour and mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness doth mainly consist; and that's <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Ground</hi> of it; <hi>Christ.</hi> What by his <hi>Merit</hi>; 'tis <hi>in him,</hi> for his sake, and through his satisfaction, we are justified. What by his <hi>Spirit</hi>; 'tis <hi>by him,</hi> by his vertue and efficacy working in us, that we are justified.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Condition</hi> or <hi>Qualification,</hi> which makes us capable of it, or, as some love ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to term it; the <hi>Instrument</hi> by which 'tis applied and made ours; and that's <hi>faith. They that believe are justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Extent</hi> of it, and the latitude it bears. And that twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:37154:5"/>1. As to its <hi>Subject, in quo, viz.</hi> the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> justified; <hi>all that believe,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>every one that believes is justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As to its <hi>Object, circa quod,</hi> to wit, the <hi>things</hi> from which Justification is to free and release Believers. And that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>from all things,</hi> from all charge and incumbrance, from all damages and inconveniences, which otherwise might upon strict rules of Justice befal them.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Negative</hi> part is expressed the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and insufficience of the <hi>Mosaical Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> for the attaining this Righteousness, which is to be had only by <hi>Christ</hi>; that <hi>we could not be justified from those things by the Law of Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see then, that I have a large field of discourse before me, were I, which cannot well be expected from me in these straights of time, at large to speak of <hi>Justification,</hi> of <hi>Christs Satisfaction,</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> of the <hi>legal Administration,</hi> which are so many <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and would each of them require a Volume to be treated of in their full importance. It will be enough that


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37154:5"/>
I briefly touch at each particular head seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and so as may be most agreeable to the purpose of our present meeting, to the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> of the Hearers.</p>
            <p>And I shall take this <hi>Method,</hi> first to shew, what is meant by <hi>Justification,</hi> or by being <hi>justified.</hi> Next to prove the insufficience of <hi>Moses his Law,</hi> and its inability of justifying the observers of it: and then in the last place to make out how we are justified <hi>by Christ,</hi> and that through <hi>Faith</hi> in him. For so the words stand in the <hi>Greek,</hi> in this order I have here set them in; <hi>From all things from which ye could not be justified by,</hi> or <hi>in the Law of Moses, by,</hi> or <hi>in him,</hi> namely, in <hi>Christ, every one that believeth is justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> then what <hi>Justification</hi> is. To be <hi>justified</hi> is to be accounted and lookt upon as righteous and perfectly just in the sight of Good, our <hi>Law-giver</hi> and our <hi>Judge</hi>; and thereupon to be absolutely discharged and acquitted according to the tenour of the <hi>Law</hi> by the Sentence of the <hi>Judge</hi> from all the penalties that were to be inflicted upon the transgressors of the Law, and for that our


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37154:6"/>
Righteousness to be accepted of God in our persons and performances, and in the end to be eternally rewarded. And this all grounded upon the nature and sanction of a <hi>Law,</hi> which as it proposes <hi>Commands</hi> and Rules to be observed, so is ratified with <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> on one hand of reward to the obedient, and on the other hand with <hi>Threats</hi> of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to those that shall be found guilty of the breach of it. Now this <hi>Justification,</hi> had the <hi>Covenant of Nature</hi> stood, the <hi>Law of Moses</hi> continued in force; must have been made out by our own personal exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to every tittle of our obligations: for this was the tenour of that Law. <hi>Do this and live,</hi> and <hi>Cursed be every one that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in all the words of the Law to do them</hi>: and this is that is called <hi>legal</hi> Righteousness. But in <hi>Christ,</hi> under the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> which was substituted in the room and stead of that other, the <hi>Law of Faith</hi> has altered the terms, thus; <hi>He that believes, shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>; and <hi>He that believeth not, shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> So that now faith in Christ and sincerity of obedience, (for there are <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi>


               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:37154:6"/>
too as well as <hi>Promises,</hi> and <hi>Threats</hi> even in this Law of Faith) is that we call <hi>Evangelical Righteousness</hi>; whereby we are through that satisfaction, Christ as our surety hath by his <hi>active</hi> and <hi>passive</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wrought for us, which through <hi>Faith</hi> in him is imputed unto us for Righteousness, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by him, to the forgiveness of our <hi>sins,</hi> to the acceptation of our <hi>persons,</hi> and to the reward of our <hi>services.</hi> Again this <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is indeed <hi>attained</hi> in this life, being laid hold on by <hi>Faith,</hi> evidenced by our <hi>obedience,</hi> and sealed to every particular Believers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science by the <hi>Spirit of Promise</hi>: but in the next life will be <hi>declared</hi> in open Court at the general Assizes of all Mankind at the last day, so that the true Believer lives &amp; dies in peace of conscience, as having an assurance through <hi>Faith,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> by his death has satisfied for his sins, and purchased for him everlasting life. For so we find <hi>Justification</hi> explained in this very <hi>Chapter,</hi> by comparing the 38. and 26. verses with our Text. What he had said there, <hi>to you is the word of this salvation sent,</hi> repeating it here in other words. <hi>Through

this man is preached unto you forgiveness of sins.</hi> So that to be justified is to have our sins forgiven, and our souls saved.</p>
            <p>Having thus stated and distinguished <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> we are now to remove the <hi>legal</hi> Righteousness, that we may establish the Righteousness by <hi>Faith,</hi> and to shew that the <hi>Law of Moses</hi> was unable and insufficient for the justifying of any one. Where first we are to premise an usual <hi>Distinction</hi> of that <hi>Law</hi> into <hi>Moral, Ceremonial,</hi> and <hi>Judicial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Judicial Law</hi> was peculiar to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Common-wealth, designed only for <hi>external polity,</hi> and for the quiet and regular administration of the Civil State of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor has it any obligation upon any other people any further, then, as it was a body of <hi>Statutes</hi> appointed by God himself for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his own people, it deserves our <hi>veneration,</hi> and as far as the circumstances and customs of other Countries will admit, an <hi>imitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Ceremonial Law</hi> was most properly the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> wherein were delivered the rules of Gods Worship, which consisted of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifications</hi>


               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37154:7"/>
and <hi>Expiations,</hi> and other <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rites.</hi> That again obliged none but <hi>Jews,</hi> and their <hi>Proselytes,</hi> and was to have an end at the coming of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Moral Law</hi> was not so much the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as the Law of <hi>Adam,</hi> that which is written in every mans heart, and was obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to all mankind before <hi>Moses,</hi> and will be so to the end of the world; such as are all the Precepts of the <hi>Decalogue.</hi> For though there be somewhat in them ceremonial, to which none but <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged, as in the fourth the strictness of the <hi>Sabbath-rest,</hi> and the very day it self (for had it not been so, it could not have been altered; whatsoever is in its nature purely <hi>moral,</hi> being of a <hi>perpetual</hi> as well as <hi>universal,</hi> and of an indispensable obligation) I say, notwithstanding somewhat of Ceremony intermixt, the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves commanded or forbidden in those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts are acknowledged and owned by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light of Nature; as that God should have a proportion of our time bestowed on his service, which in equity could not be less then a seventh part. Beyond all this, our


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37154:8"/>
               <hi>Saviour</hi> himself tells us, he came not to <hi>destroy</hi> this Law, but to <hi>fulfil</hi> it in his own person, and heighten its obligations upon us his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. And it appears by circumstances here, that the Apostle addressing his speech to the <hi>Jews</hi> might very likely mean only the Law of <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as possibly he does in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and other places by <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> intend mainly the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> and other <hi>Rites</hi> and observances, which some <hi>Converts</hi> of that Religion, at the first propagation of the Gospel, mainly insisted on, and mixed with their Christianity: a perswasion and practice, which the <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> does every where upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as he meets with it, endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute. Yet this <hi>Law</hi> also having been given by <hi>Moses</hi> in some sense, as to the promulgation of it, and the accommodating it to the use and interest of his Country-men, I shall take it in too, and make good, that neither the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Jews, could; nor the performance of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, to which all men are obliged can or ever could justifie any man. And


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37154:8"/>
this according to that place, <hi>The Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Moses; but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ,</hi> where as <hi>Truth</hi> is opposed to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> so <hi>Grace</hi> is to the <hi>Law of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> besides that it laboured under other disadvantages, as that it was <hi>burdensom</hi> in its charge, and in its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and it was <hi>obscure,</hi> compared to Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel light, as being but <hi>the shadow of good things to come</hi>; it was in its very constitution <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> and <hi>impotent,</hi> and that in two respects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was not <hi>commensurate</hi> to the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all mankind; that <hi>Levitical</hi> service having been prescribed only, and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a characteristical mark of distinction betwixt them and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was not <hi>adequate</hi> to its end; which was the expiation of guilt, the atonement of wrath, and propitiation for sins. For <hi>it was not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins,</hi> as the Apostle argues, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.4. Wherefore <hi>the Law,</hi> as he says there, <hi>could not by those Sacrifices,</hi> which were fain to be continually repeated, <hi>make the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37154:9"/>
thereunto perfect.</hi> For indeed what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion was there betwixt those mean obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the ransom and price of souls? For the <hi>Verdict</hi> of the Law was, that <hi>the soul that sins shall die.</hi> What amends then could the death of a poor beast make for the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of its owner? or how could those sorry acknowledgments reconcile Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? Which made the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> cry out, VI. 7. <hi>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oyl? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul</hi>? No, this would have been no compensation. It cost more to redeem souls then so.</p>
            <p>But, you'l say, if it be so, what use was there then of those <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices?</hi> Was no one justified under that Law, no Righteousness to be had by that Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Yes, but 'twas the righteousness of <hi>Faith</hi> then too, and those that were, were justified by <hi>Christ,</hi> who was represented and typified in


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37154:9"/>
those <hi>legal Rites</hi>: for it was the immaculate <hi>Lamb</hi> that virtuated all those <hi>Oblations,</hi> and the whole <hi>Pedagogie</hi> of that Law had its effect and consummation in him. Wherefore it was to be but of a <hi>temporary</hi> date, and as it pointed to him, so it was to end in him.</p>
            <p>Nor was the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law only imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but the <hi>Moral</hi> is so too, that which has a natural obligation upon all men. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of this Law, as to <hi>Justification,</hi> is <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> from our weakness, <hi>partly</hi> from its own.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>We</hi> are naturally unable to perform it in an <hi>exact</hi> obedience: and though some <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi> are bold to say, that a man may by the strength of <hi>Nature</hi> satisfie all the demands of that Law we are by nature obliged to; a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which modest <hi>Philosophers</hi> amongst Heathens disclaim; as appears by the <hi>body of death,</hi> the blessed Apostle complains of, and other passages in him, taken out of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Plato.</hi> Yet supposing, that there were no <hi>original corruption,</hi> and that a man could lead a <hi>perfect life</hi>; which are two things that are not to be supposed; for what man ever was there beside the Son of God, that was


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37154:10"/>
either born, or lived without sin? If he could make <hi>satisfaction,</hi> where would be his <hi>merit?</hi> Or how could he extend that satisfaction to the benefit of others? But alas! Scripture tells us, <hi>no man hath redeemed his own soul</hi>; much less is he in a capacity to do it for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but must let that alone for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we are unable to go through what the Law requires, so the <hi>Law</hi> also is unable to help us. It lays <hi>Rules</hi> indeed before us, and <hi>Obligations</hi> upon us, and convinces us sufficiently of the <hi>Duty</hi> we owe; but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes us with no <hi>strength</hi> for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. <hi>I had not known sin,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>but for the Law,</hi> no, nor practised it neither. For (which shews the <hi>pravity</hi> as well as <hi>weakness</hi> of our nature) <hi>lust</hi> takes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the <hi>Law,</hi> and breaks out with the more violence from under its restraints. Not but that the <hi>Law</hi> is in it self <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> but <hi>sin</hi> finds occasion from the Law to be <hi>exceeding sinful.</hi> Wherefore he affirms elsewhere, that as <hi>the sting of death is sin,</hi> so <hi>the strength of sin is the Law</hi>; from whence sin hath all its damning power; since


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37154:10"/>
without the Law sin could not damn us; for <hi>where there's no law, there's no transgression.</hi> But what follows? <hi>But thanks be to God,</hi> says he, <hi>which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and that's our <hi>third</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
            <p>That we are <hi>justified by Christ</hi> alone. What <hi>Moses</hi> could not do in his Law, <hi>Christ</hi> has done in his. <hi>Grace</hi> has supplied the defects of <hi>Nature</hi>; and what was wanting to <hi>Legal</hi> Righteousness, is made up by the <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> The <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as they were to have their <hi>period,</hi> so were to have their <hi>completion</hi> too at the coming of <hi>Truth</hi>: and the <hi>Law of Works</hi> is not so much superseded, as 'tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished in its end, by the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> which exserts it self, though not in an <hi>exact,</hi> as was then required, yet in, that, which is now accepted, a <hi>sincere</hi> obedience. Now this <hi>Justification</hi> I told you, is had by Christ two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>imputation</hi> of his <hi>satisfaction</hi> and <hi>merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By the <hi>influence</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> I am sorry to find that some men among


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37154:11"/>
us take offence at these terms of <hi>imputed Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>infused Grace,</hi> as <hi>notions</hi> that do not so well square with <hi>Right (i. e.</hi> they mean their) <hi>reason.</hi> But as sure as our sins were <hi>imputed</hi> to Christ, so really is his Righteousness imputed unto us: and as sure as we have no natural ability of our selves to any thing that good is, so certain is it, that we are to be <hi>influenced</hi> by Gods good Spirit, infusing a <hi>principle</hi> of grace into us, and accompanying that grace along with his assistances in its particular <hi>acts.</hi> Otherwise I am to seek which way we are to expect, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be <hi>justified,</hi> or to be <hi>sanctified:</hi> for I hope they will not say our <hi>Justification</hi> or <hi>Sanctification</hi> is from our selves, and so make men to become their own <hi>Saviours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We are justified by <hi>Christ, per modum meriti,</hi> as a <hi>meritorious</hi> cause; by vertue of that <hi>satisfaction</hi> he has made for us. For the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> having in our behalf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon a mutual <hi>Covenant</hi> and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that whosoever <hi>believes,</hi> should through Christ have <hi>forgiveness</hi> of his sins, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the <hi>well-beloved</hi>; and <hi>Christ</hi> on his


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37154:11"/>
part having in his own person fulfilled the <hi>Law,</hi> and fully answered all its demands, and satisfied <hi>Divine Justice</hi> for us; it now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains that God, as he is <hi>faithful,</hi> will forgive our sins, if we be faithful; and that he will in <hi>justice</hi> justifie us sinners by <hi>Faith</hi> in his Sons sufferings. For so he that knew no sin was made <hi>sin</hi> for us, that we through his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might be made <hi>righteous.</hi> To this <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> of his, which was of it self <hi>plenary,</hi> the <hi>dignity</hi> and excellency of the <hi>person</hi> that undertook and performed for us, has added that illustrious advantage, that there has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued a large stock of <hi>merit,</hi> a purchase of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> for all <hi>Believers,</hi> as well as of <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> for true <hi>Penitents.</hi> Nor is it his <hi>merit</hi> alone, for which we are <hi>justified.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are justified by him <hi>per modum ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientiae</hi> too, as an <hi>efficient</hi> cause, by the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> And this was to ascertain his purchase and to apply his acquists: and therefore, when he had finished the work of our Redemption he came into this lower world about, he not only ascended himself


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37154:12"/>
into Heaven, there to sit at the right hand of the Father, and by continual <hi>intercessions</hi> to plead and make good his <hi>merits</hi>; but did also send down the <hi>Spirit</hi> to keep residence here below, &amp; to perform the office of an <hi>Advocate</hi> and a <hi>Comforter,</hi> and made him the great <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stee</hi> to issue out the revenues of his grace. Besides, all things in him are gathered into <hi>one,</hi> and there is that strict <hi>Vnion</hi> and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>Communion</hi> betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of the Church, and all the lively <hi>Members</hi> of that his <hi>mystical Body,</hi> all true Believers, that they and he are one, <hi>as the Father and he are one.</hi> For he having <hi>espoused</hi> our <hi>nature</hi> as well as our <hi>quarrel,</hi> the vertue of that <hi>hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Vnion</hi> extends it self over all, even to the very dust of the Faithful, that sleep in their graves. From this close <hi>Vnion</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that all Believers, as being parts of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, are animated and acted by his <hi>Spirit</hi> effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in several <hi>operations</hi>; such as these are in the matter of <hi>Justification</hi> we are now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that by this Spirit of his, the <hi>merits</hi> of Christ are applied to us, and that our <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> are sprinkled with his blood from dead


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37154:12"/>
works, to the purging away of guilt, that the <hi>pardon</hi> of our sins is assured and sealed to us, that <hi>Faith</hi> is wrought in our hearts, and that a sufficience of <hi>Grace</hi> is given in to us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are inabled to every good work. And all this according to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> by which he was to purchase not <hi>pardon</hi> only, but <hi>grace</hi> also for us, whereby we might be as dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the <hi>guilt,</hi> so released from the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and <hi>dominion</hi> of sin, if we rightly imploy our victorious <hi>Faith</hi>: which is the <hi>condition,</hi> or, if you will, taking the word in a <hi>moral</hi> sense, the <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Justification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this we are now to speak of, and then conclude with the <hi>extent</hi> of it, that 'tis <hi>all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> are justified, and they are justified <hi>from all things.</hi> And these two will make up our applicatory part, the <hi>condition</hi> for our <hi>Instruction</hi> and <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and the <hi>extent</hi> for a word of <hi>Comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing then that <hi>Justification</hi> is so great an advantage and <hi>priviledge,</hi> such a <hi>benefit</hi> and blessing, as none is to be compared to it, as that which sanctifies and sweetens all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of <hi>this</hi> life, and ascertains Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37154:13"/>
and glorious hopes to us in the <hi>next</hi>: that which renders all conditions comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, living or dying; whereas without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sins and peace of conscience, let a mans outward fortunes be what they will, the man is an utter stranger to true happiness, whilst he is <hi>here,</hi> and will be abandoned to a sad miserable estate to all eternity <hi>hereafter</hi>: and seeing that this <hi>Justfication</hi> is not to be had but by <hi>Christ</hi> alone, who took upon him to be our <hi>surety,</hi> and has done and suffered all that was necessary to be done and suffered for us in order to our salvation, and has by his <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> purchased for us <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> whereby we may be saved; and that the <hi>merit</hi> of his <hi>satisfaction</hi> can no other way be derived and conveyed to us but by <hi>Faith</hi> in him, a reliance on his <hi>merit,</hi> and an obedience to his <hi>Gospel</hi>; and that without our faith <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Gospel</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> it self can stand us in no stead; and all the merits of his <hi>obedience</hi> and the benefits of his <hi>Passion,</hi> and the dispensations of his <hi>Grace</hi> will signifie nothing, be of none effect to us, if we remain still in our <hi>unbelief</hi>; let us be


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37154:13"/>
exhorted to have <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>holy Jesus,</hi> to have recourse to him as to our <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Advocate,</hi> to imbrace him upon his own terms, to nail our sins to his <hi>Cross,</hi> to cast our burden upon him, who is able to save to the utmost all that put their trust in him, to shelter our selves in <hi>the clefts of that Rock</hi> the wounds of our dear <hi>Saviour,</hi> and renouncing all other hopes with a holy confidence roll our selves upon his <hi>satisfaction,</hi> that we may be cloathed with the robes of his <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and be found in him to the atoning of our offended God, to the pacifying and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our troubled and guilty consciences, and to the escaping of <hi>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish,</hi> and everlasting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which attend those that through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and impenitence live and die in their sins.</p>
            <p>But because <hi>Faith</hi> is a word of large and doubtful meaning in holy Writ, let me also for your better <hi>instruction,</hi> that no one may mistake himself, lay before you some of the most ordinary <hi>acceptions</hi> of the word, which yet do not come home to our purpose nor


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37154:14"/>
amount to a justifying <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>Faith</hi> is taken for <hi>an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of Divine Truths revealed in Gods Word.</hi> And this though it be enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate one <hi>Orthodox</hi> in his opinions, and sound in his judgment; yet if it be but <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> and hath no <hi>practical</hi> influence upon the heart and life, is no right sound <hi>Faith,</hi> by which a man shall be <hi>justified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Otherwhere it denotes <hi>a firm perswasion of mind, that the thing he is taking in hand is lawful and fit to be done.</hi> In which sense the Apostles rule is to be understood, that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is not of faith is sin.</hi> And this is very far from being a <hi>Faith</hi> that will <hi>justifie</hi> one before God or men. For some out of an <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous conscience</hi> (which sure is no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence) may having a zeal not according to knowledge (as often has been done) think those things <hi>lawful,</hi> which are quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: such as our <hi>Saviour</hi> speaks of, that will kill you, and think they do God good service in so doing. And others when they have not a mind to do things that in their own nature are <hi>lawful,</hi> and the command of a just Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37154:14"/>
makes <hi>necessary</hi> to be done, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend dissatisfaction of <hi>conscience</hi> for a colour of their <hi>disobedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another common <hi>acception,</hi> to mention no more, of <hi>Faith</hi> is to take it for <hi>a strong as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of Gods peculiar love and favour</hi> to them <hi>in pardoning their sins and designing them for salvation.</hi> When perhaps they have no other reason for their so believing, but that they are willing to <hi>believe</hi> so, and have taken pains with themselves to perswade themselves into such a belief, and make themselves <hi>believe</hi> they do <hi>believe</hi>: and this may be, as it too too often proves a dangerous mistake, by putting the name of <hi>Faith</hi> upon a fond over-weening conceit and a rash unreasonable presumption.</p>
            <p>Wherefore that thy <hi>Faith</hi> may not deceive thee, take along with thee these three or four <hi>marks</hi> of <hi>tryal,</hi> to examine it by, whether it be a right well-grounded <hi>Faith</hi> or no.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A true Faith imbraces Christ in all the capacities of his mediatiorial office; as King, Priest, and Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It takes in the whole compass of Gospel-dispensations; commands and threats as well as promises; Sacraments and all other Ordinances alike.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:37154:15"/>3. <hi>It ingages the whole man, the assent of the understanding, the compliance of the will, the regularity of the affections, and the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the outward behaviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It always is accompanied with serious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for sin, and a frank expression and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of charity, according to the sense a man has of the love of God towards himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dost thou find then that by thy <hi>Faith</hi> thou ownest and acceptest thy <hi>Saviour</hi> all over in all his three <hi>Offices</hi>? that thou art as content to submit to him as a <hi>Prophet</hi> to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct thee, as a <hi>King</hi> to rule and govern thee, as thou art glad to have him thy <hi>Priest</hi> to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for thee and to bless thee? Art thou willing to be saved his way, and to conform to his <hi>Methods,</hi> so as to ingage in <hi>working out</hi> thy own salvation, and art thou convinced thou oughtest to do something for thy own sake, something for his, who has done so much for thine? Has thy <hi>Faith</hi> an equal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial respect to Christs <hi>Commands</hi> as to his <hi>Promises</hi>? and dost thou take as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the <hi>obedience</hi> of Faith, as thou dost in its <hi>assurance</hi>? Dost thou consider that though

it be a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> thou standest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet 'tis a <hi>Covenant</hi> and tyes thee up to <hi>conditions</hi>? and that though the Gospel be a <hi>Law of Liberty,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Law</hi> still, and that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>liberty</hi> does not give thee a freedom from duty, but from sin, and is not to be used as a cloak of malice and licentiousness? Hast thou an even regard to all the <hi>means of grace,</hi> and a desire to profit by them all, and not by a wanton preference of one <hi>Ordinance</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forfeit the benefit of all the rest? Canst thou tell where to find thy <hi>Faith,</hi> in what part of thee 'tis seated: does it swim as an empty <hi>Notion</hi> in thy <hi>head</hi> only, or has it by serious <hi>resolutions</hi> sunk down into thy <hi>heart,</hi> and thence flows into all thy outward parts; to the government of thy <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> thy <hi>words</hi> and thy <hi>actions?</hi> Dost thou use to call thy <hi>sins</hi> to account, and thinking on them and thy Saviours <hi>sufferings</hi> togetber, set open the sluces of <hi>grief,</hi> and mourn over thy wounded <hi>conscience</hi> and thy crucified <hi>Jesus?</hi> And lastly, hast thou such a sense of Gods <hi>love</hi> to thee, in the <hi>pardon</hi> of thy sins, that thou canst freely <hi>forgive</hi> all offences done

against thee, and for his sake, who for thine has not spared his Son, cheerfully part with all thou hast and <hi>resign</hi> up all thy concerns into his hands for his uses, when he calls for them; and is thy <hi>Faith</hi> a <hi>Faith working by charity,</hi> that puts forth <hi>vital</hi> acts; and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and justifies it self by <hi>good works</hi> to be a living and a true <hi>Faith</hi>? For though it be <hi>Faith alone</hi> that <hi>justifies,</hi> yet 'tis no true <hi>Faith</hi> that is <hi>alone</hi>; and as a man is not justified <hi>for</hi> his good works, so no man must hope to be justified <hi>without</hi> them.</p>
            <p>If thy <hi>Faith</hi> be such a <hi>Faith,</hi> as will abide this <hi>tryal,</hi> and answer this description, then 'tis a <hi>Faith</hi> thou mayst trust to, and thou hast reason to <hi>believe</hi> thy self to be a <hi>Believer,</hi> and God will improve and build up thy <hi>Faith</hi> to blessed assurances of <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi>

               <hi>humility</hi> was remarkable, for she had that, which S. <hi>Peter</hi> advises grave Matrons to put on, the ornament of a <hi>meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God,</hi> and of good men too, <hi>of great price</hi>: and this she preferred before all the gawdy <hi>Attire,</hi> which others of her <hi>Sex,</hi> especially of her <hi>Fortune,</hi> use to adorn themselves withal.
