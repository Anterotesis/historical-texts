            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE
To the following
NARRATIVE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I DO readily agree with thee, that there
is no ſort of Writings more lyable to
abuſe than this of the <hi>Narrative:</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much at the Mercy of the <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi>
to be Corrupted; and as much in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be miſ-improved by the <hi>Reader:</hi> The
<hi>Reader</hi> therefore I am ſure will demand good
<hi>Security</hi> that he is not impoſed upon in the
enſuing <hi>Relation,</hi> and the <hi>Writer</hi> craves leave
too, to maintain <hi>a modeſt Jealouſie,</hi> leſt the
<hi>Reader</hi> ſhould miſs the benefit that is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him in it: The <hi>Author</hi> will engage,
and pawn his Credit <hi>not to wrong the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
and he would take ſome care alſo that
the <hi>Reader</hi> may <hi>not wrong himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true, that <hi>every Narrator</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a ſtrong Temptation to <hi>Seaſon</hi> his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
to the <hi>Guſto</hi> of the Time, not impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb facs="tcp:110337:6"/>
a ſevere Law upon himſelf, to <hi>Report</hi>
what is true, but accomodating his Story to
the Liquoriſh Appetite of others: I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that <hi>ſome Men</hi> are aſhamed to <hi>Recount
mean and humble Matters;</hi> if they bring us
any thing below <hi>Prodigy and Miracle;</hi> if they
ſtuff not their Farces with <hi>Gorgons, Harpies,
Centaures, and Enchanted Iſlands,</hi> they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleaſe themſelves, nor hope to take their
<hi>Readers</hi> by the <hi>Heart-ſtrings.</hi> Hence it is,
that we have ſo many lean, barren <hi>Stories,</hi>
larded with the Additaments of Fruitful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
as if they had been Penn'd by the
Pattern of <hi>Xenophon's Cyrus. Non ad Hiſtoriae
fidem, ſed ad juſti Imperii Exemplar:</hi> Not
for <hi>Counter-panes of Truth,</hi> but <hi>Counterfeits
of Fancy:</hi> They tell us not what was <hi>really
done,</hi> but what they <hi>would have had done,</hi> if
they might have had the Contrivance of <hi>the
Scene and Tragedy:</hi> They firſt form <hi>Idaea's</hi>
of <hi>Ingenious Romances</hi> in their own Heads,
and then obtrude them upon the World for
<hi>Hiſtorical Verieties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Juſt as our <hi>Hydrographers</hi> in the Delineat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Countries,</hi> with one wanton <hi>Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Frolick</hi> of their <hi>Graver</hi> can raiſe <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
where Nature left us <hi>Vallies;</hi> and ſink
<hi>deep Vallies,</hi> where God has ſtretch'd out a
<hi>Champagn;</hi> can create <hi>Bays, and Creeks,</hi>
where the <hi>Creator</hi> made <hi>firm Land;</hi> and jut
out <hi>Promontories, and Capes,</hi> where there's
<pb facs="tcp:110337:6"/>
nothing in <hi>Nature</hi> to anſwer them; and to
fill up <hi>Vacuities</hi> (out of pure good <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
that not an inch of <hi>Ground</hi> may be loſt)
preſent us with <hi>Flying Fiſhes, Tritons,</hi> and
<hi>Mermaids,</hi> which ſpend their hours <hi>inter Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctinem
&amp; Speculum;</hi> and leſt <hi>Mare del zur</hi>
ſhould ſtill be a Deſolate Wilderneſs, have
courteouſly ſtock'd it with <hi>the Painter's
Wifes Iſland,</hi> and <hi>Terra Incognita;</hi> at this
rate are we dealt with, by this kind of Men,
who love to blow up <hi>lank ſttories</hi> into huge
<hi>Bladders,</hi> and then put ſomething in them to
make them <hi>Rattle</hi> to pleaſe <hi>Children,</hi> and
yet they are <hi>but Bladders ſtill,</hi> though ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the <hi>Tympany,</hi> and <hi>Wind-Cholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are alſo a ſort of <hi>Stories,</hi> which, <hi>by
the way of Courteſie,</hi> we miſ-call <hi>Hiſtories,</hi>
that ſcorn to give us an account of any thing
but <hi>dreadful, and terrible Battels,</hi> and how
one great Man above all the reſt, chopt off
<hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Arms,</hi> and cut off ſome ſheer by
the <hi>Waſte,</hi> and with his <hi>Trenchant-blade</hi> mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down <hi>whole Files of Armed Enemies;</hi> the
Fields all this while running with ſtreams of
Blood, and purple Gore; and all this, with
as much confidence, and exactneſs in every
<hi>Minute Circumſtance,</hi> as if, like the Familiar
<hi>Daemon</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> they had been inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in <hi>the pommel</hi> of the <hi>General's Sword;</hi> or
had hover'd, like <hi>Victory with her doubtful
Wings,</hi> over both the <hi>Armies,</hi> where they
<pb facs="tcp:110337:7"/>
might ſecurely take notes of all that was <hi>ſaid</hi>
or <hi>done,</hi> in <hi>Shelton</hi>'s <hi>Brachygraphy:</hi> but from
what <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Intereſts</hi> theſe <hi>Warriers</hi>
were <hi>Acted;</hi> by what <hi>Rules</hi> they <hi>proceeded,</hi>
with what <hi>Councels</hi> and <hi>Intrigues,</hi> deſigns
were <hi>managed;</hi> and to what <hi>Point</hi> all theſe
<hi>Policies ſteered;</hi> is as much <hi>below their Spirits</hi>
as <hi>above their Abilities,</hi> to inform us.</p>
            <p>To ſecure the <hi>Reader</hi> againſt the fear of
ſuch Entertainment in this <hi>Narrative,</hi> let
him know, that he ſhall meet with nothing
<hi>in Fact</hi> but what is <hi>preciſely true;</hi> what of
<hi>wonderment</hi> he may Encounter, was of <hi>God's
own working,</hi> not of <hi>Man's inventing;</hi> let others
make <hi>Tragedies</hi> to gratifie the <hi>Book-ſeller,</hi> and
cheat the ſimple <hi>Buyer;</hi> we need not <hi>Peter
Lillicrap</hi>'s <hi>Eſſex Serpent,</hi> nor <hi>Livewell Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s
<hi>Greater Monſters,</hi> to <hi>Aggrandize</hi> our
<hi>Title Page;</hi> God's Works need no <hi>foyl</hi> to ſet
them off, the greateſt <hi>Beauty of Truth,</hi> is its
<hi>nakedneſs,</hi> and <hi>Symmetry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a vaſt difference <hi>between</hi> the <hi>moſt
elaborate products</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> and the moſt <hi>homely
pieces of Nature;</hi> for though <hi>the former</hi> will
needs <hi>Ape</hi> the <hi>latter,</hi> yet how pitifully does
<hi>ſhe bungle in the imitation!</hi> Look upon <hi>the
ſubtle Point of the fineſt Needle</hi> through a
<hi>Microſcope,</hi> and you will ſoon be ſatisfied
that <hi>Art is but a Dunce,</hi> for the <hi>Needle</hi> will
appear as <hi>blunt, and dull</hi> as a <hi>Drum-ſtick;</hi> but
come and view one of Gods Handy-works in
<pb facs="tcp:110337:7"/>
the ſame Glaſs, <hi>V. G. The ſting of a Bee,</hi> and
you ſhall ſee it perpetually Acuminated till
it ends in <hi>ſomething,</hi> which the Eye muſt
either confeſs to be a <hi>Point,</hi> or <hi>Nothing;</hi> The
ſame difference we may obſerve between
thoſe <hi>Romances,</hi> which are the <hi>Iſſues</hi> of <hi>fine
Wits,</hi> and the <hi>ſerious, grave Contrivances</hi> of
<hi>Divine Providence;</hi> what <hi>clumz'd things</hi>
are the <hi>Caſſandra's</hi> to one of thoſe <hi>pieces of
proportion,</hi> to be ſeen in <hi>God's Government of
this lower World!</hi> So that it were <hi>unpardonable</hi>
to ſtrive <hi>to Recommend</hi> the wonderful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of God to the <hi>Genius</hi> of this <hi>Age, by
a Lye,</hi> or to <hi>talk deceitfully for him;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
therefore this <hi>Narrative</hi> is, yet it's a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Account of his own workings; and Gold
needs no Gilding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Readers great danger</hi> lies in
running over ſome of <hi>God's Works,</hi> and yet
not ſeeing <hi>God in his Works:</hi> Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
we ſee, do hugely pleaſe themſelves
with the <hi>Gilded Covers,</hi> and <hi>Marbled Leaves</hi>
of Books, but concern not themſelves, <hi>what
is within;</hi> and if they chance to look a little
overly upon <hi>the forms and ſhapes of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
yet underſtand not the <hi>ſublime matter,</hi>
that may be coucht in them: Now, to divide
<hi>the words</hi> from <hi>the meaning,</hi> is morally to
<hi>Annihilate</hi> them, and ſo whilſt they ſee <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
and <hi>Words</hi> only, they ſee juſt <hi>Nothing:</hi>
There are a great many ſuch <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb facs="tcp:110337:8"/>
ſuch <hi>Old Children</hi> in the World, that gaze
upon <hi>the ſurface of Gods Works,</hi> but never
are led <hi>by them</hi> to admire <hi>the Wiſdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Goodneſs, and Holineſs</hi> of God: They
deal with <hi>the Works of Providence,</hi> juſt as
they do with <hi>the Works of Creation:</hi> God
has Ingraven <hi>his own Name</hi> in Legible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
upon <hi>the Heavenly Bodies.</hi> The Stars
in their <hi>ſingle Beauties,</hi> their <hi>Combined Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms,</hi>
their <hi>Mutual Aſpects,</hi> their <hi>Intricate,</hi>
yet <hi>Regular Motions,</hi> ſpeak their <hi>Author;</hi>
nay, upon the loweſt <hi>Recreations,</hi> the <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-ſports</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> there is written, <hi>Deus
fecit.</hi> But now the common obſerver,
whoſe <hi>thoughts</hi> are terminated by his <hi>Eye,</hi>
and his <hi>Eye</hi> with the <hi>viſible Heavens,</hi> as 'tis
beſpangled with glittering things, called
<hi>Planets,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> loſeth quite their main
<hi>deſign,</hi> which is to conduct and argue our
thoughts up to a firſt <hi>Cauſe;</hi> for they were
not ſo much out who cryed up <hi>the Muſick
of the Sphaeres</hi> to be ſo <hi>Raviſhing:</hi> and we
ſhould confeſs it, could we but hear them
Sing this <hi>Antheme, Glory be to God on High.</hi>
Can we be ſo Bruitiſh, as once to imagine,
that the wiſe God, who creates <hi>nothing little,</hi>
nor for a <hi>little end,</hi> ſhould create ſuch <hi>great,
and glorious Bodies</hi> only <hi>to</hi> be <hi>the Objects</hi> of
<hi>Ignorant,</hi> and <hi>Blind Amazement?</hi> Surely
no; <hi>but that</hi> by <hi>the contemplation of them,</hi>
we <hi>might</hi> be led <hi>into the Admiration of Him,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:110337:8"/>
whoſe Being, Wiſdom, Power muſt needs
be <hi>infinitely Glorious,</hi> when his very works
are <hi>excellently ſo:</hi> Here then will be <hi>the
Readers</hi> danger, leſt all his <hi>Spirits</hi> ſhould
evaporate in a confuſed <hi>Admiration, that a
Boat, a little, a Canvas Boat</hi> ſhould, like <hi>the</hi>
Ark, convey ſo many Perſons ſo many
Leagues ſafe a Shoar, whilſt he miſſes <hi>the</hi>
true <hi>intent,</hi> and <hi>meaning of it, to</hi> behold a
<hi>watchful Providence</hi> (as well as <hi>the Being of a
Deity,)</hi> over all Affairs. Now, <hi>that</hi> he
may <hi>not ſplit</hi> upon <hi>this</hi> dangerous <hi>Rock, but</hi>
improve <hi>the Narrative to</hi> his beſt <hi>Advantage,</hi>
I ſhall ſubmiſſively lay before him a few Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p>1. Sect. <hi>Learn from</hi> this Narrative to <hi>truſt,</hi>
and in all thy ways to acknowledge God, <hi>who
by</hi> the moſt contemptible means, <hi>can effect</hi>
the moſt <hi>conſiderable</hi> things. <hi>Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as</hi> they cannot <hi>act beyond</hi> the Sphere
<hi>of their</hi> Activity, <hi>ſo neither can</hi> they <hi>Operate
further</hi> than the ſuitableneſs of <hi>their</hi> Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<hi>will enable</hi> them; it <hi>were ridiculous</hi>
to attempt to cut down a <hi>Forreſt</hi> with a Pen-knife,
<hi>or</hi> Lave the Ocean with a Spoon; but
if the <hi>great God can make</hi> the dulleſt Tool to
cut, <hi>can ſerve himſelf of</hi> the most unfit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,

which, though perhaps they carry
not <hi>ſo much of</hi> Rarity in them, yet may
have in <hi>them, as much of</hi> real power, wiſdom,
and goodneſs. We are <hi>apt to deal with</hi> our
Mercies, <hi>juſt as we do with</hi> our Sins, where
<hi>the commonneſs and frequency of</hi> either, abates
and takes off from <hi>the Obſervation and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi>
which we owe them; we gaze, and
wonder at <hi>Comets,</hi> and their <hi>Flaming Beards,</hi>
but ſeldome admire the <hi>Sun,</hi> a far more
Glorious Body, becauſe he riſes and ſets
every Morning and Evening <hi>upon the juſt
and the unjust;</hi> Doſt thou admire God in
our preſervation, learn to admire him in
thy own: Art thou ſurprized with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>that we were kept a few Days,</hi> when there
<hi>was not half an inch between us and Death?</hi>
Conſider, God has <hi>kept thee many Days,</hi> and
<hi>many Years,,</hi> and <hi>every minute of thoſe many
Days and Years,</hi> when there was <hi>but a hairs
breadth between thee and Death:</hi> Doſt thou
then admire God preſerved us alive in a
<hi>Veſſel of Cloth?</hi> Admire that God that <hi>hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thy Soul in Life,</hi> and that in a more frail
<hi>Veſſel,</hi> a <hi>Veſſel of Clay:</hi> Doſt thou ſtill won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
we were not blown over with every

of thy Life</hi> which thou carrieſt in a Paper-Lanthorn,
is not blown out by every <hi>blast
of Sickneſs:</hi> But if thou wilt ſtill wonder
how <hi>ſuch a Boat</hi> ſhould carry us? Then
wonder alſo how <hi>thy Food nouriſhes thee,</hi> how
<hi>thy Cloaths keep thee warm,</hi> how <hi>thy ſleep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhes
thee:</hi> There's not a <hi>moment</hi> in our

<hi>I will Praiſe thee</hi> (ſaies the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi>

are fearfully and wonderfull preſerved.</hi> If
Preſervation be but a continued Creation,
how ſhould we adore that Power that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us once, but preſerves us alwaies! God
expects that we ſhould equally magnifie his
skill in making us <hi>out of Nothing,</hi> and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
us that we drop not <hi>into Nothing:</hi> and
as much admire his goodneſs, <hi>that we crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>4. <hi>Sect.</hi> Let the <hi>Reader</hi> learn from our
Slavery, to prize, and improve <hi>his own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
If we ſerve not our God ſincerely, and
chearfully <hi>in plenty,</hi> he can ſend us where
we ſhall ſerve our Enemies <hi>in want.</hi> If we
glorifie him not with our Liberty, but turn
it <hi>into licentiouſneſs,</hi> he can <hi>clap us up cloſe,</hi>
where we ſhall learn to prize it higher, and
wiſh we had improved it better. It argues
<pb facs="tcp:110337:12"/>
great <hi>diſinginuity and baſeneſs</hi> in our Spirits,
that we provoke our God to teach us the worth
of Mercies by the want of them: <hi>The Lord
does not willingly afflict, nor grieve the Children
of Men,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. but we provoke him to
take his Rod into his hand, and lay it ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon our backs, <hi>becauſe that Folly which
is bound up in our Hearts will not otherwiſe be
laſht out of us.</hi> Thus God threatned his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Old, <hi>Deut. 28. 48. Becauſe thou ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedſt
not the Lord thy God with joyfulneſs and
gladneſs of Heart, for the abundance of all
things, therefore ſhalt thou ſerve thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
in hunger, thirſt, and nakedneſs, and in
the want of all things.</hi> Thus he taught <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
by <hi>the Captivity of Babylon,</hi> to prize the
freedom of <hi>Canaan;</hi> we might learn our
Duty much cheaper from Gods Word, but
we like <hi>Truants,</hi> will not learn it there, till
God ſends us to <hi>School</hi> with a Rod at our
backs.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Sect.</hi> Let all Learn from hence, <hi>in what
State ſoever the Providence of God ſhall place
them, therewith to be content:</hi> Perhaps thou
art a Servant to a Chriſtian; doſt thou
murmur? It ſhews, thou little knoweſt
what it is to be a Slave to an imperious <hi>Turk.</hi>
Thou ſerveſt him that Prays with thee, and
for thee: doſt thou repine? God might have
made thee ſerve one who would <hi>Curſe and
Torture thee,</hi> and make little Proviſion for
<pb facs="tcp:110337:12"/>
thy <hi>Body,</hi> and none at all for thy <hi>Soul:</hi> The
Chriſtian Religion is ſurely <hi>the moſt excellent</hi>
Religion in <hi>the</hi> World, <hi>becauſe it holds the
ballance ſo even between</hi> Superiours <hi>and</hi> Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours:
It enjoyns <hi>the one</hi> to give the moſt
full <hi>Obedience,</hi> and yet prohibits the other
to exerciſe Rigour. It is peremptory for
<hi>Duty,</hi> and yet abhors <hi>Tyranny:</hi> whoever has
known <hi>Turkiſh Slavery,</hi> is obliged to become
a more <hi>Loyal Subject,</hi> a more <hi>Dutiful Child,</hi>
a more <hi>Faithful Servant;</hi> and whoever has
not known it, is yet obliged to become all
theſe, leſt God make him know it, and
whip out of him that Reſtiff Spirit of grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and Diſobedience with the Briars, and
Thorns of the Wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>God commanded all Maſters among the
<hi>Jews,</hi> to allow their Servants a Day of Reſt,
<hi>Deut. 5. 14.</hi> and he gives this Reaſon for it,
<hi>Remember that thou waſt a Servant in the
Land of Egypt.</hi> The Equity of which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
holds ſtronger for the Chriſtian: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thou waſt a Servant to the worſt of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
a Drudge in the baſeſt of works, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to receive the worſt of Wages:</hi> Has Chriſt
ſet thee free? And art thou become a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the beſt of Maſters? Employed in
the moſt reaſonable, and honourable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices?
<hi>And in expectation of the moſt</hi> glorious
Rewards? Let it teach thee <hi>if thou beeſt a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
to command gently; and if a Servant, to
obey chearfully.</hi>

6. <hi>Sect.</hi> Let all Learn <hi>to walk worthy of the
Goſpel.</hi> It is that which ſweetens all our
mercies, and mitigates the bitterneſs of all
Afflictions; and if we ſin away that, we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſin away all the reſt, or whatever is
uſeful, and deſireable in all the reſt. If we
enjoy the Light, and yet walk in darkneſs,
it's righteous with God, to over-ſpread our
<hi>Habitations with Egyptian,</hi> or <hi>Babyloniſh, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh,</hi>
or <hi>Popiſh</hi> darkneſs. God can carry us
<hi>to Rome,</hi> or <hi>Algiers;</hi> or elſe ſend <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<hi>Algiers</hi> home to us: For what ſhould a
a People do with Light, that only intend
to play, or fight by it? The once Famous

defiled with the Abominations of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Impoſtor that ever ſeduced the <hi>Nations,</hi>
but <hi>One.</hi> And thinkeſt thou, O Man, O
Chriſtian, <hi>that do'ſt theſe things,</hi> ſo Alien
from the Goſpel of Chriſt; that art drunk
in the day, and curſeſt that God whom thou
Worſhippeſt, <hi>that thou ſhalt eſcape the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God?</hi> I tell thee, nay; and I tell all
thoſe that read theſe lines, and are guilty;
and I tell my ſelf, <hi>ſo far as I am guilty, that
except we repent, we ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi>

The <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the

2. 5. Remember therefore from whence thou art
fallen, and Repent, and do thy firſt work, or elſe
I will come unto thee quickly, and remove thy Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick

in it, than in all our Slavery; and yet
they were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not <hi>Algerines; Proteſtants,</hi>
not <hi>Papists; Engliſh-men,</hi> not <hi>Strangers,</hi> that
were the cauſe of it: But I have put a force
upon my ſelf, and am reſolved not to publiſh
it. In our Return homewards, we met with
ſome <hi>who would talk to the grief of thoſe whom
God had wounded, and was now in a way to heal
again.</hi> Some would interpretatively ſay, with
the Churliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 10. Who are
theſe? And whence come they? <hi>There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Servants now adays that break away, every one
from his Maſter.</hi> But then was the ſeaſon when
we had moſt Experience of Gods faithfulneſs:
And I ſhall never ceaſe to own before the World
the great Reſpect we found from ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Merchants, to whom we were perfect Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and the Civilities of Captain <hi>Goodſon,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:110337:16"/>
Captain <hi>Smith,</hi> his <hi>Mate,</hi> and his <hi>Son,</hi> are not
to be forgotten.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perhaps, after all this, the</hi> Reader <hi>will be</hi>
earnest to be ſatisfied, <hi>why this</hi> Narrative <hi>has</hi>
lain ſo long Dormant, and appeared no ſooner in
the World? <hi>And I ſhall herein alſo endeavour</hi>
to give him all Reaſonable ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>When we return'd into</hi> England, <hi>we
found our Native Country</hi> embroyled in a Civil
War, <hi>and moſt Men had enough to do,</hi> to bear
their own perſonal Calamities, <hi>and had little
need to be troubled with</hi> the miſeries of others;
they were other kind of Declarations that flew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
then, and that was enough to ſuper-ſede a
Narrative of this Nature, for ſome Years.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>great Mercies of God</hi> have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<hi>their due weight</hi> upon our Hearts <hi>at first;</hi>
and I have received <hi>ſignal Deliverances</hi> from
eminent dangers <hi>ſince that great one;</hi> and it's
well if all the mercies of our Lives, all our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
put together, will <hi>amount to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
ſtrong enough to overcome our backwardneſs
to make publick acknowledgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. I thought a long while that <hi>it was not worth
the while,</hi> to trouble the World <hi>with my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Concerns,</hi> till the <hi>Importunity of ſeveral Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and others,</hi> both in City and Country,
overcame my reluctancy, in whoſe Reaſons I
did acquieſce.</p>
            <p>4. I was conſcious to my ſelf <hi>of great unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
to recommend <hi>it to publick view,</hi> in ſuch a
<pb facs="tcp:110337:16"/>
garb as might <hi>vindicate it from Contempt;</hi> for
though it has been drawn out many years <hi>with
my own hand,</hi> and many have had the <hi>peruſal
of it, have approved it, and deſired it;</hi> yet till I
could prevail with a Friend to teach it <hi>to ſpeak a
little better Engliſh,</hi> I could not be perſwaded
<hi>to let it walk abroad; The Stuff and Matter is
my own, the Trimming and Form is anothers,</hi> for
whom I muſt vouch, that he has done the
<hi>Truth, my ſelf, and the Reader Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having overcome all theſe difficulties, <hi>I do
here Erect my Ebenezer, as a ſmall Monument of
great Mercy,</hi> and as an <hi>Obligation</hi> upon my <hi>Soul</hi>
to great Duty, and do pray that it may ſtand as
an <hi>Abiding Witneſs</hi> for God in my <hi>Conſcience;</hi>
that when-ever I am tempted to Sin, I may
have an Anſwer ready to ſtop the Mouth of the
<hi>Tempter</hi> with <hi>Indignation; How can I do this
great Evil, and Sin againſt my good God?</hi> When
I am tempted to diſtruſt, I may encourage my
<hi>Faith</hi> from my own <hi>Narrative,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that God who delivered thee at Sea;</hi> when I
am tempted to murmur, I may ſuppreſs thoſe
mutinous thoughts from my own <hi>Narrative,</hi>
ſaying, <hi>Remember what thou endureſt in Algiers.</hi>
When my Heart grows cold, and unthankful,
I may chide, and ſhame it, from my own
<hi>Narrative,</hi> into gratitude to God; <hi>That God,
who remembred us in our low Eſtate, for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
endureth for ever!</hi> who preſerved us <hi>at the
Sea,</hi> the <hi>Great Sea; for his Mercy endureth for
<pb facs="tcp:110337:17"/>
ever!</hi> and ſecured us in a <hi>Boat,</hi> a <hi>Contemptible
Boat, for his Mercy endureth for ever!</hi> who gave
us favour in the Eyes of <hi>Strangers, for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
endureth for ever!</hi> and opened to us the Hearts
of <hi>Enemies; for his Mercy endureth for ever!</hi>
and taught us to look up to his never failing
Mercy, when Friends failed, <hi>for his Mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
for ever!</hi> who turned us ſafe to <hi>England,</hi>
for <hi>his mercy endureth for ever!</hi> we called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him <hi>in the day of Trouble, he delivered us, and
we will glorifie him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> this <hi>Narrative</hi> is true, peruſe it ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and let not Vanity tempt thee to ſay,
<hi>Things might have been better contrived, wiſelier
managed;</hi> it was God that did what was <hi>Good</hi>
in <hi>All;</hi> call not his Wiſdom in Queſtion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he did not create more wonders to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
thy itching Humour; perhaps thou wouldſt
have had us been brought over upon a <hi>Floating
Iſland,</hi> or in a <hi>Whales Belly,</hi> but I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that the great God is bound to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
to ſave Mens longings: God has done
his work well, and none can mend it; for,
<hi>what can the Man do that comes after the King?</hi>
Eccl. 2. 12. <hi>For the matter of Fact</hi> Recorded
herein, <hi>I might ſafely call God to Record upon my
Soul that I lye not:</hi> The thing is known to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and has been ſifted, and ſcann'd by ſuch
Eyes and Ears as are not guilty of eaſie Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
I have Evidence that may ſtorm the moſt
obſtinate unbelief: Mr. <hi>Thomas Saunders,</hi> my
<pb facs="tcp:110337:17"/>
Wife's Brother, being in <hi>Mayork</hi> not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we came from thence, ſaw our <hi>Boat</hi> hang
up <hi>for a Monument</hi> upon the ſide of <hi>the great
Churh there.</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Hales,</hi> who was there
1671. aſſures me he ſaw the naked Ribs and
Skeleton of it then hanging in the ſame place.
Now, I aſſure thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> I ſhould be much
aſhamed of my ſelf, if Strangers unconcerned
in my <hi>Perſonal Deliverances,</hi> ſhould be <hi>ſo far
concerned</hi> as to preſerve a <hi>Memorial</hi> of them,
and yet unthankful I ſhould Erect no <hi>Standard</hi>
or <hi>Piller</hi> as an Evidence of Gods wonderful
appearing for me.</p>
            <p>It's true, I am informed by <hi>one, that ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,</hi>
there are more <hi>Boats hanging up in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>york,
in Memory of ſome ſuch like eſcape:</hi> Now,
if others have really eſcaped the ſame danger,
by the ſame means, it greatly confirms our
<hi>Narrative;</hi> and I do heartily rejoyce, <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has appeared in the ſame Method for others,
as for our ſelves:</hi> we never intend to <hi>Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize</hi>
Gods Providences to <hi>our ſole uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof;</hi>
and we rejoyce if our attempt and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
may have encouraged others to make <hi>the
like attempt,</hi> and have found the like ſucceſs;
but I do aſſert it with great confidence, that
when we were in <hi>Mayork,</hi> there was no ſuch
<hi>Boat hanging up,</hi> but the Inhabitants there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
our Deliverance as ſuch whereof they
had no parallel: But if on the other ſide, theſe,
or ſome of theſe ſucceeding <hi>Boats</hi> were but <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:110337:18"/>
then the goodneſs of God appears <hi>more
remarkable</hi> towards us, that we really were the
Subjects of ſuch wonder <hi>which others</hi> durſt <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretend to;</hi> and it ſets a luſtre upon this <hi>great
Salvation,</hi> which others have thought <hi>ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,</hi>
that they judged it worth the while to
<hi>tell a Lye</hi> to entitle themſelves <hi>to the Credit of
it;</hi> for <hi>it's Gold and Silver, not Copper, or baſer
Metals,</hi> that they who drive the Coyning
Trade, ſtrive to Counterfeit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let then every one that reads, underſtand,</hi> and
ſeriouſly ſit down, and conſider with himſelf,
whether he has not had <hi>many eminent Perſonal
Deliverances</hi> in one kind or other, which this
Marvellous Providence of God towards us may
not refreſh his Memory withal; and if he ſhall
hence be taught to bluſh at his forgetfulneſs of
lapſed Mercies; if this <hi>Narrative</hi> ſhall recover
any loſt Providencies, and fix them on, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet
into his Soul; if he ſhall find himſelf
awakened to do thankfulneſs to God for all his
benefits towards him; let him joyn with me in
aſcribing <hi>all the Power,</hi> and therefore <hi>all the
Glory,</hi> to the Almighty, and let him kindly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the aſſiſtance of him, who ſhall reckon it
amongſt his other Mercies, to have been Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to any one in reviving a better frame
of Heart. Iam,</p>

               </p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>June,</hi> in the Year of Our
Lord, One Thouſand, Six Hundred, Thirty,
and Nine, in purſuance of a Commiſſion from
the Right Honourable, the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> we took Ship
at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> in the <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> carrying
Six Guns, Mr. <hi>Boarder</hi> being Maſter, and <hi>James
Walker</hi> the Maſters Mate; the Ship was chiefly
Laden with Linnen and Woollen Cloath, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in her, Seamen and Paſſengers, above
Sixty, bound for the <hi>Iſle of Providence</hi> in the
<hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> Five Weeks we lay in the <hi>Downs,</hi>
wiſhing, and waiting for a Wind, and then we
ſet Sail, and came to Anchor near the <hi>Iſle of
Wight;</hi> but by this time all our Beer in the Ship
ſtunk, and we were forced to throw it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
and to take in Vinegar to mix with
Water for our Voyage. The next Lord's
Day we ſet Sail again, and coming between
the Iſland, and the Main Land, we ſtuck faſt
in the Sands, but the Tide coming in, hove us
off. Theſe Circumſtances ſeem very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110337:19"/>
to thoſe that were not concerned in the
Products of them; but God has given us the
advantage and leiſure to ſee what <hi>great things</hi>
were in the Womb of <hi>theſe little things.</hi> Had
the Wind ſtood longer againſt us, it had been
more for us, and the danger had been paſt;
had it ſtood leſs while againſt us, it had been
for us too, and we had been gone paſt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
But God appoints it the Moment when it
ſhould come about to blow us into the Mouths
of our Enemies: We ſee the Truth of that,
<hi>Ye know what to pray for:</hi> We prayed for a
<hi>Wind,</hi> and we had a <hi>Whirl-wind:</hi> If we alwaies
knew what miſchief the Anſwer of our Prayers
would do us, we ſhould be glad to eat our
words, and Pray againſt our Prayers. Denyal
is often the beſt Anſwer, and we had need leave
all Petitions to the wiſdom of God to be Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
according to his good pleaſure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
as they may be good for us, and make
moſt for his own Glory: we were alſo taught,
that the Sea may ſometimes be our beſt
Friend, and the Earth our worſt Enemy; and
that <hi>nothing can do us good or hurt, but by the
Direction and Commiſſion of the Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were now three Ships in Company, and
one of the other I remember, carried Nine
Guns, Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> Maſter. The Sixth Day
after our ſetting Sail from the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> by
break of Day in the Morning, we diſcovered
three Ships about three or four Leagues to <hi>Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:110337:20"/>
The Maſters of our Ships preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted,
what was moſt adviſeable; whether to
ſtay and ſpeak with them, or to make the beſt
of our way; <hi>at laſt</hi> (upon what Reaſons I know
not) it <hi>was determined that we ſhould ſtay;</hi> It was
not long <hi>before we diſcovered thoſe other three
Ships to be Turks Men of War,</hi> who eſpying their
Prey, endeavoured to come up with us, which
<hi>about Night they affected:</hi> Whilſt they were
coming up, the Maſters of our Ships <hi>ſeemed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to Fight them,</hi> and accordingly made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to receive them, but in the Night, the
Maſter and Company of the Ship wherein I
was, <hi>altered their Counſels, let their Reſolutions
Dye,</hi> and agreed to run for it; <hi>uncertain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
never produce better ſucceſs;</hi> when we <hi>might</hi>
have gone, then we would ſtay; and when
there was no way to eſcape, then we muſts <hi>needs</hi>
attempt it: Had we either at firſt <hi>Reſolved not to
Fight them,</hi> or reſolved to Fight, <hi>had proſecuted
our Reſolutions lie Men of Courage,</hi> we might,
perhaps, <hi>either have avoided the danger, or brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Maſter'd it.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving us begin
to run, <hi>ſent one of their number to Chaſe us,</hi>
whilſt their other two attended the remaining
two of our Company till the Morning. At
break of Day <hi>they began to Fight us,</hi> and after a
ſhort Diſpute Boarded us, <hi>and took us all three:</hi>
In the <hi>Mary,</hi> ſix were ſlain, and many wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>ſo ſmall was the difference between Flight and

               <p>Many Weeks <hi>they kept us</hi> cloſe Priſoners at

to be Butcher'd,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Market to
be Sold.</hi> Their Cruelty is great, but their
<hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> exceeds their <hi>Cruelty;</hi> could they
make as much of us Dead, as they make alive,
that ſo both the Intereſts of <hi>Cruelty,</hi> and of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,</hi>
might be ſecured, and reconciled,
we were well aſſured which way it ſhould have
gone with us. But it muſt be a great deal of
<hi>Tallow</hi> and <hi>Fat,</hi> that will anſwer two or three
<hi>Dollers</hi> a <hi>Month.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their manner of ſelling <hi>Slaves,</hi> is this. They
lead them up and down the <hi>Fair,</hi> or <hi>Market;</hi>
and when a Chapman bids any Money, they
preſently cry, <hi>a-Rache! a-Rache!</hi> that is,
<hi>Here's ſo much Money bidden, who bids more?</hi>
They that cheapen the expoſed <hi>Slaves</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>circumſpect perſons, they carry their Eyes in
their Heads, as well as their Money in their Purſes,</hi>
and uſe the one in laying out the other; for
they <hi>are loath to buy a Pig in a Poke;</hi> their firſt
Policy is to <hi>look in their Mouths;</hi> and a good,
ſtrong, entire ſet of <hi>Grinders</hi> will advance the
Price conſiderably, and they have good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for this Practice: for firſt, <hi>they are Rational
Creatures,</hi> and know, <hi>that they who have not
Teeth, cannot eat, cannot work;</hi> and they <hi>that
cannot work, are not for their turn; and they
that are not for their turn, are not for their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110337:23"/>
Money.</hi> And Secondly, they intend to keep
them at hard meat all the Year, and it muſt
not be <hi>Gums,</hi> but ſolid <hi>Teeth</hi> (nay, if it were
<hi>poſſible, caſe-hardn'd Teeth)</hi> that <hi>muſt chew it;</hi>
and when all is done, they had need of the
<hi>Oſtriches Stomach to digeſt it.</hi> Their next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<hi>is to feel their Limbs;</hi> as whether there be
any <hi>Fracture,</hi> or <hi>Diſlocation</hi> in the <hi>Bones;</hi> any
thing <hi>Analogical</hi> to <hi>Spavin,</hi> or <hi>Ring-bone,</hi> for
theſe will bring down the <hi>Makret</hi> wonderfully;
And to be <hi>clean Limb'd, cloſe coupled, well
joynted, will advance it as much. The Age is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſiderable;</hi> but they that <hi>ſell them,</hi> did not
<hi>breed them,</hi> and therefore they know nothing,
more or leſs of that: Two waies they have to
find out the Age; the one is, to ſtand to the
courteſie of the <hi>Slaves,</hi> but they are not bound
to make any ſuch Diſcovery, and therefore
they go by general conjectures from the <hi>Beard,
Face,</hi> or <hi>Hair;</hi> but a good ſet of <hi>Teeth</hi> will
make any one <hi>Ten Years Younger,</hi> and a broken
one <hi>Ten Years Older than the Truth;</hi> for if they
were <hi>Five Hundred Years Old all is a Caſe,</hi> if they
could but eat and work; or if they could not
eat, yet if they could but work, or if they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
eat nor work, if their Skins would but fetch
in the Mony again. You ſhall have the <hi>Seller</hi>
commend his Goods to the Sky, and the <hi>Buyer</hi>
on the other hand, as much undervalue them,
and the true <hi>Market-price</hi> commonly lies juſt
<hi>between them; but ſo it is all the World over.</hi> Or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110337:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaies the <hi>Seller,</hi> mark what a <hi>Back he has,</hi> what a
breadth he bears between the <hi>Shoulders!</hi> What
<hi>a Cheſt!</hi> How <hi>ſtrong ſet!</hi> How <hi>fitted on the nonce
for Burdens! He'l do but e'ne to much work.</hi>
Piſh, ſaies the <hi>Buyer,</hi> He looks like a <hi>Pillard,</hi>
like a very <hi>Meacock</hi> at his <hi>Provinder,</hi> and one
that ſeems to be ſurfeited. But they are very
curious in examining the Hands; for if they
be callous and brawny, they will ſhrewdly
gueſs they have been inured to Labour; if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
and tender, they will ſuſpect ſome <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi>
or <hi>Merchant,</hi> and then the hopes of a
<hi>good Price of Redemption</hi> makes him Saleable.</p>
               <p>When any are ſold, they muſt be trotted
once more to the <hi>Vice-Roys,</hi> that he may have
the review of them, and if he likes any of them
at the prizes they went off at, there's no more
Diſpute, <hi>they are his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for my ſelf, I was ſold the firſt <hi>Marget-day</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt Adventure I met with after I was
brought to my <hi>Patron</hi>'s Houſe (for ſo I muſt
now ſtile him) had well nigh coſt me my Life.
My <hi>Patron</hi>'s Father being deſirous to ſee his
Sons <hi>Penny-worth,</hi> commanded me up into a
<hi>Gallery,</hi> which looked into the Court; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to inſult over me with inſupportable ſcorn,
reflecting upon me becauſe I was a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
and caſt out ſome Expreſſions which did really
reflect upon the Perſon of my <hi>Rdeemer,</hi> though
I have heard worſe ſince.) My Neck was not
yet bowed, nor my Heart broken to the Yoke
of Bondage; I could not well brook, becauſe
I had not ben uſed then to ſuch Language; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:110337:24"/>
becauſe I could not expreſs my ſelf in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſco,</hi>
or <hi>Lingua Franc,</hi> I ſupplyed it with Signs;
and <hi>imitating the Coblers Yarke,</hi> I ſignified both
waies as well as I could, <hi>That their Prophet was
but a Cobler.</hi> I confeſs, my meaning was no
more, but that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by the help of <hi>Sergius,</hi>
a <hi>Neſtorian Monk,</hi> and <hi>Abdalla</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> had
patch'd up a Cento of <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Monkiſh Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries,</hi>
which was now their <hi>Religion.</hi> But he,
without the preamble of many Railing words,
fell upon me with ſevere blows; whatever <hi>Rage</hi>
and <hi>Fury</hi> his <hi>Hands</hi> or <hi>Feet</hi> could <hi>Execute,</hi> that
I felt; and my intreaties did but enrage his
<hi>Choler,</hi> ſo that I ſaw I might ſooner blow out
the Fire with a pair of Bellows, than lenifie his
paſſion with Prayers; I had no other way but
this, to make an offer of leaping down out of
the <hi>Gallery</hi> into the <hi>Court,</hi> and therefore clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
my hands upon the <hi>Rails,</hi> as if I would
throw my ſelf head-long down over them, and
rather chuſe to receive my Death from the
<hi>Pavement,</hi> than his <hi>Hands,</hi> he preſently aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
if not his <hi>Rage,</hi> yet the <hi>Execution</hi> of it.
The Old Gentleman knew very well, that if I
loſt my Life, his Son muſt loſe his preſent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and future profit; <hi>for there's little made
out of a Dead Man's Skin:</hi> and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpites
my further puniſhment till my <hi>Patron</hi>'s
Return, and then indeed this reputed Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of mine with full cry was carried to his
Ears, <hi>and it loſt nothing in the telling,</hi> but was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110337:25"/>
aggravated to purpoſe: My <hi>Patron</hi> being Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
a very paſſionate Man, ſaid nothing,
but without Examination, drew out his long
Knife, (which they conſtantly wear by their
ſides) and made at me; and had there doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
put an end to my Life and Captivity at
once, had not his Wife, who was there ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
preſent, taken him in her Arms, and
ſweeten'd him into more moderate Counſels.
Some will be ready enough to ſay, that I was
but a <hi>Martyr to my own Folly:</hi> This was not
a place for Diſpute, but Obedience. Well, I
learnt from hence two Leſſons: One, <hi>That
when the Body is a Slave, the Reaſon muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be free; and where the whole outward Man
is in Bondage, the Tongue muſt not plead Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi>
A Second, That it's fair for Slaves to
enjoy <hi>the freedom of their own Conſciences, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reviling anothers Religion,</hi> though errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<hi>and this Wit I bought,</hi> as it fell out, <hi>a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
good Penny-worth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Storm was over, my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was aſſigned me (for they had rather ſee
a Slave Dead than Idle) and for about half a
Year it lay in trudging on Errands, bearing
Burdens, and diſcharging other Domeſtick
Services at Command, wherein the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
was, <hi>That it was Commanded,</hi> and not
<hi>What was Commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time my <hi>Patron</hi> had a part in a <hi>Man
of War,</hi> which carried Twelve Guns: She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110337:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at Sea, (with ſome others of the ſame place)
met with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, <hi>Laden with
Plate,</hi> and other Rich Commodities from <hi>Spain,</hi>
and Bound for <hi>London,</hi> (one <hi>Iſaac</hi> being <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter)</hi>
and after a very ſharp, though ſhort Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
the <hi>Algerines</hi> carried her, and brought
her ſafe home. The Adventurers divide their
Booty, and being high flown with this ſucceſs,
they Reſolve to fit her out again to carry more
Guns; and from hence grew my new employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Upon the <hi>Capenters</hi> I attended, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the <hi>Smiths,</hi> to get the Iron-work fitted,
and finiſhed; and truly he allowed me more
for Portage than to the ordinary <hi>Hammels,</hi> or
common <hi>Porters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this Ship was now fitted for another
Adventure, my <hi>Patron</hi> tells me, <hi>I muſt go in
her;</hi> it was a nipping word: I pleaded, that I
was no <hi>Sea-man,</hi> underſtood nothing of the
<hi>Mariners</hi> Art, and therefore as he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
little Service from me in that kind, ſo I
muſt expect moſt rigorous treatment, becauſe
I could not acquit my ſelf in the Service as well
as others; he removed my Pleas, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
I ſhould not be wronged; but there was
more at the bottom than all this: For here
a Caſe of Conſcience offered it ſelf, <hi>Whether I
might without Sin in any Caſe fight againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
on the Port of the common Enemy of all
Chriſtianity?</hi> The beſt Reſolution I could give
my ſelf, was this; That firſt, my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:110337:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
employment would only lie in managing
the Tackle, which will kill no Body; but it
was replied, <hi>That without the due management
of the Tackle, all the Guns in the Ship would
kill no Body:</hi> Secondly, therefore I anſwered,
That it was not evident that they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
againſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> more than all the reſt
of Mankind, for all the World are their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who are Rich enough to invite them,
and too weak to reſiſt them; but my <hi>Patron</hi>
had a Solution worth all theſe: He told me
peremptorily, <hi>I muſt, and ſhould go;</hi> I found
my ſelf under force, I was a Preſt Man: who
could not examine the Juſtice of the Cauſe. In
a word, his Commands were back'd with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion,
and whatever his Authority was, he
had more Power, than I had Courage to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or Strength to reſiſt; and go I did. Yet
this I will ſay for him, he ſpoke to the Captain
and Officers of the Ship, to treat me civilly,
that is, leſs cruelly than other Slaves were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
He gave me ſome Money alſo in my
Pocket, bought me Clothes, and laid me in
Proviſion above the Ships allowance.</p>
               <p>Nine Weeks we were at Sea, within, and
without the <hi>Streights,</hi> Cruiſing, and Picka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooning
up and down, at laſt we met with
one poor <hi>Hungarian French Man of War,</hi>
whom we took, and ſo returned.</p>
               <p>My <hi>Patron</hi> having been at great charges in
fitting, and manning out this Ship, and the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:110337:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Repriſals ſo ſlenderly anſwering his great coſt,
and greater hopes, told me, I muſt allow him
two <hi>Dollers per Month,</hi> and Live aſhore where
I would, and get it were I could. This was a
hard Chapter, That he that could not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
himſelf, ſhould be compelled to contribute
to the maintenance of another; it was difficult
to raiſe encreaſe out of no ſtock, and to pay
Intereſt out of no Principal; but there was no
contending; It coſt me much debate with my
ſelf, and I turn'd my thoughts into all forms
and ſhapes, but all Projects that preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were incumbred with ſo many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that they amounted very near to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.
The more I conſulted, the further I
found my ſelf from a concluſion, and I could
ſee no way but one, (but that was worth a
Thouſand, could I have made the beſt of it,)
and that was to commit my ſelf to God, who
had brought me into this ſtrait, beſeeching
him that he would bring me out of it.</p>
               <p>But that my truſting to God might not be
a Cloak for Lazineſs, or a Pillow for Sloath to
reſt upon, I addreſt my ſelf to an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi>
whoſe condition was that of a Slave, whoſe
Calling was that of a <hi>Taylor.</hi> He at firſt word
counſelled me to come and ſtay with him, and
he would teach me to work of his Trade. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
nothing baſe that was honeſt, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
would ennoble a far meaner Emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and very readily cloſed in my thoughts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110337:27"/>
with his motion, and was ſuddenly elevated
into huge hopes that I ſhould now be in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to anſwer my <hi>Patron</hi>'s demands, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
his laſh. But my ſtraits were not (it ſeems)
great enough to glorifie God; nor my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
mean enough to magnifie his Power in
raiſing me; I was not reduced to that Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mety
which would make an oportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
his appearing Mercy; for when I came to
him the next <hi>Day,</hi> I perceived by his ſilence
that his mind was changed, and I was loth,
either out of Modeſty or Pride, to give him
further trouble; and therefore interpreting his
ſilence to be a more civil way of denial, I left
him, and once more Launched out into the
wide World.</p>
               <p>In this forlorn poſture I wandred, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knew, nor much cared whither, though
the wiſe God both knew, and cared; and his
Providence directed me to another <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi>
who was ſitting in a little Shop: He ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me what News? And (as that which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt
alwaies comes out firſt) I preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the Story of my deſperate Condition;
how the Rigid Law of my <hi>Patron</hi> had impoſed
two <hi>Dollers per Month</hi> upon me, and I knew
not where to levy the leaſt Mite of it: He
heard, conſidered, pityed my Condition, and
invited me to come and ſit in the Shop with
him; but ſeeing nothing but the bare Walls,
I asked him, to what end? What Trade ſhould
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110337:27"/>
we drive there? There's not much difference
between ſtarving in the Streets, and in the Shop.
Country-man (ſaid he) I drive here an unknown
Trade; here I ſell Lead, Iron, Shot, Strong-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Tobacco, and many other things. This
motion was a great deal to good to be refueſd,
and I think at that time no tolerable condition
would have ſtck with me.</p>
               <p>I acquainted my <hi>Patron</hi> with my Deſign,
pleaded I wanted ſtock to ſet up with; he lent
me a <hi>ſmall modicum,</hi> and with another pittance
that I had privately reſerved of my own, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Trade. That very Night I went and
bought a parcel of Tobacco, the next Morning
we dreſs'd it, cut it, and fitted it for Sale; and
the World ſeemed to ſmile on us wonderfully.
In this way of Partner-ſhip we continued for
ſome while, and what we got clear, we divided
every week according to the proportion of our
reſpective ſtocks. In a while, finding the
World to come in upon us, we ventured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no leſs then a whole Butt of Wine, ſome
Money we had, and ſome Credit: This Wine
we drew out, and got conſiderably by it. But
it's very difficult to maintain moderation in an
exalted State, for even our State was capable
of better and worſe; for my Partner being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
with our good ſucceſs, grew a good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and a bad Husband; neglecting his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
went tipling, and fndling up and down,
and the Concerns of the Shop and Trade lay
wholly upon my Shoulders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:110337:28"/>
It fell out, that one <hi>John Randal,</hi> who with
his Wife and Child were taken in the ſame
Ship with my ſelf, being put to the ſame ſhifts
with my ſelf, and, as 'tis very common, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Monthly Tax impoſed upon him by
his Patron, which he muſt ſcrape out where
he could, and beſides maintain himſelf, his
Wife, and Child, went up and down ſeeking
for Relief, at laſt the poor Man ſtraggled to
our Shop: His Caſe made great impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, I could not but conſider the goodneſs
of God to me, that ſhould now be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to adviſe, and help another, who ſo lately
wanted both my ſelf; and it had this operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon me, that I would not ſuffer a poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
Country-man, a Fellow-Captive, a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Chriſtian
to ſtand begging at that door,
where I had ſo lately ſtood my ſelf: Shall I
ſhut the Door, or my Heart upon him, when
God hath opened a Door of hope to me in the
day of my Trouble? Shall I ſo ill requite the
Lord's kindneſs to me? Surely that God who
<hi>comforts us in our Tribulations,</hi> expects that we
ſhould comfort others in theirs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. I
bad him therefore come in, and knowing him
to be a <hi>Glover</hi> by Trade, adviſed him to learn
to make Canvas Cloaths for Sea-men that are
Slaves; and for my own part, he ſhould ſit
<hi>Rent-free;</hi> but if my Partner would inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Moiety, he muſt be willing to ſatisfie
him, for I had no power to determine of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Right.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:110337:28"/>
It were tedious to trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> how I
wore out three or four irkſome Years in this
way of Trading. All this while there was no
dawning of deliverance from our Bondage:
As one Year left us, another found us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
us over Captives to the next: Our
condition was bad, and in danger every day
of being worſe, as the mutable Humours of
our Patrons determin'd upon us, for our Shop
and Trade was no free-hold: The Truth is,
in time we were ſo habituated to Bondage, that
we almoſt forgot Liberty, and grew ſtupid, and
ſenſleſs of our Slavery; like <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> we <hi>couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down between our burdens, we bowed our Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to bear, and became Servants to Tribute,</hi>
Gen. 49. 14, 15. And were in danger to be
like thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> who being once
ſettled, forgot <hi>Canaan, and dwelt with the King
for his work,</hi> 1 Chron. 4. 23. We ſeem'd as if
our Ears had been bored, and we had vowed
to ſerve our Patrons for ever. Long Bondage
breaks the Spirits, it ſcatters hope off, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
all attempts for freedom: And there
were more evils attended our condition than
the bodily torture, which we were alwaies li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to, and ſometimes endured.</p>
               <p>1. We were under a perpetual temptation
to deny the Lord that bought us, to make our
Souls Slaves, that our Bodies might recover
Liberty. As <hi>Satan</hi> once tempted <hi>Job</hi> to <hi>Curſe
God, and Dye;</hi> ſo he knew how to change his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110337:29"/>
Note to us, and accommodate his Snare to our
condition, to <hi>Curſe God, that we might Live.</hi>
How many have made Ship-wrack of Faith,
that they might not be Chained to the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liees?</hi>
I can never enough admire the grace of
that Promiſe, <hi>Pſal. 1253. The Rod of the wicked
ſhal not always roſt upon the lot of the Righteous, leſt
the Righteous put forth their hands to Iniquity;</hi> nor
ever enough adore the faithfulneſs of him,
<hi>who will not ſuffer us to be tempted above that we
are able,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13.</p>
               <p>And 2. Evil is the unmaning, and diſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Soul to worthy Actions; for we are
apt to put on the Temper and Spirit of Slaves
with the Habit, and the Chriſtians of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Communion, are a very ſad inſtance of this
Truth.</p>
               <p>And 3. We were very much at a loſs for
the Preaching of the World: And yet herein

us an Able Miniſter to Preach the

               <p>THE gracious God looking upon the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of his poor Servants, and <hi>Remembring
us in our low Eſtate,</hi> was pleaſed many waies to
mitigate the load of our Captivity: We have
Reaſon to ſay, with the Church, <hi>Ezra 9. 9. We
were Bondſmen, yet our God hath not forſaken us
in our Bondage, but hath extended Mercy to us,
to give us a reviving, and a Nail in his Holy
place:</hi> And thus he brought about his Deſign
of Grace and Mercy. There was an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ship taken by ſome of our <hi>Algerine</hi> Pirates, and
in her one Mr. <hi>Devereux Sprat,</hi> a Miniſter of
the Goſpel. It deſerves our conſideration, and
greateſt Admiration, that the wiſe God ſhould

others of his dear Servants: But thus Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſent <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he endured
thirteen Years Slavery, that he might <hi>preſerve
the Lives</hi> of his Fathers Family, within thoſe
narrow walls the moſt viſible Church of God
in thoſe daies was encloſed, <hi>Gen. 45. 5.</hi> Now,
ſome of us obſerving this Mr. <hi>Sprat</hi> to be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110337:30"/>
of very Sober, Grave, and Religious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,
we addreſſed our ſelves to him, and
humbly entreated him that we might enjoy the
benefit of his Miniſtry; in Order whereto, we
deſired him that he would compound with his
Patron at ſo much a month as he could, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we were abundantly convinc'd of our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to adminiſter to him of our <hi>Carnal things,</hi>
who ſhould adminiſter to us of <hi>his Spirituals,</hi> we
engaged to allow him <hi>a Competency</hi> to maintain
himſelf, and ſatisfie the expectations of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron:
The good man hearkned to us with much
readineſs; and now indeed we found our burd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
much lighter, and our conditions not preſt
ſo hard upon our Spirrits: <hi>Thrice a week</hi> this
Godly, painul Servant of Jeſus Chriſt prayed
with us, and Preach'd to us the Word of God;
our meeting-place was a Cellar, which I had
hired at ſome diſtance from our Shop, where I
ſtowed ſome Goods that were peculiarly my
own when we fell into a greater ſtroke of trade.
To our Meetings reſorted many, ſometimes
three or fourſcore, and though we met <hi>next the
Street,</hi> yet we never had the leaſt diſturbance
from the <hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Moors;</hi> for whilſt we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddled
not with <hi>their Superſtitions,</hi> but paid
our Patrons <hi>their demands,</hi> we might, without
any diſturbance from them, <hi>Worſhip our God,
according to our Conſciences:</hi> It's true, that ſuch
were the circumſtances of the Slavery of many
poor Chriſtians, that they <hi>could not</hi> attend; and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110337:30"/>
ſuch the wretched careleſsneſs of others, that
they <hi>would not</hi> attend, and ſuch the Proviſions
that God had made for others, by other means,
that they <hi>needed not,</hi> perhaps, attend upon
God's Worſhip with us; but thus was our God
pleaſed to give us the means of <hi>ſtrengthning our
Faith,</hi> and <hi>Comforting our drooping Spirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At length came one Captain <hi>Wildy</hi> of <hi>Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff</hi>
to Trade there, who, with the Aſſiſtance
of the <hi>Legorn</hi> Mercahnts, free'd our Miniſter
from his Patron. After his freedom from his
Patron, yet there remained <hi>a Duty of ſixty Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
which was a particular charge payable to
the Publick Treaſury, before he could be fully
enlarged from the City: We Petitioned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Captain, that <hi>he might,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sprat</hi>
himſelf, that <hi>he would</hi> ſtill continue to be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to our poor Souls, in the work of the
Goſpel, and we eaſily prevailed, and had the
benefit of his Miniſtry whilſt I ſtaid there.</p>

               <p>THey that are preſſed with <hi>their own Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Grievances,</hi> have little leiſure <hi>to look
abroad,</hi> and obſerve <hi>the Motions of others;</hi> and
indeed our own Afflictions however ſweetned,
lay ſtill gnawing, and grating upon our Spirits
that we muſt needs be very ill qualified to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
up materials to make a Hiſtory. Such a
Deſign required Leiſure, Liberty, Privacy,
Retiredneſs, Intelligence, and ſtrict Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to all which we were perfect Strangers.
Yet ſometimes I could make a truce with my
Troubles, and obtain ſo long a ceſſation from
my vexatious Preſſures, as to make Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>And. 1. <hi>The Hypocriſie of their Profeſſion</hi>
was ſo notorious, that he muſt put out his Eyes
that did not ſee it. One Month in the year they
Obſerve their <hi>Ramedam,</hi> which is <hi>their Lent;</hi>
and indeed rhey Obſerve it <hi>by day</hi> with more
<hi>Monkiſh Auſterity,</hi> impoſing upon themſelves <hi>a
total Abſtinence:</hi> An Obſervation which they
may be preſumed to owe to that <hi>Neſtorian
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110337:31"/>
Monk,</hi> who clubb'd <hi>with Mahomet</hi> in the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
invention of <hi>the Alchoran:</hi> But for all their
demure <hi>Quadrageſimal looks by day,</hi> they <hi>give</hi>
or <hi>ſell themſelves</hi> to commit <hi>with greedineſs</hi> all
manner of the moſt execrable Villanies <hi>by night.</hi>
And they cheat themſelves with this evaſion;
that forſooth <hi>Mahomet Commanded them to Faſt
ſo many Days, but not ſo many Nights;</hi> For
now they beat up their Drums, and call their
Friends firſt <hi>out of bed,</hi> then out of Doors, they
provoke, challenge, dare one another to <hi>eat,
drink, and run into all exceſs of Riot.</hi> They
will neither <hi>ſpare Men in their Rage, nor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in their Luſt:</hi> The <hi>two hungry meals of
the Day, makes the third of the Night an errand
Glutton.</hi> By Day they create themſelves <hi>a
Purgatory,</hi> and by night the poor Slaves <hi>find a
Hell.</hi> Now when they have cramm'd their
Guts <hi>all Night,</hi> and are <hi>Maw-ſick in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
they put on their <hi>Lenten face again;</hi> and
call that <hi>a Faſt,</hi> which is <hi>but Phyſick;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<hi>Religion</hi> for that which they are compell'd
to <hi>by Nature;</hi> that is, <hi>they Faſt when they can
eat and drink no longer:</hi> But indeed their Faſt
by Day is nothing but <hi>a dry Drunkenneſs;</hi> for
when they have drunk, and whored themſelves
<hi>into ſin,</hi> they fancy they <hi>merit a pardon by Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence.</hi>
A piece of Hypocriſie ſo groſs, that
whether it be to be ſampled any where in the
World, unleſs, perhaps, by the <hi>Popiſh Carne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,</hi>
I cannot tell.</p>

2. I could not but obſerve, that though they
allow, <hi>that every man may be ſaved in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
he profeſſes, provided he walks by i'ts
Rules,;</hi> and therefore that at laſt, <hi>the Jews,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Banner of <hi>Moſes;</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Banner of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> under
the Banner of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſhall all march over
<hi>a fair bridg,</hi> into I know not what <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> a

                     </gap>articular Treaſury</hi> ſet apart for that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
but this I know, that they uſe <hi>the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
benevolence of well diſpoſed Perſons,</hi> to
advance it. Now, there was a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Friar,
that was a Slave, who being paſſed by <hi>in the
Redemption that Year,</hi> took it <hi>very hainouſly</hi> to
be neglected, thought himſelf <hi>much wronged;</hi>
hereupon he grows <hi>Diſcontented,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
(who never works with greater ſucceſs than
upon that Humor) takes the Advantage to <hi>puſh
him on;</hi> and he <hi>in a pett,</hi> Renounces the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, declares himſelf <hi>a Muſſulman,</hi>
and accordingly appears in his <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Habit.
I knew him very well by ſight he was a fat,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110337:32"/>
corpulent perſon; but after he had turned <hi>Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado,</hi>
I obſerved him to become <hi>ſtrangely lean,
and dejected in his Countenance.</hi> but I little ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that the <hi>Root of his Diſtemper</hi> lay in <hi>his
Conſcience:</hi> but it ſeems he had ſeverely reflected
upon <hi>his Apoſtacy,</hi> for he had not Renounced
<hi>onely his Popery,</hi> but <hi>his Chriſtianity:</hi> His own
Conſcience, which was <hi>a Thouſand Witneſſes</hi>
againſt him, was <hi>a Thouſand Tormentors</hi> to him:
Long he bore <hi>i'ts ſecret and ſtinging laſhes,</hi> but
when he could no longer ſtand under them,
he goes to the Vice-Roy's Palace, and there
openly declares himſelf a Chriſtian, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
againſt the Superſtition and Idolatry of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
as a moſt Execrable, and damnable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture:
Immediatly he is conveyed before the
Councel, and there ſtrictly Examined, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
reſolutely in his Profeſſion, whereupon he
is clapt in Irons, and for ſome time there ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Now, they pretended this reaſon for their
proceedure. That there had been ſome pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing
and tampering with him, either <hi>Morally
by Argument,</hi> or <hi>Naturally by ſome Doſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicating
Drugs,</hi> that had thus diſtempered
him; for loth they were it ſhould be thought,
that any Man <hi>of ſound mind, or maſter of his
Reaſon,</hi> would ever revolt from their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But when they ſaw him fixt in his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and that neither what <hi>he felt,</hi> or <hi>might
fear,</hi> what they had <hi>inflicted,</hi> or could <hi>threaten,</hi>
did unhinge him from his Profeſſion, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110337:33"/>
to the laſt remedy, and inexorably <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
him to the Fire:</hi> A way of Puniſhment
which <hi>they learnt from the</hi> Spaniards <hi>themſelves
who firſt ſet up the Inquiſition againſt the</hi> Moors,
<hi>and have now turned the edg of it againſt the
Proteſtants.</hi> And now they proceed to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of the Sentence, which was performed
with ſome <hi>Pomp, and State.</hi> And firſt, they
formed <hi>a Crown with a Croſs upon the top of it,</hi>
within the Plates, and Bars whereof they put
Flax; thus Crowned, they guard him through
the City, out of the Weſt-Gate, about half a
mile, which was the appointed place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and firſt, one puts Fire to the Flax in his
<hi>mock-Crown,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of <hi>his Head,</hi> in
<hi>the Name of the reſt of his Body:</hi> at firſt he
ſhook it off, but another put Fire again to it with
a Cane, and then the poor man ſtood patiently,
and preſently they put Fire to the whole Pile,
and there burnt him: I ſaw ſome of his Bones,
and ſcorched Fleſh after he was dead; and the
ſame Evening came a Zealous <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and
carried away ſome of his ſcorched Fleſh, and
Bones, as <hi>the Holy Reliques of a Martyr,</hi> ſaying
<hi>I have now done enough to make ſatisfaction for
all the ſins that I have committed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It's worth Admiration, to ſee in what
<hi>great awe</hi> they ſtand of <hi>the meaneſt Officer,</hi> who
is known to be ſuch by his <hi>Turbant, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</hi>
If any Affray be made, or a murder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the Streets, the <hi>Chiaux,</hi> or Officer
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110337:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preſently comes without any Weapon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to aſſiſt him; and if he ſeizes the Offenders,
none is ſo hardy as to reſiſt <hi>even unarmed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The great Reverence which <hi>the Moors</hi>
pay to <hi>the Turks,</hi> though both <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> is
remarkable: If a <hi>Moor</hi> ſhall dare <hi>to ſtrike a
Turk,</hi> he is puniſht with great ſeverity: I ſaw
two <hi>Moors</hi> whilſt I was there, whoſe <hi>right
Hands were chopt</hi> off for this one Crime, and
hung about their necks in ſtrings; the one was
ſet upon an Aſſe, the other walkt by on foot,
the Common Cryer proclaiming before them
their Offence, through the chief Streets of the
City. I ſaw another alſo with his heels tyed to
a Horſes Tayl; he was wholly naked, onely he
had on a pair of linnen Drawers, and thus was
he dragg'd through the Streets? It was a moſt
lamentable Spectacle, to ſee his Body all torn
with the rugged way, and ſtones; the skin torn
off his Back and Elbows, his Head broken, and
all covered with blood, and dirt, and thus was
he dragg'd through the City out at <hi>Bubazoon,</hi>
or the Eaſt-gate, where he ended his miſerable
Life.</p>
               <p>Two others of their own Country-men I ſaw
Executed in a moſt terrible, and dreadful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
(but either I did not know, or do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
their Crimes:) The one was thrown off
from <hi>a high Wall,</hi> and in his fall he was caught
by the way, by one of <hi>the great</hi> ſharp <hi>Hooks,</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:110337:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which were faſtned in the Wall; It caught him
<hi>juſt under the Ribs,</hi> and there he hung <hi>roaring
in unſpeakable pain</hi> till he dyed. The other was
<hi>faſtned to a Ladder,</hi> his <hi>wriſts, and ankles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nailed through with <hi>Iron spikes,</hi> in ſuch a
poſture as ſomewhat reſembles <hi>the Celebrated
Croſs of St. Andrew;</hi> and leaſt his Fleſh and
Sinews ſhould fail, and the Nails not hold; his
<hi>Wriſts</hi> and <hi>Ankles</hi> were bound faſt with ſmall
Cords to the Ladder: <hi>Two days I ſaw him alive
under this Torture,</hi> how much longer he lived
under it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>5. They are generally great Enemies to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
in publick: It's a great ſcandal to them
when they ſee any <hi>Chriſtians, who brought that
Beaſtiality out of their own Countries with them,</hi>
to be guilty of it. I have heard them ſay, of a
Drunken Slave; <hi>A Chriſtian?</hi> No, <hi>He's a
Swine.</hi> And though they will indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by Night (eſpecially in their <hi>Ramedam</hi>
Month) yet woe be to him, that ſhall Offend
<hi>by Day in that Kind.</hi> There was an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who had brought <hi>over with him his drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Humour,</hi> and his Captivity <hi>had not made him
Sober:</hi> and when <hi>Religion has not firm hold of the
Heart,</hi> a little matter will make ſuch a one <hi>let
go his hold of Religion:</hi> This <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> turn'd
a Renegado, and of <hi>a Drunken Chriſtian became
a Drunken Turk,</hi> and was not able <hi>to keep the
Pot from his Head,</hi> during <hi>their Holy time of
Ramedam;</hi> being one day found thus like a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110337:34"/>
Sot, he was brought into <hi>the Caſſabal,</hi> or Chief
Court of Judicature, where he was adjudged to
receive many hundreds of violent blows; ſome
<hi>upon his naked Back and Reins,</hi> others upon <hi>his
naked Belly;</hi> he could <hi>not creep</hi> from the place
of puniſhment, but was <hi>carried away</hi> by <hi>the
Hammels;</hi> his <hi>Belly, and Back</hi> were ſo excori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
that <hi>Sampſon Baker,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi>
who was his Chirurgeon, aſſured me he was
forced to cut off abundance of his Fleſh before
he could be Cured.</p>
               <p>6. What Cruelties they Exerciſe <hi>upon poor
Slaves,</hi> needs not be mentioned, and there will
be an Occaſion to ſpeak of <hi>the moſt Ordinary
way</hi> of puniſhment e're long. Let it ſuffice, that
all is <hi>Arbitrary, and unlimitted.</hi> If a Patron
ſhall <hi>kill his Slave,</hi> for ought I could perceive,
he ſuffers no more for it, than if he ſhould <hi>kill
his Horſe:</hi> There was a <hi>Dutch</hi> Youth, a Slave
to a <hi>Turk,</hi> who, upon ſome provocation, <hi>drew
his Knife at his Patron;</hi> for this <hi>Offer,</hi> he was
Sentenced to be dragg'd out at one of the Gates,
and there to have his <hi>Arms and Legs broken in
pieces with the great Sledg Hammer,</hi> which Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was accordingly Executed, for though I
could not ſee <hi>his face for the Crowd,</hi> yet <hi>I heard
the blows,</hi> and the miſerable Cries of the poor
dying Young Man.</p>

twiſting the Staff about, <hi>till</hi> his Feet are fast

up his Feet with the Soles upwards, well nigh as

<hi>Then comes</hi> another luſty, ſturdy Knave <hi>behind

                  <hi>in the Vice-Roy's Priſon</hi> till our Patrons ſhould
demand our Liberty, and fetch us out. And
the next day we were both delivered, though
with differing Fates; as <hi>Pharaoh's Chief But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and Chief Baker</hi> were both taken from Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>the One to be Advanced, the Other to be
Hanged:</hi> For <hi>John Randal's</hi> Patron being <hi>a

Sovereignty which they pretend to, over
their Slaves, and commanded him to receive
<hi>three hundred blows upon the Soles of his Feet
with the Battoon,</hi> in manner before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed:
As for my ſelf, when I was brought home,
the Spie that ſeized us, came and demanded
Money of my Patron <hi>for his good ſervice</hi> (not
reckoning that he had any thing of me) which
put him into a moſt deſperate fit of Paſſion, and
calling me <hi>Dog and Jew, and all to naught,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me <hi>to go work in the Looms</hi> with two

But alas, I was <hi>a very
Bungler,</hi> and underſtood nothing of the Craft

there I wrought till I had ſpoiled all that I laid
my Hands on: Now, when he ſaw that my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

rated me for <hi>a Loggerhead,</hi> and bad me <hi>fill
Quills</hi> for the other two; being now degraded

become of it I knew not, and durſt not for my
Life diſcover any deſire to return to that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
At laſt, my Patron asked me for
the money that he had lent me when I firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to Trade: I anſwered ſubmiſſively, that I had
not a farthing, all my ſmall Eſtate lay in a
few Goods, and till they were ſold, I could not
poſſibly repay him: He calls one of his Slaves,
a <hi>Dutch</hi> man, and commands him to go with
me, and turn all into ready money, and bring
it him: When I came to my Old Shop, <hi>there
was the Neſt indeed, but all the Birds were ſlown;</hi>
for in my abſence, (poor <hi>John Randal</hi> being
Lame, and not able to work, my Partner ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
before having left me, and I confined to
another Employment) ſome of theſe Raſcals
had broken open my Shop, and thence carried
<hi>the beſt of my Goods,</hi> though my Cellar was ſtill
ſafe, and ſome of my Goods I heard of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
what money I had was hid in the
Ground, as it was my conſtant way: That night
the <hi>Dutch</hi> man and my ſelf returned to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
and told him we could ſell nothing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he remanded me to my Shop, there to
Trade, paying him the two Dollars a moneth,
as I had done before.</p>

               <p>In the partage of his Slaves, it fell to <hi>my Lot

I was in a handſome way of Trade, it was

And if I ſhould be ſilent here, I ſhould
be the moſt ungrateful wretch Living: I found

               <p>My Patron had a fair Farm in the Countrey,

I ſhould loſe with it <hi>all means, all helps,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

none of theſe <hi>could,</hi> or <hi>would</hi> run the riſque of

               </p>
               <p>And herein I had a three fold Reſpect: Firſt

               </p>
               <p>But before I would reveal the Project to any

him, or them, a matter of great concernment</hi> to

promiſe, and ſwear, that in caſe they did
not approve it, or would not joyn in it, yet they

general <hi>their Happineſs and Well-fare,</hi> I needed
not tell them in particular what it drove at, they
could ſmell out that with eaſe; for what could
be <hi>Good, or Happy to Slaves without Liberty?</hi>
This Oath therefore they willingly took: I judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>ſeven Perſons</hi> would be enough to manage,
carry on, and Execute it; and therefore except
the three fore-mentioned, I communicated it to
no one Perſon but theſe following, who engaged
in it, though all of them did not go through
with it. <hi>John Anthony,</hi> a Carpenter, who
had been <hi>a Slave fifteen years:</hi> his Trade ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſhews, how uſeful he would prove in

Slavery about five Years. <hi>John</hi>—a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

of Body, and therefore muſt be a good Wheel
in this Engine, and he had been a Slave
five Years: And two others, whoſe Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  </hi> theſe made

<hi>ſo fairly bought me,</hi> were juſtifiable before God

               <p>And 1. It might be a Queſtion in point
of <hi>Prudence;</hi> for, where could I hope to
<hi>mend my ſelf?</hi> Or better my Condition? I might
poſſibly find <hi>worſe</hi> Quarter in <hi>England,</hi> where
the Civil Wars were now broke out, and to
that height of exaſperation, that thoſe of the
ſame Nation, and, perhaps Blood, would
hardly give Quarter of Life one to another: If
the Name of <hi>Native Countrey</hi> bewitcht me, if
That dazled my Eyes; ſurely <hi>where-ever we are
well is our Countrey,</hi> and <hi>all the World is Home
to him that thrives all over the World:</hi> And why
ſhould the <hi>Name of Bondage,</hi> why ſhould <hi>a
word</hi> grate ſo harſhly upon my <hi>delicate Spirit,</hi>
when the ſting of it was taken away? <hi>Liberty</hi>
is <hi>a good word;</hi> but a Man <hi>cannot buy a Meals
meat with a word:</hi> And Slavery is <hi>a hard word,</hi>
but <hi>it breaks no mans back.</hi> Thouſands <hi>are more
Slaves</hi> then I, who are yet their <hi>own Masters,
and leſs at Liberty</hi> then my ſelf, who have the
<hi>free rake and range</hi> of the whole World. But
yet my Patron's Favour was <hi>no free hold;</hi> I held
not my Happy time <hi>in fee ſimple,</hi> all was <hi>advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem

who might be of <hi>another Character,</hi> and

               <p>2. I might be Queſtioned in point of <hi>Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,</hi>
how I could be ſo unworthy to leave him,
who had Loved me? <hi>Would</hi> not all that ſhould
hear of it, <hi>Condemn me of ill Nature, to leave</hi>

to me, who might have uſed the Right of
<hi>a Lord;</hi> and <hi>uſed</hi> me <hi>as a Child,</hi> who might have
treated me <hi>as a Slave?</hi> But really I thought
there was more of <hi>Manners and Courtſhip</hi> in
the Objection, than of <hi>weight, and Cogency;</hi> Still
<hi>I dwelt with</hi> Meſhech, <hi>and had my Habitation
amongſt the Tents of</hi> Kedar; and one thought
of <hi>England,</hi> and of its Liberty and Goſpel <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
a thouſand ſuch Objections,</hi> and routed
whole Legions of theſe <hi>little Scruples.</hi> It was
no time to ſtand upon the <hi>Punctilio's of Honour
and Ingenuity;</hi> no time to <hi>Complement, and
ſtrain courteſie;</hi> here was no <hi>Farewel Patron,</hi>
in the Caſe, and therefore I ſoon overcame <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, 3. It might be Queſtioned in the Court
of Conſcience, whether it were not <hi>down-right
Theft</hi> to with-draw my ſelf from <hi>his Service,</hi>
who had <hi>bought</hi> me, <hi>paid</hi> for <hi>me,</hi> enter'd upon
me, <hi>poſſeſs'd and enjoy'd me,</hi> as his own <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Goods,</hi> and now I was <hi>not my</hi> own, had no
<hi>right to my</hi> ſelf: Whether might not a Man be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:110337:43"/>
                  <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> in <hi>ſtealing himſelf,</hi> as well as <hi>killing
himſelf?</hi> And whether he is not the greater <hi>ſelf-robber,</hi>
that ſteals <hi>away himſelf,</hi> then he that
ſteals away <hi>from himſelf?</hi> But I much queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>their propriety</hi> to me; my Patron's <hi>Title</hi> was
<hi>rotten</hi> at the <hi>Foundation:</hi> Man is too noble a
Creature to be made ſubject to <hi>a deed of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and Sale;</hi> and my <hi>conſent</hi> was never ask'd
to all their bargains, which is Eſſential, to create
a right of Dominion over <hi>a Rational Creature,
where he was not born a Subject.</hi> If I had <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited</hi>
my Life or Liberty, <hi>the Law might take
it;</hi> but I was not Conſcious to my ſelf of any
<hi>ſuch forfeiture,</hi> but that I was <hi>at my own Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus all was clear and quiet, and we went on
with our Deſign, which I now firſt opened to
them: That I had contrived the Model of a
Boat, which being formed in parcels, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
put together, might, by the ſuper-inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of Divine Providence, prove <hi>an Ark</hi> to
deliver us out of the hands of our Enemies. This
was ſoon ſaid, and greedily entertained; to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape</hi>
was a pleaſant <hi>word,</hi> the Name of <hi>Liberty</hi>
made Muſick in our Ears, and our wiſhing hearts
danced to <hi>the Tune of it;</hi> and <hi>a Boat</hi> was as <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
a means</hi> as any thing could be imagined:
But when once their thoughts <hi>cooled,</hi> and came
<hi>more ſedately</hi> to look into the difficulties of it;
they appeared <hi>innumerable,</hi> and ſome of them
ſeemed <hi>inſuperable;</hi> and ſome things that had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:110337:43"/>
paſt currant in my own thoughts, and I went
clever away with them, without any rub; yet
when they came to be pierced into with <hi>more
Eyes,</hi> and ſcann'd upon <hi>more Fingers,</hi> they were
attended with conſiderable impediments: where
this Boat ſhould be built, was one ſtaggering
Queſtion: Where it ſhould be Lanched, and
where put to Sea, was a Choaking Objection:
How we ſhould eſcape thoſe <hi>Argus</hi>-eyes, which
are always obſerving us by Day, was a gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Qhaery; or how to get out of the City by
Night, whoſe Walls are ſo high, whoſe Gates
are ſo cloſe ſhut, and ſtrongly Guarded was
another vexatious Quaery: How we ſhould be
Rigged and Victualled for ſuch a Voyage, was
a conſiderable enquiry: and whether we ſhould
deſign, was not to be ſlighted. But how <hi>ſuch a
little Skiff,</hi> rather than Boat, ſhould be able <hi>to
Weather all the Accidents of the Sea,</hi> was <hi>a
Neck Queſtion,</hi> enough to <hi>ſtrangle Faith, and
ſtifle with us with Deſpair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe Objections, I Anſwered. That I
had deſigned <hi>my own Cellar,</hi> as the meeteſt place
wherein to <hi>build the Boat;</hi> that when it was there
Built, it might be taken <hi>in pieces again,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
out of the City <hi>in parcels,</hi> and beſtowed in
private places till things were <hi>ripe for Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
That for a place where to put to Sea, it

                  </gap>ould be time enough to determine upon that
when we had finiſh'd our Veſſel: That <hi>Mayork</hi>
was the moſt commodious place to deſign to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110337:44"/>

That if we <hi>never attempted</hi> any thing till

<hi>a piece of Timber about twelve Foot long, to
make the Keel:</hi> But becauſe it was impoſſible
to convey a piece of Timber of that length out
of the City, but it muſt be ſeen; and of that

                     </gap>t reſolved, and obstinate breaſt;</hi> we
therefore cut it <hi>in</hi> two pieces, and fitted it for
Joynting thus in the middle. Our next care
was the <hi>Timbers or Ribs</hi> of the Poat, which
we contrived thus; every one of the Timbers
was <hi>made</hi> of three <hi>pieces,</hi> and joynted in two
<hi>places,</hi> becauſe a whole Rib at its full length,
would <hi>be</hi> lyable <hi>to the</hi> ſame inconveniences with
the Keel. Now underſtand, that the joynts of
the Ribs were not made with <hi>Mortice and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:110337:45"/>
but the flat ſide of one of the three Pieces
was laid over the other, and <hi>two holes</hi> were bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at <hi>every joynt,</hi> into which <hi>two Nails</hi> were
to be put, when we ſhould <hi>joyn the parcels</hi> of our
Boat together: You muſt underſtand further,
that <hi>theſe two holes at every joynt</hi> were not made
in a <hi>ſtrait line, parallel with the ſides</hi> of the pieces,
for then the three pieces, which make one Rib,
being joyned together would have made <hi>one
ſtrait piece;</hi> a Form which would by no means
comport with the Uſe and Deſign of the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
But ſo, that when <hi>both the Nails were in
the holes,</hi> each Joynt would make <hi>an obtuſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle,</hi>
and ſo incline ſo near towards <hi>a Semi-Circu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110337:45"/>
                  <hi>about their Wives and Slaves are inſupportably
ſuſpicious:</hi> And therefore from the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the Deſign, I always reſolved upon
<hi>a Canvas:</hi> In purſuance of which thought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all ſatisfied that it was <hi>practicable;</hi> we bought
as much ſtrong Canvas as would cover our Boat

We provided alſo as much <hi>Pitch, Tar, and

Tawparlin Sear-cloth,</hi> to ſwaddle <hi>the naked
body of our Infant-Boat:</hi> With Earthen pots
to melt done our Materials in; and prefixt a
night wherein we might Execute that part of our
Labour. The <hi>two Carpenters, and my ſelf</hi> were
appointed to this Service, and the Cellar was
the place where we met. Matters had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
run very evenly, and ſmoothly, but here
we met with ſome <hi>diſcouraging rubs.</hi> For when
we had ſtopt all the Chinks and Crannies of the
Cellar, that the ſtreame of the melted Materials
might not creep out and betray us, (there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Chimney,) we had not been long at our
work before I felt my ſelf exceeding ſick, with
the ſtrong, and unuſual ſcent of the melted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor;
I was forced to go out into the ſtreets to
<hi>gaſp for breath,</hi> where meeting with the <hi>cool
Air,</hi> it over-came me, I ſwooned, fell down
brake my face, and there lay: My Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
miſſing me, made out to ſeek me, found
me in this ſad plight, and carried me in again,
though exceeding ſick, and unſerviceable. They
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:110337:46"/>
had not proceeded much further before I heard
one of them complain he was ſick, and cou'd
proceed no further, and now our work ſtood
ſtill: I plainly ſaw that <hi>our hopeful Project,</hi> that
had hitherto ſo ſmoothly proceeded, muſt needs
miſcarry, and Prove Abortive; for it would be
impoſſible to finiſh it <hi>this night:</hi> and if we once
<hi>parted,</hi> and ſuffered our Spirits <hi>to cool over</hi> the
<hi>Deſign,</hi> they would never ceaſe cooling till they
were <hi>ſtone-cold, and hard frozen;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I adviſed to ſet open the Door, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our ſelves, and our work to Gods Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For I told them they could not but know,
that <hi>if any Diſcovery</hi> were <hi>made, the burden</hi>
would <hi>fall heavieſt upon my ſhoulders;</hi> and my
<hi>Back or Feet muſt pay for all.</hi> At length, we
reſolved to ſet the Cellar-door wide open, and
as ſoon as that was done, and the ſtream pretty
well gone out, we came to our ſelves again, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly
went <hi>on</hi> with our buſineſs, and pitched
one half that Night. The next night we met
again, ſet open the Door, and whilſt they <hi>plyed</hi>
the work, I ſtood Sentinel at the Door to give
Notice of <hi>approaching</hi> danger; but we <hi>happily</hi>
finiſh'd the whole, and while it was yet dark,
carried it to my Shop, which was about a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from the Cellar, and there at preſent ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not queſtion the Readers Ingenuity ſo
much, but that he will <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> there goes a

but what ſhould I trouble him with thoſe things
that <hi>are common to all other Boats,</hi> I mention
only what was <hi>Peculiar to our own;</hi> and I do
not intend to trouble him with <hi>the Boat-wright's
Lecture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our Cellar we fitted all things, we made
the Timbers fit to the Keel, and the Canvas fit
for the Timbers, and the Seats fit to the whole,
and then took all in pieces again, and laying our
Heads together, plotting how to convey all out
of the Town, and lodg them in ſecure and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
places.</p>
               <p>And firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>for our Keel,</hi> we all with unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
conſent judged <hi>Will. Adams</hi> the fitteſt
Perſon to execute that part of the Deſign, for
he had long Exerciſed the Trade of a Brick-lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and his Employment lay much without the
Town; and beſides, he uſed ſuch pieces in level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his work. He therefore; accourted with
his <hi>Apron before him, his Trowel in his hand,</hi> and
one of the pieces <hi>upon his ſhoulder,</hi> undertook
it, and without the leaſt Obſervation went cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly
away with it, and as he ſaw his Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
hid it in the bottom of a Hedg; and not
long after conveyed out its Fellow, and Lodged
it in the ſame place. This ſucceeding ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily,
we ſaw no great difficulty <hi>in the Timbers,</hi>
for we put <hi>one nail into a hole of every joynt,</hi> and
then you will eaſily conceive, that <hi>the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
pieces of one Rib</hi> being <hi>folded inwards
upon the middlemoſt,</hi> will lye <hi>in the room of one
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:110337:47"/>
of the pieces for length,</hi> excepting that litile that
<hi>the ends of each piece</hi> were beyond the holes:
Now, by general conſent, the conveying theſe
out of the City was committed to one, whoſe
Employment was to waſh ſmall Clothes by the
Sea-ſide: He puts them into his bag amongſt his
Clothes, and ſo very orderly carried them out,
and hid them where he could find <hi>moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſtowage,</hi> but yet <hi>with Reſpect to nearneſs to
that Place</hi> where the Keel was laid.</p>
               <p>But how to convey <hi>our Tarpawlin</hi> ſafe out of
Town ſeemed moſt difficult; by night it was
impoſſible, and by day the difficulties very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
and the danger <hi>proportionable; for the
Gates</hi> are ſtrictly watch'd, the <hi>Streets</hi> crowded,
the <hi>Spies pickering</hi> in every corner, and <hi>the
bulk of the Canvas</hi> thus dreſſed was very great.
To <hi>divide it</hi> had been to <hi>ruin our ſelves,</hi> for no
ſtitching together again, could ſo <hi>cheat the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
water,</hi> but it would find out <hi>the needle-holes.</hi>
At laſt we ventured upon this way; we
put it into a large Sack, and committed it to him
that uſed <hi>to waſh Clothes,</hi> and leſt any ſhould
clap a jealous hand upon it, we put a Pillow over
our Canvas within the bag, that ſo its ſoftneſs
might delude the Inquiſitor, and make it paſs
for Clothes. Let none diſpiſe, or condemn theſe
as <hi>low, mean pieces of contrivance,</hi> for we had
not <hi>Polititians tools to work withal;</hi> but the leſs
was <hi>our Policy,</hi> the more glorious does <hi>the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God</hi> ſhine in ſucceeding it, and yet even
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110337:47"/>
                  <hi>that little</hi> Policy we were guilty of, was of <hi>his
beſtowing</hi> alſo; <hi>what of ſin</hi> was in all of it, was
entirely <hi>our own;</hi> what of <hi>Power, Wiſdom, and
Succeſs,</hi> was <hi>all his:</hi> But our Agent eſcaped
happily with it, and Lodging it in a ſecret place,
returned.</p>
               <p>We had yet many things to provide, and
Oars are abſolutely neceſſary, they were of <hi>the
Quorum</hi> to an Eſcape <hi>by ſea:</hi> As <hi>Finns</hi> are the
<hi>Fiſhes Oars,</hi> ſo <hi>Oars</hi> are the <hi>Boats Finns,</hi> by
help whereof ſhe makes her way: Now, to
ſupply this defect, we took <hi>two Pipe-ſtaves,</hi> and
ſlitting them a croſs from corner to corner with
a Hand-ſaw, we made of each Pipe-ſtaff two
Rude things, which Neceſſity was pleaſed to
entitle <hi>The blades for a pair of Oars,</hi> and theſe
were eaſily conveyed out, without ſuſpition.</p>
               <p>Next, we conſidered, that <hi>Proviſion</hi> muſt be
laid in for <hi>our Voyage;</hi> and therefore we provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>a ſmall,</hi> and but <hi>a ſmall quantity of Bread,</hi>
preſuming our ſtay at Sea muſt be but ſhort;
for either we ſhould ſpeedily <hi>recover Land,</hi> or
ſpeedily <hi>be drown'd,</hi> or ſpeedily be <hi>brought back
again:</hi> Two Goats ſkins alſo, ſtript off whole,
and ſo Tann'd (a kind of Bottle much uſed by

had, which <hi>we lived</hi> with <hi>freſh water,</hi> and we

               </p>
               <p>We remembred alſo that <hi>a Sail</hi> might be of
right good uſe to us <hi>for expedition,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110337:48"/>

                  </gap> carrying it out, I Offered to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<hi>that laſt part of our work:</hi> I had not gone

I was loth <hi>a Deſign of ſo near, and dear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment

<hi>in the Haven,</hi> but me-thought it was <hi>more ſad</hi>
to <hi>ſink a Veſſel before it could be Launched:</hi> And
here I firſt found the difference between <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

<hi>guilt</hi> in <hi>my Countenance,</hi> (for ſome things are
ſin <hi>there</hi> which are not ſo in <hi>other places:)</hi> and
this had betray'd me, had I not ſuddenly pluckt
up my ſpirits, and ſpying an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Clothes by the Sea, I went the ready way to
him, and deſired him to help me waſh that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas;
as we were waſhing it, <hi>the learing Spye</hi>
came and ſtood upon the Rock juſt over our
Heads to watch our motions: As ſoon as we had
<hi>a little formally</hi> waſh'd it, to caſt a Miſt before
his Obſerving Eyes, I took the Canvas and ſpred
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:110337:48"/>
it before his Face upon the top of the Rock to
dry; he ſtaid his own Time, and then march'd
off. But I was as Jealous of him, as he could
be of me for his Heart; and therefore fearing
he might lye in Ambuſh for me, took it when
'twas dry, and very fairly carried it back into
the City, and faithfully acquainted my Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
how the Matter ſquared. This Diſcora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them not a little, for that they ſeemed timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to proceed in the Enterprize.</p>

another, and entred into cloſe Counſel, where

               <p>We had hid ſeveral of our Materials near <hi>the
top of the Hill,</hi> where alſo grew a ſmall Fig-tree,
which we had marked with our Eye, as Judging
it would be uſeful to ſtrengthen the Keel of our
Boat: Two of our Company were immediately
diſpatcht to <hi>ſaw down this Fig-Tree,</hi> and bring
it, and the parcels of our Boat there diſpoſited
away with them: They were hardly come to
the place, but we heard Dogs bark about the
top of the Hill, and indeed two Men with Dogs
came very near them; but our Men being aware
lay cloſe and ſtill, and ſo they paſſed by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
making any Diſcovery, and then our Men
beſtirr'd themſelves, and brought away the
Fig-Tree, and the other Materials, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to us.</p>
               <p>And now we had once more brought the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
Limbs of our Boat into one place, which,
like thoſe of <hi>Abſyrtus,</hi> had been diſperſed up
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:110337:50"/>
and down the Fields: It was no time to trifle,
&amp; therefore we all buckled to our work in good
earneſt: But we were ſo nigh ſome that were at
work in the Neighbouring Gardens, that we
could hear them ſpeak, and therefore muſt needs
ſuppoſe they might hear us too; and therefore
we Acted by Signs, and pointed, and pulled,
and nodded, but were <hi>all Mutes:</hi> It might have
been an Expedient for the Builders of <hi>Babel,</hi>
when their Languages were Divided, to have
carried on their great Project by Signs: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there was Confuſion poured out <hi>upon their
Hearts and Counſels,</hi> as well as Diviſion in <hi>their
Tongues and Languages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two parts of our Keel we ſoon joyned;
then opening the Timbers, which had already
<hi>one Nail in every Joynt,</hi> we groped out for <hi>the
other hole;</hi> and put <hi>its Nail</hi> into it: Then we
open'd them at their full length, and applyed
them to the top of the Keel, faſtning them with
<hi>Rope-Yarn,</hi> and ſmall Cords; and ſo we ſerved
all the Joynts to keep them <hi>firm and ſtable;</hi> then
we bound <hi>ſmall Canes</hi> all along the Ribs <hi>length-ways,</hi>
both to keep the Ribs <hi>from vering,</hi> and
alſo <hi>to bear out the Canvas very ſtiff againſt the
preſſing water:</hi> Then we made <hi>Notches</hi> upon
the ends of the <hi>Ribs, or Timbers,</hi> wherein <hi>the
Oars might plye;</hi> and having tyed down the Seats,
and ſtrengthned our Keel with the Fig-Tree, we
laſtly drew on our double Canvas Caſe, <hi>already
fitted;</hi> and really <hi>the Canvas</hi> ſeemed a <hi>Winding-ſheet
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110337:51"/>
ſheet for our Boat;</hi> and our <hi>Boat a Coffin for
us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, four of our Company took it upon
their ſhoulders, and carried it down towards the
Sea, which was about half a Mile off: It was
a little Repreſentation of a <hi>Funeral,</hi> to ſee <hi>the
four Barers</hi> Marching in deep ſilence with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
very like <hi>a Herſe, and Coffin,</hi> upon their
ſhoulders, and the reſt of us <hi>decently attending
the Ceremony;</hi> but we <hi>wanted Torches,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it's not uſual for <hi>any</hi> to wait upon <hi>their own
Coffins:</hi> But we durſt not grudg our Boat that
<hi>ſmall, and laſt Office,</hi> to carry it <hi>half a Mile,</hi>
for we expected, it ſhould repay us that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Civilty with Intereſt, in carrying us
<hi>many a League:</hi> We carried it at Land, where
it could <hi>not ſwim;</hi> that it might carry us at Sea,
where we could <hi>not walk.</hi> As we went along,
they that were in the Gardens heard us paſſing
by, and called to us, <hi>who comes there?</hi> But it
was dark, and we had no mind to prate, and
therefore without any Anſwer, we ſilently held
on our way.</p>
               <p>When we came to the Sea-ſide, we immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſtript ourſelves naked, and putting our
Clothes into the Boat, carried it, and them, as
far into the Sea as we could wade; and this we
did, leſt <hi>our tender Boat</hi> ſhould pe <hi>toren againſt
the Stones or Rocks;</hi> and then all ſeven of us
got into her: But here we ſoon found how our
Skill in Calculating the Lading of our Veſſel
failed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110337:51"/>
us: For we were no ſooner Embarqued,
but ſhe was ready to ſink under us, the water
coming in over the ſides? ſo that once again we
muſt entertain new Counſels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at laſt, one <hi>whoſe
Heart moſt failed him,</hi> was willing to be ſhut out;
and rather hazard the <hi>uncertain Torments of the
Land,</hi> than <hi>certainly be drown'd at Sea;</hi> then
we made a ſecond Experiment, but ſtill ſhe was
ſo deep Laden, that we all concluded there was
no venturing out to Sea: At length, <hi>another</hi>
went a ſhore, and then ſhe <hi>held up her Head</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſtoutly, and ſeem'd <hi>hearty enough</hi> for our
Voyage.</p>
               <p>It was time now to commit, and Commend
our ſelves, and Veſſel to the Protection, and
Conduct of that God <hi>who Rules the Winds and
the waves, and whoſe Kingdom is in the deep
Waters, imploring Mercy for the Pardon of our
Sins, and reſigning up our ſouls to God, as if

for Six Dayes, and Nights, with the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident
Providences of God that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
for us in our Extremities, and
our Miraculous Landing at Mayork,
July 6. 1644.</head>
               <p>WE are now out at Sea without Helm, or
Pilot; without Anchor, Tackle, or
Compaſs; but God was <hi>theſe. all theſe, and
more then all theſe.</hi> Our Number was <hi>Small,</hi>
our Work was <hi>Great,</hi> we could not afford one
<hi>Idle Hand,</hi> not one idle <hi>Finger:</hi> Four of the
Company continually wrought at the Oars; and
indeed we <hi>wrought for our Lives,</hi> and then I
ſhall not need to ſay <hi>how we wrought:</hi> But this
<hi>I ſhall</hi> ſay, I <hi>can truly</hi> ſay it, I never ſaw ſtrength
<hi>ſo ſtrained,</hi> nor the utmoſt of what <hi>Nature
could do</hi> for <hi>Life and Liberty,</hi> exerted ſo much
in all my Life. The Employment of the fifth
Man was <hi>more eaſie,</hi> but no leſs neceſſary, which
was to free the Boat of that water, which by
Degrees leak't through our Canvas.</p>
               <p>We Labour'd the harder <hi>that Night,</hi> becauſe
we would gladly be out of the Ken of our Old
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:110337:54"/>
Maſters <hi>by Day;</hi> but when Day appear'd, we
were yet within ſight of the Ships that lay in the
Haven, and Road, and off the Land: But our
Boat being ſmall, and lying cloſe, and ſnug up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Sea, either was not at all diſcovered, or
elſe ſeemed ſomething that was not worth the
taking up: A <hi>little hope</hi> in the midſt of <hi>great
Fears,</hi> made us double, and re-double our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence;
we tugg'd at the Oars like thoſe who
are <hi>Chain'd to the Gallies,</hi> becauſe we had no
mind to be <hi>Slaves</hi> to our Old Patrones in <hi>their
Gallies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But upon all Occaſions we found our want of
fore-caſt, for now our Bread, which was to be
the ſtaff of our decayed ſtrength, had lie ſoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Salt water, like a drunken Toaſt ſopt
in Brine, and was quite ſpoiled: And our freſh
water in the Bottles ſtank of the Tann'd Skins,
and Owze, having lye ſobbing in the Salt water
which made it nauceous: But yet that hope that
hover'd over us, and flatter'd us that we ſhould
one day mend our Commons, ſweeten'd all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
<hi>ſo long as Bread was Bread,</hi> we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
not: Three days with good Husbandry
it laſted, but then pale Famine (which is the
worſt ſheap Death can be painted in) ſtared us
in the Face; And there was no ſubſtitute for
Bread at Sea: At Land, the Roots of Graſs the
tops of Trees, and the vileſt Excrements have
ſerved to ſtop the clamour of a Ravenous Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
but that which Slaves deſpiſed, we ſhould
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:110337:54"/>
have admired, and prized: Water indeed we
might have, <hi>either cold, or hot;</hi> we had choice,
but it was <hi>a hard choice:</hi> Either the <hi>cold ſalt
weter</hi> out of the Sea, or <hi>that warmer</hi> which
had been ſtrained through our Bodies, and that
we choſe <hi>of the two,</hi> but we muſt not have that,
<hi>after a while,</hi> unleſs we would firſt accept <hi>the
other:</hi> And the Miſery was, theſe did not <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage</hi>
our thirſt, but <hi>increaſe it;</hi> nor <hi>increaſe
our ſtrength,</hi> but <hi>diminiſh it;</hi> yet theſe were
the <hi>means of Life:</hi> Strange means, that would
deſtroy <hi>the End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Several things added to our Miſery; for trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſeldom comes ſolitary: For firſt, we had
the Wind <hi>for ſome time</hi> full againſt us: And this
was both an evil in <hi>its ſelf,</hi> an evil in <hi>its effect,</hi>
and an evil <hi>in its cauſe.</hi> It was a great evil <hi>in it
ſelf;</hi> it <hi>increaſed</hi> our Labour, and then <hi>defeated
it:</hi> We Rowed <hi>harder</hi> to <hi>leſs purpoſe:</hi> we <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
but did not <hi>advance!</hi> we <hi>ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent our ſtrength
for nought, and in vain.</hi> It was an <hi>evil in its
effect;</hi> for it engaged <hi>the Waters</hi> againſt us, and
drew them into <hi>its prey,</hi> The Sea is <hi>a perfect
Neuter</hi> of it ſelf, and willing to maintain <hi>its
Neutrality;</hi> but the powerful Winds drew her
<hi>into the Faction:</hi> And that Sea which ſerves <hi>the
North</hi> to day, ſhall comply with the <hi>more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
South</hi> to Morrow; for <hi>the Waves are
the greateſt time-ſervers</hi> in the World: But it
was far the greateſt <hi>evil in its Cauſe;</hi> for the
<hi>Winds being againſt us,</hi> argued that <hi>God was
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110337:55"/>
againſt us;</hi> for the Wind we know was <hi>his:
He brings the Winds out of his Magazines.</hi> We
were now ſo diſpirited, that we debated, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we ſhould bare up with the Wind, or make
the beſt of our way, and Row againſt it?</hi> That
is, whether it were not better to go back to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gires
with eaſe,</hi> then <hi>painfully</hi> make towards
<hi>Freedom?</hi> At laſt like Perſons that though we
knew not what to do, yet reſolved not to return;
we reſolved whilſt we had Life, and ſtrength,
and Breath, we would ſtruggle with it: And
now the great God interpoſed; he rebuked <hi>his
Wind;</hi> it was <hi>not againſt us;</hi> nay he <hi>reconciled</hi>
his Wind, and it became <hi>our Friend.</hi> He that
can turn the <hi>Rivers in the South,</hi> could turn <hi>the
Winds out of the North:</hi> Here we might have
had a notable demonſtration of Gods Soverign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
He determined the <hi>Quarter</hi> of the Wind,
the <hi>Quantity</hi> of the Wind, and the <hi>Continuance</hi>
of the Wind. The Quarter, <hi>whence</hi> it ſhould
blow The; Quantity, <hi>how much</hi> it ſhould blow,
and the Continuance, <hi>how long it ſhould blow.</hi>
The Quarter was our Enemy, the Continuance
had quite brought us to Deſpair; but had he
opened his Hand, and let out <hi>one blaſt more,</hi> the
proud <hi>Waters had gone over our Souls, we had
periſhed in the deep:</hi> But we ſee that <hi>our times
are in Gods Hand;</hi> the Ocean in the <hi>hollow of
the ſame Hand,</hi> and the Winds <hi>in the ſame hand;</hi>
and Happy it was for us, that <hi>we, and they,
were all there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:110337:55"/>
A Second great Inconveniency was, that <hi>our
Labour was without Intermiſſion,</hi> though we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<hi>not forwards</hi> at many ſtroaks, yet ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had driven us <hi>backwards.</hi> The poor Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel
that ſtands upon the Watch, yet comforts
himſelf that another will Relive him; but we
had none to take the toyl off our Hands, and
give us Reſpite: We might <hi>ſhift our places, but
not our pains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Third great Evil that lay ſore upon us, was
the extremity of the <hi>heat by day;</hi> the Seaſon
was Raging hot, being the beginning of <hi>July;</hi>
the Climent was hot, being under, or about the
Fourth Climate; we wanted freſh Water to
cool the Heat, and were engagad in continual
Labour to <hi>enrage the heat,</hi> and all theſe made it
inſupportable to <hi>our Bodies,</hi> and our <hi>little, or
no hope,</hi> (which now like a Candle burnt down
to the Socket, did rather blink, than burn) made
it <hi>grievous to our Souls.</hi> One ſmall help we had
(if it was a help) that the fifth Man, who emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed
the Boat of the Salt Water, threw it upon
the Bodies of the reſt to cool them; But this was
<hi>a Miſerable Remedy,</hi> for our Bodies were ſo
bleached between the ſcorching Sun, and the
cooling Water, that they roſe up in Bliſters all
over. Great pain we felt, great danger we were
in, great Miſeries were endured, great wants
we were under, and had <hi>nothing little,</hi> but <hi>hope,
food, and ſtrength.</hi> By Day we were all ſtark
Naked, by Night we had our Shirts, or looſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:110337:56"/>
Coats, and that was all our Cloathing, the reſt
we left a ſhore to eaſe our Boat.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall be ſo Inquiſitive, as to ask, <hi>by
what Directions</hi> we ſteared our Courſe, that we
did not tack about inſenſibly in the dark Night
or Day? He may know, that for <hi>the Day,</hi> one
of the Company had <hi>a Pocket-Dyal,</hi> which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the place of the Compaſs, ee'n well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for ſuch a Veſſel, and ſuch Mariners. By
Night when <hi>the Stars appeared,</hi> we had our
advice from them, and when they diſ-appeared,
we gheſſed at our way by <hi>the Motions of the
Clouds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſad &amp; woeful plight we continued four
Dayes and Nights; on the fifth Day, we were
<hi>on the brink of the brink of deſpair,</hi> and all
hope that we ſhould be ſaved, utterly periſhed.
And now, as perſons deſpairing of <hi>the End,</hi> we
ceaſed to purſue <hi>the means;</hi> laid by our Oars,
left off our Labour; either we had no ſtrength
left, or were loth to throw away that little we
had to no purpoſe, only we kept ſtill emptying
the Boat; loth to drown, loth to dye, yet knew
no wayes to avoyd Death: When the <hi>End is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,</hi>
all <hi>means periſh</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>They that act leaſt, commonly wiſh the moſt:
thus when we had left <hi>fruitleſs Labour,</hi> we fell
upon <hi>fruitleſs wiſhes,</hi> that we might meet with
ſome Veſſel, ſome Ship to take us up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it
was <hi>but a Ship,</hi> we conſidered <hi>no further; Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
or African, Troſs, Tyriuſve;</hi> all was a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:110337:56"/>
Caſe: Or if not, yet <hi>the worſt was better than
our bad caſe;</hi> and therefore reſolved, could we
have Diſcovered any Ship, to have made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her, though it had been one of <hi>Algiers:</hi>
How many wiſht themſelves again <hi>in Egypt,</hi>
when they Combated with the un-expected
Difficulties of <hi>the Wilderneſs!</hi> How oft have
the People of God been more afraid of <hi>the means
of thier Deliverance,</hi> than of <hi>their Danger!</hi>
When Chriſt came to ſave his Diſciples from the
Storm, yet becauſe he came in a way uncouth,
and unexpected, <hi>they cryed out for fear,</hi> Mat.
14. 26. Whether the Reader will pity, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
us, I know not; but to that paſs were we
now brought, that we would have accepted Life
upon any terms, <hi>not baſe and ſinful;</hi> and whether
we ſhould have ſtuck <hi>at ſuch or no,</hi> I have no ſuch
ſecurity from my own Heart as to reſolve
him.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we were at <hi>this dead Ebbe</hi> of Hope,
the Great God, whoſe moſt Glorious <hi>Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
to help, is his Creatures <hi>greateſt Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
He that appeared for <hi>Abraham in the
Mount,</hi> and to the <hi>three Young Men in the Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Furnace;</hi> he that Delivered <hi>Iſrael at the Sea,
at the Red Sea;</hi> he who times all his Mercies
for their Advantage: even He ſent us ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and a <hi>little Relief</hi> is <hi>great,</hi> in <hi>great exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
As we lay hulling up and down, we Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
a Tortoiſe not far from us aſleep in the
Sea. Had the great <hi>Drake</hi> Diſcovered the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:110337:57"/>
Plate-Fleet,</hi> he could not have more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced;
once again we bethought our ſelves of
our Oars; and now our little Boat ſhewed it
ſelf to be of <hi>the right breed of Algiers,</hi> made of
<hi>Piratick Timber,</hi> and to its poor Abbility would
become <hi>a Corſair;</hi> we ſilently Rowed to our
Prey, took it into the Boat with great Triumph,
we cut off her Head, and let her bleed into a
Pot; we drank the Blood, eat the Liver,
and ſuck'd the Fleſh; <hi>warm Fleſh, and hot Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi>
(except our own) had been <hi>a great Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
with us a long time, it was a Novelty of
Providence; and really it wonderfully refreſh'd
our Spirits, repaired our decayed ſtrength and
recruited Nature; at leaſt, poor exhauſted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was willing to be cheated, and fancy her
ſelf recruited: But there was no cheat in't we
were really refreſh'd, and with freſh vigour and
courage fell to our Work; we left our fears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
us, we pickt up ſome ſcatter'd crumbs of
hope, and about Noon, we Diſcovered, or
thought we Diſcovered Land. It's impoſſible
to expreſs the Joy, and Triumph of our raiſed
Souls at this apprehenſion. The Poets tell us,
that as often as <hi>Hercules</hi> threw the great Giant
againſt <hi>the Earth,</hi> his <hi>Mother Earth</hi> gave him
<hi>new ſtrength</hi> againſt the next Encounter: It was
<hi>new ſtrength, new Life</hi> to us, though <hi>not to touch</hi>
yet <hi>to ſee;</hi> or if <hi>not to ſee,</hi> to <hi>think we ſaw</hi> it.
It brought freſh Blood into our Veins, freſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
into our pale Cheeks; we look'd <hi>not</hi> like
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:110337:57"/>
Men awaked from ſleep, <hi>not</hi> like Captives broke
from the Chains of <hi>Algiers,</hi> but like Perſons
<hi>raiſed from the Dead.</hi> But <hi>Hope and Fear
made a ſtrange Medly Paſsion in our Souls;</hi> like
the Reparties of two contrary joſtling Tides, or
the ſtruggling of the Eddy with the main Stream;
Hope would perſwade us that we ſaw the Land;
but chill Fear bad us pauſe upon it, for as we
eaſily believe, what we deſire to be true, ſo
we are as ready to fear leſt it ſhould not prove
true; for fear had got long poſſeſſion of our
Souls, and would hardly admit Hope to ſtir, but
was ready to ſuppreſs it as a diſturber of its
Empire: We had ſeen nothing but Air, and
Sea; Sea, and Air in five Dayes and Nights;
that though our Reaſon tould us there was ſuch a
thing as Land, yet the Impreſſions that fear had
made upon us, made it Queſtionable, whether
ever we ſhould ſee it. And we durſt not give
too much Credence to our Eyes, that had been
uſed to bring ſadder ſtories to our Hearts.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill we wrought hard: Hope did us that
kindneſs it put us upon an earneſt deſire to ſee,
whether we were deceived or no. After ſome
further Labour, we grew more confident, and
at laſt, fully ſatisfied that it was Land: I hope
I ſhall never foeget what a ſenſe we had of Gods
goodneſs upon that Aſſurance. Extreams do
equally annoy, and ſometimes infatuate the
mind: They tell us, that in <hi>Greenland,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of Cold will make the Iron ſtick to the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:110337:58"/>
Fingers, as our Experience aſſures extremity of
Heat will do; for now like Diſtracted Perſons,
we all leapt into the Sea, quitting our Boat, and
being all good Swimmers, we there Bathed, and
cooled our heated Bodies. An Adventure,
which, if well conſidered, had as much of the
Deſperado in it as our putting to Sea: For now
we were at the Mercy of the Sharks; which
might have ſheared off a Leg, or Arm; and now
our over-heated Bodies were open to receive the
Impreſſions of that Cold Element: But as we
never conſidered our Danger, the great and
good God delivered us from the Ordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of ſuch Folly; we preſently returned to
our Boat, and being both wearied with Labour,
and cooled a little with the Sea, we lay us all
down to Sleep in as much ſecurity, as if we had
been in our own Beds: Nature being almoſt
ſpent, muſt have a Truce; ſhe will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to keep our Bodies upon their Legs, if we
will not ſubmit to her great ſtanding Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Reſt; and here we ſaw ſtill more of
Divine Goodneſs, that our Leaky Veſſel did not
bury us in the Sea, and we awaking find our
ſelves in the other World: But he that <hi>gave us
Sleep, meaſured it;</hi> and he meaſured it <hi>exactly,</hi>
not ſuffering us to <hi>out-ſleep the Seaſon</hi> of plying
our Pump, or that which ſupplyed the place of
it.</p>
               <p>Being thus refreſh'd with ſleep, we found <hi>new
ſtrength</hi> for our Work, and God found us <hi>new
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:110337:58"/>
Work</hi> for our ſtrength: We tugged the harder
at the Oar, becauſe we hoped e'er Night to ſleep
upon a more ſtable, and faithful Element. But
we made our way very ſlowly, and when we
caſt up the Account of our Progreſs, found that
we had gone but <hi>little way in a long time;</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Evening we diſcovered another Iſland:
The firſt we ſaw was <hi>Mayork,</hi> the ſecond,
<hi>Fromentere;</hi> and ſome of our Company that
had Sailed in theſe Seas, would undertake to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
us of it: We debated not long to which
of theſe we ſhould direct our Courſe, for the
latter being much infeſted with venemous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
and little, if at all Inhabited, we reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all for <hi>Mayork:</hi> All that Night we Rowed
very hard, and the next, being the ſixth of <hi>July,</hi>
and from our putting to Sea; we kept within
ſight of it all Day, and about Ten a Clock at
Night we came under the Iſland, but the Rocks
were there ſo craggy, and ſteep, that we could
not climb up.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we were under theſe Rocks there
came a Veſſel, very near us. Let the Reader put
himſelf in our ſtead, let him but Copy out our
Thoughts, let him imagine how loth we were
to loſe all our toil and Travel, to forego our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
to have this Rich Mercy, which God
had put into our Hands, wreſted out of them
again by ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Pickaroon, or <hi>Corſair,</hi>
that are alwayes skimming thoſe Seas: It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
us therefore to lye cloſe, and when they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:110337:59"/>
were paſſed by, we gently crept along the Coaſt
as near the ſhoar as we durſt, till we found a
convenient place, where we might thruſt in our
Weather-beaten Boat.</p>
               <p>If theſe Papers ſhould fall into the hands of
ſome that are great Clerks in the Art of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and have conn'd the Mariners Terms of
Art, they will ſmile at my improper wording of
theſe Maters, and ſay, I am one of <hi>Paul's</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners.
But I can be content to be Accounted
one of his Mariners, whilſt I have ſhared in his
Mercies: How many of thoſe that ſpake the
Language of the Sea, yet have found her Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
deaf to their Cries and Prayers, and their
ſtately Ships made the Scorn of Winds, and the
Reproach of Waves, when we, who had none
of their Ships, and little of their skill, have had
Experience of thoſe Providences, to which rhey
have been Strangers.</p>

from the Vice-Roy, and the Inhabitants
of that Iſland and City.</head>
               <p>WHen we were come to Land, we were
not unſenſible of our Deliverance,
though like Men newly awakened out of a
Dream, we had not the true Dimenſions of it;
We confeſſed God had done <hi>great things</hi> for us,
but <hi>how great</hi> things he had done was beyond
our Comprehenſion: We had <hi>eſcaped the Sea,</hi>
but yet Death might be found <hi>at Land;</hi> and we
were ready to ſay, with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> Judg. 15. 18.
<hi>Lord, thou haſt given this great Deliverance
into the hands of thy Servants, and now ſhall we
dye for Thirſt?</hi> We had had no Food ſince we
eat the Liver, and drank the Blood of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſe,
and therefore leaving three of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with the Boat, the other too, <hi>viz. John
Anthony,</hi> and my ſelf were ſent out to ſcout
abroad for freſh Water: And the rather were
we ſent, becauſe this <hi>John Anthony</hi> could ſpeak
both the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Tongues very
perfectly; and I had as much of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> as
might ſerve to expreſs our wants, and deſires,
if perhaps we might meet with any perſons there
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:110337:60"/>
abouts. We were not far gone, before we fell
into a Wood, and we were in a Wilderneſs in
our thoughts, which way to take: He will needs
go his way, and I mine. Good Lord! what a
frail impotent thing is Man! That they whom
common dangers <hi>by Sea,</hi> common Deliverances
<hi>from Sea</hi> had United, ſhould now about our
own wills fall out at Land. And yet thus we
did: He gave me reproachful words, and it's
well we came not to blows: But I went my own
way, and he ſeeing me reſolute, <hi>followed me,</hi>
and the Providence of God, not dealing with us
according to our frowardneſs, <hi>followed us both:</hi>
This way led us to a Watch-Tower of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
many of which they keep upon the Sea-Coaſts,
to give the Countrey timely notice of
any Pickaroons that come aſhoar to Rob, and
Spoyl.</p>
               <p>When we came within call, fearing he might
Diſcharge at us, we ſpoke to him upon the
Watch, told him our Condition, what we
were, whence we came, how we eſcaped; and
earneſtly begged of him to direct us to ſome freſh
Water, and in the mean time to beſtow upon us
ſome Bread. He very kindly threw us down
<hi>an old mouldy Cake,</hi> but ſo long as it was <hi>a Cake,</hi>
and not <hi>a ſtone,</hi> nor <hi>a Bullet,</hi> Hunger did not
conſider it's <hi>Mouldineſs:</hi> Then he directed us
to freſh Water, which was hard by? We ſtood
not telling Stories; we remembred <hi>our ſelves,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:110337:60"/>
we remembred <hi>our Brethren</hi> left with our Boat,
and obſerving the Sentinels Directions, came
to a Well, where there was a Pot with ſtrings
to draw with: We drank a little Water, and
eat a bit of our Cake, but the paſſage was ſo
diſ-uſed, that we had much ado to force our
Throats to relieve our clamourous ſtomachs:
But here we ſtaid not, but, with the four Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
in the Tents of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> 2 Kings 7. 9.
Rebuked our ſelves, <hi>We do not well, we have
glad Tidings to carry, and do we hold our peace?</hi>
We return to our Boat, are welcomed by our
Companions, acquaint them with the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of our Embaſſy, and all prepare to make
to the Well.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>we muſt leave our Boat;</hi> that <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Inſtrument</hi> of God's Providence, which had
<hi>ſo truſtily ſerved his purpoſe</hi> to deliver us: It was
not without ſome recoylings upon our Spirits,
that we ſhould ſo much as in appearance <hi>imitate
the ingratitude</hi> of thoſe, who having ſerved their
private ends on their Friends, and have now no
further uſe of them, moſt ungratefully ſhake
them off: That we ſhould be like <hi>the water-dog,</hi>
which uſes the water to purſue his Game; and
when he comes to Land, ſhakes it off as <hi>trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
and burdenſome.</hi> But it was no time to
ſtand upon Complements; Hunger, Thirſt,
Wearineſs, deſire of Refreſhment and Reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
thoſe <hi>importunate Duns,</hi> Commanded us away;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110337:61"/>
and tying our Boat as faſt as we could to the
Shoar, we left her <hi>to Mercy,</hi> which had been <hi>ſo
good</hi> to us.</p>
               <p>As we were going, or rather creeping, or
crawling towards the Well, another Quarrel
ſtarted amongſt us, the Memory whereof is
ſo ungrateful, that I ſhall give it a Burial in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
the beſt <hi>Tomb for Controverſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now we are at <hi>the Well,</hi> and the Well is
<hi>provided of Water,</hi> and we have <hi>ſomething to
draw;</hi> all <hi>theſe helps</hi> God has given us, but he
muſt give us <hi>one more,</hi> even <hi>a throat to ſwallow</hi>
it, without which, all the reſt <hi>ſignifie nothing.</hi>
This was the evil Diſeaſe <hi>Solomon</hi> had obſerved
in his Daies, <hi>Eccleſ. 6. 2. A Man to whom
God had given Riches, Wealth, and Honour,
ſo that he wanteth nothing for his Soul, of all
that he deſireth; yet God giveth him not Power
to eat thereof:</hi> He that gives us <hi>water to drink,
and meat to eat,</hi> muſt give us <hi>Power to eat and
drink</hi> alſo. How totally do we depend upon
him for Life, and Breath, and all things! One
of our Company, <hi>William Adams,</hi> attempting
to drink, after many Eſſays was not able to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, but ſtill the water returned, ſo that he
ſunk down to the Ground, faintly ſaying, <hi>I am
a dead Man?</hi> we <hi>forgot</hi> our ſelves, to <hi>remember
him,</hi> and after much ſtriving, and forcing, he
took a little; and when he and we were refreſh'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:110337:61"/>
with our Cake and water, we lay down by the
Well-ſide till the Morning. None of us could
<hi>watch for the reſt,</hi> but <hi>One God watched over us
all:</hi> There we lay lockt up, and buried in
Sleep: The Heavens covered us, when we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Canopy: Each might ſay in the Morning,
with <hi>David, Pſal. 3. 5. I laid me down and ſlept;
I awaked, for the Lord ſuſtained me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When it was clear day, we addreſt our ſelves
once more to the man upon the watch-Tower,
entreating him to direct us the ready way to
the next Houſe, or Town, where we might find
relief. He civily points us towards a Houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two Miles off, whither, with wearied ſteps,
and joyful Hearts, we now began to Travel:
Our Feet had been ſo <hi>parboyled, and quodled</hi> with
the <hi>Suns heat,</hi> in the <hi>Salt-water pickle,</hi> that
they were very raw, and more bliſter'd; and
long it was before we could overcome the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs
of thoſe two Miles. When we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
the Houſe, the Owner eſpying us, and
concluding by our <hi>ſhabby garb,</hi> that we were
ſome <hi>Pilfering Raſcals,</hi> preſented a Fowling
Piece at us, and chatged us to ſtand. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of our Company, who could ſpeak that
Language well, meekly told him, he might
ſpare that Language, we were <hi>not able</hi> if we
had ſo <hi>wicked a will;</hi> nor <hi>willing</hi> if we had been
<hi>able,</hi> to offer him the leaſt injury; That we
were a Company of poor Creatures, whom the
wonderful Providence of God had reſcued from
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:110337:62"/>
he Slavery of <hi>Algiers,</hi> and hoped he would
ſhew Mercy to the Afflicted. The honeſt Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
moved with our Relation, ſent us out
Bread, Water, and Olives, with which when
we had refreſh'd our ſelves, we lay down, and
reſted three or four hours in the Field; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
thanks for his Charity, prepared to crawl
away at our lame rate. He ſeeing us thankful
Beggers, enlarged his Civility to us, called us
into his Houſe, and gave us good warm Bean
Pottage, which ſeemed to me the moſt Pleaſant
Food that ever I eat in my Life: Our Leave
once more taken, we advanced towards the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Mayork,</hi> which from this place is about ten
Miles: No water could we meet with upon our
way, but towards Evening, we diſcoverd one
drawing water at a Well, we haſted to him,
and he drew for us; that was our Supper, and
there was our Lodging that Night.</p>
               <p>The next Morning we came iuto the Suburbs
of the City, the ſtrangeneſs of our Attire, being
bare-foot, bare-legg'd, having nothing on but
looſe Coats over our Shirts; drew a croud of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers
about us, who we were? whence we
came? whither we went? We gave them a
particular account of our Deliverance, with its
Circumſtances; and they as willing <hi>to pity,</hi> as
<hi>to know</hi> our Eſtate, and as ready <hi>to Relieve,</hi> as
<hi>pity,</hi> accommodated us for the preſent with food;
they gave us Wine, and Strong-waters, and
whatever elſe might recover our exhauſted Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110337:62"/>
but told us, we muſt be obliged to tarry
in the Suburbs, till <hi>the Vice-Roy</hi> had notice that
ſuch ſtrangers were Arrived: He had ſoon <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
of us, and we as ſoon <hi>a Command</hi> to
appear before him: He Examined us about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Affairs; what Men of War the <hi>Algerines</hi>
had at Sea? what ſtrength they were of at
Land? But above all, he was moſt curious, and
exact in ſatisfying himſelf about our Eſcape, our
Boat, our hazzards at Sea, wherein when we
had fully obeyed him, he ordered we ſhould
be maintained at his own Coſt till we could have
paſſage to our own Country.</p>
               <p>In this while the People gathered us Money
to buy us Clothes and Shooes, and we wanted
nothing that Nature called for, but <hi>thankful
Hearts to God.</hi> And they endeavoured to help
to <hi>that Mercy</hi> too: As I was walking in the
Streets viewing the City, a young Man-ſteps to
me, Friend (ſaid he) are you one of thoſe that
came lately over in the Canvas Boat? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
Yes, I was one of them: well (reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the young Man) <hi>It was not the little Boat,
but the great God that brought you Over.</hi> I muſt
needs ſay, I often think on this young man's
words, and as often as I think on them they
chide me, that I have not hitherto more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
owned God in his Gracious and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Deliverance. However others may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to read, I know not, yet I am concern'd to
Write of the great things God has done for me.</p>

corrects our <hi>preſumption</hi> on our own Inventions,
and by <hi>Both,</hi> Glorifies his own Omnipotency,
Teaching us, That in and by Him we can do

            <p>The foregoing Narrative of a Stupendious

And that which is here ſubjoin'd (referring in
diverſe Reſpects to the like Subject, tho failing
in an equal Succeſs) may ſerve as an Example
of the ſecond. And tho' our Relation abound
not in ſuch Varieties of Wonder, yet may the
ſame be of ſome Satisfaction and Uſe to the
Reader, as well for acquainting him with the
Miſeries poor Chriſtians endure under the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny

            <p>On the 25. of <hi>June 1679.</hi> we Sailed from

Captain <hi>William Stoakes</hi> Commander, bound

all which were enough one would think
to keep them in the moſt ſober frame, an Holy
Converſation and ſtrict Dependence on that
<hi>all-ſufficient</hi> Power, who <hi>alone can protect</hi> them
from ſo many immediate and <hi>Round-threatning</hi>
Dangers; But ſo incorrigibly hard and wicked
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:110337:66"/>
is the Heart of Man, that we find too many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the proſpect of all theſe Wonders and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils
utterly inſenſible; Mariners that fill their
<hi>Sails</hi> with the Breath of <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi>
and encreaſe the raging of the <hi>Sea</hi> with the
<hi>Vomits</hi> of their <hi>Surfeiting</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs;</hi> And
what can ſuch expect but <hi>ſwift Deſtruction,</hi> even
to be Swallowed up by an Ocean of <hi>Water,</hi> and
delivered over to a Deluge of everlaſting <hi>Flames?</hi>
I ſpeak this not as reflecting on our <hi>Ships Crew</hi> in
particular (wherein moſt were at leaſt <hi>Civiliz'd</hi>
Perſons) but for a General Caution; Nor yet
dare I excuſe my ſelf and our Company from
many <hi>neglects</hi> of our Duty, for which it appears
in the Sequel, God had <hi>a Controverſie with us,</hi>
whoſe Juſtice always puniſhes us, that we ſhould
<hi>not Sin,</hi> and never but <hi>for Sinning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After a week pleaſant Sailing, on the 2d. of
<hi>July</hi> at Day light, we ſaw two Ships ſtanding
towards us, and ſoon diſcovered them to be
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Men of Warr, which put us into a great
and General Conſternation, as knowing how
unprepared we were for reſiſtance, both for our
ſmall ſtrength, and for that ours was a <hi>Pesterd
Ship</hi> by reaſon of a quantity of <hi>Hay</hi> we had on
Deck and elſewhere, for a dozen Horſes we
carried with us; However we reſolv'd to Sell
our Liberty at the beſt rate we could, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to Entertain them; within an hour and
an half, one of them was came up along by our
ſide, and for the Firſt Complement fired in his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:110337:66"/>
               <hi>Broad-ſide</hi> and a luſtly Volley of <hi>ſmall Shott,</hi>
which ſhot off our <hi>Taller,</hi> and wounded us three
Men, but none mortally; Kild alſo one of our
Horſes in the <hi>Hold,</hi> and having received two
Shots more between <hi>Wind and Water,</hi> we quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had about 4 or 5 foot Water in the <hi>Hold:</hi> we
Anſwered them with our Guns, but to little
purpoſe; for having ſoon ſpent all the <hi>Powder</hi> we
had up out of our <hi>Powder-Room,</hi> and it being
Impoſſible for us at that inſtant to come at any
more; and at the ſame time perceiving the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ship almoſt with us, and that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
we ſhould make good our Defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
2 of the <hi>best</hi> Ships of <hi>Algeirs</hi> (For they
proved to be the <hi>Golden Horſe,</hi> old <hi>Canaria</hi>
Captain, and the other the <hi>Golden Roſe,</hi> young
<hi>Canaria</hi> Captain,) we thought beſt to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
for our <hi>Lives</hi> at the price of our <hi>Liberties,</hi>
and ſurrendred our Ship.</p>
            <p>Hereupon their Boat came aboard and fetcht
us all away, except two whom they left aboard
with ſome of their Turks and Moors. When
we came on Board the Turks man of Warr, the
Captain by an Interpreter inquired our Lading,
and with many menaces exacted a full Account
to the beſt of our knowledge, ſoon after they
took 2 Ships more, and ere they went off our
Coaſt, they ſurpriz'd in all 9 Ships, wherein
were about 170 Souls. And having taken the
men out, and pillag'd their pleaſure; ſome of
the Ships they <hi>Burnt,</hi> and others <hi>Sunk,</hi> having
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:110337:67"/>
not Men enough to ſpare to Man ſo many, but
three of the beſt they ſent away home; And
having now been out of the <hi>Straights</hi> near ſix
Weeks, they are afraid to venture in without
<hi>clearing</hi> their Ships, and therefore went on the
South Coaſt of Barbary to <hi>Magadore,</hi> touching
alſo at <hi>Saphe</hi> and other Towns to take in freſh
Proviſions;</p>
            <p>All this time we poor Captive Chriſtians were
put every night in <hi>Irons.</hi> The manner whereof
was thus, between 2 ſpare <hi>Top-Maſts</hi> between
the Decks placed about 6 aſunder, we ſat cloſe
to one another on each ſide, and in the middle
went a long <hi>Iron Bolt</hi> between our Shackles, ſo
that we were conſtrained to ſleep ſitting (when
the neceſſitie of Nature could Charm our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
Spirits into any kind of Repoſe;) not
being afforded Room to <hi>lye down;</hi> And the
weather being extream <hi>hot,</hi> and the place
cloſe and <hi>Sultry,</hi> we were forced to ſit naked;
The Proviſions alotted to keep us alive, (who
now began rather to Court and wiſh for <hi>Death)</hi>
was only a ſmall pittance of Bread, and ſome
Vinegar, with a few drops of Oyl, and this was
all our Allowance for 24 Hours; and that
which yet added more to our miſery was, that
they afforded us not much above <hi>a pint</hi> of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Day, ſo that thro' very extremit<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Thirſt,</hi>
we were frequently forc'd to beg and intreat
of the Moors boys, to bring us ſalt Water, and
could but <hi>ſeldome</hi> obtain that favour of them
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:110337:67"/>
neither; Nay when we were in <hi>Magadore,</hi> tho
we could (like Tantalus for our greater Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
ſee the <hi>Freſh-Water</hi> plentifully on the
ſhore, and were almoſt Dead with Drought,
in working and continual heaving in of <hi>Ballaſt,</hi>
yet we could not be allow'd but about 3 pints
for four and twenty Hours, and half of that
too, <hi>Salt</hi> or brackiſh; whereby we became ſo
faint that we could hardly ſtand on our Legs;
but it was vain to Intreat or expect any other
uſage from thoſe whoſe tendereſt <hi>Mercies</hi> were
the Extremities of <hi>Cruelly,</hi> unleſs we would have
abandon'd all fear of God, and reſpect to <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty</hi>
and the Dignity of Humane Nature, by
Condeſcending to the deteſtable ſollicitations of
their moſt unnatural Luſts, to which they were
not wanting in their curſed Importunities; ſo
that our very <hi>Souls</hi> were not free from their
Tortures; They being ſo filthy as to mix with
<hi>Brute Beaſt,</hi> having ſeen ſuch Evidences of their
abominations in that kind, with ſome Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that were on Board, as fill'd our Hearts
with horror, and are not fit to be named a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
Chriſtians: At length the Wind ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fair, they reſolv'd to Sail Homewards; but
firſt muſt perform their <hi>Oriſons;</hi> (for theſe
<hi>Filthy-Infidels</hi> at to the outward <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and
obſervances of their wicked Religion are Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<hi>Punctual;)</hi> Therefore for a <hi>Peace-Offering</hi>
to the Sea, (or whether it were to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
to ſend them an Happy paſſage, I know
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:110337:68"/>
not, they offered their Sacrifice of a <hi>Sheep,</hi>
having firſt cut in the midſt, one half they heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Over-Board</hi> on the one ſide, the other on the
other; with certain Muttering Prayers which
we underſtood not; This fit of Devotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſt, they make all the Sail they could, and
in they ſtand through the <hi>Streights-Mouth,</hi> and
in two or three days Arrived at their <hi>Deſired</hi>
Port;</p>
            <p>Nor was it <hi>undeſired</hi> by us: For as we long'd
to know the worſt of our Condition, ſo we flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
our ſelves that it muſt needs be better than
that on Board, at leaſt that there we ſhould have
<hi>Water</hi> enough, the Want of which here was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable.</p>
            <p>Being brought aſhore we were ſent to the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midore</hi>'s
Houſe, and the next day carried to
the Pallace of the <hi>Dey,</hi> Baſhaw, or King, who
by his Prerogative out of every Eight Slaves
brought in, Chuſes <hi>one,</hi> and commonly elects
the Captains, as ſuppoſing they are able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the <hi>beſt Ranſome,</hi> or if there happen to be
taken any young Lady of <hi>Extraordinary Beauty</hi>
or Youth, well Featur'd, and of a promiſing
Aſpect, theſe he ſnaps, and ſends away as moſt
<hi>Acceptable Preſents</hi> to the <hi>Grand Seignior;</hi> for
whom there is never any Redemption. The
next day about eight of us were carried into the
Market, and one or two of the Kings <hi>Slaves</hi>
with us, where about one a Clock we were led
about the Market, <hi>one by one</hi> by a <hi>Negro,</hi> who
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:110337:68"/>
in the Turkiſh Language cryed out as he went,
to this effect—<hi>Here is a brave Captain, a Mate,
a Merchant,</hi> &amp;c. (as the Perſon is quallified)
<hi>one has bid ſo much, who bids more?</hi> And when
they have been the Market round, and none will
give more, then they put him by; And ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
till all are ſold. And then they have us to
the <hi>Kings Houſe</hi> again, and if He or any elſe
there, will give more but to the value of a ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
then was bid in the Market, he ſhall have
the Slave; otherwiſe the Market Chapman
takes him, and he is thenceforth abſolutely
<hi>His,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was my hard fortune to be ſold to a <hi>Taga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reen</hi>
(or Moor, whoſe Anceſtors formerly came
out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ever ſince aſſume the Title of
that City from whence they were driven) but
his Name was <hi>Haly Hammet Ben Jejilee,</hi> and
for his Temper it was well known, for as I came
out with him from the Kings Houſe, ſeveral told
me I had got <hi>a Curſed Patroon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I was now in, <hi>for better for worſe,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him very obſequiouſly to his Houſe, where
after a day or two, I with others of his Slaves
(whereof ſeveral were Engliſh) were ſet to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dung out of a <hi>Fondack,</hi> as they call it,
being the place where Horſes, Aſſes, Mules, and
Cows and other Cattel, ſometimes to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 100 or more were kept, and alſo the place
of Slaughter, where they killed Beaſts as oft as
they had occaſion, whoſe <hi>Blood</hi> mixt with their
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:110337:69"/>
               <hi>Dung</hi> in that hot Climate, made it very noiſome
and offenſive; but we muſt not be <hi>Dainty-No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi>
but rake it up into Baskets, and carry it out
on our <hi>Heads</hi> or Shoulders, to a <hi>Dunghil</hi> at a
great diſtance.</p>
            <p>This Jobb being finiſht, we were put to work
in the <hi>Mould,</hi> abord Prizes, for ſometime, and
after that ſent to the <hi>Garden</hi> or <hi>Vineyard</hi> (for
it was both) about four miles from the Town,
where inſtead of digging with a <hi>Spade,</hi> we had
only a <hi>Chopp</hi> of 8. or <hi>10l.</hi> weight which we
were forced to work vvith at <hi>Arms-end,</hi> and I
think vvas as hard Labour as any could be,
unleſs grinding at their <hi>Silk-Mills;</hi> and if vve
<hi>Loitered,</hi> or they vvere pleaſed to think vve did
ſo, preſently vve had many blovvs on the back,
and ſides, and ſometimes on the <hi>Soles</hi> of the
feet, and our hair torn off our heads, with other
inexpreſſible Cruelties, whilſt in the mean time,
we had many times but one <hi>poor Cake</hi> of <hi>Courſe
Bread</hi> allowed us <hi>per</hi> day for our diet, and our
Lodging at night moſt hard and miſerable, for
frequently when we were in the City, we were
driven into a <hi>Naſty Cellar,</hi> where was an Houſe
of Office that ſtank intollerably; and the room
ſo ſmall, that there being near twenty of us,
it would not afford breadth or length enough
for us to <hi>Ly<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Down,</hi> but there were ſome Bords
put up and a Platoon made about thre foot from
the Ground, where ſome lay a top, and the reſt
under neath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:110337:69"/>
Thus for many long moneths we continued
as miſerable, as to this World, as 'twas poſſible
for the Envy and Cruelty of our Patroon to
make us. You need not doubt but we had often
thoughts of making our <hi>Eſcape,</hi> but the manner
how to do it, ſeemed next to impoſſible; yet as

                  </gap>ceſſity</hi> is the <hi>Mother of Invention,</hi> variety of ways
were propoſed, ſome that were men of <hi>Courage</hi>

were for taking a Boat from the Mould at
Noon-day, &amp; going away maugre all their Force,
and defying them to Catch us, but this was lookt
upon as extravagant, others had other projects;
and no ſooner was any thing offered, but it was
diſliked, for indeed all were attended with <hi>inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable
Difficulties,</hi> and yet ſo greedy were we
of <hi>Liberty,</hi> that we would <hi>Catch</hi> at any thing
that ſeemed to promiſe us that happineſs, and
ſomewhat eaſed our preſent miſeries by thoſe
pleaſing thoughts and Idaeas; which yet our
recollected Reaſon told us were <hi>vain</hi> and impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable.</p>
            <p>At length one of my Fellow-Slaves told me
of a deſign that He and ſome others had of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away, which he verily believed might be
<hi>feazible,</hi> and after he had ſworn me to Secreſy,
acquainted me, That it was by building a Boat
privately, but that they wanted ſtrength, and
an Artificer for the Work; which I undertook
to procure; The Names of us Concerned in
his Project were <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> Captain <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:110337:70"/>
Palmer,</hi> Doctor <hi>John Atwood,</hi> of <hi>London,</hi>
Captain <hi>Thomas Cheiney, William Knight</hi> of
<hi>Briſtol, Henry Bull, William Phelps, Arnold
Showel</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> Captain, Another a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whoſe name I know not, though I brought
him into the deſign; Three Spaniards, a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez
Negro,</hi> who were with us in the Garden,
and my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Matters being thus reſolved on, we applyed
our ſelves to getting of Thyme, ſome of which
we furniſht our ſelves with, out of our <hi>own</hi>
and the reſt from other Folks Gardens, in the
Night (wherein if we had been Caught, we ſhould
have had Three or 400 Baſtinadoes for Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt)
and it was almoſt a miracle, how thoſe
which lay in the Garden, <hi>viz. John Atwood</hi> and
the Spaniards, eſcaped it, the Moors lying very
thick up and down the Hedges; but at laſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much time, hazard and induſtry, we had
formed our <hi>Keel,</hi> which vvas twenty foot long,
ſix foot broad and three foot deep, and our
Timbers fitted to their places, with holes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
bored, that there ſhould not want much
knocking, when vve ſhould ſet her up <hi>for good
and all;</hi> we had likewiſe got <hi>Canes</hi> to make faſt
with <hi>Rope-yarns</hi> from Timber to Timber, as
alſo, <hi>Pitch, Tar, Tallow,</hi> and other requiſites,
For providing of which; you muſt know, that
ſome of us had ſaved privately, ſome ſmall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of money, and others being ſuffered to
work at their own hand, and follovv Trades,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:110337:70"/>
paying their <hi>Patroons</hi> ſo much a Month, got
Money, which they expended freely on this
occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the great difficulty was to get the
<hi>dreſſed Hides</hi> wherewith we intended to cover
our Boat, and to help us therein we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to Mr. <hi>Showel,</hi> who ſince his Slavery,
upon I know not what former inſight into that
Myſtery, had ſet up for a <hi>Cobler,</hi> and lived
from his <hi>Patroon</hi> under Contribution; and by
that means had the Opportunity to buy them,
which were privately convey'd into thoſe things
in which we carried Dung on the <hi>Mules,</hi> and
ſo got out of the Tovvn, and ſo ſovved up,
vvhich vvas moſt artificially performed by Mr.
<hi>Showel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bull,</hi> and the Boats covering
moſt conveniently prepared, and all things
hid in parcells near the Sea-ſide ready for the
Voyage.</p>
            <p>Hitherto things going on thus fairly, and
every one of our <hi>Cabal</hi> expecting no leſs than
Liberty, the very day appointed for our going
away at Evening being come, and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Bread and Water and other Neceſſaries
for that purpoſe. It happen'd our <hi>Patroon</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who had not been in the Garden for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
did, by I know not what ill-Fortune,
or rather as to me <hi>good Providence,</hi> come into
the Garden, of whoſe approach a Spaniard ſet
for <hi>a Spye,</hi> gave them notice, ſo that they had
time enough <hi>to hide</hi> their things which they
were preparing that night to ſet together, but

ſome of them being found rambling, were ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

our <hi>Patroon</hi> vvere not Friends, and ſo the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
never came to his Ear.</p>
            <p>Therefore this Diſappointment of the loſs
of our Timber did not vvholly diſcourage, but
got others and framed them, and had brought
all things again to perfection, vvhen once more
our project vvas Interrupted, and by other
hands and in an untimely manner put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>For about the latter end of <hi>November 1681</hi>
there came from other Gardens 2 Dutchmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a Spaniard and ſome others; Who, by I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
gueſs, what means, being acquainted with

our Deſigns, and the forwardneſs we were in,
they Ingratiated themſelves with the Spaniards
that lay in our Garden, and agree with them
forthwith to make uſe of this Expedient for
their Eſcape, And thereupon they threaten
<hi>John Atwood,</hi> who alſo lay there, that if He
would not Conſent and go with them, they
would forthwith Kill him to prevent his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Poor Mr. <hi>Atwood</hi> was loth to abandon his
Friends, and Rob them of that means which
they ſo long and with ſuch Danger and Charge
had been Contriving to leave them behind, and

Next morning 'twas my lot vvith one of my
Fellovv Slaves to be ſent into the Garden, but
finding no body there, and quickly perceiving
other Symptomes, I concluded they vvere gone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But Oh! hovv much <hi>anger</hi> did I ſvvell vvith
againſt them for leaving me behind, (for as yet
I underſtood not the Truth, tho aftervvards I
did, from the before-mentioned Engliſh-man
that came too late,) and vvhat an Exceſs of
Grief and ſorrovv did poſſeſs me for not going
vvith them; vvhen yet this very thing which
I ſo much fretted my ſelf about, was to me the
the moſt <hi>eminent Mercy</hi> of Providence; for thoſe
that went off, were <hi>never any of them heard of,</hi>
ſo that 'tis Juſtly ſuppoſed they were <hi>all lost</hi>
and caſt away: And as for me that vvas left
behind, vvithin ſix vveeks after, my <hi>Ranſome-Money</hi>
came from <hi>England,</hi> being 400 pieces of
Eight, beſides 218 for Charges, and ſo I ſafely
returned to my Native Countrey; For vvhich
Gratious Providence of God, as I hope I ſhall
never forget to return him continual thanks
from the Centre of my Soul, ſo I thought it no
leſs than my Duty to give this Publique Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of my Gratitude to that Divine and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorable
Power to whom be all praiſe, Glory,
and Honour both now and for Ever-more.</p>
