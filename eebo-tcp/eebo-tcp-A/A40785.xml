            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF we had been born only for our ſelves, or all our concerns were entire between God and our own Souls; to live ignorant of, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the World, would make up a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhare of our preſent negative happineſs: and put a bar betwixt us and thoſe griefs, which enter ſo plentifully (beſide other paſſages) by the eyes, and ears. But above all men, he that is ſo hardy as to peep out of the Preſs, doth run the Gante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope; and expoſes himſelf to the ſcourge of tongues. And let his Work be ever ſo worthy, or unworthy; he is like to taſte both of the good, and bad report. Of which kind this undertaking of mine is, or of what degree in either, is not ſo much mine, as yours (now) to judge.</p>
            <p>'Tis rare to find a Work pretending to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> whoſe Author doth not warrant it with a Call from God: yea, though it be vain, frivolous, or trite, or (which is worſe) of a direct contradiction to its pretendments; even the unhinging of the moſt important Truths, and perverting ſo far as prevailing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31145:3"/>I am not very willing to trouble the Reader, with a Hiſtory of the production of this Diſcourſe; it being little material <hi>how</hi> it came to paſs, but <hi>much</hi> to what purpoſe: which is all that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of conſideration to the Reader. Yet I will venture the vindication of my ſelf from the itch of writing, ſo far as to tell my Reader; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a common view of the evils herein diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and oppoſed; the attempts that have been made by the men of my preſent Controverſie, upon thoſe Quarters to which the Providence of God hath aſſigned me, hath given me ſome more than ordinary advantage in the knowledge of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>I have with ſome regret obſerved, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, troubleſomneſs, and diſorder of theſe kind of Adverſaries; have been taken for a ſufficient indempnity, and excuſe to the more able Pens, from ſtooping to ſuch an undertaking as this: except ſome few, who have well detected and ſmitten ſome of the Heads of this monſtrous <hi>Hydra.</hi> I have reaſon therefore to conclude, they will excuſe me from preſumption, in attempting (what they have omitted) both <hi>root,</hi> and <hi>branch</hi> at once.</p>
            <p>Certainly all Souls are precious, and ſuch a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt as becomes the utmoſt diligence of the moſt excellently qualified of the Lords Labourers. Our dear Redeemer came not to ſave only the wiſe, the prudent, the rich, and the honourable; but their Souls alſo, whoſe Cabinets are covered with Rags, and whoſe intellects cannot taſte, and are much beneath School-niceties: of which number are the far greater part of thoſe to whom the
<pb facs="tcp:31145:3"/>
Goſpel is ſent, and to whoſe capacities the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God hath vouchſafed to accommodate the more material parts of it.</p>
            <p>He is a great ſtranger in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not the great ſhoals that have been taken in the net of Quakeriſm, eſpecially in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where Miniſters in good earneſt for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſoundneſs in Faith, and holineſs in Life, are but thinly ſown: yea, and in the great City of <hi>London</hi> alſo, where means are not wanting, but as great Lights ſhining as the preſent World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys: if perſons were but humble, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly faithful, there would not be one Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker there.</p>
            <p>But what if in Country, and City alſo; men ſlight their advantages? and will rather follow an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> that meets them in their wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or ſome dark-lanthorn-man that ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiouſly impoſe his diſſervice; than to be at the pains of opening their eyes, and walking by the Scripture light, and directions, miniſtred by thoſe, whom the Lord hath gifted for, and called to that worthy (yet painful and reproached) imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? ſhall they be ſo tetchy, or ſo ſtately; as to leave them to the perdition of their own ſloath, and folly? our Lord and Maſter bids us to <hi>go out</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 14. 23.</note> 
               <hi>into the high-wayes, and hedges, and compell them to come in.</hi> O let it never be ſaid, (and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly) that Satan and his deluded, and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Inſtruments, are more induſtrious, and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to <hi>deſtroy,</hi> than we are to <hi>ſave</hi> the precious Souls of men! Sure I am, our work is more <hi>righteous,</hi> and our reward will be more <hi>rich</hi> than theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31145:4"/>By how much the more trifling thoſe devices are, by which they are ruined; ſo much the more inexcuſable are we, if we endeavour not their ſecurity. Our work will not be valued by our Lord, altogether by the parts laid out therein; but alſo (and much more) by the faithfulneſs, tendency, and bleſſed effects. I am debtor (ſaith<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 14.</note> the great Apoſtle) to the wiſe, and to the unwiſe. Our Lord Jeſus, the great High Prieſt of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; hath pity on the ignoranr, and thoſe who are out of the way. Many who need our help herein, deſire (and it may be deſerve) it not; but God who needs it not, both deſerves, and commands it.</p>
            <p>If any ſhall ſay, that it is not fit we ſhould write againſt the Principles of any, who fall under the ſame condemnation, or ſtand by the ſame favour with our ſelves: let ſuch know, that Theft is not the more juſt or amiable, nor we to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to it; becauſe two Thieves were cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the ſame time, and on the ſame Croſs with the juſt and holy One. Nor yet is a Dunghil the more to be embraced becauſe the Sun ſhines on it, at one and the ſame time, wherein the Meadows, and Gardens are refreſhed by its beams.</p>
            <p>And it is far from our Duty, or Charity to be ſo cruelly friendly, as not at all times to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of thoſe who ſtand free from the ſtains of ſuch Errors; and the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of thoſe who are faln into them, by Spiritual, and rational weapons: which will wound none, but thoſe who love their guilt, and darkneſs rather than light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31145:4"/>Moreover, were this Treatiſe an intermedler with differences of leſs than a Fundamental im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, there might be ſome room for the pleas of unity, and forbearance; to ſuperſede thoſe of (meer) verity: but when it concerns the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion as ſuch; thoſe Errors which will as certainly damn as adhered to; which would render the Holy Scriptures unneceſſary and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; the blood of Chriſt, Prophets, Apoſtles, and Martyrs to be Childiſhly laviſh'd away: and all the warm diſputes of ſerious Chriſtians about the more weighty parts of the mind of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Scriptures, to be but <hi>vain</hi> janglings of men, contending who ſhould hit that <hi>white;</hi> which, when done, would not be a Prize of a half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny value: yea, when it concerns thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Errors, which would blot out, and ſtrikes directly at Chriſtianity, and would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heatheniſm (diveſted of its more noble and rational parts) the higheſt perfection to be aimed at by mankind in this world; and the life to come, a fancy dwindled away to a juſt nothing.</p>
            <p>It muſt be more than juſtifiable in the eyes of all men, except theirs; whoſe Sceptiſm, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in matters of a Religious concern, is arrived to that perfection, as to have them all equally doubtful, or acceptable to them.</p>
            <p>The Doctrines of Chriſtianity common to men called Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, Congregational, Anabaptiſts; are no farther here concerned, than vindicated. And for Worſhip and Order, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is here agitated to the reproach, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of any; who are not againſt all things
<pb facs="tcp:31145:5"/>
called (by ſome reproachfully, and as ignorantly) Forms.</p>
            <p>To be contentious is an offence the Scripture condemns, with no little keenneſs; whiles it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to contend <hi>earneſtly for the Faith, once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Saints:</hi> from which <hi>I</hi> conclude, that though I contend againſt Quakeriſm with ſome ſymptoms of zeal, I am not therefore conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: neither can I eſteem it the part of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to look on the deplorable eſtate of thoſe, wounded both in head and heart with this diſeaſe; and like the Prieſt and Levite in the Parable; paſ; by on the other ſide, as unconcern'd: nor yet to ſtand gazing with a ſeeming amazement, and all the help I afford to them, to be only to cry out Unclean! Unclean! whiles they who hear theſe clamors, and whoſe ſoul-humours prepare them for the infection, are not thereby one whit the more ſtartled at their danger.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved that of the ſort laſt mentioned, are thoſe Profeſſors eſpecially; whoſe Judgments are very weak, and their Conceits very ſtrong: who have <hi>obſtinately</hi> reſolved into many ſins, and eſpecially thoſe of omiſſion; as, attending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly on the Ordinances of Chriſt, Family Worſhip, and ſerious Inſtructions of thoſe under their Charge; contrary to the plain mind of God, revealed in his Word; the ſerious and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſolicitings, and intreaties of their Teachers; and the checks of their own Conſciences: to ſalve all have faln into Quakeriſm; whereby their pride, conceit, idleneſs, covetouſneſs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect have been adopted into, and made a part of their Religion it ſelf; and thereby they have
<pb facs="tcp:31145:5"/>
ſecured themſelves from thoſe batteries, which were before ſomewhat wounding, and grievous to them.</p>
            <p>And it is no leſs matter of lamentation, that the far greater number of men and women, are ſo groſly ignorant in the things of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of their eternal concernments, that brutiſh ſenſuality, and the examples of a ſottiſh benighted world, are the only Compaſſes they ſteer the courſe of their lives by. So that, when they are by any means prevailed with to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to conſider the things of their everlaſting Peace; they know not which way to turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the way of God is dark before them; in which they are ſo little inſtructed, that they know not their <hi>right</hi> hand from their <hi>left.</hi> They are eaſily convinced, that the way to Heaven lyes not thorow drunkenneſs, ſwearing, lying, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, injuſtice, and ſuch plain and reproachful Vices. Religious they muſt, and are willing to be: but, without the ſpecial, and almoſt miraculous guidance of the good Spirit of the Lord, they are moſt likely to fall in with the groſſeſt deluſions; and mend their conditions at no better rate, than removing out of one quarter of the Devils Kingdom, into another far more dangerous; and wherein they may more peaceably, and confidently go down to the Chambers of death. And when this is done, Satan and they are agreed, all is quiet again; and the poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed vanquiſhed Souls triumph, as the only Victors.</p>
            <p>And it is no wonder that thoſe ſhould have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed preſent peace, who know no <hi>God</hi> above
<pb facs="tcp:31145:6"/>
that they call the <hi>Light in their Conſciences;</hi> whiles they comply with its <hi>dictates,</hi> how leud and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous ſoever they be. Let ſuch ſeriouſly weigh theſe two Texts of Scripture: <hi>But if thine eye be</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 23.</note> 
               <hi>evil, thy whole body ſhall be full of darkneſs; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the light that is in thee be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs! I know nothing by my ſelf, yet</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 4.</note>

            <p>Thoſe Hiſtories that have derived to us the knowledge of thoſe Errors, and Hereſies that ſprang up among profeſſed Chriſtians in ſeveral places and ages, have not been accounted ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, nor their reſpect worn out in many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years continuance; how much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſhould we be, to have the knowledge of thoſe born in our own age, and (which is more dolorous) brought forth in our own bowels, the Land of our birth and abode? but worſt of all, one, ſuch a Monſter, which hath devoured (almoſt) all the reſt, and digeſted them into one body with a vaſt addition: a Monſter! whoſe deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt alway be concluded with an <hi>&amp; caetera,</hi> as Geographers leave a ſpace for the <hi>Terra in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, I believe, that this piece, is as full a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Tenets, as any that have come forth with the like Proofs out of their own Authors; which hath coſt me more pains to collect, and underſtand, and digeſt into ſome order, than their confutation. Though, I ſuppoſe, who reads the Book thorow, will find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of advantage, more than meerly concerns <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31145:6"/>I confeſs, the Book hath exceeded in <hi>bulk</hi> my firſt intentions, and indeed, I found, after I had launched a little into the work, that <hi>the way of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 10. 23.</note> 
               <hi>man is not in himſelf, it is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps.</hi> I was launched into ſuch an Ocean for vaſtneſs, and ſaw ſo many Rocks in my paſſage, that I could not ſatisfie my own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſend this into the world; without clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>difficulties:</hi> which for all my <hi>honeſt</hi> Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and <hi>downright</hi> Confutation; might wrack the Faith of many a Soul. I ſhould be glad to ſee ſo publique a Chriſtian Spirit, as to be at the Charge of Printing many thouſand ſmall Pieces of four or five ſheets, fitted to the genius of the meaneſt capacities, and diſtributed over the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>gratis:</hi> which might diſcover the Principles of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to the ſecuring of many: who being entangled with their outward appearance, and profeſſion (in <hi>words</hi>) of the great and main Principles of Chriſtianity, are ſoon enſnared <hi>paſt</hi> recovery; without an extraordinary good hand of God. And I doubt not ſome will be found who are well acquainted with their Tenets, and evaſions; who will willingly undertake (by Gods aſſiſtance) the writing of what might be ſerviceable that way. By this courſe have the Quakers more encreaſed in the Country, than by all others; for where you ſhall find <hi>one</hi> ſheet againſt them, you may find a hundred of their <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> which are generally put into their hands by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> at the <hi>cheap</hi> rate of <hi>accepting:</hi> though poyſon taken into the <hi>Body,</hi> and deluſions into the <hi>Soul,</hi> are ever dear and coſtly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31145:7"/>But to the unwillingly miſtaken, among the people <hi>called Quakers;</hi> and ſuch whoſe inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are towards their Principles, and Practices, known by the name of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> I do ſolemnly profeſs, That I have the witneſs of God, and my own Conſcience; that <hi>I</hi> heartily deſire the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and Salvation of all ſorts of men, whatever notions they fall under, and however diſobliging in their carriages towards <hi>me</hi> in particular. And although, <hi>I</hi> hope, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not <hi>juſtifie</hi> the Opinions called Quakeriſm till <hi>I</hi> dye; yet <hi>I</hi> am perſwaded there are many called Quakers, whom the Lord will turn from their way, (which is not Chriſts) and ſanctifie them by his Spirit, and juſtifie them through his Grace, by Jeſus Chriſt: even that Chriſt, who, as God, is every where, and, as Man, is aſcended above the viſible Heavens and Skies. If ſincere proteſtations of my righteouſneſs, and ſincerity in this matter; and the verity of what <hi>I</hi> have written would prevail with you, my Spirit is clear, and <hi>I</hi> doubt not but my Pen might be as ſerviceable to it; as ſome of thoſe whoſe intereſt is <hi>too great</hi> in <hi>you.</hi> Yea <hi>I</hi> know not that <hi>ſuffering I</hi> might embrace without <hi>ſinning</hi> againſt God, but for Chriſt ſake and yours <hi>I</hi> ſhould not <hi>long</hi> to be baptized with. <hi>I</hi> beg of you in the bowels of a Chriſtian, that you would not ſlight the Truth, and Scripture-evidence here preſented to your view. The Quakers have no Miracles to bind you to their perſwaſion, and ſure the Truths contained in the Scripture, and right reaſon; may match all other viſible demonſtrations. You venture hard, to Father all your Opinions on the <hi>immediate inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;</hi> and your affections and practices on the
<pb facs="tcp:31145:7"/>
               <hi>motions</hi> of that Spirit, who is God: which if it prove to be otherwiſe, (which will be as certainly as God is Truth) your <hi>early</hi> repentance may be accepted; but your <hi>late</hi> repentance will make little for your comfort: <hi>I</hi> would not then be in <hi>your</hi> condition for more <hi>Worlds</hi> than there are Stars in the Firmament. <hi>I</hi> beſeech you do not think that God hath given you the <hi>reaſon of men,</hi> to be ſerviceable to you only in the affairs of <hi>this</hi> world; and not to be exerciſed at all in diſcerning <hi>truth</hi> from <hi>error, good</hi> from <hi>evil;</hi> of a Spiritual and <hi>Religious</hi> nature. The <hi>new</hi> creature, is the creature <hi>renewed;</hi> that is, Body, Soul, and Spirit ſo <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,</hi> as to know God in Chriſt; ſo <hi>ſanctified,</hi> as to be devoted to him, in whatever ſervice he ſhall command, and to make a Heaven of nothing on this ſide the full Viſion, and enjoyment of his favour, and glorious preſence in the other world, or the world to <hi>come,</hi> and what will <hi>neceſſarily</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from thence.</p>
            <p>If you think me too ſmart in ſome paſſages in the Book, be pleaſed to conſider; if againſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> it is againſt thoſe your <hi>miſleaders,</hi> who are to be blamed at a ſharper rate than good <hi>Eli</hi> chid his Sons, and was therefore rebuked by God to the breaking his <hi>heart,</hi> his <hi>neck,</hi> and the loſs of a great priviledge beſides: if againſt <hi>ſayings</hi> or <hi>opinions,</hi> I have fully proved them <hi>groſs</hi> falſhoods, fooliſh and pernicious luſts and errors: and I know not how to call <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>poyſon,</hi> by <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>lovely</hi> names.

The tearms Quakeriſm, Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Quaker, Chriſtian explained.

               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. II.</hi> The beginning of Quakeriſm compared with the beginning of Chriſtianity, with reſpect to the manner, and with reſpect to the time of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; from both, Quakeriſm proved to be no Chriſtianity, or not the Chriſtian adminiſtration.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. III.</hi> Proving the Quakers denying the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old and New Teſtament to be the word of God, that the intent is more than a meer verbal matter, that this is the gate and inlet of their other errors, the grounds of their denying it to be the word of God, all of which are examined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, the definition of a word, and the Scriptures proved to be the word of God (of that ſpecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended about) more properly than Chriſt the Son of God is the word of God, the Scripture proved to be the word of God by its own undeniable evidence, where it cannot be underſtood of any other than the written word, denying the Scripture to be the word of God, proved a denying of the Scripture, the titles the Quakers give to the Scriptures examined, and proved (though taken altogether) to come
<pb facs="tcp:31145:9"/>
ſhort of a fit and diſtinct character of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the ends and neceſſity of the Quakers deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture this title, for the ſupport of their other fancies. The ſenſe we take the Scripture to be the word of God in, the written word proved to be the word of God.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. IV.</hi> The Quakers equal their own writings and ſayings with the word of God, and prefer them before the word of God. So to do proved a denying the Scripture, that they do ſo proved by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them infallible, that they ſpeak and write by immediate inſpiration, that the Spirit of God dwells in them eſſentially and in all his divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and Chriſt ſpeaks out of them as through a Trunk. Proved by the characters they give of their own writings and ſayings, beyond and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the characters afforded by them to the holy Scriptures. Infallibility explained, the Quakers infallibility confuted by divers mediums, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſpiration conſidered and confuted, the woful and abſurd conſequences of this error, the Papiſts foundations of their orders and groſſeſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities; and the foundation of the Quakers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion proved to be the ſame thing, and inſtances given on both ſides. <hi>viz.</hi> contempt of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as inſufficient, infallibility, and immediate revelations, and divine inſpirations; the Quakers proved to have the blackeſt marks of Antichriſt upon them.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. V.</hi> The Quakers deny the Scriptures to be a rule of faith and life, or a Judge and determiner in religious controverſies. This charge proved to be a denying the Scriptures. That charge it ſelf prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Herein they agree with the Jeſuites. That
<pb facs="tcp:31145:9"/>
whatever is by the Lord affirmed in the Scripture ought to be believed. That what is there in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and not repealed) ought to be obeyed. That the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures do (in their kind) determine contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of a Religious concern. That the Teachings, motions, and determinations of the Spirit of God by the Scripture, are more ſuitable to the nature and preſent condition of man, and more certain to his knowledge, than any immediate teachings which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enjoy in our days. The conſequence of this error.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. VI.</hi> The Quakers take men off from reading the Scriptures, and looking into them for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and comfort. The charge proved, 1. directly, 2. by their affirming the light within every man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient as a Teacher, 3. by their affirming the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be within, 4. by their affirming the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to have no light in them, each of theſe confuted and explained in their order.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. VII.</hi> The Quakers affirm the doctrines, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, promiſes, holy examples expreſſed in the Scriptures, (as ſuch) not to be at all binding to us. That this is a denying of the Scripture, proved. That they are guilty of the charge, proved; and their error confuted. That we are to follow the good examples there expreſſed, proved; and the manner <hi>how,</hi> that we may not ſin on that hand. The ill conſequences of the error charged on the Quakers.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. VIII.</hi> That the Quakers deny the Scriptures to be any means by which we may come to know God, Chriſt, or our ſelves, proved, and confuted in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The wicked &amp; abſurd conſequences of this error.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. IX.</hi> The Quakers affirm the Scriptures to be no means whereby to reſiſt temptation, and that they are dangerous to be read. The charge proved, and
<pb facs="tcp:31145:10"/>
that it is a denying of the Scriptures. <hi>William Pen</hi> rebuked for aſſerting this falſhood.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. X.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the Scriptures to be read to any profit, farther than they are beforehand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced by thoſe that read them.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. XI.</hi> They render the Spirit of God, and the letter of the Scriptures in direct oppoſition each to other.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. XII.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> hold it to be a ſin, and the ſin of Idolatry, to believe and live according to the inſtructions and examples expreſſed by the Letter of the Scriptures, except we have them by immediate revelation or inſpiration, and at firſt hand as the Apoſtles received them.</item>

               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. XIII.</hi> The Quakers deny and ſubvert all the Ordinances of the Goſpel. An apologie for, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Goſpel Ordinances as ſuch. The Quakers proved to deny Goſpel Ordinances in general. That they deny and ſubvert the Goſpel Miniſtry proved, the grounds of their denying the Miniſtry, becauſe mediate, preaching out of the Scriptures, taking maintenance, ſtudying for their Sermons, that none can ſpeak the truth <hi>truly</hi> but from immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. All theſe grounds overthrown in their order. They deny a Goſpel Church, what Church they own, and what Miniſtry, what a Goſpel Church is, and to what ends.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. XIV.</hi> The Quakers deny the Ordinance of hearing the Word preached. They diſown Goſpel Prayer. In their Families and at Meals altogether. Pray in publick not miniſterially. Deny premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Prayer. Owne no Prayer, but what is by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb facs="tcp:31145:10"/>
inſpiration and motion. They pray not in the name of Chriſt or any Mediator. All theſe proved, and refuted in their places. The Quakers deny reading and meditating in the Scriptures. An apologie for poſitive or ſacramental Ordinances. The Quakers deny all Water-Baptiſm. What Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm they owne. The grounds on which they deny Baptiſm conſidered and refuted. They deny the Lords Supper to be now an Ordinance. The grounds of their denial. An account of their ridiculous fancies, which they call the Lords Supper.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. XV.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the tranſactions of Chriſt when manifeſted in the fleſh 1600 years ſince, and what he doth now at the right hand of God in Heaven, to have any influence into our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſalvation. The influence of Chriſts active and paſſive obedience conſidered, and objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwered. What the righteouſneſs is, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are, as they ſay, juſtified by, and aſcribe ſalvation to.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. XVI.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> diſown and deny the Chriſt of God, and ſet up a falſe Chriſt in his room and ſtead; and attribute all that to their falſe Chriſt, which is due to the true Chriſt. Theſe abundantly proved. What Chriſt they owne as God and as man. Thoſe Texts of Scripture on which they chiefly build their great deluſion, opened largely, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſervice.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Ch. XVII.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> are groſs Idolaters, &amp; <hi>Quaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> groſs Idolatry. Abundantly proved by their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſe Gods; <hi>viz.</hi> The Light in every man, the Souls of men and the Spirits of men. Theſe Charges abundantly proved, and that theſe are no Gods proved plainly. The <hi>Quakers</hi> proved to worſhip (and
<pb facs="tcp:31145:11"/>
that according to their own profeſſed principles) falſe Gods.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. XVIII.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the reſurrection of the dead. Their Evaſions diſcovered. Their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions anſwered. The conſequences of their errour.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. XIX.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> do not profeſs a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward after the diſſolution of the frame of ſoul and body: but are as to that, either deeply ſilent, or imply their contempt of ſuch a belief.</item>

                     <p>The Chriſtian Religion or Chriſtianity was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> by the preaching of the promiſed Meſſias to be come into the world; whoſe humane Perſon was pointed at by <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and viſible to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes of a multitude of beholders. <hi>The next day</hi> John <hi>ſeeth</hi> Jeſus <hi>coming unto him, and ſaith, Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the World: This is he of whom I ſaid, after me cometh a man which is preferred before me, for he was before me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> was introduced by preaching a Chriſt<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> within every man, born within every man, which was never ſeen with the bodily eyes of any man; and this Teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> concerning the true Chriſt pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the maintaining of their feigned Chriſt.</p>

whom you are looking for without you, and put his day far off from you; and ſo you live in want of him, and know not how to come to him, nor the place where to find him; but live in the dreamings, and night-viſions, and have a talk of him, and what he hath done for you, and ſo ſpend your precious time in ſlumbring and dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>This Quakers Text will bear a large Comment, but I will take notice of that only which is to the preſent purpoſe: here is preached a Chriſt within, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to, and contempt of a Chriſt without, which <hi>John</hi> preached, and that faith and hope of the Saints, (which according to the Scripture are the ſubſtance of things not ſeen, and the evidence of things hoped for)<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> reproached as a ſlumbring fancy, and a nocturnal dream. But if you would infallibly be convinced of the groſs darkneſs wherewith this ſort of men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted, or their palpable knavery and impudence in abuſing the Holy Scripture, weigh the following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance out of the preceding Author.</p>

                     <p>Chriſtianity made its way not only by the truth<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> and purity of its doctrine; but alſo by ſuch and ſo many ſignes and wonders wrought before multitudes, as were convincing to its moſt malicious and prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced adverſaries, and that not only by Chriſt himſelf but alſo by his diſciples and ſervants, both before and after his death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And all bare him witneſs, and wondred at the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words which proceeded out of his mouth,</hi> Luke 22. 4. but men may ſpeak many good words, and yet both ſay and do at other times bad enough: but Chriſt appeals to the faces of his worſt Adverſaries; <hi>If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil,</hi> John 18. 23 But if forcible right words would not make way, Chriſt exhorts them to believe for the very works ſake; and theſe were not ordinary works or wonders, and miracles neither: <hi>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had ſin.</hi> And as himſelf, ſo his ſervants introduced Chriſtianity with the ſame holy pomp and ſtate of the Mighty, and miraculous works of the Power of God, bearing witneſs to the truth of their doctrine.</p>

                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:31145:18"/>
Chriſtianity, will ſave me much of the labour of proving (in this place) when it began to take place. I know none that aſſert Heatheniſm, or the ſtate of the Saints before the flood, or of the Patriarchs after the flood, or the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Adminiſtration to be (in a proper and ſtrict ſenſe) Chriſtian: except ſome of the Quakers, who date it from the reign of the light within (their only Chriſt) and will needs have not only Jewes, but Heathen, (and eſpecially <hi>Adam</hi> in innoceney to be) under that diſpenſation: yet I doubt not to prove both from Scripture, and alſo from their own Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings by neceſſary conſequence, that Chriſtianity is not ſo old as the forementioned, nor yet ſo young as <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some (though but few) date Chriſtianity from the<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> Birth of Chriſt: Others, with much more reaſon, from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, when he had finiſhed his Tranſaction for the merit of our ſalvation in the Perſon of God-Man; and from that Declaration he made of the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Power committed to him, <hi>Matth. 28. 18. All Power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all agree (who make any diſtinction) that it began immediately upon the abrogation and diſſolution of the Moſaical Adminiſtration and Temple-Worſhip; which was above ſixteen hundred years ſince, although (as the Scripture ſpeaks) <hi>The Diſciples were called Chriſtians firſt at</hi> Antioch, Acts 11. 26. But the thing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity might well be before the name Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſo ſhort a ſpace. And that the Chriſtian-Name had about that time its Beginning,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31145:19"/>
appears by the reply of <hi>Agrippa</hi> to <hi>Paul, Almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian,</hi> Acts 28. 8. which then, it ſeems, was the common appellation of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Profeſſors of the Faith of Chriſt; but if all this will not convince, I will adde one Text more to make down-weight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Yet if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed?</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 16.</p>
                     <p>Here Chriſtianity is diſtinguiſhed both from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm</hi> and <hi>Judaiſm.</hi> Both the Gentiles and the Jews were bitter enemies to the Chriſtian Name; and that not for the Name but the things ſake; the Gentiles for their denying Idol-worſhip, the Jews for their deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moſaical Conſtitution; the Gentiles for their only worſhipping the only true God, the Jews for worſhipping the true God, by, and through Jeſus Chriſt the Mediatour. <hi>And I, brethren, if I yet preach Circumciſion, why do I yet ſuffer perſecution? then is the offence of the Croſs ceaſed,</hi> Gal. 5. 11.</p>
                     <p>Having adjuſted the entrance of Chriſtianity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> the world in point of time; let us now compare Notes whether it agree with the Birth of Quakeriſm. I know but of two Arguments (ſuch as they be) upon which they build their Antiquity, and by both of them they date their Chriſtianity, either from <hi>Adam</hi> or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. The firſt is from Chriſt the Light who was in the Beginning with God. But if they make the being of their Chriſtianity commenſurate with the being of Chriſt as God: I confeſs, 'tis but folly for any other to number days with it. But beſides the notorious abſurdity of this Fancy at firſt view, to thoſe that dream not waking: I have already proved, that Chriſtianity had a beginning, and that long ſince the Creation.</p>
                     <p>The other Argument is from Inſpirations, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate<note place="margin">§. 4.</note>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:31145:19"/>
teaching; which next to the light within is the main principle of Quakeriſm.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, by way of grant and conceſſion; that there was immediate teaching and revelation very early in the world: but that wherever and whenever there was immediate teaching, then and there was Chriſtianity: is a thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that men who have better skill in the Scriptures, and more uſe of their reaſon then they, will be aſhamed to attempt the proof of.</p>
                     <p>But if it were granted, That Inſpirations divine and immediate, did conſtitute Chriſtianity; and that all who are, or were thereby conducted are to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtians: it will be long enough ere the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers prove they are the perſons, and not long before I have proved that they are not; as will appear when you come to that point handled at large in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
                     <p>But beſide the notoriouſneſs of the Quakers novelty,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> I ſhall fully prove it from their own Aſſertions; and if they oppoſe one another, let them look to that, and agree among themſelves as well as they can. <hi>It is now</hi>

But they have another opinion of it, or they would not call it blaſphemy to be otherwiſe minded; and we ſhall finde it ere I have done, to be their forelorn Hope; by which they attempt to make a breach of the Authority and eſteem the Scripture hath juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the hearts of all ſerious Chriſtians; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with more eaſe and ſecurity to enter the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and groſs of their deluſions; and therefore I ſhall encounter it firſt and in good earneſt.</p>
                     <p>It will be neceſſary before I proceed, to let you<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> know what we intend by the phraſe, that <hi>the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the VVord of God:</hi> that you may know know what we hold and contend for, though they know not what they contend againſt: except the vain ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own begetting.

                     <p>On the other hand, we dare not call them a dead<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> letter, (who have felt them <hi>ſharper then any two-edged ſword,</hi> and taſted them <hi>ſweeter then the honey or the honey-comb</hi>) nor yet Ink and Paper-Divinity, or meerly the words and works of men: Theſe are too low an opinion of them.

                     <p>Now that the Scriptures are the <hi>VVord</hi> of God in the<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> ſenſes aforeſaid, I ſhall vindicate from the violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions of the <hi>Quakers.</hi> They have theſe three Objections againſt this truth.</p>
                     <p>1. That it is improper ſo to call them, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>VVord</hi> of God.</p>
                     <p>2. That many things or ſayings contained in them were ſpoken by wicked men or the devil.</p>
                     <p>3 That this Title is peculiar to Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, they deny them to be the Word of God in the<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> ſingular number. I muſt therefore in dealing with this great Criticiſm, reconcile the plural number to the ſingular.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, it ſounds methinks very harſhly, that not one word in the Scripture ſhould be the VVord of God, becauſe there are in them more words then one. Surely, if the firſt, 2, 3, 4, and ſo on, be the VVord of God, then every word in it is the VVord of God: and never the leſs, but rather the more for being united; for that there are few ſingle words, which ſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone will ſignifie any thing, whereas divers put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, have a ſenſe and ſignification. And the whole body of the Scripture conſidered together, doth ſignifie the mind of God more compleatly, then if it were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31145:23"/>
diſmembred and conſidered apart.</p>
                     <p>But I know they aim at more then a meer<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> Grammar-nicety, at which kind of failings they uſe not much to quarrel, but are rather affected with them, as if the Spirit of God delighted in real nonſenſe, though I think the cauſes to be three eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; Firſt, that their firſt Authors could ſpeak or write no better; and they take it to be apefection to write falſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> and nonſenſe after ſuch infallible perſons; Secondly, becauſe they have ſo few of thoſe they call their Miniſtry able to write true ſenſe and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> that thoſe who can if they liſt will not, leſt they ſhould diſgrace their brethren; and rather then that it ſhould be admitted, it ſhall become the faſhion, and obtain in time to be better <hi>Engliſh</hi> then ſenſe. A third reaſon may be their taking all, matter and form, to be infallibly from the Spirit, and therefore dare not amend the ſenſe of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But to what is the Queſtion I return, after this ſo<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> long (yet not altogether inexcuſable) digreſſion, one of their zealous Miniſters (as they call them) thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims; <hi>And what an improper ſpeech were this, to</hi>

If I ſhould ſtop at and examine all ſuch paſſages in point of ſenſe or true Grammar: <hi>I</hi> muſt not finiſh my intended task this ſeven years: but 'tis pity not to laſh a little, when ſuch idiots will be playing the Criticks.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, the Scriptures and all Writings abound with figurative ſpeeches, of which number this is; but if he mean by improper, incongruous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet, he offends greatly; for then the Scriptures are very guilty herein, as will appear by and by; and I know not what elſe he ſhould mean by proper, unleſs not peculiar or a tall ſpeech; as we call a tall man or woman a proper, and by<note place="margin">Naylor, Love to the loſt p. 17.</note> improper a ſhort ſpeech.

So I ſay, of the Word that was God, it was the Word that was in the beginning, that created all things: ſhew me any ſuch Word and I will call it God too: yea, I will ſay it is blaſphemy to deny it to be ſo: but the Scriptures which we call the Word of God, were not in the beginning, nor did they create any thing, much leſs all things.</p>

Yea, and will you not ſay, that <hi>John</hi> ſaith ſo in his Declaration? I know you will, and I will ſay ſo too; what then? Is there nothing called light, or that is truly ſo, but Chriſt or God? the Sun, Moon, Day, are called Light alſo, <hi>Gen</hi> 1. 5, 16. yea, the diſciples are called by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>The Light of the World,</hi> Mat. 5. 14.</p>
                     <p>And muſt they be God too? or Chriſt be too blame for calling them the light of the VVorld; a phraſe ſo very near, that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9.

You do not honeſtly diſtinguiſh betwixt proper and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative words and phraſes in reading the Scriptures, but have gotten an Art to conſtrue them backward, quite croſs to their true intent and meaning; you will take proper ſpeeches for figurative, and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for proper, not careing for the true ſenſe, but as they will ſerve your turn; and thereby you can prove <hi>quodlibet ex quolibet,</hi> what you will, and any how; and ſo you ſeem in the eyes of ſilly and credulous ſouls, to make your rope of ſand to hang finely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and you are no more happy here, for Chriſt the VVord is the VVord, but in a leſs proper ſenſe, whereas the Scriptures are the VVord of God in a much more proper ſenſe; which I ſhall plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate: Only take one direction in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while.</p>
                     <p>That where any phraſe or word may be taken in a<note place="margin">§, 2.</note> proper ſenſe, it ought ſo to be taken: unleſs there be a neceſſity to do otherwiſe, from the conſideration of the Context. As in the point in hand, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The VVord was God, in the beginning;</hi> here it cannot be underſtood of the VVord in a proper and ordinary acceptation; becauſe ſuch words or word cannot be God, neither were in the beginning.

if you ſhould take it for Chriſt the VVord, which is figurative: you muſt read it <hi>Choak Chriſt:</hi> which how untrue and uncomely a phraſe it is, <hi>I</hi> leave your ſelves to judge.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſhew you what is a word in a proper<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nſe: and that the Scriptures are ſuch, and what in a figurative ſenſe: and that Chriſt or the Son of God (as the Word in ordinary acceptation) is ſuch.</p>
                     <p>A word in a proper ſenſe, is either an articulate ſyllabical ſound, which the eare is receptive of, and by which ſomewhat may underſtood as its ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a commonly received acceptation.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe, a writing, impreſſion or graving, which is ſuch a diſpoſing of letters in their Order, as doth expreſs and ſignifie to the eye, what the other doth to the ear.</p>
                     <p>Now Chriſt is not, cannot be the Word, in neither<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> of theſe ſenſes; for he is not a ſound thus diſpoſed, nor yet an engraved, printed or written thing: but the Scriptures are ſuch, or conſiſt of ſuch words. How the Scriptures are the word in the ſingular number, <hi>I</hi> have already ſhewed, and muſt refer you thither</p>
                     <p>A figurative word, or word in a figurative conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> is ſomewhat ſo expreſſed, but is ſo only by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy, as having ſome proportion with, and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or likeneſs to a word: but will by no means bear the definition of a word, taking in all that is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to its being a word.</p>

for he takes care of them, he waters them, purges, prunes, plows, digs, fences, feeds them in a ſpiritual ſenſe.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is called the Lion of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> the<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> Vine, the door: yet he is none of theſe, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his relation, and uſefulneſs to his people, there is ſome ſimilitude betwixt Chriſt, and theſe Figures and Emblems of him: he is ſtrong and courageous, fears none, overcomes all he encounters with, he conveys ſap, life and fruitfulneſs to his living branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; he is the mean by which we may be reconciled to, and enjoy God; but enough of this.</p>
                     <p>And Chriſt who is God, is the Word, but by Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> not properly in ordinary acceptation.</p>

                     <p>2. He doth alſo manifeſt and ſignifie to us all the glorious attributes of God in a ſplendid manner, but more eſpecially his love, mercy and pity: and that not only as a Prophet and Teacher; by the Word of his mouth; but alſo in all his concerns as Mediatour.</p>

Thus <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> have cleared my way hitherto. One thing only remains to prove their errour, which <hi>I</hi> have reſerved as the laſt blow; and that is to ſhew that the Scriptures do callthe Threatnings, Promiſes, &amp;c. therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the Word of God, and the written Word;

and if I prove, that in any place of Scripture the phraſe cannot be taken in the ſenſe the Quakers would have it, that is, for Chriſt or God; and alſo, that it can be taken in no other ſenſe then for the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scripture; I have done enough, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will be convinced or no; and they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deny the Scriptures to be true, or own their doctrine to be falſe.</p>

were notto deny the King? though he that doth ſo ſhould allow him to be entituled a Man, a Gentleman, yea, a Nobleman or Duke, which are titles common to him, with others, or below him? ſure I am, we Chriſtians are elſe under an old muſty miſtake, and guilty of great ſlander, for affirming the <hi>Turks</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt, becauſe they will not own him to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or to be the Saviour of mens ſouls, while they own him to be not only a man, but alſo a great Prophet, and next to <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf; I ſuppoſe, a <hi>Quaker,</hi> whoſe Child ſhould own him to be a Man, and a good man too, and one that provides well for him, and yet ſay, He is not his father, and ſtand to it in earneſt, would ſay that ſon denies him, and is a naughty wicked Child, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 13.

                     <p>To deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> is to deny that Appellation on which their Authority is grounded, and which puts an awe upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men.

The Papiſts, who are the more ſubtil, will tell us, that in their Image-worſhip they terminate their worſhip in God alone, but alas, the common people are for downright language; and they, poor ſouls, being exhorted to worſhip the Images, do it devoutly, and think not on God all the while; it is no otherwiſe in the preſent caſe, people will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand after the common ſenſe and aceeptation of words.</p>

                     <p>If <hi>G.

We are here before the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Holy Spirit, let him pronounce ſentence and ſay thus; thou</hi> Jacob Gretferus <hi>believeſt not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, thy cauſe is overthrown; thou</hi> Jacob Hailbrun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerus <hi>haſt overcome: then I will quickly go over to you.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Now let the Holy Ghoſt come, now let him judge me, now let him condemn me.</hi> If he had not had the metaphorical word to have played with, the world had not been troubled with ſo impertinent an Argument, and language ſo lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrous, abuſive, and daring to the Holy Spirit. By this you may ſee, that if the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> agreement in the ſame falſe Witneſs againſt the Scripture will carry it, our cauſe is gone, and the Scripture muſt not determine religious matters. But 'tis a ſign 'tis a bad ſtep, that ſo well fits the Popes Foot to mount his uſurped and infallible Chair by, and which both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> tug for as for life.</p>
                     <p>I remember when I was a ſmall Lad I heard our<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> Proteſtant Divines uſually affirm, that every man was born with a Pope in his belly; which to my then childiſh genius ſeemed a very pretty phraſe; but ſuch an one (as I thought) as was not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable

                     <p>For convicting the <hi>Quakers</hi> of groſs errour, and<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> eſtabliſhing others in the truth; I ſhall prove from the Divine Authority of the Scripture theſe four things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That whatſoever is by the Lord affirmed in the Holy Scripture, it is our duty to believe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That whatſoever is thereby or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in commanded of the Lord (not being repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the coming of Chriſt) it is our duty to obey.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Holy Scriptures do (in their kind) determine or diſcover to us; whether we believe and walk or practiſe aright or not.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt of theſe I ſhall prove from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> own words, <hi>O fools! and ſlow of heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that the Prophets have ſpoken, &amp;c.</hi> If it had not been their duty to believe according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord by the Prophets (which were not immediate to the Diſciples) it had been neither their fault nor their folly not to believe, or to have been ſo ſlow and unready to believe, even thoſe Prophecies which foretold the death and ill hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31145:47"/>
of the Meſſias; which was ſo much above their underſtandings, and ſo thwart to their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Yea the innocent and compaſſionate Jeſus would have been not a little faulty, for ſo ſeverely rebuking them for what was no crime at all.</p>
                     <p>But leſt you ſhould ſay, theſe Prophecies were within them; (as ſome of you have ſaid) know firſt, that they were ignorant of them, <hi>for as yet</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>they knew not the Scriptures.</hi> And 'tis ſaid <hi>Luke 4. 27. Beginning at</hi> Moſes <hi>and all the Prophets, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them in all the Scriptures the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf.</hi> Thus much may ſuffice to prove it our duty, to believe what the Scriptures ſpeak, and that all and univerſally.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What is therein commanded we ought<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> to obey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

I anſwer, firſt, that the commands here chiefly intended, were ſuch as oblige all men in all Ages, for the matter of them which is alway juſt and righteous. Secondly, the ground of their authority being the Lord commanding, reaches to whatever he commands in his written Word in all Ages of the World. Thirdly, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had them not immediately by inſpiration, but by the hand of <hi>Moſes;</hi> either from his mouth to that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or by Writing and Tradition to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations following.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The holy Scriptures determine accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> to their kind, or as much as a Writing can do, whether we believe and practiſe aright or not. I hope you are not yet reſolved (with the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>William Pen</hi>) that becauſe they do not expreſs the ſenſe contained in them, <hi>viva voce,</hi> or direct it to thy conſcience without any other help; and ſay, thou <hi>A.</hi> art in the right, thou <hi>B.</hi> art amiſs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wilt not take them to be meet to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine good and evil, right and wrong.

                     <p>The teachings, motions, and determinations of the Spirit of God by the Scripture, are more ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the nature, and preſent ſtate and condition of man; and more certain to his knowledge, than any immediate teachings, which any enjoy in our days.</p>
                     <p>More ſutable to the preſent condition of man.</p>
                     <p>I prove it firſt from its being that diſpenſation of God, which he hath put an eminent Character of mercy upon. <hi>He ſheweth his Word unto Jacob, and</hi>

of God been expreſſed as a mercy ſo ſingular, ſo excelling his dealings with any other people; and ſuch flouriſhing matter for the praiſes of the Lord. Never did any of the Saints of old call it a carnal letter, husks, and by ſuch like ſcornful names.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The diſpenſations of the revealed and<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> written Word, render God nigher to a people, than to thoſe who are without it.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Read the Context, and you will find that, the means of God being ſo nigh was (chiefly) his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Laws. And it is notorious, that the Gentile Nations who were without the Scripture, had loſt ſight of the true God ſo far, that they worſhipped the moſt deſpicable things in his ſtead: and as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>were without God in the world;</hi> for<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.</note> all their light within, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay all men ever had.</p>
                     <p>The diſpenſations of God in and to his Church,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> riſe higher and higher in excellency and glory. And this is a third Argument.</p>
                     <p>His firſt after the fall, were ſome few revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſome few perſons; and by them handed to others: which might be then much more eaſie than now, for that men lived ſo long, that the days of <hi>Methuſelah</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> took hold of the days of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham:</hi> But men increaſing in number, and no leſs in impiety, they quickly loſt that little was committed to them.</p>
                     <p>And before the Law and Covenants, and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (in part) were written (notwithſtanding Creation, Providence, and ſome revelation) the knowledge of God was very thin and ſcant in the

                     <p>A fourth proof may be, from the ſlipperineſs of<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> our memories.</p>
                     <p>Who among the ſons and daughters of men, is able to retain in the memory ſuch a multitude of particulars as concern faith and life? that if it ſhould be granted, that every man at ſome time or other ſhould have the whole mind of God contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture, immediately, and by revelation imparted to him: the memory would prove a very leaky Veſſel, and bad Steward; and let ſlip a great part, both matter and form; without a miracle to raiſe our faculty (not only above the common courſe, or which is ordinary, but) above the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of any man that breaths: whereas the word imparted by the Scripture abides, to which as to an everlaſting Record we may have recourſe, and ſupply that defect.</p>

                     <p>I would not wrong the <hi>Quakers</hi> as bad as they<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> are, and it is pity they ſhould be wronged, who wrong themſelves more than enough: if they mean by the Scripture, the ſenſe by them expreſſed, I wiſh they ſaid true; and if within be in the heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> not only known and readily produced out of the heart, and men as a good man brings forth from thence good things, but alſo eſteemed loved with underſtanding; I am ſure they would be no Quakers.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31145:54"/>
meaſure, but alas memory is ſo weak and frall it will not hold all: and ſo confuſed ever and anon, that it is neceſſary to go to the Scripture without not only to get in more, but alſo to repair decayed and broken notions of them, and to be ſure that our crazy imaginations by brooding upon the frame of them within, have not hatched ſomething of its own, and adopted it Scripture: which the Quakers are not a little guilty in.</p>
                     <p>But while I am commending the firſt part of<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> their Tenet, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scripture is within; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it taken in as good a ſenſe as it may be, I muſt not forget the latter part which hath the dregs and poiſon, <hi>viz. and was read within before it was read without.</hi>

                     <p>If by reading it within before without they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it only of the Penmen of the Scriptures, I would join with them, and ſay ſo too: but they intend nothing leſs, but, that, in the light which every man hath within him, there is the Scripture all and every part, at leaſt that may be of uſe, if it had never been without. I would willingly be reſolved of a few things by thoſe that are of this mind. Wherefore did the gracious God expoſe the Prophets and Apoſtles to ſo many difficulties, dangers, and deaths for declaring the matters contained in the Scriptures, if they were read, and might be read by all men within?</p>
                     <p>Why did God with his own finger write the Ten<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> Words or Commands, and cauſe other of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to write both them and the other parts of the Scripture?

                     <p>Why did Jeſus Chriſt never rebuke the Jews for not heeding the Scripture within, while he oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked them for not heeding and believing the Scripture without? theſe are enough and to ſpare, to diſcover the vanity of this conceit.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, the Scriptures were written (with<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> reſpect to us) firſt without, then within.</p>
                     <p>I would gladly hear any of the Quakers make a<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> report of any of the Goſpel truths contained in the Scriptures, which you could aſſure me you never heard or read without: or that you could all agree without conferring together in a Narrative of thoſe Traditions which the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> were taught by word, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 15. and of thoſe many other things which Jeſus did (or ſome of them) ſpoken of <hi>John</hi> 21. 25. which were not written:

                     <p>The Laws that were given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the doctrines and promiſes alſo were binding to the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael, Exod. 34. 32.

                     <p>And moreover it were a very ſuperfluous thing<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> for God to ſend his commands to them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> if they had them all at as nigh and as good a hand as he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The like may be ſaid of the New Teſtament Commands and Doctrines, <hi>&amp;c. 2 Theſ. 2. 15.

                     <p>But let us ſay a little about the obligation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples<note place="margin">§. 2. <hi>Morning Watch.</hi>
                        </note> of the Saints. That I may not run you out of one errour into another, I am willing to take ſome pains in this, as in the other parts of this Tract.</p>
                     <p>To imitate all the Examples of the beſt of Saints would lead us into ſin, and therefore cannot be our duty. This I will not plead for, for then we ought to murmur, murther, diſſemble, and be proud, which at ſome time or other, ſome or other of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenteſt Saints recorded in Scripture have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of.</p>
                     <p>To imitate and take example by them from the<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> meer authority of their Example, is not a little faulty, though the thing be good in its ſelf: But to take them for our examples, and follow their ſteps wherein they act according to the written Word, or are commended and rewarded by God for ſo doing, yea not any where reproved for ſo doing: their examples in the like caſes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, it is not only reaſon to follow, but a ſin not to follow: yet we are to follow their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as they are ſome diſcovery of the will of God to us, which we knew not ſo well and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without them: or as they are a farther incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to our faith and obedience.</p>
                     <p>Neither are we notwithſtanding to follow their<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> examples which were according to the mind of God when they lived, but ſince thoſe Laws are abrogated and repealed by a demonſtrative act, and law of God. As in the caſe of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites

and Ceremonies; with all thoſe things which were Typical ſhadows, the ſubſtance, and intendment of which is performed and compleated.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things promiſed, I ſhall prove that their examples are binding to us, yea are a ſuperadded engagement to duty; and render a ſin againſt a command ſo backed with examples, to be more ſinful and more deeply aggravated.</p>

                     <p>I conclude this Chapter with ſome conſequences of the denying the doctrines, commands, holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the Scripture contained, to be binding to us, unleſs they come to us by immediate inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or motion of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Friſt then all miniſtry by men is ſuperfluous and vain; and that not only our miniſtry, but that alſo which you call yours, who affirm this dangerous untruth.</p>
                     <p>Can you ſay your Miniſters are the Spirit? if the<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> Spirit teach by, or through them it teaches medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; but I ſay not this as if I took it to be of bad conſequence that your Miniſtry ſhould ceaſe: but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31145:60"/>
to ſhew you how greatly contradictory you are to your own principle. You ſay the light and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing within you, is a ſufficient, and only Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and no other can oblige, or move you: and yet none make a greater noiſe in that you call teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or declaring, or are ſo troubleſom and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate therein, as your ſelves.</p>
                     <p>2. The conſequence will be, that however the<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> Scriptures are a Monitor from which we may ſtore our ſelves with Gods counſel, and commands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in the intervals, and mean whiles between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations, and motions from the Spirit within: we have no obligation to any duty, nor can we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſin. For where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion; take away the Scripture Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and to you there is none, but as inſpirations drop in: and then I aſſure you (for all your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences) you may live lawleſly enough: inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being now ſo rare; and when they were more plentiful, but one <hi>Balaam</hi> among the wicked was ſo viſited, as we read of.</p>
                     <p>3. Then the Scriptures ſignifie juſt nothing, but<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> a Romance to read, to exerciſe the fancy; or at moſt but as a prophane or common Hiſtory, from which we learn nothing but what others did and ſaid; and how it was with them. If you read the Scripture commands, they are nothing to you; if you have a command in Spirit (as you call it) it is enough: though it never were in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yea, though it be contrary to the Scripture, reaſon, and all modeſty.</p>

                     <p>THis is a bold and ſtrange aſſertion from thoſe who call the Scriptures the Scriptures of truth, and would be thought not to deny but own them with ſome reſpect. But ſeeing it is within them, I love they ſhould ſpeak out.</p>
                     <p>If the Scriptures are thus impotent, I know no uſe they are of in things of a religious concern; all Religions aiming at and depending upon the knowledge of God and ourſelves: and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion as ſuch, on the knowledge of Chriſt.

For the inviſible things of him from thhe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World are cleerly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made: even his Eternal Power and Godhead.</hi> Either they never read this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the beam is in their eyes, who ſhall ſay there is no other way to know God but Chriſt; if he had ſaid no other way to know God ſavingly without Chriſt, he had ſaved his credit here, and hit the mark: but what will not men ſay that have a mind the Scripture ſhould be ſilent. The reaſon he grounds this upon is of like ſtrength to moſt which they produce under that name, or form: <hi>For Chriſt is the way,</hi> now this Scripture doth not ſpeak of the knowledge of God, but of coming to God; which is ſomewhat more than a bare knowledge of God; which muſt have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us before we can come, or move towards him. But ſuppoſe he had ſaid there is no other way to come to God but Chriſt only, he had ſpoken falſly. For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:31145:62"/>Though there is no other way to come to God<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> without Chriſt, yet there are many other ways to come to God by, in conjunction with and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to Chriſt. So our reading the Scripture, knowledge of our alienation from God, our ſin, guilt, and danger, ſanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are all ways and means by which we come to God. Add to theſe faith, love; yet who will ſay that any of theſe are Chriſt? (except <hi>James Naylor,</hi> who ſaith Chriſt is the Word and Prayer) but though we make theſe to be ſome ways and means of coming to God, we make not any of them <hi>the way,</hi> as the moſt excellent and only way: nor do we make them our Saviours, and Mediators, and Interceſſors with God for us: nor that they by ſhedding their blood ſatisfied Gods Juſtice and appeaſed his anger, and made reconciliation between God and man: and yet without theſe any one of them (at leaſt ſuch as are within their reach) no perſon can be ſaved or be re-united to God. I will give you a demonſtration as eaſie as ſenſe it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe that over a great and deep River there<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> were but one Bridge; and he that would go to the other ſide muſt go by this Bridge; and it ſhould be ſaid (and truly) no man can get to the other ſide of the River, but by this Bridge: would this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that you muſt not enquire where this Bridge is? how you may paſs over by it? that you muſt not take thoſe paſſages, and ſteps that lead to the Bridge? that you muſt not have and uſe your legs, and your eyes? and all becauſe you cannot get over but by thy Bridge.

I would know of the Quakers, what they will make of the mouth of the Lord? Do they take it to be ſome part of his body, which is like our mouths, the Organs of ſpeech? We have thought hitherto that God being a Spirit hath no mouth at all; only to expreſs things to our underſtandings, he ſpeaks by ſimilitudes taken from ſuch things we are acquainted withall: and ſo whatſoever God reveals his mind by, may be called his mouth.</p>
                     <p>And it will follow that the Scriptures are his mouth, as eminently as any thing, yea all things in the world, and more. For God ſpeaks by them to us, more than by all other things: he ſaith to <hi>Jeremy, Jer. 15. 19. Thou ſhalt be as my mouth. As thou ſpakeſt by the hand of Moſes.</hi>

                     <p>But the Quakers will not have it ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt not be ſo.

                     <p>Firſt, As the New Teſtament or Covenant of promiſe (eſpecially in the hand of Chriſt) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth and conveyeth ſoul-quickning grace in a good meaſure to ſanctifie and enable, and diſpoſe the ſoul to keep the Laws of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As by the New Teſtament or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, life and ſpirit, comfort and refreſhment is put into the hearts of poor drooping ſinners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of the ſeverity of the Law, and their liableneſs to the puniſhment of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, And chiefly, the intent and mind of<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> the Spirit in the terrible diſpenſation of the Law of Works, was by diſcovering mans woful eſtate; to make the promiſes of the Goſpel, or the new Covenant ſweet and welcome; and to put ſouls on embracing the redemption through Chriſt. So that the matter of the pure New Teſtament or Covenant in the hand of the Mediator; was that which God eſpecially aimed at to promote by the Letter, or the meer Law of Commandments; in which alone there was not the leaſt appearance of mercy or mans welfare implied.</p>

                     <p>In the firſt place he abuſes the Scripture by a groſly falſe and directly contradictious Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. The Scripture which moſt agrees with his words is in 2 <hi>Col.</hi> 14. <hi>blotting out the hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>

                     <p>The true meaning of the Text is, that Jeſus<note place="margin">§ 3.</note>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:31145:83"/>
Chriſt by his death fulfilling what was ſignified by the typical Jewiſh Ordinances, and aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moſaical diſpenſation, entred his houſe [his Church] to undertake the adminiſtration of its affairs, which he in all things diſpoſed as was ſuitable to the gracious nature of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and that glory of Gods goodneſs that now ſhines in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But will this great Prophet <hi>G. F.</hi> ſay, that the pure Goſpel-Ordinances are againſt us? contrary to us? or as the Jewiſh, ſtanding in the way of the converſion of the Gentiles through their burthenſomeneſs? Will he ſay that Chriſt by his death aboliſhed his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ordinances? Will he ſay that he nailed them to his Croſs before they had a being? di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them not being formed, till by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles after his reſurrection. Will he ſay that he blotted out the Lords Supper, and nailed that to his Croſs alſo, as ſoon as he had inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it? as if he delighted in a fickle humour, as the Quakers; and to give life to an Ordinance, and within twenty four hours put it to death: yea to engage his Diſciples thereby to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his death as often as they did it, and yet abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Ordinance by his death, and ſo take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all opportunity of remembring his death thereby.</p>
                     <p>And that phraſe of the Angel, (ſeeking the<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> living among the dead) becauſe they are taken with the ſound, is often uſed by them, though not only beſide the meaning of it, but contrary to the ſenſe of any Scripture. I am ſure it was never intended to prove Goſpel-Ordinances dead.</p>

                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:31145:84"/>You may hereby note, what he denies, <hi>viz.</hi> outward forms: they are not to be touched, and his reaſon is an excellent one, the Saints have Chriſt in them. At another time he will ſay <hi>Moſes, Abraham,</hi> and the Old-Teſtament Saints had Chriſt in them, and that in their own ſenſe; and yet I hope he will give us leave to believe, that it was their duty to obſerve Gods forms. But I wonder not that they that hold not faſt the form of ſound words, are ſo eaſily perſwaded to let go the forms of ſound worſhip.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here you have the tenet, and the pretended reaſon of it; all that know his will [that is the Quakers] cannot endure that any viſible thing ſhould be ſet up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what if Chriſt have ſet them up? If they can prove as ſtrongly that Chriſt hath pulled them down, and is departed from them, as we can that Chriſt did ſet them up, and is preſent with and in them, we will quickly in that point turn Quakers. But alas! the proof that he hath done ſo, is but this; they limit his leadings in Spirit, that is, the Quakers fancies: but if he intended the Spirits leadings in a true ſence, it is very ſtrange that the Goſpel and Law of works ſhould be both ſick of one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe: <hi>that which was ordained to life I found to be unto death.</hi> The Ordinances of the Goſpel were

                     <p>What is ſtudy but meditation, and ſearching to underſtand the truth, and to get it into our heads and hearts? if this be a ſin, obedience to God is ſo.

                     </p>
                     <p>Then it ſeems it is no idle task to preach like a workman, and divide the Word of truth aright; and that we may be approved to God, and free from ſhame among men, we muſt ſtudy.</p>

                        <hi>there of the Devil, that ſpeaketh the words of truth, but not as they are in it; as ſo ſaith Chriſt to the Jewes, they were of their Father the Devil, they ſpeak of themſelves—they ſpeak of themſelves as the Devil doth, but abide not in the truth, but a lyar from the beginning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Devil ſpeaks a lye from himſelf, that is a truth, for no body need teach the Devil to lye: but how will it follow that whatever any man ſpeaks of himſelf is a lye? then it ſeems for a man to be firſt in telling any thing, true or falſe, 'tis a lye; whereas we uſe moſt to ſuſpect the truth of that, which comes by a ſecond, or third hand, or more: but the concluſion is, what we have not by immediate inſpiration, and teach it, we ſpeak it of our ſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are deviliſh lyars.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And to ſuch wiſe ſayers and knowers as theſe—God ſaith, though ye ſay God lives, yet as I live ye ſwear falſly, and why falſly? was not that a truth that God lives? but not a truth truly teſtified unto by them (any more than what is teſtified</hi> in foro homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, <hi>in mens Courts, by ſuch as being not eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes thereof, have it only by hear-ſay from others) becauſe they witneſſed to it but in ſtollen words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is then the proof, that we ſpeak more<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> than we know, and therefore lye. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pretty near a lye; but that they who live in the light of the Creation, and read and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and know the Scripture to be the Word, or the words of God; and affirming no nicer a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31145:88"/>
truth, than that God liveth, ſhould lye; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know it not by immediate inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is very ſtrange: He that lives, may know from thence that God lives, who holdeth every ſoul in life that lives.</p>
                     <p>But the meaning of the Text may be (and I will truſt the ſober Readers judgement to decide it betwixt us) that they did not believe the Lord lived, and ſwearing what they thought untrue, or doubted of, they therein ſware falſly. But I deſire thoſe who give credit to ſuch teachers as infallible, and inſpired immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from God, to try by the inſtance I am now upon, whether we are not likely to ſpeak more rightly concerning God, from the Scripture, than their teachers without book? In the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Text, <hi>Fiſher</hi> hath falſified (beſide his Expoſition) in three plain caſes, for <hi>they</hi> ſay he writes <hi>ye</hi> ſay, for <hi>the Lord lives,</hi> God lives, there is both taking away a word, and changing another, and makes God ſwear too, where there is not a word or title of it in the Text, and ſo adds to the Word of the Lord theſe words, <hi>yet as I live.</hi> This is ordinary from theſe inſpired teachers, and to tell us God ſaith ſo, leſt we ſhould take them to be his own words, adds to the boldneſs of the perverting the Scripture. I could write a Catalogue of a thouſand ſuch faults in the Quakers citing of Scripture, ſome adding, ſome leaving a word or two out through careleſneſs, or wilfulneſs.

                     <p>But moſt will conclude that theſe Authors do not ſpeak the minds of the Quakers, for that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31145:89"/>
they have more teachers than all others.</p>
                     <p>Men-Miniſters, Women-Miniſters, and any one of them when there is a motion to it.</p>
                     <p>It is confeſſed that in point of fact it is ſo,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> but it is a moſt palpable contradiction to their profeſſed principle: I ſhould be glad to hear they were more true to it, that the light within might be their only teacher, and they would let others alone, till that turned them Quakers. But Satan is cunning, and can give a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where it may ſerve ſo greatly to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes they have ſilent meetings, as is known to moſt; then they ſay they attend to the teacher within, which is ſufficient, and by which they find more comfort often, than when there is ſpeaking.</p>
                     <p>But at a meeting not far from my dwelling,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> there was the ſtrangeſt teaching that I believe was ever heard of among pretended Reformers; and I had it from a man of note among them, who was one of the meeting. There declared, not a man but a woman (that's ordinary) not an Engliſh woman but a Dutch woman, (that is not ſo frequent) not in Engliſh but in Dutch, (this was orderly according to the Popiſh Maſs) and prayers in an unknown tongue to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But the ſtrangeſt thing of all was, he told me (that although not one of them underſtood Dutch, nor could the Dutch-woman interpret into Engliſh, at leaſt ſhe did not) they knew ſhe ſpake by the Spirit. I asked him how? he told me becauſe they all found refreſhings; ſo have children many a time at Puppet-playes. What
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31145:90"/>
a paſs are theſe people come to, who yet deny all teachings by man?</p>
                     <p>But that you may not doubt the truth of the<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> Story, there being a diſpute (or ſomewhat ſo called by ſome) between me, and <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> the Quakers Champion; I did before all the audience charge them with this thing, my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former a Quaker being there, and many more Quakers who were at that meeting: but none dared to deny one word of the Charge, only <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſaid, it may be there was ſome body there that underſtood Dutch.</p>
                     <p>But what have they to ſay, think you, to this<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> contradiction of their principles in teaching? Why, it is not they but the man Chriſt, or the light or the Spirit that teaches; and if ſuch light replies will not ſerve turn, you may go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe to be ſatisfied for them.</p>
                     <p>But beyond all contradiction, if the Church, and Churches mentioned and owned in the New Teſtament, be Goſpel-Churches, the Quakers deny a Goſpel-Church; for all of them had men who taught them, at leaſt they did not deny any ſuch helps.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Prayer by more than one; <hi>Our</hi> Father give <hi>us:</hi> Secondly, Family-Prayer; for that the whole family ſharing in common in the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ſcarcity of proviſion, (eſpecially for the belly which is the great ſpender) they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to put up their joynt ſupplications to God for daily bread, and that daily: which might have made a third Note, <hi>viz.</hi> That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we may pray every prayer we offer up to the Lord, for proviſion to our lives end; yet we are to pray for it every day, and eſpecially for the proviſion of the preſent day.

                        <hi>thanks to God in the preſence of them all; and when he had broken it, he began to eat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>All that ever I could learn of the Quakers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> of benefits received, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable by us, from what the Man Chriſt Jeſus did and ſuffered in the world, amounts but to this: He left us a perfect example; and yet they think ſcorn to follow that, as below ſuch ſpiritual perſons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He looked up to heaven,</hi> which implyes, he did it for example ſake at leaſt, (though all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead dwelt in him bodily) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the divine Being (eſpecially and in his more glorious manifeſtations) to be above, or beyond the viſible boundaries of this little world.</p>
                     <p>And as it is againſt Chriſts example, ſo againſt ſomewhat <hi>more</hi> than a Goſpel-precept: <hi>For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>So that to omit this duty (which therefore <hi>Paul</hi> would not when in a ſtorm, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in a conſternation with fear of death) renders the creature no good to us, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified by God.</p>

                     <p>They alſo deny publick Miniſterial Prayer:<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> for although they have ſome who utter petitions, they do it (as I am informed) alwayes in the firſt perſon ſingular, <hi>I pray thee,</hi> not <hi>We pray thee.</hi> So that although they may pray for others, they pray not with them as their mouth, which is contrary to Chriſts Directory, and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints in the Ordinances of the Goſpel.

                        <hi>So the ſame wiſdom may deny the preſcribed way,</hi>

                        <hi>as being formal, and may invent ſomething inſtead of it, in a higher mystery of iniquity; and though they may not ſpeak in ſuch formal words compoſed, yet in the ſame wiſdom their words are formal: they can ſet their own time to begin and end, and when they will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31145:94"/>
they can utter words, and when they will they can be ſilent; and this is the unclean part which offers to God, which he doth not accept,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>What the wiſdom here is intended by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, you ſhall ſee by and by: but the main for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality inveighed againſt is keeping of ſet-times; but they may forgive us this errour, it being ſo well known, that <hi>they</hi> have ſet-times, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their ordinary hours no more than we. And the wiſdom of the fleſh is, that we do it in our own wills: if they mean not in obedience to the will of God, 'tis more than they know: if it be according to the will of God, and our wills comply with that, it is ſo much the better, for God likes no ſervice againſt, nor without the will: To chooſe the things that pleaſe God, pleaſes God very well. It is well known, that many of them when they come into our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and are preſent when the Miniſter is at<note place="margin">Iſa. 56. 4.</note> prayer, they will ſit all the while in the midſt, with their Hats on their heads, in contempt, which I my ſelf have experienced more than once.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Owning no prayer that is not by immediate inſpiration, and motion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and without the uſe of our conception, and direction of the underſtanding.</p>

                        <hi>living God, who is that Spirit who will be ſerved with his own alone, not with any thing in man, which is come in ſince the fall; ſo the imaginations, thinkings, and conceivings are ſhut out.</hi>

                     <p>

                        <hi>to be ordered, and ceaſe from their own words, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31145:95"/>
from their own time, and learn to be ſilent till the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit give them utterance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That we ought to pray in the Spirit, and with the Spirit, is far from us to deny: but he that prays according to the mind of the Spirit of God revealed in the Scripture, (which is the Spirits Directory) and who by the commands, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and promiſes therein contained, is moved to pray: he prays in the Spirit, and with the Spirit, although he have no immediate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the divine Being. He that obeys Gods commands in his written Word, doth his duty, and is through Chriſt accepted of him.</p>
                     <p>But leſt you ſhould miſtake the Quakers mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the phraſe, <hi>traditions of men,</hi> take notice, That they hold the written Word, and what is therein contained as its ſence, to be but the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, except it come to us by immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate inſpiration, as to the Prophets and Apoſtles, and not at ſecond hand; which I have already proved, and therefore need not do it over again.</p>
                     <p>And by what I have here produced you may learn, That they deny any thing of man to be exerciſed in prayer. If he intended hereby, only the depravation that is come in ſince the fall, it were very right: but certainly faith in the Redeemer, and the promiſes which in him are yea and amen, as the encouragement to prayer, is come in ſince the fall, though no part of the fall; and all the Ordinances of Chriſt as ſuch, are come in ſince the fall; and faith and Goſpel-obedience are all in man moſt eminently. But that the imaginations, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31145:95"/>
and conceiving muſt be ſhut out alſo, is a moſt abſurd notion.</p>
                     <p>What! muſt we pray, and neither conceive nor think what we are to do, what we ought to do, nor how to expreſs our ſelves? no, nor while we are praying? Muſt all be done, as if man in his faculties of conceiving, knowing, were not Gods? nor to be concerned in his worſhip? Certainly if nothing of man, ſoul or body, be active therein, man doth not worſhip God, nor pray at all, and ſo God worſhips himſelf; which is the true reſult of the Quakers Tenets.</p>
                     <p>But let us conſider a Text or two out of the Word of God.</p>

                     <p>It is to me reported on all hands, That they never pray in the name of Chriſt as their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; much leſs then do they pray to God, in, or in the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary;</hi> or of that one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; even that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who was crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> between two thieves, above 1600 years ſince.

                     <p>I ſhall ſay ſomewhat of their abundant ſcorn of the Lords Supper, and Baptiſm; wherein they expreſs a ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, not only in their Tenets, but down-right railing.</p>
                     <p>The Ordinances I have hitherto conſidered in particular, are called moral, from their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation, although that ſubſtantial and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part, and qualification of them, their reſpect to a Mediator, will require a denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more evangelical, and without which we cannot call them Goſpel, or Chriſtian-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe two Goſpel-Ordinances I come now to conſider, are purely and perfectly poſitive, and depend meerly upon divinely-revealed inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without which they had never come within our notice, nor had they been any way obliging to us.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſuch is the ſanction that the Lord hath put<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> upon inſtitutions of this nature, that not only ſince his revealed Law hath abounded to his Church, but alſo when the revelations of his mind immediately to his ſervants was very rare, he did not omit injunctions of this kind. The ſacrifices we read of as early as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi> Yea <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſtate of innocency, (who then needed not any indication of moral duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what was within the reach of his natural, entire, and uncorrupted light, and innate to his perfect frame, and holy diſpoſition) had the obligation of a poſitive duty from God, in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31145:98"/>
matter of the tree in the midſt of the Garden.</p>
                     <p>And to me the main ground of it was, that the abſolute ſoveraignty of the Creator might be acknowledged, and man might learn to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der obedience to God, not only becauſe the matter of it is juſt in its ſelf, and would be ſo if God had never explicitely commanded it, but alſo becauſe it is the will of God: yea, where his will obliges ſingly, without the reſpect of natural and unchangeable equity.</p>
                     <p>And God hath ſo expreſſed his jealouſie over<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> this right of his, that when ſins againſt not only natural light, but ſuperadded precepts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ſtrengthen its doubtfulneſs and decayes, have been paſſed by without any ſpecial expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his provocation, ſins committed againſt his poſitive Laws, have been avenged with a high hand.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Adam</hi>'s and <hi>Eve</hi>'s tranſgreſſion was againſt an inſtitution and poſitive Law, the commiſſion of which ſo ſtirred up the diſpleaſure of God, that he baniſhed them out of Paradiſe, and impoſed that curſe, under which the world groans to this day. And it is not below our notice, that although they were capable of ſinning againſt God in many other reſpects, yet God affixes the direfull penalty to this poſitive Law: <hi>In the day</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The caſe of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> when God bare witneſs againſt them from heaven, by conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them with fire, was as a pillar of ſalt to ſeaſon others with an awfull reverence of God in his purely inſtituted worſhip. <hi>

ſo little, as in ſinning againſt a poſitive Law, by putting forth his hand to ſave the Ark, the intention of it being good and commendable.</p>
                     <p>And as under the Old, ſo under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament-diſpenſation, God hath not left his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Laws without the fence of his ſpecial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure witneſſed againſt the contemners, and abuſers of them: <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and</hi>

                     <p>Methinks they who have read the Scripture, ſhould not call Water-Baptiſm the invention of men, that is too palpable an untruth; though to call it formal imitation be an untruth alſo, it is more tollerable than the other: but to brand it with the Charge of a meer deluſion, is of ſuch reflection on its Author, as nothing but a heart ſteel-hard, and a head dungeon-dark, and both void of the fear and awe of God, could thus ſuggeſt.</p>
                     <p>And to make up the meaſure full, all muſt be reproached as Heathens, and no Chriſtians,

whoſe eyes are not as blind, and fore-heads as impudent as theirs; and yet as rank <hi>Quakers</hi> as this, will call me not only injurious, but a blaſphemer alſo, for ſaying and proving they are no Chriſtians.

This regardfull Prophet can tell you, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm roſe from the Pope, yea, and the Wine in the Sacrament too, which the Pope indeed took away from the Laity, but never inſtituted it.

                     <p>I muſt tell him by the way, that he tells an
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31145:100"/>
untruth wilfully, and what that is he could tell another. He uſes (or rather abuſes) the words of the Apoſtle juſt before repeated, <hi>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm,</hi> and there he adds his <hi>but,</hi> which the Text hath not. And here <hi>the Scripture ſaith, the Baptiſm is but one;</hi> let him find ſuch a Scripture, and I will be bound to turn <hi>Quaker:</hi> but there being no ſuch, I am ſure he hath not the Spirit of God, and is by it infallibly guided, who thus forges Scripture. But to the Objection, take notice, That Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſm is the ſign, the Baptiſm of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the main thing (but not all) ſignified: now to have the thing ſignifying, and the thing ſignified, called by the ſame name, doth not make them to be two of that name, no more than there were two new Covenants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter contained in the Covenant is called the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. And Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion the ſign of the Covenant is called the Covenant alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 13. <hi>He that is born in thy houſe, and he that is bought with thy money, muſt need be circumciſed, and my Covenant ſhall be in your fleſh, for an everlaſting Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, Baptiſm with water is Baptiſm in a proper ſenſe, Baptiſm of or with the Spirit, but analogically ſo called, as having in it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a likeneſs to, or proportion with it. <gap reason="foreign">

I hope none of you believe a ſoul can be rinſed or dipped. Beſide, in Water-Baptiſm, which is proper,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31145:100"/>
the body being dipt or waſhed, or any part of it, the fleſh is put into the water, but the ſoul is not dipt or put into the Spirit. Therefore this Objection is a meer fancy; and they that will contemn the Deeds and Seal, becauſe they are Paper, and Ink, and Wax, and caſt them away, may loſe Land and all for their contempt, and then they will pay for, and repent of their folly.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Strange arguments! as if the command and abundant inſtances of its practice, had no force; unleſs we have an account where every believer was baptized, and becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> did not baptize all, therefore they were not baptized at all.</p>
                     <p>But for Baptiſm being a making Diſciples, if it be underſtood of Water-Baptiſm, it will be no ſmall friend to Infant-Baptiſm: if of the Baptiſm of the Spirit, I ſuppoſe <hi>George Fox</hi> will eat his words again, and acknowledge that the Apoſtles had not power to beſtow the Spirit of God on perſons, and make them new creatures; that was the miſtake of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and now of <hi>George Fox.</hi>

                     <p>That Chriſt is come, and his Diſciples were to do it in remembrance of him till he was come; but Chriſt is come in the Spirit to them, and therefore this precept doth not bind them.</p>
                     <p>But who would think the Spirit, or Chriſt in the Spirit was not come (either in ſhedding it abroad miraculouſly, as in the 2 <hi>Acts</hi>) or as a ſanctifier) in the hearts of his people) when the Diſciples and whole Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were ſo frequent in this Ordinance, and when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, The Bread</hi>

                     <p>But that none muſt be engaged by this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but thoſe to whom Chriſt was not come by a Spirit of ſanctification, is exceeding croſs: for whereas the Ordinance is for the Saints, this renders it to be peculiar to thoſe in a ſtate of ſin, and unconverted to Chriſt; and they are not aſhamed to own it to be ſo.</p>

                     <p>If Chriſt born in the ſoul, be not till the light within be obeyed as Chriſt the Son of the living God, we doubt not the truth of <hi>Nailor</hi>'s ſpeech: and that the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt were all ſtrangers to ſuch a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The righteouſneſs here ſpoken of is in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſenſe, and unlimited to this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe; 'tis a righteouſneſs without ſtain of ſin or unrighteouſneſs. And indeed there is no ſuch thing as a compleat righteouſneſs in the ſight of God, that hath any the leaſt crookedneſs, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, or fault in it.</p>
                     <p>'Tis that righteouſneſs of the Covenant of grace, or thereby expreſſed; for Circumciſion, the ſeal of this righteouſneſs, was a ſeal of that Covenant.</p>
                     <p>The imputation of it is according to this Text,<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> a reckoning it to a perſon; verſe 10. <hi>How was it then reckoned?</hi> verſe 9. <hi>Faith was reckoned to</hi> Abraham <hi>for righteouſneſs:</hi> not as <hi>James Nailor</hi> ſaith, <hi>And with him his righteouſneſs is freely</hi> impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Love to the Loſt, <hi>p. 7.</hi>

                        <hi>or</hi> put into <hi>the creature;</hi> as if <hi>imputing</hi> were a <hi>putting in.</hi> It was imputed to <hi>James Nailor</hi> that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31145:106"/>
he was a blaſphemer; was it then, and thereby put into him to be a blaſphemer? A very fit Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor of myſterious Scriptures! However he hit right of the <hi>Quakers</hi> mind, and therefore it muſt be no more but put <hi>in,</hi> to this day.</p>
                     <p>But to return: it being reckoned, and that<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> as a grace of the new Covenant, it was not the righteouſneſs of <hi>Abraham</hi> by him wrought, or wrought in his own perſon, as the ſubject of it; for then it had not been any grace or favour from God to reckon it to him: therefore it was a righteouſneſs of another that was reckoned to him, not his own. Whoſe righteouſneſs it was then, may be gathered by the title of the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or reckoned righteouſneſs, verſe 11. <hi>A ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith, which he had being yet uncircumciſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well then, this conſideration may lead us to the truth of imputed righteouſneſs; if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider faith, as being an act of the ſoul, and therefore not the righteouſneſs imputed: for ſo far as that is righteouſneſs in obeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 4 Rom. 4. 5.</note> of God, it is our own act. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by</hi> his <hi>faith. His</hi> faith is accounted for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>It muſt needs then be the object of faith, or that which faith acts on, or looks to; and this is no other, but <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſs,</hi> the<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 6</note> great ſubject of the promiſe and Covenant; and is therefore called. <hi>The promiſe, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and frequently, <hi>The righteouſneſs of God,</hi> as being the worker of that righteouſneſs in his own perſon, which is of Gods appointment, to juſtifie a poor believer, which is not a believers,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31145:107"/>
but as it is reckoned or imputed to him.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond ground of this Doctrine of imputed<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 21. §. 5.</note> righteouſneſs, is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reign through righteouſneſs unto eternal life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> That this righteouſneſs of Chriſt is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Juſtification, and therein the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of God, is plain in the 17, 18, and 19 verſes, where the Apoſtle lays his argument for grace and righteouſneſs through Chriſt, in its ſimilitude to the influence of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin by imputation. <hi>For if by</hi> one <hi>mans offence death reigned by</hi> one, verſe 17. <hi>Therefore as by the offence</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom 5. 17, 18, 19</note> 
                        <hi>of</hi> one, <hi>judgement came upon all men,</hi> verſe 18. <hi>For as by</hi> one <hi>mans diſobedience many were made ſinners,</hi> verſe 19. <hi>much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by</hi> one <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> verſe 17. <hi>ſo by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of</hi> one, <hi>the free gift came upon all men, to juſtification of life,</hi> verſe 18. <hi>ſo by the obedience of</hi> one <hi>ſhall many be made righteous,</hi> verſe 19.</p>
                     <p>And further to clear this truth (if clearer evidence may be poſſible) the conſideration of verſe 14. will contribute a good meaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nevertheleſs death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, <hi>even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adam'<hi>s tranſgreſſion, who is the figure of him that was to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two reſpects wherein (at leaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> of) thoſe over whom death reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> did not ſin after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, They did not ſin againſt a revealed Law, which <hi>Adam</hi> did, in eating the forbidden
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31145:107"/>
fruit: and there was no revealed Law, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of life expreſly given from God after <hi>Adam</hi>'s time, before the fall, untill <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, They did not all ſin actually, and in their own perſons, as <hi>Adam</hi> did; yet death reigned over <hi>Infants,</hi> who were in reſpect of actual ſin, Innocents. And by what Law did <hi>Infants</hi> ſuffer death? if not as they were inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man, and his offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming theirs thereby; according to thoſe words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>For as in</hi> Adam all <hi>die, ſo in</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Chriſt ſhall</hi> all <hi>be made alive.</hi> So that if it were not by the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, <hi>Children or Infants</hi> ſuffered a penalty without all Law; which is contrary to the Apoſtles words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>But ſin is not imputed when there is no Law.</hi> But there was a Law then in force, <hi>viz.</hi> the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, which by imputation reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his poſterity. And in this very reſpect, <hi>Adam</hi> was the figure of him that was to come, <hi>viz.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>So that if the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, of that<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> one man Chriſt Jeſus, be not imputed to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all his children by faith, or that are conſidered by God in Chriſt; the whole frame of the Apoſtles arguing is but trifling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes nothing of what it ſeems to aim at, which is not to be admitted by a Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>There are four Objections (among others) I have met with, againſt the evidence of theſe Texts, to the Doctrine I have vindicated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Chriſt was our example, and<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> therein did anſwer to <hi>Adam</hi> as his figure; for ſin came into the world by <hi>Adam</hi>'s example, and ſo righteouſneſs by Chriſts.</p>

                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:31145:108"/>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is an old error; and what error ſo old and rotten, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> will not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, who live in error as their element?</p>
                     <p>The Texts I have quoted, have not the leaſt appearance of ſin entring the world by example; and the Infants over whom death reigned, were not capable of ſinning by example.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. There might be a derivation of<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Adam</hi>'s corrupted nature to all his poſterity, and ſo all of them might be guilty of ſinfull diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and habits in their own perſons; yet by generation from <hi>Adam,</hi> and not by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſin committed in his own perſon: ſo the righteouſneſs that juſtifies, may be derived in ſpiritual regeneration, whereby the ſoul is diſpoſed, and enabled to work righteouſneſs, by that ſpiritual life and vigour it receives from him as its root.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That cannot be the meaning, for then the condemnation ſpoken of would be by all and every one; which though it be true, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to ſin are derived from <hi>Adam</hi> by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation, and diſpoſitions to holineſs by regeneration from Chriſt, yet cannot be the meaning of theſe Texts: for the emphatical word which as upon the hinge the whole argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment turns, is the word <hi>one;</hi> by <hi>one</hi> mans of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, by the obedience of <hi>one;</hi> whereas if the Objection did hit the meaning, the Apoſtle muſt rather have ſaid, <hi>So by all or every mans of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, condemnation came upon all:</hi> But there is no mention of that middle thing, mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt diſpoſition to knit condemnation to <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, as a more original and remote cauſe. Alſo

it ſhould then be <hi>in</hi> or <hi>into all,</hi> and not <hi>upon all.</hi>

The condemnation that came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> all, and that reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> was but temporal death, and what is that to eternal; or to bear a proportion with juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to life, ſpiritual and eternal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is more than you prove, or can prove; that it was but corporal and temporal death; and we can prove that it was the guilt of eternal death, if we go no further to fetch the proof, than from what is oppoſed to it in the laſt verſe of the Chapter; <hi>righteouſneſs to eternal life.</hi> And temporal death is not remitted or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged to thoſe, who enjoy the benefit of the grace by the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>To the firſt Inſtance in the Objection I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, The ſaying a man hath faith, is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to render him juſtified, or to juſtifie him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A dogmatical or hiſtorical faith cannot juſtifie, or ſo act on the promiſe and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as to put us under the imputation of juſtifying righteouſneſs: for ſuch a faith the Devils have; and there is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween believing the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and believing in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And this is the <hi>dead faith</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, verſe 17.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:31145:109"/>To the ſecond Inſtance: <hi>Abraham</hi>'s works<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> though they juſtified his faith, yet they did not juſtifie his perſon. And the Hiſtory of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up his Son, doth give evidence for this Expoſition: <hi>Now I know that thou fearest God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 12 Jam. 2. 18</note> 
                        <hi>ſeeing thou hast not with-held thy Son, thine only Son from me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And I will ſhew thee my faith by my works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the third Inſtance, which ſeems to joyn<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> works with faith in juſtification, that is, our works: I anſwer, That although juſtifying faith is not without works, yet faith juſtifies without works: as a man cannot have ſeeing eyes, if he have not lungs, and heart, and brains, which are eſſential to life, and the living motion of every member; yet the eye only ſees, and not the lungs, or brains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if you ſhould pluck the eyes out of the head, they would ſo alone be to little purpoſe. So works are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the being of juſtifying faith; yet faith alone is in the act of juſtifying, or ſo acts on Chriſt, as to juſtifie the perſon in the ſight of God, by cloathing the ſoul with Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>And although in the Text it is tranſlated, <hi>not by faith only,</hi> it may, and (I was going to ſay) ought to be tranſlated, <hi>alone;</hi> and then the ſenſe is but this, That faith which is alone without works, doth not juſtifie a man in the ſight of God. And I ſhall give two good Reaſons for it: The one, becauſe it may be ſo without wrong to the Original. Secondly, It muſt be ſo, becauſe it will otherwiſe contradict the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the truth alſo, as expreſſed abundantly in other Scriptures.</p>

                     <p>And it muſt be ſo, becauſe elſe it oppoſes the great Doctrine of the Goſpel, or at leaſt looks like ſuch a thing: <hi>Rom. 4. 2, 5, 6.

                     <p>'Tis generally agreed, theſe Verſes reſpect<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> Jeſus Chriſt, who is Gods ſalvation; the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and glory of whoſe effects for his people,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31145:110"/>
are chiefly two: Firſt, The reconciliation of Gods mercy to us, with his truth, and his righteouſneſs, to our peace. The truth and righteouſneſs of God were engaged to deſtroy and ruine the whole race of mankind, for their ſinning againſt him, and breach of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, in thoſe words, <hi>For in the day that thou</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17</note> 
                        <hi>eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Now whatever inclinations God might have to ſhew mercy to man, and bleſs him with peace, the truth and righteouſneſs of God (he having that word gone out of his mouth) ſeemed to oppoſe it, as not conſiſting with mercy, and peace towards man; and to have bound up thoſe hands, and lockt up thoſe bowels, from whence mans peace (through the Lords mercy) might reach him. But through Chriſt (Gods ſalvation) and what he did and ſuffered in our nature, as our publick perſon, and in our ſtead, the mercy of God in reaching poor ſinners is ſet free, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any detriment to his truth; and the peace of a believing ſinner throws no ſcandal on the righteouſneſs, and juſtice of a gracious God: but theſe his glorious Attributes of mercy, truth, righteouſneſs, are at a full agreement, amity and union, not only in God, (as they alwayes were and never can be otherwiſe) but alſo in bleſſing man with a reconciliation with his offended Creator. This Jeſus ariſes like a divine Sun in his almighty ſtrength, with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his wings.</p>
                     <p>And this is no mean evidence of the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the truth, juſtice and righteouſneſs of God, by what Chriſt tranſacted in the world,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31145:111"/>
in the behalf of loſt and undone man. <hi>To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond glorious effect of this ſalvation of<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> God Jeſus Chriſt, by his tranſacting our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is, That righteouſneſs ſhall look down from Heaven. The righteouſneſs in the 11th. Verſe (I ſuppoſe) is not the ſame with that in the 10th. Verſe: the former in the 10th. Verſe being the eſſential righteouſneſs, and juſtice of God, which was to be reconciled to ſinners; which could not be done with a <hi>ſalvo</hi> to his Word, but by ſome means which might anſwer to, and ſatisfie his juſtice. But the righteouſneſs in the 11th. Verſe (ſeems to me to be) that ſinleſs ſtate, which Chriſt who came down from Heaven hath cloathed them with, by imputing to them, and putting upon them, that divine and glorious righteouſneſs, which he wrought in his own perſon, and in our nature, when he was in the world: and ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his believing ones, not only free from the direfull ſtroaks, and heart-piercing frowns of a juſt and offended God, but alſo the objects of his love of benevolence, yea, of delight and complacence.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, The whole tranſaction of Jeſus Chriſt as Redeemer, is the ground of our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and its effects and conſequences, we being inſtated therein: although the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, conſidered as his obedience, and fulfilling that Law under which he was made as man, and imputed to us, be the glory of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31145:111"/>
Saints, wherewith they ſhine in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in him. And with relation to our union with Chriſt, all thoſe holy fruits the Saints bring forth, by the ſtrength and life from Chriſt received, are accepted of by God, and ſhall be eternally rewarded: yet have no part nor portion in this matter, of juſtifying our perſons in the ſight of God.</p>

                     <p>It follows in the Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion: For we have life before we have motion, to act or do any thing that is pleaſing to God; and in that life we have ſalvation, and ſo life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is freely given us of God.</p>
                     <p>The latter part of the Anſwer is brought to prove the truth of the former; and you will ſay, they are huge good at proving, who rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at this rate. They are not the things we do, becauſe we have life from God, and that freely, before we can move or do any thing.</p>
                     <p>This being one of the great deluſions of this poor people, wherein they ſhew ſo much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as without much grace from God, they are utterly uncapable of inſtruction: I ſhall (hoping in that grace for a bleſſing of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them) demonſtrate, by the moſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and eaſie things, the falſity of their ſuch Concluſions.</p>
                     <p>By the ſame Reaſon, all your bodily motions and actions are the motions and actions of God, and you do nothing at all the while.</p>
                     <p>Was there not life before motion? And did not God give you this life?</p>
                     <p>Can any man move hand, or foot, or tongue, in any natural action, but by that life they firſt

                     <p>For you to ſay, Your good actions and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Chriſts righteouſneſs, becauſe you have life from him to perform them, is no leſs abſurd.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſee if <hi>Pennington</hi> (who had ſomewhat of<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> a Scholar) will do any better, in the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and proof of his Anſwer to the ſecond Queſtion.</p>
                     <p>This [righteouſneſs] conveyed to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in and through the ſeed, and brought forth in the creature, by the ſeed, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture united to Chriſt, in the ſeed; here is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of life.</p>
                     <p>A ſtrange juſtifying righteouſneſs by Chriſt alone! brought forth in the creature, by the ſeed. I would ask any of this opinion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their tongues and lips did not move in the words they call righteous words? And the hands in ſome of thoſe they call righteous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Sure they will not deny they do; and how then can they ſay it is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone, in which the bodies of <hi>Thomas, John,</hi> &amp;c. are imployed?</p>
                     <p>But yet the fine myſteries in this Doctrine (which I muſt confeſs, may puzzle many an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Countreyman to find out the ſenſe of) amounts to no more than this great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                     <p>What a contradiction there is in the creatures being united to Chriſt in the ſeed, the <hi>Quakers</hi> themſelves (if any liberty be left them ſo to do) will find out. Chriſt is the ſeed, and the ſeed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31145:113"/>
is Chriſt, both but one and the ſame thing; and yet the creature is united to Chriſt, in the ſeed, that is, to Chriſt in Chriſt. But the blind ſwallow many a Fly.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, They who received the Spirit, were called to all this <hi>ſelf</hi>-work he talks of, and that by faith in Chriſts bloud too; and yet by the Law of faith it is all excluded. So here faith does and undoes; calls for ſelf-juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when it draws nigh ſhuts the door againſt them; begets children, and that by Chriſt too, and ſo ſoon as they are born, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſclaims them. If he had ſaid, they were called to ſanctification, mortification, and not put that blot of <hi>ſelf</hi> in their Eſcutcheons, to render them baſe-born; and then have aſſerted, they were not the righteouſneſs by which we are juſtified, he had ſpoken like a man, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: but they are two things in the <hi>Quakers</hi> account, adverſe and together by the ears; and therefore <hi>Nailor</hi> will have to do with neither. But that a man ſhould be called by faith to ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtification, is a ſtrange riddle, and after all the condemnation of theſe things, it is (for all that) the work of God, wrought by Chriſt <hi>in</hi> the believer.</p>

                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:31145:113"/>But to finiſh <hi>Nailor</hi>'s teſtimony of juſtifying righteouſneſs, obſerve what he ſaith ſomewhat more plainly.</p>

                     <p>Here is ſome ſhew, but a great deal of abuſe of the holy Scriptures, and the Spirit of God, by whom they were given forth.</p>

                        <hi>within—for all the holy men of God were juſtified by their faith, and that faith is in the heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the right underſtanding of this, we are to conſider faith as a diſpoſition and habit, and therein a principal part of the new creature. This diſpoſition of truſting in, relying on, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to God, hath its acts ſuitable to its ſelf. Now the acts of faith either reſpect its fruits and effects, other parts of ſanctification, as love, patience, ſelf-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or its objects and aims.</p>
                     <p>Faith hath for its immediate objects the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, leaning, truſting, hoping accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them: it is ſaid to lean on the Lord, truſt, hope in the Lord; its aims and ends for which, are the good things wrapt up in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace.</p>
                     <p>Now faith is not accounted for righteouſneſs
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31145:115"/>
with reſpect to it ſelf, as a holy diſpoſition, or its acts as holy acts; but as it looks on, takes hold of, and truſts in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. It is no rare thing for the act to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from the object.</p>
                     <p>Though faith which juſtifies, juſtifies as it hath<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> for its object Jeſus Chriſt, who is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God; and ſo though faith be within, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt which juſtifies is not within, for faith juſtifies as it looks at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what without, and above our ſelves. <hi>Whom God</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 25. Gal 2. 16 Heb. 11. 1</note> 
                        <hi>hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his bloud, juſtified by faith in Jeſus Chriſt. Faith is the evidence of things hoped for.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, Faith is made the condition of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that not only as it may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſingly, but as it includes the whole body of ſanctification, in ſome parts and meaſures of it. <hi>But to as many as received him, to them he gave</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 12</note> 
                        <hi>power to become the ſons of God, even to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his name.</hi> So that faith is a receiving of Chriſt, who is both Prince and Saviour, Lord of life and Prince of peace, and receiving him as ſuch, is conditional of this acceptation with God, and ſo may be ſaid to juſtifie, as it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the condition of juſtification on our part.<note place="margin">§. 11.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if faith were the meritorious cauſe of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it were a juſtification by works. And if faith juſtified, looking no further then its ſelf, as it is ſubjected in the ſoul; it were a ſtrange faith indeed that hath its ſelf for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and then a man ſhould believe in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                     <p>This is inſtead of many, though their Books do generally ſpeak of the ſufferings of Chriſt as propitiatory, to be done over in every perſon before converſion. And the maddeſt humour of all is, That they make the ſeed, or the light, or Chriſt being crucified in the ſoul by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſin and luſt, to be the crucifying and death of Chriſt, by which God is appeaſed.

                     <p>They do not deny, That there was ſuch a man as Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> and that God was in him, or rather Chriſt was in him: but this is no more than they profeſs of themſelves, That

Chriſt as God, and the eternal Word is in them; yet that body of the man Jeſus, which he calls here, the <hi>bodily garment,</hi> he tells us, they can never call it <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Another paſſage out of the ſame Author will explain this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For that which he took upon him was our garment,</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Which is of an earthly periſhing nature; but he is of an heavenly nature, and his fleſh, and bloud, and bones are of his nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſumme is this, The fleſh and bloud, and bones or body of Chriſt which they own, is of a heavenly and eternal nature; but the body which Chriſt took on him of our nature is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and periſhing: and therefore they can never call that or own that to be Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>This is as plain a denying the <hi>man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> whoſe body of fleſh was of our nature, and of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> as can be.</p>
                     <p>They own him as one that once had a Being, but is now periſhed, that is, his body of fleſh and bloud.</p>
                     <p>What can we expect of thoſe men, who can diſown what the Scripture ſpeaks ſo plainly and frequently? and that not now and then by the by, but as its main ſcope? Do not all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that propheſie of Chriſt ſpeak of him as to come? Doth not he himſelf, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary that lived with him in the fleſh, ſpeak of him as then come? Do not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures after his death and reſurrection ſpeak of him, as having finiſhed the merit of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and ſalvation, and departed from the earth, aſcended into Heaven, and there (at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand) ruling the affairs of Heaven and earth, and making interceſſion for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? And all this, of the body of Chriſt, which he took of mans nature; and this called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the <hi>Saviour.</hi>

                     <p>Let not theſe blaſphemers of the Lord of life<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> and glory, delude people with a fancy, as if we believe, and preach the fleſh and bloud of Chriſt to be Chriſt, ſeparated from his ſoul, his ſoul of the nature of mans ſoul, (but undefiled) or that we take his humane or mans nature to be Chriſt, ſeparate from his eternal and divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for they cannot be ſeparated, the one is not (now) without the other; nor was the divine nature of Chriſt compleat Chriſt, untill united to, and dwelling in its fulneſs in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or mans nature of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet, as what the mind conceives in a man,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> the man conceives; and what the leaſt member of the body doth, or ſuffereth, the man doth, and ſuffereth: ſo by a communication of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and union of natures in Chriſt, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and eternal Being of Chriſt is called Chriſt ſometimes, but much more often the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, or the man Chriſt Jeſus. And the reaſon is clear, becauſe although Chriſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up himſelf by the eternal Spirit, as both dignifying him to a worthineſs for ſuch a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and enabling him to undergo it as a Lamb, for patience, innocency and meekneſs, and to overcome death: yet the <hi>mans</hi> nature of Chriſt, his ſoul and his body, was the only proper ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31145:117"/>
and ſacrifice; for God cannot ſuffer, nor be put to death; and by the obedience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings thereof, was our reconciliation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption wrought. Only (as I ſaid before) its union hypoſtatical with the divine nature, did put it into ſuch a capacity, and entitle God or the divine nature (which in its fulneſs dwelt in him bodily) to all that he did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>

But is now made manifeſt by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> The meaning is, That that ſalvation eternal, which God had purpoſed to give to his people, which could not be ſeen in the purpoſe of God as ſuch, is by the appearing of Chriſt in the fleſh, and therein tranſacting and declaring this ſalvation and eternal life, abundantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And as <hi>light</hi> properly is that which makes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, ſo metaphorically it is that which <hi>comforts and rejoyceth:</hi> and as the firſt is put in oppoſition to ignorance, or the abſence of the means of knowledge; ſo the other is put in oppoſition to affliction, grief, diſtreſs, which are ſo frequently called <hi>darkneſs</hi> in Scripture, that I need not turn to their Inſtances.</p>
                     <p>And I do not in the leaſt doubt, but Chriſt the Word is here called <hi>light</hi> in both reſpects, and that eminently: for as he diſcovers the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thoughts and purpoſes of God for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man, it hath in its open hand the light of comfort; they are glad tidings, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tidings.

                     <p>Again, The <hi>true</hi> light is to be underſtood of<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> the light eminently conſidered; and ſo, though <hi>John</hi> was a true light, and by Chriſts own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony a burning and a ſhining light; and ſo the Prophets were true lights; yet Chriſt excelled them all in light, as the Sun doth the Stars. <hi>The brightneſs of his Fathers glory, and expreſs image</hi>

                     <p>The other Text is more plain to the purpoſe.<note place="margin">§ 9. Pſal 94. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>His lightnings enlightned the world, the earth ſaw and trembled.</hi> If by the earth be not meant the men on the earth, and by the world the men in the world, lightning was not likely to be ſeen by, or help them ſo to ſee, as to effect trembling; unleſs you will ſay, the meer animals were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Well then, the world was enlightned by Gods <hi>lightnings,</hi> that were totally without them; whether their ſeeing by thoſe lightnings have reſpect to the objects of their bodily eyes, or to God the object of the eye of the mind, who is in a good meaſure made known by his mighty and terrible works.</p>
                     <p>But if you will needs have the <hi>enlightning</hi> in the<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> Text, to be a bettering of the faculties of the mind, to diſcern its ſpiritual concerns; I grant, that the Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> did by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming work merit, and doth now by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit effect that great good in his people: and they have thereby better underſtandings, and a more pure and faithfull conſcience than others. But that Chriſt by being (eſſentially conſidered) in the conſcience of every man, ſhould be its enlightning, is a moſt baſe diſhonour to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty; for what is it leſs, than to render

God under no better notion, than the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faculty of a pityfull creature?</p>
                     <p>Therefore however it be expounded, it makes nothing for the <hi>Quakers light within,</hi> or rather the enlightning within, to be the Being of Chriſt.</p>

For the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt treats in the introductory Verſes of Chriſt as the univerſal Creator, and by conſequence the eyes of the body and mind (by which both are enlightned) are creatures of his framing. This is the opinion of many (Superiours to me in judgement by far) and I ſhall not contradict it; but modeſtly, and with ſubmiſſion offer my opinion. But if that be right (which all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in the world are not able to prove it cannot be ſo underſtood) the <hi>Quakers</hi> may quit this Text, as doing them no ſervice. Some have affirmed that <hi>John</hi> wrote <hi>his</hi> Goſpel, upon the occaſion of the Hereſie of <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> in denying the eternal and divine nature of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond Text they uſurp, is in <hi>Romans</hi> 10. 8.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But what ſaith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in</hi>

                        <hi>thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the Word of faith which we preach.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Text joyned with <hi>John 1. 1. In the begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,</hi> they build their Tenet upon; that Chriſt the Word is <hi>within</hi> every man; as upon the Text before agitated, they affirm, that he is within them as a ſaving light.</p>
                     <p>Let us firſt conſider, whether <hi>the Word</hi> in this Text be of the ſame ſenſe and import with that in <hi>John</hi> 1. which ſpeaks of Chriſt the perſonal Word. That it is not ſo, but the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word, is plain from theſe Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Apoſtle doth in theſe words allude<note place="margin">§. 2. Deut. 30. 14 open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> to the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 30. 14. <hi>But the Word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou maiſt do it.</hi> This <hi>Word</hi> in <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy</hi> is ſaid in Verſe 10. to be the <hi>commandments and ſtatutes which were written in the Book of the Law;</hi> which Book they had among them, and by that means had the contents of it in their heart, either in the love of it, or by rote; as we uſe to ſay, a writing is gotten by heart, when it is treaſured in the memory; and it was in their mouth, by profeſſion or diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle gives the ſame Anſwer<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> to a ſuppoſed Objection, How ſhall we know
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31145:128"/>
what is our duty? How we ſhould pleaſe God, and be bleſſed therein? ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> 'Tis no ſuch difficult thing for you to know this; for what you have gotten into your heart out of this Book of the Law, and what you have in your mouth by diſcourſe and profeſſion, that is it you ſhould obſerve and do.</p>
                     <p>So the Apoſtle, if you ſuppoſe while we preach ſalvation by Chriſt, whom you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that we preach impoſſibilities, for that the perſon of Chriſt if in Heaven, or in the grave, he is out of your reach; this will cure your miſtake, to conſider, that as the Word of the Law which <hi>Moſes</hi> taught and wrote, was in the heart and mouth to do it, ſo the Word of faith, or to be believed, is in your heart and mouth to believe and confeſs it. And this will as effectually ſave you, as if Chriſt in his perſon were in your arms, yea and more too.</p>
                     <p>And that this is his ſenſe, is plain in Verſe 9. <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Conſideration is, That the word<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> that is ſaid to be in the <hi>heart,</hi> is ſaid alſo to be in the <hi>mouth;</hi> and we all know what manner of word uſes to be in the mouth, that it is a word <hi>ſaying,</hi> or <hi>ſpeaking</hi> while it is there; ſuch as that ſpoken of in <hi>Samuel, tidings in his mouth;</hi> or that<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 25.</note> in <hi>Eſther, As the word went out of the Kings mouth:</hi> therefore it cannot be meant of Chriſt, but that <hi>ſpeech,</hi> thoſe <hi>ſayings,</hi> which are or may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as in the Goſpel when preaching, or when written.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:31145:129"/>Fourthly, Both that in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and this<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> word in the <hi>Romans,</hi> are ſaid to be in the heart and mouth of thoſe who were the Church of God, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake, and the <hi>Romans</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote; and ſo were taught by the one the truths of the Law, by the other, of the Goſpel. It ſorrily follows from hence, that it is in the hearts of all men.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Apoſtle agitating this Argument<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> farther, Verſe 14. <hi>How ſhall they call on him of whom they have not heard?</hi> He doth not tell them, Chriſt Jeſus the Word will preach himſelf, and he is in the heart; where if you will but ſtand ſtill, and wait and liſten, you ſhall hear him teach you all things, as is the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> No, but he tells them in Verſe 17. <hi>So then faith cometh by hearing,</hi> (ſo ſay the <hi>Quakers</hi> too) but of whom? Verſe 15. <hi>Of them that are ſent,</hi> them whoſe feet are beautifull for the ſake of the glad tidings of the Goſpel of peace which they bring. And theſe are more than that one perſonal, or (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> phraſe it) eternal Word, Chriſt; for they are expreſſed by <hi>they, them,</hi> which are Plurals; but Chriſt is but one.</p>
                     <p>Yet from this Text do they moſt confidently<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> avouch Chriſt the Word, who was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and who is God, to be in the heart; and not only in the hearts of the Saints and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, but in theirs alſo, who are the moſt wicked and ignorant among the ſons of men. And I have by a grand <hi>Quaker</hi> been given the lye in the Pulpit, for expounding the Word in <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

with no more but confidence, and of that enough, to prove me ſo.</p>
                     <p>There is a paſſage of <hi>William Pen</hi>'s, either in his Book called, <hi>Sandy foundation,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe, <hi>The Spirit of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. which is this, (at leaſt the matter of it) <hi>That Chriſt is moſt eminently the Word, all will agree, or none will deny.</hi> I have not time to look it. But I ſhall ſay thus much to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote that fancy: That that is moſt eminently the Word of that ſpecies, about which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, which is moſt properly ſo, though other conſiderations may render it more eminent in another kind, and not that which is ſometimes, but improperly ſo called.</p>
                     <p>Chriſt is called a <hi>Lion,</hi> a <hi>Door:</hi> 'Tis true, Chriſt as God is more eminent than all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, in Heaven and Earth; and we uſe to ſay, (and do not yet repent it) that all (uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded) good things are eminently in God. So, as there is ſtrength and courage in a Lion, with reſpect to ſtrength and courage, Chriſt may be ſaid to be eminently, moſt eminently ſtrong and couragious; but to be the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently a Lion, would be a ſtrange and untrue expreſſion of Chriſt: For, <hi>Formadat eſſe;</hi> and he that is without the form that gives the being, cannot be ſo eminently ſuch, as the meaneſt that hath the true form. And that the Word Chriſt is only ſo analogically, I have ſhewed, and the definition of a Word, in the ſecond Chapter. I deſire Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> to conſider better next time, and not think every body elſe; not a hairs breadth beyond his ſize.</p>

                     <p>A third Scripture I am willing to explain, to fence the weak againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſeductions is, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 19. We have alſo a more ſure word of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereunto ye do well to take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, untill the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>more ſure word of prophecy,</hi> refers to the voice from Heaven, which <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> heard, expreſſed in Verſe 17. and is by <hi>Peter</hi> affirmed to be rather to be credited, than that, or any other immediate revelation. By the <hi>more ſure word of prophecy,</hi> is meant thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies written in the Old Teſtament, which are called, Verſe 20. <hi>prophecy of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and are called, <hi>the light that ſhineth in a dark place,</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies ſhine, but with a dim light, (yet are welcome and give ſome light) comparatively with providences, which are the fulfilling of thoſe prophecies.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>dawning of the day,</hi> and the <hi>day-ſtar</hi> ariſing in their hearts, cannot be meant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> known and received by faith to ſalvation, and ſanctification too in ſome meaſure: for ſo he was riſen in their hearts, when the Apoſtle wrote <hi>this;</hi> or elſe he would not have ſaid them to <hi>have obtained like precious faith</hi> with him, and others the Apoſtles and Saints, which he doth in Verſe 1. as the direction of his Epiſtle.</p>
                     <p>I therefore conclude that the ſenſe is <hi>this,</hi> He<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> exhorts them to be intent on the prophecies, (whether verbal or figurative) which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:31145:130"/>
to (not only the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which they believed already, but alſo) the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing of the <hi>Moſaical rites,</hi> and conſtituting in their room the ſpiritual and <hi>Goſpel-administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> till thereby they were convinced of that truth: which is called, the <hi>dawning of the day,</hi> and the <hi>day-ſtar,</hi> with reſpect to its light, and beauty, and reality, above the <hi>Moſaical</hi> cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and rites, which were but dim night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtars in compariſon: or till they were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the day of the Goſpel-realities was come, and ſo the night-ſhadows of the Law to be done away.</p>
                     <p>The grounds I have for this Expoſition are<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> theſe, added to the former.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Peter,</hi> the Pen-man of this Epiſtle, is ſaid to be the Apoſtle to the Circumciſion, <hi>as the Goſpel</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>of Circumciſion was to Peter.</hi> And therefore we may gather, that thoſe to whom he wrote were Jews, whom the Scripture ſpeaks to be zealouſly addicted to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And this is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed, by his direction of them to the heeding of the Scripture-Prophecies, which few but the Jews were acquainted with, or did own as worth the heeding, except the converted Gentiles; of whom there was no danger that they ſhould Judaize, unleſs moved thereunto by ſuch of the Jews as needed this conviction.</p>
                     <p>This to me is ſufficient; I leave the grounds for others to conſider.</p>
                     <p>One Text more I ſhall weigh, and then I judge<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> I have done enough to ſatisfie thoſe that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, how the <hi>Quakers</hi> abuſe thoſe <hi>Texts,</hi> which are not ſo eaſily underſtood as ſome

                     </p>
                     <p>From hence they conclude, They have <hi>very Chriſt,</hi> his Being and Eſſence within them.</p>
                     <p>It will not be eaſily refuted, That the hope of glory is to be underſtood to be in them; which being a hope in Chriſt, the crucified <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was ſuch a myſtery, as the Gentliles called fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>But we preach Chriſt crucified, to the Jews a</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>For Chriſt to be <hi>in</hi> them (rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) would be no ſuch hard matter for the Gentiles to believe, (who underſtood Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical phraſes very well) as to believe ſuch a glory to be attained by faith in, and obedience to the Laws of a man, who died as a Malefactor: and that this death of his, ſhould reconcile God to man, with the addition of ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe it is a truth, That Chriſt is <hi>in</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; I ſhall therefore fay that (which with the bleſſing of the Lord to a willing mind to be inſtructed) will prove convincing.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The <hi>man</hi> Chriſt that was nail'd to the<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> Croſs, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not believe to be <hi>in</hi> them, nor that he hath a being or life, nor can he be <hi>in</hi> them in his perſon as a man, if they had a ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er faith.</p>
                     <p>For the God-head of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Being and Eſſence) every where, and every where alike. <hi>Do not I fill heaven and</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> So that with reſpect to the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31145:131"/>
infinite Being of God, who comprehends all things, he is <hi>in</hi> every thing at all times, and nothing can be void of his preſence. So that if this be it you mean, the Saints have no more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge than any other creature whatſoever. But it remains, that Chriſt is <hi>in</hi> his people by his graces, wrought by his Spirit, which is his image and likeneſs; by his love, which hath a uniting nature to its object; as we ſay, ſuch are <hi>one</hi> who love dearly: Every man <hi>is</hi> where he <hi>loves,</hi> more than where he <hi>lives.</hi> And ſo alſo where he is beloved; for that will make him frequently thought on, and a man to be ſenſible of his good or hurt, as if he himſelf enjoyed the one, or ſuffered the other. And he is ſaid to live in the hearts of his people by <hi>faith,</hi> as faith believes how lovely and deſirable he is, and ſo loves him, and works all thoſe other graces in the ſoul which are his image; and do as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſs the ſoul for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to his uſe and intereſt, as a faithfull friend can do. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Text,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith, that</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph 3. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>ye being rooted and grounded in love,</hi> &amp;c. You know what the Scripture ſaith of faith, that it <hi>worketh by love.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that in very deed, Chriſt both as God and Man, doth live in <hi>all</hi> his Saints, but not in his perſon, but by the manifeſtations of his love and glory; his works and image in, and on the ſoul. And this is enough to ſatisfie thoſe that are ſober, and are contented with, and rejoyce in thoſe priviledges which God affords to his children; which are enough to render them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31145:132"/>
bleſſed, rather than thoſe which pride and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance will chooſe, like our firſt Parents; to be as Gods, and pay dear for the deluſion.</p>

                     <p>It may refer to the Apoſtles, in whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Apoſtle ſpeaks, (though he himſelf were not concerned with them) who did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dream of being great in the world, and ſharing with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in an earthly kingdom; but now being better informed; and attained to a higher and more noble degree of ſpiritual un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings and affections, they were crucified to thoſe childiſh and carnal deſigns, and their conſideration of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his glorified body, and his exaltation in Heaven at the <hi>Fathers</hi> right hand, did raiſe their ſouls to a longing after a further and compleat view of his glory, and ſharing with <hi>him</hi> in his heavenly Kingdom. This is ſuitable to the eighth Verſe of this Chapter, which hath ſome Contexture with

Verſe 16. <hi>We are confident I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> Then Chriſt was not in them as in his Heaven and Glory.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I beſeech you who are engaged<note place="margin">§. 1. 3.</note> with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> from the good opinion you have of <hi>their</hi> Tenets, or from other reſpects which may quickly produce their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; do not think it a light thing, to diſown him who muſt be your Redeemer, or you muſt for ever periſh; or that the difference between the <hi>true Chriſt,</hi> and any thing elſe that is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is ſo ſmall, that you may wink and chooſe, no danger of miſcarrying which ever be your foundation. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins;</hi> was the ſaying of truth it ſelf, and he was not the <hi>light within,</hi> but the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who was then in <hi>Judea,</hi> and no where elſe, who is now in Heaven, not on earth.

                     <p>My firſt <hi>Argument</hi> I ſhall firſt proſecute, and with that perſpicuity, as will be apparent to all that are not more blind than Bats.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> I ſhall manage in the firſt place, the <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> of which I ſhall fully prove.</p>
                     <p>And although ſome have attempted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by ſhewing the natural faculties of light <hi>in</hi> man, to be far ſhort of what <hi>they</hi> aſcribe to it, I ſhall not go their way to work, for ſo long as the <hi>Quakers</hi> hold their <hi>light within</hi> to be <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> 'tis vain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it to leſs than infinite.</p>
                     <p>And I having to do with thoſe, whoſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>light within</hi> depends on ſuch a conceit, I ſhall prove the light <hi>within</hi> every man not to be <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the proof of the firſt Propoſition, I muſt prove, That the light <hi>within</hi> every man is not <hi>God:</hi> and in ſo doing, all that is requiſite to the firſt Propoſition will be diſcharged.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But the light within every man hath not power in it to diſpoſe of the wayes of a man:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore, <hi>It is not God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Propoſition will be granted, by all who own the omnipotence of God: take away that, and you un-God him.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Propoſition I prove from <hi>Jer. 10. 23. O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf, it is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps.</hi> If it be not <hi>in</hi> man, it is not <hi>within</hi> man: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that to be <hi>within</hi> me, that is not <hi>in</hi> me; though that may be ſaid to be <hi>in</hi> me, that is not a part of me. So then, if the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> were not miſtaken, there is nothing <hi>in</hi> man, or <hi>within</hi> man, that hath the power to diſpoſe, or wiſdom to direct his ſteps; but he may either fail in directing unwiſely, or for want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to perform, what is well directed or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Therefore I muſt conclude againſt the <hi>Quakers, That the light in every man is not God.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>You ſee here plainly, that their <hi>reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> is but their <hi>regeneration,</hi> and this is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled while they are in the body.</p>

                     <p>And that which may put you out of doubt, that this is their Tenet, I can prove by many Witneſſes that <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> one of their chief Miſleaders, (after much importunity to ſpeakhis mind plainly in this matter) did affirm, <hi>That he did not believe that his Body ſhould riſe again after its Death.</hi>

                     <p>I never knew any of them affirm the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> of the Body, intending there by the Body which is ſuch in a proper ſenſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation: I have often diſcourſed them about it, and when I have propoſed the queſtion ſo plainly, that they had no room to evade by their allegories; their anſwers have been, <hi>Thou art upon the Catch, we ſhall not anſwer thee.</hi> Or <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with that in <hi>Job, If a Man die ſhall he live again?</hi> and <hi>as the Beaſt dieth, ſo dieth Man.</hi> But when all their Arguments are anſwered, which they think are lodged in theſe Scriptures; their

                     <p>For that in <hi>Job, if a Man die ſhall he live again?</hi> the meaning can be no more than this, (if <hi>Job</hi> underſtood himſelf) he ſhall not live again in this world, and in that ſtate in which he liveth before death, which is plain from what he moſt confidently affirms, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 26, 27. <hi>And though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my skin Worms deſtroy</hi> this body, <hi>yet in my</hi> fleſh <hi>ſhall I ſee God: whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine</hi>

For if God be pleaſed to acquaint us in his word, that there ſhall be ſuch a reſurrection, and that it ſhall be then ſpiritual and incorruptible; it is our duty to take his word, and to underſtand<note place="margin">§ 4.</note> what he is pleaſed to manifeſt to us of this great truth. Another text they frame an objection out of is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 19. 36, 37. <hi>Thou Fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it die; and that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be.</hi> I anſwer, that the Apoſtle doth not call <hi>him a Fool,</hi> who enquires concerning the reſurrection (which is the common charge of the Quakers from this Text) but him that doubts of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, from its ſeeming impoſſibility, and for the ſameneſs of the body: thought not in all circumſtances, yet that it ſhall be the ſame eſſence, is plain from the relative <hi>it</hi> all along, which hath for it antecedent the <hi>body of fleſh and blood,</hi> wherein we <hi>now</hi> live and are viſible to the

                     <p>I have met with ſome of them, who could not<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> or would not underſtand it of the ſame body, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 51. <hi>We ſhall all be changed:</hi> From whence they conclude, it cannot be the <hi>ſame</hi> body. I would ask ſuch, if they would be content to be refuſed their debts owing to them when young, being demanded when old; or owing when well, if demanded when ſick; or contracted when they were not Quakers, and demanded when Quakers? for as to the latter, they will affirm they are changed, and that from natural to ſpiritual. But I ſuppoſe in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they will ſhew more ſagacity, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to believe that a change <hi>in</hi> a perſon is not the change <hi>of</hi> a perſon; and for all thoſe changes, they are the ſame perſons ſtill, to whom the money both was, and is due.</p>
                     <p>I might ſay moreover, that if it be another,<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> and not the ſame body that ſhall be raiſed again, it is a contradiction; for then it muſt not be a reſurrection but a creation; and who will gueſs ſo wide of the mark, that God ſhould treate another body, which was never in this world, and did either good or evil, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded or puniſhed in ſtead of the body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in thoſe actions, which in the mean time ſhall be free among the dead, and buried in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting forgetfulneſs?</p>
                     <p>Some of them have denyed the reſurrection of the body of Chriſt, and ſtood by their error, upon the account of his entering the room when the doors were ſhut, and his appearing in ſuch
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31145:151"/>
forms, that his Diſciples did not know him. To which I ſhall ſay only this, that Chriſt as God could convey himſelf how and where he pleaſed, and that the Diſciples not knowing him, was not becauſe he was not in the ſame form as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but becauſe <hi>their eyes were withholden, that they ſhould not ſee him,</hi> Luke 24. 16</p>

                     <p>The woful companions and conſequences of the error here charged on the Quakers, and proved to be theirs, take a few of; which are enough and great enough, to make any who are not reſolved to be Atheiſts or Infidels; to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the firſt motions to ſuch a deluſion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This tenet of the Quakers doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eat out the heart and vitals of all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if the dead riſe not, <hi>Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we ſhall die.</hi> All Religion obliges with a reſpect to the life to come. The opinion of <hi>no reſurrection</hi> lets looſe the reins to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſenſuality, an Epicure is then the wiſeſt Man.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, this error renders it a meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and a piece of fooliſh obſtinacy to perſiſt in the profeſſion and practice of any thing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, when indangering our temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments. <hi>If the dead riſe not at all—and why ſtand we here in jeopardy every hour?</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 29. 30.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it utterly ſubverts and makes Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of the faith of the Goſpel, that looking at a priſe and reward on the other ſide the Grave. <hi>But if there be no reſurrection of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

but though this of a future ſtate of reward or puniſhment, be the vitals and end of all Religion, yet they do not ſo much as touch upon it.

'Tis ſaid of the Goſpel; which is the Chriſtian diſpenſation; that it brings <hi>life and immortality to light;</hi> what was in the Scriptures of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more ſeldom and obſcurely expreſſed, is the very ſcope of the Goſpel or new Teſtament the peculiar of Chriſtianity: but then certainly Quakeriſm is no Chriſtianity, that is ſo ſilent in this matter.

                     <p>I wonder not therefore, that this is ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their ſaying, That, <hi>if we are not perfect here, we ſhall never be perfect.</hi>

                     <p>It is eaſily deduceable from their more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſed principles, that they deny and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own a bleſſedneſs or miſery in another world: For if they deny the body to have life any more after it is dead, and turned to duſt; and that the Soul and Spirit are of the being of God, and that as the body returns to its former duſt from whence it came, and never revives again, ſo the Soul and Spirit returns into God its firſt being, (all which I have already proved) what then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be the ſubject of happineſs or miſery? e'ne nothing at all, except God, and he is not man. <hi>E.

Why did you not ſay, or to turn them into Suns, Moons, and Stars? which were all out as much in the Text as the other: and I dare ſay, ſome of your Friends would have taken themſelves bound to believe it, who find no fault with greater abſurdities, dropt from their admired inſpired Dictators: but</p>

it to his own uſe, manifeſting himſelf in it, to thoſe who waited on his Ordinances there ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. But now the place is void of all the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of that preſence.</p>
                     <p>I deny not, I doubt not, but the preſence of God<note place="margin">§ 7.</note> by his Spirit, in and with his people is much more glorious than that Type poſeſſed: yea ſuch a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of union and Glory; as will be matter of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual exerciſe, and delight for ever: yet it is moſt certainly no more his eſſential Preſence, than is every where. The difference is his being related to, actuating of, effecting in, and manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to, and union with the Souls of his people; ſo as none in the world but they, are bleſſed withal. And here in the Saints are ſo happy; they may well be content, and not put the name of the Godhead (in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe) on theſe his bleſſings. Such conceits are the natural ſourſe, (and have been) of opinions, and practices diſhonourable to God, and unworthy of his Grace.</p>
                     <p>Another fallacy in your arguings is from the<note place="margin">§ 8.</note> Spirits teachings indefinitely, to the Spirits teaching univerſally: at leaſt all that concerns the duty of the People of God in religious things.

                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:31145:172"/>The firſt is a Propheſie of the pouring out of the Spirit, <hi>Joel 2. 28.—I will pour out my Spirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. Let us conſider how much this will befriend them: They will not ſay (I am perſwaded) that all fleſh (in the Text) is to be underſtood without any limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all; for then Sheep and Oxen muſt propheſie: nor yet will they allow that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhall be poured forth upon all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, old and young, without ſome limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for then the moſt wicked, and ſottiſh muſt be of the number; yea, thoſe who are the keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Adverſaries to their Doctrine (among which I doubt not they will give me a room:) but if they ſay, every one hath the light within, which is a Principle capable of this Character, if they gave heed to it, and at ſet it liberty; I anſwer, ſo had all men this principle ever ſince the world began (if what they ſay themſelves be true) but the Propheſie ſaith, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs after thoſe days:</hi> So that it muſt needs be meant of a time then to come: but if it be to be underſtood (as without doubt it is) as well of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, and not all univerſally, as of ſome Age or Ages, and not all univerſally: They muſt bring ſome proof that they are the perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended; or give us leave to tell them they have here in ſtollen the words of the Lord, which belonged not to them, by falſly applying it to themſelves: And if the Expoſition which <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle gives of this Propheſie be worth the heeding, it was fulfilled (at leaſt in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) 1600 years ſince; and whether the world
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31145:172"/>
ſhall ever hereafter behold the like in that part of it, I ſhall not aſſert: <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 16, 17. and ſo on; But, <hi>this is that which was ſpoken by the Prophet Joel,</hi> &amp;c. What? <hi>They ſpake with other Tongues</hi> (about fifteen in number) <hi>the wonderful works of God;</hi> and this was uſhered in by Signs from Heaven; <hi>A ſound, as of a mighty ruſhing wind, cloven: tongues like as of fire;</hi> all of which were witneſſes ſent by God for the confirmation of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom they preached to be God's <hi>Meſſias</hi> before promiſed.</p>
                     <p>But let us ſee how neer the Quakers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> to this evidence. That they began with a noiſe, yea, a ruſhing noiſe, we know; but that it was a ſound from Heaven, we are ſure of the contrary: that they have tongues, and fiery and cloven-tongues alſo, we ſhall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not deny; but theſe are not ſuch <hi>cloven-tongues, like as of fire ſitting on them,</hi> and appearing to the bodily eyes of others: Nor do they ſpeak variety of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, (though ſome of them have gone into forein Countries, with a confidence they ſhould be gifted with ſtrange Languages, but their Spirit deceived them.) Thoſe in the Text, in thoſe Languages or Tongues ſpake the wonderful works of God; but the Quakers with their native<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Language only ſpeak the amazing deluſions of Satan. The perſons in the Text had and uſed theſe gifts to confirm and evidence Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be the Chriſt, 22 <hi>verſe,</hi> and that ſame Jeſus to be exalted by the right hand of God, <hi>verſe</hi> 32, 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Quakers improve their gifts (with al their might) to diſclaim that man Chriſt

                        <p>Characters of the Perſons who were Chriſts Apoſtles, and preached or wrote the Goſpel by Inſpiration of God, which we call the Scripture, or Word of God.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>They had an immediate Miſſion and Call from without them by Jeſus Chriſt, to preach, and declare the Goſpel. That Call, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which the Apoſtles had, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 16. to the end of the Chapter, was from without; it was Chriſt who converſed with them, and was the Object of their bodily eyes: It was that Chriſt whom the women held by the feet, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and his Call (as his perſon) was without them; the ſound of which was received by their bodily ears, in thoſe words, <hi>ver. 18, 19. And Jeſus came, and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All power is given to me in heaven, and in earth: Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> &amp;c. And it is a ſtrong Argument to prove this immediate outward Call to be eſſential to the Apoſtolical Office and Power, that when by <hi>Judas</hi>'s fall the number was imperfect, he that was choſen in his room, was choſen and called by an outward Call; the Spirit of God determining by a <hi>Lot, Matthias</hi> to be the twelfth Apoſtle; as Chriſt did the reſt by his voice
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31145:174"/>
without them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 24, &amp; 25 <hi>verſes:</hi> they had a large meaſure of the Spirit within, (and <hi>Matthias</hi> in particular,) but that was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                     <p>Yea the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was born out of due time, had this immediate outward Call when Chriſt appeared to him in that glorious and terrible form, Acts 26. 13. <hi>At mid day, O King, I ſaw in the way</hi> (not in the heart, or I in the way ſaw) <hi>a light from heaven above the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sun;</hi> (the light in the Quakers, I am ſure, would be ſeen by any who are not bodily blind, if it were ſuch <hi>ſhining round about me</hi> (then it could not be a light only within) <hi>and them that journeyed with me;</hi> if it had not been without him, they could not have ſeen it. Verſe 14. <hi>I heard a Voice ſpeaking unto me,</hi> (not within me) <hi>I am Jeſus,</hi> Chap. 10. Ver. 22. <hi>Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth:</hi> and I am ſure the light within is not of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Theſe things are enough to prove the Apoſtles had all of them an outward Call, or a Call from Chriſt without them to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Apoſtleſhip; and that the Quakers apoſtleſhip and inſpired miniſtry is far from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical.</p>
                     <p>They were all ſuch as had ſeen, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> with the Lord Jeſus in an outward viſible form to the bodily ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>And that I take to be the literal ſenſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that Scripture, 1 <hi>John 1. 1. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of Life.</hi> All theſe expreſſions cannot with any ſhew
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31145:175"/>
of reaſon be conſtrued of a mental, or ſpiritual converſe with Chriſt as an object of faith, but muſt be underſtood of the exerciſe of the bodily ſenſes and faculties upon the viſible humane nature of the Lord Jeſus. And if it be objected, that it is ſaid this Object was from the beginning, which his humane Nature and body could not be; I anſwer, There is a communication of both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the perſon of Chriſt, by which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and concerns of the one are attributed to the other, as I might give abundant proof of. But I will inſtance in one which may be ſufficient: Acts 20. 28.—<hi>To feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud.</hi> God is not a being made up of fleſh and bloud, but a pure impaſſible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: yet Chriſt being God as well as man, the bloud of his Man-hood is called the bloud of God.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable, that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> brings theſe proofs of his Apoſtleſhip in the front of his Epiſtle, <hi>as</hi> being neceſſary for obtaining Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to what follows.</p>
                     <p>To put all out of doubt, conſider what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, 1 Cor. 9 ch. 1 ver. <hi>Am I not an Apoſtle? am I not free? have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt our Lord?</hi> Some did probably object againſt <hi>Pauls</hi> Apoſtleſhip, becauſe he had not ſeen Chriſt in the fleſh, as all the reſt of the Apoſtles had done: but he anſwers this Objection; <hi>Have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt our Lord?</hi> It could not be meant of ſeeing him by the ſpiritual eye of Faith; for ſo all the Saints have ſeen the Lord: that is common to the weakeſt babe in the Faith. And
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31145:175"/>
where did he ſee him, but in the way to <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus?</hi> Compare the fore-cited Text with 1 Cor. 15. 8 ver. <hi>And laſt of all he was ſeen of me alſo, as of one born out of due time.</hi> He was not born a Saint, or Believer out of due time; for conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will be in ſeaſon to the end of the world: But he was born an Apoſtle out of due time, the Lord Jeſus viſibly appearing to him to that end in an extraordinay ſeaſon. Thus we ſee that to Apoſtleſhip the ſight of the perſon of Chriſt, as an outward viſible object to the bodily ſenſe, is neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>A third diſtinguiſhing Character is, they were<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> all enabled to work Miracles; ſuch Miracles as were neither in ſecret for the place, nor doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the matter. I ſhould but waſte time and paper to give inſtances of this: the Hiſtories of the Evangeliſts, and Acts of the Apoſtles will furniſh you with enough. The Quakers having been conſcious of the neceſſity of this, have ſome of them pretended to Miracles to credit their Apoſtolical pretended inſpirations; but none can they prove. Some have attempted ſuch like performances, but have failed in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; ſo that, if we will not believe them for their bold aſſerting, we are like to have no better evidence: and he that is ſo ſilly as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on ſo feeble a ground, I am ſure his faith ſtands not only below the power and wiſdom of God, but the right reaſon of man.</p>
                     <p>And this muſt needs be a human faith (in the moſt ſordid ſenſe) which hath not any divine evidence for its ſupport. We can by the grace of God give a reaſon of that hope in us which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:31145:176"/>
is grounded on Scripture-verity, becauſe we can prove that it is the Word of God, which was ſent from him by the Meſſengers by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and furniſhed to that end; Acts 19. 13. <hi>Jeſus we know, and</hi> Paul <hi>we know; but who are ye?</hi>

                        <p>The Apoſtles as they were commiſſionated to teach all Nations, ſo they were furniſhed with Tongues and Languages in a ſupernatural way; by which they could ſpeak to the underſtandings of any Nation or people to whom they were ſent; Acts 2. 8. <hi>And how we hear every man in our own Tongue, wherein we were born.</hi> And it is remarkable, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was gifted this way above all, or moſt; he being the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (more eminently) to the Gentile-world, and travelled more foreign Countries than any of the other, that we read of.</p>
                        <p>I cannot but wonder at the blindneſs of the Quakers, who give it as a mark to the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry (denying and diſdaining all others) not to be confined to a certain place in the ordinary exerciſe thereof; but as the Apoſtles, to have no leſs than the Univerſe for their Biſhoprick: while it is apparent, that they do not more out-ſtrip others in pretences of Spiritual and ſupernatural Gifts, than they come ſhort of them in viſible
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31145:176"/>
qualifications for the miniſterial imployment, eſpecially the knowledge of the Tongues: and who ever among them underſtand any Tongue, or can ſpeak or write it, beſides their native Mother-tongue; let them ſay it if they dare, that they came not by it by natural and ordinary means.</p>
                        <p>And if God had given them an Apoſtolical Call and Gifts, ſurely this of Tongues would have made ſome ſigne and noiſe of it; for God never calleth to any Goſpel-Office and work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, where he doth not afford abilities for the diſcharge of it. If the Quakers had the Gift of Tongues, who direct their Pamphlets to all Princes and Potentates; to every Creature, and all Nations in the World; ſurely ſome of them by that Gift would have preached their Doctrines to foreign Nations: But ſome have attempted it, and ſped ſo ill, as to become dumb preachers in other Countries: Others have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more wit than to make the adventure; yet their Writings are full ſtuffed with the bold aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting of their Apoſtolical Call, Gifts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations.</p>

                     <p>For if the Apoſtle had received what he here expreſſed by Divine inſpiration, or the Spirit of the Lord immediately inſpiring, it would have been not only unneceſſary, but very much inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the infallibility and authority of the Spirit of God, to have made his judgment bear a part with it.</p>
                     <p>Yea, it had been an uſurping on the Divine Spirit, which an exerciſe of our judging faculty concerning its truth or falſhood, muſt needs be; where it is evident that the Spirit of God doth its part, by way of immediate inſpiration; to which ready and full credit ought to be given without heſitation.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>That Divine inſpiration whereby the Apoſtles and Prophets (as ſuch) were illuminated, came in without the uſe of the bodily ſenſes, as recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of outward Objects, and carrying them to the rational and conſidering faculties, to make
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31145:178"/>
concluſions from them: and this is properly immediate Divine inſpiration, or revelation.</p>
                     <p>But Divine Truths received by the Saints (as Saints, ordinarily) are received by ſuch means as are Objects to the bodily ſenſes, as ſignificative ſounds to the ear, viſible Objects to the eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> let the Quakers or any other ſhew me, if they can, that the knowledge of God comes ordinarily to men by any other way without theſe: <hi>Faith comes by hearing</hi> (that is, ordinarily; for a Babe may have the habits of ſaving faith, whoſe hearing ferves little to that purpoſe) or by reading: &amp; that knowledg of God which the Heathen had, or might have had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word revealed handed to them as to us, it was by conſidering the works of God's Creation and Providence; which were the Books where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God wrote to them many Leſſons concerning him, and their duty. So that in few words, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being illuminated by inſpiration, it was firſt within them; others have it firſt from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; at leaſt in the premiſes from whence the underſtanding aſſiſted by God, infers Truths.</p>
                     <p>The great Objection of the Quakers againſt<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> the later Poſition is from his Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20. becauſe <hi>that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them: for the inviſible things of him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The words <hi>in them</hi> in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, are either <hi>in</hi> or <hi>among them;</hi> the later ſenſe is to me the moſt probable, becauſe, that while the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Gentile-world were ſo brutiſh, that they little regarded or underſtood any thing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31145:178"/>
of God; but were ſo beſotted with ſenſuality, that they underſtood and minded nothing but what might gratifie a blind, and impetuous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: ſome among them whoſe intellects were better imployed, came by the knowledge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things concerning God, which they not only taught, but left in writing as a witneſs to Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>But to put all out of doubt, the 20 <hi>verſe</hi> ſpeaks what I affirm plainly: <hi>For the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead,</hi> &amp;c. Here you have an account what may be known of God by the Heathen, who had neither revelation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate to themſelves, nor handed to them from others by the Word heard, or read: <hi>viz. the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal power and Godhead:</hi> and that which they were condemned for, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. was not for not knowing, or practiſing what had relation to the Mediator, or not believing the word of promiſe, which never was within the reach of their ears; but for their miſcarriages againſt God the Creator, whom they might, and ought to have known, and acknowledged. God is in his eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Being, the inviſible God; but he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt among them, How? From the Creation of the World, by the things that are made. Take another Text for the confirmation of my Expoſition of this, <hi>Act. 14. 17. Nevertheleſs he left not himſelf without witneſs, in that he did good, and gave us rain from Heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons,</hi> &amp;c. They were not without witneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Divine Being, and Attributes of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31145:179"/>
Mercy and Goodneſs; yet if the rain, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Seaſons, were without them; the witneſs was without them before it was within them.</p>
                     <p>But for the Quakers pretences of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of Divine things to be by immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Spirit to them, when we hear of Pagans and Heathen who never had the leaſt notice of, or from the Scripture, talk of Jeſus Chriſt, a crucified Redeemer, and the Promiſes, and Covenant of God; we may a little liſten to them: but for a people who live where the Scriptures are ſo much known, to talk Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-phraſes, and Goſpel-phraſes; and then tell us, they had it all by Divine revelation imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate to themſelves, is as ungrateful and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, as for thoſe who were born and bred in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and have learned their Mother-tongue from their childhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after 30 or 40 years, to affirm they learned every word of it by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſpiration, or could have known it as perfectly if man had never taught them; while in the mean time thoſe forem Languages they never heard ſpoken, they can neither ſpeak, nor underſtand one ſentence of, if it would ſave the world.</p>
                     <p>Again, Thoſe Goſpel-illuminations for the<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> matter which are by immediate inſpiration, are beyond the utmoſt reach of our natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the mind (though ſanctified) to attain by their improvement: and therefore it is ſaid to be, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>A third Difference is, that Apoſtolical illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and immediately inſpired are not habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; they are not the more conſtant frame of the ſoul, but have their fluxes, not as Springs or running Rivers, or Tydes, which have their eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and flowings, yet the chanel alway plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully ſupplied; but as bourns and flouds that ſometimes riſe high; yet the grounds they cover for a while, are ſometimes and ordinarily a long time dry, and no appearance remaining of thoſe inundations.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous evils than that would have been; were often the ſubject-matter of their ſharp reprehenſions.</p>
                     <p>Let any Quaker, of other, give me or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> the like ſatisfaction of their being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inſpired, and they ſhall have my leave to hold ſuch an Opinion of it.</p>
                     <p>But for thoſe inſpirations which, they ſay, many had before the Scriptures were written, the mention of their time will give full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; it will be a poor Argument to prove men are now inſpired as they, conſidering they had not the revealed written Word at all, and we have it ſo full, that all things neceſſary for any to know, are therein included, and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing I muſt reply to is, what the Quakers frequently Object, <hi>viz.</hi> That we make the Scripture the judge of the Spirit, whereas the Spirit gave forth the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, this is for want of judgment in the<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> Objectors.</p>
                     <p>Far be it from us to bring the to-be-adored
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31145:183"/>
Spirit of God to any mans bar for judgment to be paſſed on it, or any thing that is his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Work or Word: all we profeſs in this matter to make the Scripture a judge or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of is, whether this or that be the mind of the Spirit or no? but if once it appear to be the Voice and Mind of the Spirit, we profeſs it our duty to reverence and ſubmit to it.</p>
                     <p>And we being certain that the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were given forth from God, and that God is not oppoſite to himſelf; we conclude that what is contrary to the Scripture, cannot be the Word of the Spirit; becauſe then the Spirit ſhould bear witneſs againſt it ſelf; and the word of the Spirit would be contrary to the word of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And moreover, if any ſhall pretend to aboliſh<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> (by the Authority or inſpiration of the Spirit) thoſe Ordinances and Inſtitutions which were ſetled by Chriſt, or Chriſt in his Apoſtles; it would be unreaſonable to credit them, without the ſame Teſtimonials (ſuch Miracles as they wrought) by which they were erected. But the Quakers are far enough from ſhewing ſuch a zeal for their pretended Miniſtry and Order, And further, we are obliged not to receive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel (and that by the Holy Spirit) though an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach it: and we are warned not to believe any other as Truth Divine againſt it, though many Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhould be wrought for confirmation.</p>
                     <p>The third thing I muſt reply to is, that our<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> knowledge of the mind of God by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is uncertain. I anſwer:</p>
                     <p>If you mean a knowledge of all Gods mind,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31145:184"/>
you are not to expect it; it you mean all that is there contained, it is not neceſſary: and you may go to Heaven, and do your duty, without ſuch a vaſt knowledge; and if you endeavour it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in your places, and as God hath given you the means, it will not be your ſin, much leſs your condemnation, that you do not know it all. Sure there are many Babes in Chriſt's Family, yet they are Children, and all are firſt Babes: and that would be a Monſter never yet ſeen in the Church of Chriſt, a new-born Babe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mind of God contained in the Scripture, as fully as the moſt ſerious Chriſtians of the longeſt ſtanding! Jeſus Chriſt himſelf grew in wiſdom, and in ſtature: and I intreat you be content to leave a little of the mind of God, to be found out in the Scripture by the generations to come.</p>
                     <p>If you mean our knowledge of the mind of the Spirit is uncertain, ſo far as it is neceſſary for our living in an acceptable manner to God, ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, and to attain Heaven at laſt; it is a great miſtake: for if pride, luſt, and idleneſs ſtand not in our way, there is no perſon (that hath a few grains of Reaſon) but may underſtand ſo much of the mind of God by the Scripture, as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him to know to his eternal ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>But if you talk of the Scriptures being a dead<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> Letter, and not moving, and teaching with a voice, or impulſe, without our reading, praying, and applying it in the Lords ſtrength, you talk at a ſtrange random; as if God had given us our eyes and brains, only to look after the world, and the things thereof; but in the knowledge of God we muſt be meerly paſſive.</p>

            <head>A KEY TO THE Quakers Uſurped, and (to moſt) UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASES.</head>
            <p>THere is not any thing in the Quakers Method of deluding, which doth more tend to the inſnaring of unwary Souls, than their aſſerting their falſe, Antichriſtian, and Anti-Scriptural Tenets, under Scripture-Words and Phraſes, and in thoſe very Terms wherein are expreſſed the Truths of God; while in the mean time, they mean nothing leſs than their true import, and what People (who are not well acquainted with their Tenets) ſuppoſe them to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31145:185"/>
mean. By this Artifice they beget a good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themſelves and Errours with too many, and by degrees ſo vitiate their Principles, that in a ſhort time they are prepared to embrance the groſſeſt errors bare-faced.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore (as a work of no ſmall uſe to ſuch who are attempted by them, or who have a Call or opportunity to deal with them for their convincing or confuting; or the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others who are in danger by them) give you a true and candid account of their ſenſe and meaning of a multitude of Scripture and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Phraſes, which they utter and apply to their falſhoods: and alſo of their new-coin'd Words and Phraſes, which are more peculiar to their Sect and Notions. I diſpoſe them Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betically, for their more eaſie finding on any occaſion.</p>

            <p>And for that, they who weigh what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the body of the Book, may find ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the moſt if not all of them.</p>

            <head>THE CONCL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SION.</head>
            <p>I Have not in this Treatiſe dealt with the more minute and light Errors and Abſurdities of the Quakers, becauſe they would amount to too
<pb facs="tcp:31145:200"/>
large a Volume for this Subject; and I love not to tythe Mint, Annis and Cummin, where weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters call forth my thoughts. Where the Lord ſhall make what hath been written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and effectual, thoſe Superſtructures and Appendices of the conceit of Perfection, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſober uſe of civil Ceremonies, unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcrupling at modeſt Ornaments, Pedantick Words, Phraſes and Geſtures, obſtinate Jewiſh and Ceremonious reſpect to this or that place for Worſhip, and a multitude more, will quickly and eaſily diſſolve of themſelves.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but all whoſe Judgments are not in Captivity to the ſillieſt Errors, will conclude with me, that <hi>Quakeriſm is no Chriſtianity,</hi> yea, <hi>Not conſiſtent with Chriſtianity;</hi> being no more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of dwelling together in one Breaſt, than light and darkneſs in their abſolute and ſupream Dominion. I am perſwaded that all who have honeſt meanings among the Quakers, little think that in turning to Quakeriſm, they turn Chriſtianity out of Doors: yet it is a truth, a ſad truth, that calls for more ſerious notice than themſelves, or moſt others afford it, who profeſs (and that ſincerely) a love to Truth and Souls.</p>
            <p>My greateſt diſcouragement in writing this Treatiſe, was from the ſenſe of the Quakers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the reach of Scripture and Reaſon, to almoſt, or altogether a ſpiritual <hi>delirium.</hi> Yet I was not without ſome encouragement, from my hopes that the Lord would bleſs it to the informing and ſecuring of many whoſe feet are yet out of their ſnare. I have not a little been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31145:201"/>
to read in their Authors ſuch Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as prompt us to deveſt our ſelves of being men, that we may be Chriſtians: As if Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Spiritual, God and the Scriptures, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Chriſtianity were mortal foes. I intended a Chapter by it ſelf to demonſtrate Quakeriſm to be no Chriſtianity, from its exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding right Reaſon, any thing called Reaſon from having to do in the ſearch after Chriſtianity, its choice, Defence or Approbation.</p>
            <p>I care not if I collect a few, for my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſatisfaction.</p>
