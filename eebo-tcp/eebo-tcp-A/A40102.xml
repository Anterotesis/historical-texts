            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The EPISTLE to the People called QUAKERS, from the Author.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Suppose that many of you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a little Book, called <hi>A Friendly Conference, between a Minister and a Parishioner of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining unto Quakerism;</hi> However you esteem of the Arguments, yet I hope that some of you have the charity to believe, that no by end, no indirect purpose whatsoever, induc't me to the publication of it. No, the searcher of all hearts bears me witness, that I was mov'd to the undertaking from the truest Principle of charity and kindness, to discover to you your miserable mistakes, the Sanay bottome upon which your Tenents are founded, and the real danger your poor Souls are in, by your obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate persisting in so desperate a schism.</p>
            <p>Though (Blessed be God) this Book has had its wished effect upon some, yet others have loaded it with all the calumnies they well could invent, misrepresenting both its design, &amp; argument; And more openly one <hi>Thomas Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> in a late virulent Pamphlet, Nick-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Truth prevailing and detecting Error—,</hi> venting therein not only his spleen against me, but against the whole Constitution and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it is now happily establisht by the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb facs="tcp:57744:4"/>
of this Nation. In Communion of which Church our Pious Ancestors both liv'd and dy'd, and your selves too were both born and baptized.</p>
            <p>When I found such an immodest and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Title, I began to suspect, what after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was confirmed to me, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that He had placed the empty Name of <hi>Truth</hi> Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant in the Title page, but nothing of the thing in the Book it self.</p>
            <p>Had I not understood, with what mighty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause my Adversaries Book was received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, I had not given my self the trouble of this Vindication, but answer'd him in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as in all probability I shall do, for the time to come.</p>
            <p>I had drawn my Vindication much larger than now I present it to the World (being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unwilling to allow My Antagonist any one Paragraph in his whole Book) which I found had swelled the Volume too big; wherefore I delayed the publication hereof in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, fearing otherwise that my Book would be too large for the Busie to read, and too dear for the Poor to buy.</p>
            <p>This Book had sooner seen the light, had not some of my Sheets as they were sent to the Press, unfortunately miscarried: And though it come somewhat late, yet I hope not unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabby or less welcome to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57744:4"/>
You will find me often complaining of the Dishonesty of my Adversary in mis-stating My Book in many places of it; and also of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity in pretending to answer it, when in truth He has passed by the most material passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it. If therefore you would impartially judge between us, then compare the Books to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and you will easily discern whether He has done me right. Next compare his Book with this reply, then do you judge, whether or no I have done him right.</p>
            <p>I had been much larger upon the Subjects of Inspiration and Tithes, Had not <hi>T. E.</hi> been taken particularly to task by two other Pens, which you will find me mentioning afterwards.</p>
            <p>You will find that I generally make use of <hi>T. E</hi>'s own Authors, but how honestly He has represented them, as some others of your own party, from whom he has taken them, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in its place.</p>
            <p>I know not what opinion you may have of me, but if I know my own Soul, it is your Eternal interest and welfare, that I have been aiming at, as well in this, as my former undertaking; that I may shew you, how ridiculous and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical your Tenents are; and if I sometimes search into your Wounds till they smart, it's more that I may be faithful to you, than any ways for to please my self.</p>
            <p>You will find that sometimes I mention the
<pb facs="tcp:57744:5"/>
sayings and actions of some Quakers, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their Names, which I do for this only reason, that I may shew not my unkindness to your Persons, but Opinions.</p>
            <p>I wish you would seriously consider, with what woful mediums and artifices your Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers divert you from the truth, and hoodwink you in your errors. For when any has attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your Conversion, then must they be traduc't with Slanders, and Calumnies: As <hi>such an one is, or was a Presbyterian, or an Army-Chaplain,</hi> &amp;c.—Thus do they accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the passions, and uncharitable humours of Men, and take Sanctuary in Dunghils and Puddles: as if they thought your Religion bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defended by Dirt than Arguments: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>T. E.</hi> threatens me with an <hi>Adjunct</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">dolus latet in generalibus.</note> in case I set not my Name to my next: But what he means, I know not, having (I thank God) no particular guilt, that in the least makes me concern'd at it. I am sensible that I have Infirmities as well as other Men, yet I can modestly say, that I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge my self in any thing which I know to be ill. But I wonder why the publishing of my Name must excuse me? And seeing he knows me so well (as he makes his Reader believe) why has he not the Charity, and Christianity, to inform me what this Adjunct is, that I may amend it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57744:5"/>
But let him publish his Adjunct when he pleases, My Comfort is, that neither He, nor his <hi>Master,</hi> can go any further than God is pleas'd to suffer them: only let me advise <hi>T. E.</hi> (for his credits sake) not to take his <hi>Adjunct</hi> upon <hi>Trust,</hi> as (it seems) He did his Ancient Authors, lest He come off with as muchshame in the one, as he has done in the other.</p>
            <p>How much better had He been imploy'd, had he gone about to have heal'd, and not (as He do's) to widen our unhappy breaches? nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than you shall want an Argument for Schism, he will make <hi>suspicion</hi> a ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: I must confess he puts in <hi>where I have great ground to suspect—</hi>But then there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between ground to believe, <hi>and ground to suspect;</hi> for be the ground never so great, it's still but in order to a suspicion.</p>
            <p>One thing I do assure you, that I have not said that thing in this following Tract, which I thought not the very truth, (so far as my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did guide me.) With this integrity I have proceeded, and can with the greater hopes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect God's blessing on my labours.</p>
            <p>Had I thought my Name would have been any satisfaction to you, you should have had it before, however you must not wonder, that you want it now, being so rudely threatned to it.</p>

               <p>Neighbour, I am glad to see you: I hope you have well digested our late Conference about the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Tenents of the Quakers, and continue as well satisfied, as you seem'd to be at our last parting.</p>

               <p>I have perused it my self, and find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it fit to be made an occasion of scruple;

               <p>Seeing you did not Print your Name with your Book, T. E. <hi>conceives that omission disingenuous (not to say dishonest)</hi> and asks, <hi>if you were afraid or ashamed openly to avouch it?</hi> Preface.</p>

               <p>Though truth seeks no corners, yet may truth notwithstanding have a Friend in a corner. But will it sollow, That because I conceal my Name (for reasons best known to my self,) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the truth even then, when I publish it to the world? or that I am not a lover of it? or that my Book is not the truth? No sure: But it's this Quaker that conceals and darkens the Truth by deceitfully jumbling things thus together without distinction; as if there were no difference between an <hi>Author</hi> and his <hi>Book,</hi> between <hi>Truth</hi> and a <hi>lover of it,</hi> and all this, merely to cast a mist before you.</p>

               <p>And well you may, for here he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himself, and has made his Objection as ridiculous as it was fallacious; for <hi>if they be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the</hi> Truth, then are they tyed (by his Rule) in all cases to affix their Names.</p>

                  <hi>of controversy (especially where one Man shall charge another) the Opponent in point of honesty, is obliged to give his Name, as a Caution and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to make good his charge.</hi>

               <p>It's not the Author's <hi>Name,</hi> but <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> wherein consists the worth and credit of a Book: These secure all men from suffering injury from the Contents thereof. If truth be spoken, who is slander'd? The guilty know they are not, therefore need not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Name for Caution: And for my part, I have laid no charge to any party, but what I am ready to make good, when need shall require; and until I fail of that, no Man can accuse me of dishonesty.</p>
               <p>But there are two things which I shall offer to your consideration: First, Whether a <hi>bare Name</hi> be a sufficient caution and security? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Whether he has not involv'd the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to the Hebrews, and his own party in this accusation of dishonesty, being guilty of the same Omission? As for the first, what if the Name of <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> be fictitious? Or suppose it be the true Name of mine Adversary; still with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mention of his habitation, to direct me where to find him, it looks like an illusion, and a designed piece of mockery, while his Person <hi>lurks</hi> and <hi>skulks</hi> as much as my Name, yea and more; for it seems he could be readily inform'd both of it and the place of mine Abode. But for that malicious Charge which in divers places of his Book he brings not only against the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but the whole Constitution of the present Government, being most notoriously false (as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57744:8"/>
will be made evident) and the place of his abode not being affixed with his Name, where then is <hi>our Caution</hi> and <hi>Security?</hi>

               <p>Because a great part of his Epistle is controversial; and further he taxes some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with the enormous crime of <hi>Schism,</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> from the publick Assemblies of Christians; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Not forsaking the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of our selves together, as the manner of some is;</hi> Then he shews in the next verse the great mischief of the sin of <hi>Separation,</hi> as bordering upon, and bringing them into the danger of final Apostasie, or the sin against the Holy Ghost, <hi>for which there remains no more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> v. 26.

               <p>Yes, it did: For it was long dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the Ancients who he was; Some affirming St. <hi>Luke</hi> to be the Author, some <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> others <hi>Clemens Romanus:</hi> At last, it being (for good reason) concluded that it was St. <hi>Paul,</hi> His Name was affixed to the Title of it.</p>
               <p>But whoever was the Author, happy was he in this, that <hi>Ellwood</hi> lived not in his days, for had he found out the <hi>concealed Author, who and what he was, his name, place,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>

               <p>So that if these Quakers be innocent, then <hi>Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> is an accuser of his Brethren; And it will concern you to observe also, that for all the confidence the Quakers have in that Spirit by which their Teachers speak and write, here must needs be some mistake, yea dishonesty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in these <hi>writers</hi> of theirs, who omit to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe their Names to such virulent Treatises, and consequently in <hi>that Spirit</hi> by whose insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation they publish'd them, or else in <hi>Ellwood</hi> and <hi>his Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Your observation is very reasonable, in that he brings both this and the next passage which he cites out of my Book, under the same acknowledgment, and cry's out that <hi>I have given up my cause,</hi> p. 4.

               <p>It is such as in the terms of it expresses neither a particular, nor a general, but may mean either <hi>[all]</hi> or <hi>[some]</hi> as the sense is determin'd by what goes before or follows af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               </p>
               <p>Moreover this way of construing words and sentences will necessarily impose a false and blasphemous sense upon many texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 1. 1 Cor. 3. 3. and 6. 8.</note> Take this instance. <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not,</hi> John 1. 11.</p>

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57744:11"/>
why the People are not profited under your Ministry. We read <hi>(says he)</hi> of some in former times, who did not profit the People at all; and the reason thereof is also given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the 23d. of <hi>Jeremiah, vers.</hi> 30. the Lord by the Prophet saith, Therefore behold, I am against the Prophets that steal my Word every one from his Neighbour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Behold, I am against the Prophets, saith the Lord, that use their Tongues, and say, He saith: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am against them that prophesie false dreams, saith the Lord, and do tell them, and cause my People to err by their lyes and by their lightness, yet I sent them not, nor commanded them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shall not profit this People at all, saith the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 32. Here the very Ground and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why that Ministry did not profit, nay why it was rendred uncapable of profiting the People at all, is most plainly given by God himself, <hi>viz.</hi> He sent them not, nor commanded them. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</p>

               <p>That this Scripture does not reach his purpose, will be evident, if we consider, 1. That this non-proficiency of some of the People do's not inferr that we are not sent, seeing it may proceed from other causes. In the careless hearers of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> it proceeded not from any corruption in his Doctrine, which was Divine, nor of his Life, which was Holy; but <hi>from the hardness of the Peoples hearts,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>in that they would not bearken.</hi> In the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the false Prophets, it proceeded from <hi>their dreams, lyes, and lightness,</hi> which they taught, <hi>and to which the People trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ch. 28. 15.</note> 2. That this Scripture is ignorantly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57744:12"/>
and injuriously applied to the present Ministry, appears in that those false Prophets perswaded the People (and that to the ruine of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Chap. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.)</note> 
                  <hi>that</hi> Jerusalem <hi>should not be destroyed, that they should neither see Sword nor Famine.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 23. 17.</note> Which was an Errand upon which God never sent them. Besides, they were a company of Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Enthusiasts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who cheated the People by false pretences to extraordinary inspirations; <hi>I have dreamed, I have dreamed</hi> was their canting <note place="margin">v. 25.</note> note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Not to profit the People</hi> then] is in the true sense of this Scripture, <hi>not to secure them</hi> from the Captivity and Calamities hanging over that Nation.</p>
               <p>Now let us examine how truly this Scripture is applied to the present Ministry; Do <hi>We</hi> come with any new Errand to the World, or pretend to extraordinary inspirations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, as those did? Or do <hi>We</hi> Preach peace to impenitent sinners? No; the contrary is well known. So the words do rebound upon the Quakers themselves, while in their strange doctrines and misconstructions of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are guilty of the same fault with those lying Prophets in saying, <hi>The Lord saith, when he hath not said;</hi> and in their presumptuous pretences to Revelation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it; as also in opposing the true Ministers of God, as those Fanaticks opposed <hi>Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah.</hi>

               <p>I answer; The Ministry in general is distinguisht into Ordinary and extraordinary. Thus it was under the Law, and under the Gospel too: Of old the Priesthood belonged to the head of every Family, challenged by a right of primogeniture: But when the House of <hi>Israel</hi> multiplied into many Families, it pleased God for the more advantageous settlement of his Church, and the better Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to devolve the Priesthood upon <hi>Aaron;</hi> and to call him to the same in an extraordinary manner, by a Commission from Heaven to <hi>Moses</hi> for his Consecration; and to settle that Priesthood successively upon his Posterity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further need of an extraordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Call to the Priests of succeeding Generations. Such too was the Evangelical Ministry; For <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Priesthood being antiquated, The Apostles were called to their Function in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner even by Christ himself, and by the visible descent of the Holy Ghost were accordingly qualified for the discharge of it: Yet even in the Apostles days this Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Call ceased; For <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were Ordain'd by imposition of hands, and were <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 5. 2 Tim. 2. 2</note> commanded <hi>so</hi> to Ordain others, by which means the Ministry was by the Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to descend to all Ages in an orderly succession, though not in one Family as <hi>Aaron</hi>'s did.</p>
               <p>These things thus premised, do determine our present case as followeth. He that is sent according to the order appointed by God in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57744:13"/>
Holy Scripture (though by the Ministry of men) is not a Minister of man's making but of God's: <note place="margin">Lev. 8. 2.</note> But both the Priests of the Law, and the Priests of the Gospel, though consecrated and Ordained by the Ministry of Men, were sent according to the order appointed by God; Therefore they were not Ministers of Man's making, but of God's, and by him truly <hi>call'd</hi> and <hi>sent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Ministers only of Man's making, because they were ordain'd by imposition of hands? And if many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not profit by their Ministry (as many of the <hi>Cretian</hi>'s did not by <hi>Titus</hi>'s;) was the <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 10, 11, 12.</note> fault think you <hi>in their not being sent?</hi>

               <p>Whether this impudent charge against a whole Order of Reverend Divines be more foul or false, is beyond my skill to determine; while so great a number of them have by their humility and devotion made the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. I am sure he can charge no such thing upon the Doctrine of our Church. Where do's he find any such self-confidence taught or encouraged in our Articles and Homilies, or practised in our publick and solemn Forms of Devotion? No where, I am sure, but the quite contrary, <hi>'Tis the healthful Spirit of God's grace</hi> that we daily pray <note n="*" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Book.

This Quaker

therefore accuses us of a Crime visible to God only; and thereby strikes at <hi>his</hi> Prerogative, who alone is the <hi>searcher of hearts.</hi> But if there be any of the Clergy guilty of too great a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Confidence in their own Abilities; yet as this is best known to God, and hard for us to judge; so you are also to consider, that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are Lawfully Ordained, it is not some personal faults of theirs, that can make void their Ministry, much less justifie the accusation this Reviler brings against the whole Ministry of the Church.</p>
               <p>And as for human Learning (which, he says, <hi>we trust to;)</hi> Is not he himself a Pretender to it in his Book, and equally lyable to the same censure? But more of this in its proper place.</p>

               <p>But he tells us of <hi>another great reason, why the People are not profited,</hi> viz. <hi>the disagreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the present Ministry to Divine Institution, p.</hi> 9. which Institution, he tells us in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going page, is generally urged to be the words of Christ to his Apostles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>It concern'd the credit of his party to leave out the later clause in that Commission, instituting the holy Ordinance of Baptism; for had he not so done, he would have faln foul upon his Brethren, who most impiously reject it, contrary to the Universal practice of the Church in all Ages, since its first Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>That this Promise related to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effusion of the Holy Ghost, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manifest from the visible effects of that effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which were miraculous, and did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Church, but are actually ceased long ago; and therefore cannot (without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption) be expected in these latter Ages of the Church, by virtue of this, or any other promise in holy Scripture. But if the Quakers expect the Spirit in that manner as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had it, then according to the condition of that Promise, why <hi>go they not to the City of Ierusalem to receive it?</hi> (in the mean time we shall be happily rid of them.)

               <p>That there is due care taken to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent scandalous men from intruding into the Ministry, is as freely confest by me, as it is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimated by this Quaker (to the honour of our Church) tho' against his will; yet as the Church may unavoidably and unblama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly receive some into her outward visible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, who afterwards may prove Apostates; So may she, when all is done, as unavoidably admit some men into holy Orders, who may afterwards prove Hypocrites. For whereas Christ's Government of his Church is partly visible and partly invisible; His invisible Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Souls of men, being that which he exerciseth by his Grace and holy Spirit, is his own immediate work, because he only is the Searcher of hearts. His outward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church is that which he excercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by subordinate Ministers and Pastors; who, not seeing mens hearts, can act only according to that outward Polity which he has settled in his Church; and consequently the Bishops in admitting Ministers can and are obliged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to act by prudential rules of Probation, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Apostolical directions in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. according to the best of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and conscience. Now if any so ordain'd prove Hypocrites (as they may after the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest inspection;) Yet are they regularly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and duly ordained, and therefore true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters according to Christ's own Institution; the Church having herein done her utmost, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57744:18"/>
all that God requires in this outward Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration: And the Gospel preached by them, being not <hi>theirs,</hi> but God's, and his blessing upon his own Ordinance, are sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and save the souls of men; tho' these, while they preach to others, may themselves become Castaways. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 27.</note>

               <p>To say that upon our admission <hi>we must have letters of Induction from the Bishop,</hi> is a gross mistake; For <hi>letters of Induction</hi> are given by the Arch-Deacon; and the intent of them is not to certify our Ordination, but only to give us possession of our Benefices.</p>

               <p>Why should not such Ministers (whose lives are free from scandal) be thought sincere good men, rather than Hypocrites, seeing <hi>Charity</hi> (as himself confesses p. 23.) <hi>useth to think the best?</hi> Thefore you may discover here an unchristian artifice and wheedle of this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's, to bring the People into a prophane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their Pastors, and to make them sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the most Pious Clergy-man for an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</p>
               <p>Neither <hi>are the people at a loss,</hi> tho' the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister were an Hypocrite; while (as hath been ptoved) the efficacy of God's word depends upon his own blessing, &amp;c. and not upon the Minister's merit.</p>
               <p>By this Argument of his the Church of God ever was and will <hi>be at a loss,</hi> unless the sincerity of her Teachers were made known by Revelation: Therefore are not the Quakers themselves all at a loss? For what assurance have they of the sincerity of any of their Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who may have drifts and designs much different from what they pretend to? It's well known that Jesuits have personated Quakers, and have been Speakers in their Meetings. Dr. <hi>Good</hi> * <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Good's</hi> Dialog. p. 9. 8.</note>tells us that it's upon record at <hi>Bristol,</hi> that two Franciscans gave notice of the coming  of Quakerism into that City; and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self heard a Popish Priest brag, that he had been a Speaker in their meetings. Now who is at a loss here? Not that the Emissaries of <hi>Rome</hi> care more for the Quakers, than other Sectaries, among whom they trade and lurk; but by this wicked craft, they carry on their

business, which is to undermine the Protestant Religion, and this excellently constituted Church (the grand object of their Envy,) by throwing a bone of Division, and raising Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the bowels of her; well knowing that an Army is more effectually destroyed by a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny among themselves, than by the fiercer assaults of a foreign Enemy. So indeed do's Religion suffer more by separation and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions among the Professors of it, than by the opposition of the very Infidels. I pray God this may be seriously consider'd by all good men, to avoid all schismatical meetings; and by the Quakers themselves, to be at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, whose journey-men they are.</p>

               <p>I have given you great attention, and I must freely confess (from what you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told me) that this form of your ordination is a most solemn, serious and pious service, far beyond what I ever knew or imagin'd of it; And now I begin to blame my self, for taking things so much upon trust, and for believing every tale that others have told me, as if this Church were an enemy to the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness: For not weighing things impartially, I became very much prejudic'd against it; and when I heard others rail, I learnt by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to do so too.</p>

               <p>If one would believe the Quaker here, he's full of pity to the people; but I am sure he's much more full of mistakes, (and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must be mightily stretch'd to excuse them from being <hi>wilful.)</hi> you are therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that there is a twofold notion of Service: There is a <hi>service of Subjection,</hi> and there's a <hi>Service of Love and Friendship.</hi> To the first the Apostle has reference, in that Exhortation <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Servants, obey in all things your Masters, &amp;c.</hi> To the second, he refers, in that other Exhortation <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13.—<hi>by love serve one another.</hi> In this latter notion of it, viz. in Acts of kindness, we are ready with St. Paul to preach our selves the peoples <hi>servants for Iesus's sake;</hi> For in this sence, that is, in the offices of Love, a Superior may not inpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to serve his Inferior, as that great Apostle shewd himself ready to do.</p>
               <p>In the first notion, it implies Dominion and Authority in those whom we serve, and a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to command and controul; and consequently
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57744:23"/>
requires subjection and Obedience in him that <note place="margin">They are Ministers of God, Ministers of Christ, not of the people. SeeMede's Disc. on 1 Cor. 4. 1.</note> serveth. And in this notion also a <hi>Minister is a servant,</hi> but then 'tis to him whose Minister he is: A Minister of State is a servant, but it is to the Prince that employs him; So a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Religion is a servant, yet not to the People, but to God whose Embassador he is. The Apostles were Ministers, and did the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple think them <hi>their servants?</hi> The Church is compared to an Army; and are the Leaders and Officers in an Army, Servants to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers? Ministers are by their Office to <hi>direct and rebuke;</hi> and if they were <hi>servants</hi> to the people, would it become them so to do? Angels are Ministring Spirits, and are by God appointed to serve the necessities of the Church; This do's not suppose that they are our <hi>servants,</hi> to be controuled by us.</p>
               <p>But the Quakers methinks should be more modest than to expect from the Clergy a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Subjection to the people, While (if the Author of the <hi>spirit of the Hat</hi> may be trusted) <hi>Fox</hi> and others of them arrogating to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Ministerial Function and Power, <hi>do crush the tender ones;</hi> as he terms it, p. 12.</p>
               <p>However you see the Arts, T. E. and such as he, make use of to encourage the people to contemn their lawful Teachers; and in the mean time, as scrupulous as the Quakers are to call any man <hi>Master,</hi> you see how they take upon them to be really <hi>so</hi> themselves. Do's not this piece of Ambition directly oppose the plain doctrine of holy Scripture, which says concerning the relation of Ministers to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57744:24"/>
that <hi>They are over them in the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. and so commands them to <hi>esteem them very highly. v.</hi> 13. And again, that <hi>They have the rule over them Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them <hi>to obey them, and submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> &amp;c. And calls them elswhere <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Fathers</hi> and <hi>Pastors?</hi> But the Quakers it <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11. 1 Cor. 4. 15</note> seems, are for inverting this Doctrine, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Hearer and learner a Master over his Teacher, a Son over the Father, and the Flock over their Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Now therefore to retort his own words, p. 29. <hi>What I pray do's this bespeak, but pride and arrogance?</hi> And as a little before, <hi>Is it the humble, meek, gentle Spirit of Iesus? or the haughty proud exalted Spirit of Lucifer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you see the ill Consequences of his Doctrine; And by applying the rule of our Saviour, you may know, who he is by his <hi>fruits,</hi> that is to say, a false Prophet.</p>

               <p>For the right understanding of this text, We must consider What <hi>Moses's Chair</hi> imports; and Who the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees</hi> were.

Num. 12. 6, 7, 8.</note> do artribute to him a higher mode of Prophecy than ordinary. Now the great and principal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57744:25"/>
work of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> was to teach and instruct the people: This is evident from the Scripture; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. False Prophets and false Teachers do there explain one another. And <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying</hi> is put for Expounding and teaching the will of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>and</hi> 14. 1, 3. And he that expoundeth and declareth another's mind and meaning is called his Prophet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 1, 4, 16: And Christ's great work in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of his Prophetical Office, was to teach the people and to reveal his Father's will. We may therefore safely conclude, that <hi>Moses's Chair,</hi> is the Chair of Doctrine; For it was the custom of those times for Teachers to <hi>sit,</hi> while they taught; as several of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors, and also the antient Commentaries under St. Ambrose's name on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 29, 30. do inform us. In conformity to this Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom Christ himself taught <hi>sitting;</hi> and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Philosophers did the same, as Grotius noteth upon the place, where he quoteth Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca calling them <hi>Cathedrarii,</hi> that is, <hi>Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Moses's Chair</hi> is thus to be taken, will further appear from the Persons sitting in it. Christ's discourse is not concerning <hi>Iudges and Magistrates,</hi> but <hi>Teachers,</hi> as appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 4. where we read, <hi>They bound heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens &amp;c.</hi> that is expounded the Law with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable strictness by adding their Traditions to it; see <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10, 28. and accordingly the <hi>Iews</hi> called a thing forbidden by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors <hi>Ligatum,</hi> viz. a thing bound; and a <note place="margin">See ver. 9, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And if he had spoken concerning their Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drins, the Priests would no doubt, have been mention'd especially the high Priest, who was a Chief member of them in our Saviour's time. Now that the Scribes here mention'd did suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Prophets in their office and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is clear from the Scripture. <hi>Behold</hi> (says our Saviour) <hi>I send you Prophets, Wise-men and Scribes, Mat.</hi> 23. 34.

               <p>I cannot do it better than in the words of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> an Author, whom this Quaker pretends to have a very good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of, and whose Authority he misquotes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me with so much triumph. <hi>p.</hi> 120, <hi>and</hi> 188. Let us here him therefore descanting upon this Document by Theophilact, <hi>The Lord speaketh of those, who fit in Moses's Chair, that is, of those who teach what is in the Law; those</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Theoph. in loc. The like expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we read in St. Aug. de doct. Chr. l. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore who teach the Divine Law we ought to hear, tho they do it not themselves:</hi> Further he objects, (as <hi>Ellwood</hi> here) <hi>But must we do all things they say, tho they be evil things? We answer,</hi> says he, <hi>First that he that teacheth will hardly be so audacious as ever to exhort to things directly evil. Secondly, If we grant that any one should exhort to evil life, then he speaks not from Moses's Chair, nor out of the Law.</hi> And this I hope the Quaker will grant an eternal Document, that <hi>All</hi> that an evil Pastor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us from God's Law (and by virtue of his Office,) we ought to do; This was our Saviour's sense in that text, and <hi>mine</hi> in quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it.</p>

               <p>This is a passage I must not brook, that he should be so arrogant to call them <hi>Their</hi> Martyrs, as if the Martyrs were Quakers, and

it were the Quakers Cause for which they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, The Crow must not adorn himself with the Peacocks feathers; nor the Quaker chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge a property where he has none at all. In honour therefore to the memory of these pious Souls, I shall (God willing) undertake to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their reputation from so foul, so false an intimation; and shew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How far they were from being any thing like the Quakers, or in the least inclinable to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they did not oppose Christ's words (as <hi>Ellwrod</hi> here doth;) but held this Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be eternal.</p>
               <p>First I hope to make it evident, that They were as contrary to the erroneous and nonsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal tenents of the Quakers, as to those of the Papists, by whose cruel hands they were mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd.

                  <hi>Cranmer</hi> was Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Ridley</hi> Bishop of <hi>London, Latimer</hi> Bishop of <hi>Worcester, Hooper</hi> Bishop of <hi>Glocester, Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Winchester, Bradford</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> Parson of <hi>Hadley:</hi> And would it not make any man smile to hear this man call those Reverend Prelats, &amp;c. the Quakers Martyrs, who were such constant Defenders of the Protestant Religion, and of the Doctrin of the Church of England, both by their Sermons, their Pens, and their Lives? However take this by the way, that in calling them <hi>Godly,</hi> he justifies their Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and in calling them <hi>Martyrs,</hi> he owns the Cause for which they suffer'd; <note n="*" place="margin">The cause makes the Martyr.</note> and so by consequence makes the whole design of his Book a Contradiction to himself here.

               <p>For further instance, These Martyrs, who were so learned, so well skilled in the Fathers, and so excellently grounded in the Principles of Faith and Holiness, that they confirmed them with the Sacrifice of their Lives, These very

men were so far from concluding <hi>all</hi> Oaths un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, that as they could not be admitted into their Offices and Places, but by taking Oaths; so likewise did they administer Oaths to the subordinate Clergy, and Ecclesiastical Officers, according as the Laws, did then oblige them. These were Dispencers of both the Sacraments, were Receivers of Tithes; They never scrupled to give Civil Titles to men, nor to say [You] to a single person, as is evident from all their Conferences and Disputations; They wore <note n="*" place="margin">

Yea that very Form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession (in our service-Book,) against which <hi>Ellwood</hi> writes a whole Chapter, was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by some of these, whom he calls <hi>their</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs.</p>

               <p>He knows, what reputation they have among all Protestants, and therefore he would Gull the common people with this plausible Cheat, by endeavoring to perswade them, that these Martyrs were Patrons of <hi>their</hi> Cause.

               <p>Truly <hi>Ellwood</hi> is <hi>so far</hi> in the right, for a Godly and Learned man he was. But then let us see how He and the Quakers agree in their notions and principles of Religion; and what property the Quakers have in this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Martyr. <hi>Bonner</hi> taunting him as an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist, and as one that denyed the Lawfulness of Swearing before a Judge, he replyed thus, <note place="margin">Martyrol vol. 3. p. 561.</note> 
                  <hi>My Lord, I am no Anabaptist, I think it LAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FVLL TO SWEAR before a Competent Iudge.</hi> He being accused by the said <hi>Bonner,</hi> before one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> that he denyed <hi>Baptism to be necessary to them that were born of Christian Parents;</hi> and that he denyed <hi>Fasting and Prayer, &amp;c.</hi> smartly answer'd to this <note place="margin">ibid.</note> slander, <hi>Is not your Lordship ashamed to say be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Worshipfull Gentleman, that I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain these abominable Blasphemies which you have rehearsed?</hi> So that you see to deny the Ordinance of Baptism (as the Quakers do) in the judgment of the Learned <hi>Philpot</hi> is an <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Blasphemy.</hi> And in vindication of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <note place="margin">ibid. p. 606.</note> Baptism He has writ a very learned Tract never to be Answer'd. And concerning the other Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; At a Conference with several of the Nobility, he said thus, <hi>I do protest to your Honours, that I</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:57744:31"/>
                  <hi>think as reverently of the Sacrament, as a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian man ought to do; and that I acknowledg the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ibid p. 556.</note> 
                  <hi>ministred after Christ's Institution, to be one of the greatest Treasures and comforts that he left us in the earth.</hi> And being required by the Arch-Bishop <note place="margin">Martyrol v. 3. p. 576</note> of <hi>York</hi> to give a definition of the Church, he gave it thus, <hi>It is a Congregation of people dispersed thorow the world, agreeing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the word of God, using the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and all other things according to the same.</hi> So then those that deny the use of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments (and consequently the Quakers, who do so) are, according to this Pious Martyr, no members of the Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bradford</hi> (whom <hi>Ellwood</hi> styles an <hi>Eminent Martyr, p.</hi> 275.) in a Conference with the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> would not by both their entreaties be <note place="margin">ibid p. 295.</note> moved to sit in their presence; neither would he be perswaded to put on his Cap, till they overcame him by their great importunity. The <note place="margin">ibid p. 298.</note> same <hi>Bradford</hi> chargeth the Papists with <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> in robbing the Laity of Christ's Cup in the Sacrament. Now if he were living, of how great Sacrilege would he accuse the Quakers, who not only take away the Cup, but utterly deny both the Sacraments? And <hi>herein</hi> are the Quakers far worse than the Papists. Again as to his Judgment of an Oath; In a certain <note place="margin">ibid p. 284.</note> Conference he says thus, <hi>I was thrice Sworn in Cambridg, when I was admitted Master of Arts, when I was admitted Fellow of Pembrook Hall, and when I was there, the Visiters came thither</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57744:31"/>
                  <hi>and Sware the University; Again I was Sworn, when I enter'd into the Ministry, when I had a Prebend given me, and I was Sworn to serve the King a little before his Death. Tush! Herod's Oaths</hi> (quoth the Chancellor <note n="*" place="margin">Steph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gardiner.</note>) <hi>a man should make no Conscience at. But, My Lord,</hi> (said <hi>Bradford) these were no Herod's Oaths, no Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oaths, but</hi> OATHS ACCORDING TO GOD's WORD, <hi>as you your self have well affirmed in your book De verâ obedientiâ.</hi> Do but compare his Letters Recorded by <hi>Fox,</hi> with <hi>Ellwood's</hi> Chapter <hi>of Confession,</hi> and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Light and Darkness can be more contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taylor</hi> speaking of the Common Prayer-Book, gives this character of it, <hi>There was</hi> (says he) <hi>set forth by the innocent King Edward, the whole Church-Service, with great deliberation and the advice of the best learned men in the Realm, and Authorized by the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and receiv'd and publish'd gladly by the whole Realm, which book was never reformed but</hi>

                  <hi>once, and yet by that one reformation it was so fully perfected, according to the Rules of our Christian Religion in every behalf, that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Conscience could be offended with anything therein contained, I mean of that book reformed.</hi> And the Common Prayer-Book was the last Present he made to his Wife; and that which <note place="margin">ibid p. 175.</note> he used also during his inprisonment. This may satisfy you, that this Godly Martyr was no <note place="margin">ibid p. 172.</note> Quaker. Of an Oath you may see his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where he saith, <hi>The Oath against the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the Bishop of Rome was a</hi> LAWFULL OATH, <hi>and so was the Oath made by us all</hi>

               <p>First you shall hear, what Latimer saith, <hi>As long as they minister the word of God or his Sacraments, or any thing that God hath Ordained to the Salvation of Mankind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath promised to be present, to work with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">biid p. 478.</note> 
                  <hi>the Ministration of the same to the end of the world, They be to be heard, to be obeyed, to be honoured for God's Ordinance sake, which is Effectual and Fruitful, whatsoever the Minister is, though he be a Devil, &amp;c.</hi> And he cites <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> as of the same opinion.</p>
               <p>Hear also what the Learned <hi>Philpot</hi> saith to this Point. He being engaged in a Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and being asked <hi>[what the opinion of the Donatists was?]</hi> replyed, <hi>That they were a certain sect of men, affirming among other Heresies, that the Dignity of the Sacraments depended on the Worthiness of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">ibid p 576.</note> 
                  <hi>the Minister, so that if the Minister was Good, the Sacraments which be Ministred were avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or else not.</hi> Here you may infer, that this tenent of <hi>Ellwood's</hi> in the opinion of this holy Martyr is no less than <hi>Heresy:</hi> And you may know too from whence both <hi>he</hi> and <hi>his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>

had it, even from the <hi>long since exploded</hi> Donatists. At another Disputation with the Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> and others, He told the Bishop that <hi>he knew Rome.</hi> To this the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop answer'd, that <hi>he was sorry that he had been there; for he supposed, the wickedness which he saw there made him do, as he did. Philpot</hi> replyed <hi>No, My Lord, I do not do, as I do for that cause; for I am taught otherwise by the Gospel, not altogether to refuse the Minister for his evil living, so that he bring sound Doctrine</hi>

               <p>As for <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Deacon (whom you mention'd) <hi>his Office was to serve tables, to take care of the widows, &amp;c. he was chosen to be Overseer of the poor, &amp;c. however it appears not, that he was a publick Preacher.</hi> ibid.</p>

               <p>If I rightly understand this Quaker, the Offices of a Deacon and an overseer of the poor are according to him one and the same. Then probably his next work will be to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with our Magistrates, or rather with the Laws of the Land, that the Overseers of the poor are not ordained into their Function by Prayer and Imposition of hands, as the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were <hi>Acts.</hi> 6. 6. But why might not <hi>he</hi> be a Preacher as well as his Collegue St. <hi>Stephen?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However this I must ask, If the Quakers plead, that his Deaconship did not qualify <hi>him</hi> for a publick Preacher, How dare <hi>they</hi> (men and women, every one at their pleasure) take upon them to preach, being neither Priests nor Deacons? Do's not this contradict and make void their pretence of the <hi>Spirit's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas T.

               <p>But whatever the Preacher is, the people are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57744:34"/>
accountable for all the instructions they hear, concerning their respective duties both to God and man. How will <hi>Ellwood</hi> deny this?</p>

               <p>Ay <hi>Indeed?</hi> Is this the Quaker's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, to say this would have been well reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Sermons of his duty to God and man made little impression upon him? No pretence, I am sure, can justify this Reply; But it's too apparent, the contrary Command of our blessed Saviour lately explained to you, has made little impression upon this Quaker, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the people are straitly enjoyn'd not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey their Teachers (tho' Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees) nor to plead <hi>their</hi> ill life to excuse their own disobedience, (as this Quaker here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the people to do, having (to this end no doubt) aforehand corrupted that text, as you have heard;) but in quite opposit terms, Whatsoever they bid them concerning their said duty to God and man, that to observe and do, tho' not after their works. This Quaker in the mean time forgot that heavy sentence of our Saviour's, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>Whosoever shall break one of these least Commandments, and teach men so, shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> that is, excluded from the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of it.</p>

               <p>A good hearing; Then may a good man, without any violence to Religion, say as well <hi>[You,]</hi> as <hi>[Thou]</hi> to a single person. But if he spoke as he thought, why do they and he contend so much about a word, and divide the Church, and separate themselves

from it for a thing they dare lay no <hi>stress of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon?</hi> So that he has in those words done little credit to his Cause, and his whole Party, in making them all Schismaticks.</p>
               <p>Yet can we think, that he has here truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented his own Party, or clear'd them of Superstition, while we observe their strict and demure use of words and phrases to the ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of their own Consciences? As if to say, <hi>[I thank you for your kindness]</hi> or the like, were not as good sense and as lawful, as to say, [I <hi>receive thy love;]</hi> Or to say <hi>[Such a one is dead]</hi> were not as pleasing to God, as to say <hi>[He is out of the body;]</hi> Or to say, [I <hi>cannot consent to such a thing]</hi> were not as proper, and as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, as to say [I <hi>am not free,]</hi> which is a phrase they have very ready to oppose good Laws and good Counsel.</p>
               <p>And if you mark the Quakers, you cannot but observe, that in the affected use of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing phrases, tones and gestures, they really esteem themselves more religious than their Neighbours, whilst indeed (if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it) they are the less Religious, by how they are the <hi>more</hi> superstitious and schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>
               <p>But I believe, that in many of them much of this proceeds from want of knowledge, who now (I hope) will by one of their own Teachers be at length convinc'd of their great errour in laying so much <hi>stress of Religion upon words and phrases.</hi>

               <p>Though the holy Scriptures ought to be remembred and frequently used in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, for our mutual instruction; Yet I would not have you so ignorant and superstitious, as to think that God in revealing his will there, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd that our duty should consist in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual use of those very forms of speech, but in a due regard to those truths and Commands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them.</p>
               <p>As for the style of the Scriptures, you are to understand, that it was ever accommodated to the particular dialect of that people to whom they were written, and therefore varied accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; as we find it does in the different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the <hi>Greek</hi> in the new: And if this had not been observed by the Apostles in their Preaching, how could they have been understood by men of so many different Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, as we find they spake to <hi>Acts</hi> 2. seeing every language has its peculiar phrases and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties of speech?</p>

               <p>Here is one instance (among many in his book) of this Quaker's <hi>Canting,</hi> in his demure and impertinent bringing in a Scripture phrase, nothing at all belonging to the subject in hand, but quite to another matter.

                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in Ioc.</note> growing heresies. And therefore to bring in this to the subject in hand, to make the sense of these words to imply a Grammar or Dictionary to direct the Conscience in the use of words and phrases (as his brethren no doubt do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him) is a thing which sure He, upon more serious thoughts, will be unwilling to defend, and therefore he had done faithfully to have interpreted his meaning.</p>
               <p>If by <hi>sound words</hi> he mean an entire and plain Confession of Faith, or a summary of those things that are necessary to be believed unto Salvation, I know no such thing subscribed by the body of them; for that would fix them to

                  <hi>short Form,</hi> to let men see to the bottom of their Religion.</p>
               <p>Tis true indeed, some Quakers have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to set down in their books the heads of their belief. But then, 1. No man knows whether the rest will subscribe to them, while they have been so different from one another even in Fundamental Points. 2. That croud of Scripture texts which they quote, has been generally so erroneously misinterpreted and misapplied by them, that even where they write little else but Scripture words, we have reason to suspect their meaning. Therefore when you were so inclined to Quakerism, would you have turn'd to you knew not what? to a dangerous Religion you cannot see to the bottom of? What kind of Religion is this of the Quakers, whereof their Leaders either can not, or dare not give any entire and intelligible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? Do not these Teachers use this as a piece of Craft to reserve to themselves a liberty to preach what Doctrine, yea what heresy they please? I pray God draw their Followers out of their snares, and grant all unstable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Grace and Discretion to keep off from them and their meetings.</p>
               <p>As for that which we and the Universal Church of Christ embrace under the name of the Apostles Creed, as the Mark and Badge of a Christian, the Quakers tenents are such as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57744:39"/>
give us little reason to think they will own it; while some have held one Heresy, some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; Some have denied the Holy Trinity, Some have pretended Equality with God: One of the Heads of 'em pretended to be the <hi>Messiah;</hi> Another of their cheif men affirmed himself to be the Judge of the world, and to see mens hearts; and has been by some of his Party call'd the Son of God: Others have affirmed, that Christ in the flesh, and all he did and suffer'd was but a <hi>Figure,</hi> and nothing but an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <note place="margin">See per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee.</note> Others, if not most of them, think they have no need of outward Teaching, by reading, and hearing the Holy Scriptures read and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; And that the Holy Scriptures are not the word of God; That there is no mediate Call to the Ministry, &amp;c. so far are they dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate from the Christian Faith. <note n="*" place="margin">See per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee.</note> Now what fault finds T.

               <p>But whether, think you, is there more pride in <hi>our useing it</hi> as a testimony of respect, or <hi>their sawcy denying it</hi> to Superiors, even to the King himself, in an affectation of singularity, and in opposition to a lawful custom?</p>

               </p>
               <p>I acknowledge that the Spirit of Jesus is an humble and obliging Spirit, and should be most truly glad to see the Quakers conform to it. For our Blessed Lord complyed with all the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Customs of the People among whom he lived. Did they stand in the Synagogues when the Scriptures were read? Christ did so too: Did they sit when they Preached? He did the same: Did they eat Bread and Wine after the Paschal Lamb? Christ did so too; though God never commanded it: Did the Jews observe the Feast of Dedication, a Feast of their own institution? Christ did so too: Did they lye upon Beds when they ate the Passover? (tho' by the Original institution it was to be eaten standing) Christ conforms to the Custom, and did so too: Nay he accommodated the two great Sacraments of his Church to their Customs; And that Prayer which he taught his Disciples, was for the most part of it compiled out of the Jewish Liturgies. So that we have all the reason to conclude, that if he had lived among us, He would have suited himself to the present inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Customs both in speech and behaviour: For he used both the Jewish Language and their Phrases; He used both the Hebraisms and Hellenisms of those times. He deliver'd his <note place="margin">Whereof there are great numbers in their Talmud.</note> Parables in positive Assertions; a thing more exceptionable than <hi>[You]</hi> to a single person. So unwilling was he to quarrel with innocent Customs, or to make innovations, where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57744:41"/>
did not compel him. All which shew that the Son of God was far from a Spirit of crossness and contradiction, and from all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of schism and faction.</p>

                  <hi>leaning</hi> or <hi>lying along</hi> on one side; In which posture, though he being the Lord himself, did in his state of Humiliation, eat his Last Supper with his Disciples, and gave them the freedom to do the like; yet that being contrary to our National Custom, and Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now Glorified, this posture of <hi>leaning</hi> or <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along</hi> would be very irreverent among us, in the celebration of that B.

               <p>But one thing I will take the boldness to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That we conform more to our Saviour's example in doing as we do, then if we perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those Services in Christs own posture.</p>

               <p>It will not be so strange to you, if you well weigh and consider this truth; That Conformity to our Saviour consists not in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Natural Actions which he did, but in following the same Moral Rule, by which he

did those Actions: Now his Rule was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to all present Constitutions and Customs in themselves indifferent; And this in order to the promoting of Love and Peace: The Rule of Charity was his constant and general Rule in all his Actions; Particularly in this last instance, our Saviour did not institute a posture, but only express a compliance with a Jewish Custom: He therefore that for peace and love conforms to all present lawful Customs and Constitutions (though far different from the same natural Actions our Saviour did) most truly conforms both to the example, and the meek and gentle Spirit of Jesus.</p>

               <p>This is an answer that perhaps <hi>Ellwood</hi> will not thank you for, because the Quakers (at least many of them) deny the Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity; to such a pitch of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Herefie are they already arrived: However these Scriptures will bring the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers into this <hi>Dilemma;</hi> Either to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity, or else to confess, from the example of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that it's neither unlawful nor improper, to speak <hi>of</hi> a single person in the plural number: If so, then is it as lawful to speak <hi>to</hi> a single person in the same number; for if God say [WE] and [US] of himself, it would not have been improper to say [YOU] to him, seeing one is but the Relative of the other. Therefore though we should suppose <hi>[You]</hi> to be only plural, this way of useing it would be sufficiently justified by the instances already given: yet after all this, you are to consider, that while <hi>[Thou]</hi> is singular, <hi>[Ye]</hi> plural, Custom

(the only Law-giver in these Cases) has so far prevail'd, that <hi>[You]</hi> is become either singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or plural, as some Pronouns <note n="*" place="margin">Buxtorf. p. 21.</note> are in the Hebrew.

               <p>of this I said sufficiently in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; but let me ask you further; Is there any one general rule of speech appointed by God? Or is it arbitrary, in the choice of men in each particular Society?</p>

               <p>I never heard that any one Dialect was ever commanded by God; for if so, he would not have divided it, as we read he did <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. Therefore I suppose it is arbitrary according to the consent of each Society.</p>

               <p>By these last words of his, he has spoiled Quakerism, which we may impeach as <hi>sprung up out of the putrefaction of corrupter times,</hi> than those-he mentions: <hi>In the midst of wars and figtings</hi> (as a Quaker confesses <note n="*" place="margin">Spirit of the Hat. p. 3.</note>) when the Throne was usurped, when Religion and Property were invaded in the heat of our civil broils and distractions, up starts the Quaker.</p>
               <p>As for the dialect he contends for; you must know, that God did not accept of it for its own goodness as better than any other, but so that he would have accepted another as well as it; And when himself and the best men used it, they did it in compliance to the Customs of speech at that time. Yet the Dialect at some times varied (as has been proved) and yet was no less accepted of by God; To shew, that he design'd not to bind the Conscience to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form of speech.</p>
               <p>But will he not (think you) allow the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians to be as good men, as the Heathen Romans before their Empire? Of those ancient Christians, who lived under the Empire (at which time <hi>Ellwood</hi> confesses <hi>[You]</hi> to a single person was used) <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Antonius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, gives this account; <hi>The Christians (says be) are not distinguished from others by their Country, speech nor any peculiar Customs: They inhabit not Cities appropriate to them alone, nor do they use a DIALECT differing from other</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:57744:46"/>
                  <hi>men, nor is their manner of living unlike to other men; They follow the CUSTOMS of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in Clothes, Dyet and other things,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Just. Mart. Epis. ad Diogen. p. 446, 497.</note> &amp;c.

               <p>This Quaker is a right Conformist to the humour of his Party, and a true Practicant here of this Uncivil tenent of theirs, against Civil Respects. His first work is to render me suspected and ridiculous, that mens ill opinions of me may give advantage to his feeble reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: But I am willing to put my self upon my Trial; How do's he make good his charge?</p>

               <p>Whereas I told you in the Conference, <hi>That possibly I had been faulty in suffering my Servant to call me Master;</hi> He accuses you for inferring; that <hi>the Quakers have brought this tenent of theirs</hi> [against the civil Title of Master, founded on Mat. 23. 10.] <hi>to this strange result, that a child must honour his Father, but not call him Father; that a Servant must obey his Master, but not call him Master; which tenent (he says) is your own, not theirs, as their writings &amp; practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sufficiently evidence.</hi> p. 32.</p>

               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I made not the interence from your words immediately, but from the Quakers way of alledging that Text, utterly beside the scope
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57744:47"/>
and intention of it; For the words just before my interence were these, <hi>In the same notion that we are forbidden to call [Master,] we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise forbidden to call [Father.]</hi> And seeing that that Text and the next before it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to call <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> concern not temporal but such spiritual Titles only, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Mastership and Dominion over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; it follows, that while the Quakers extend the Text from Spiritual to Temporal Titles (as they have done all along) they make even <hi>that</hi> of a <hi>Natural Father</hi> to be equally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by it, <hi>that</hi> being but a temporal Title no more than any other. So that the practice of those Quakers, who receive of their Children the Title of Father, evidently contradicts the result of the Quakers Tenent against Civil Titles, as it is founded on the said Text.</p>
               <p>And whereas he tells his Reader, <hi>that this is contrary to their universal practice, and a foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fasten'd on them.</hi> p. 42. You shall hear what <note place="margin">See the Foot out of the snare p. 17.</note> one <hi>Iohn Toldervy</hi> says as to this point, having been desirous to draw Coll. <hi>Webb</hi> (his Master) to Quakerism; he, after his return from his errors, gives this following relation, <hi>I took him by the arm and bad him sit down</hi> William Web, <hi>not bowing, not pulling off the hat, not Master, for then I denyed that Title to him, though rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him a Servant, as afterwards I denyed all Relations, from the words of one, He that liveth in the Light will see no difference.</hi> Which shews that it was not his private opinion only.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>His other instance of dishonesty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he chargeth you, is this; that in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57744:48"/>
we should fasten on the Quakers the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity of applying that place in <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>[Salute no man by the way]</hi> to themselves in a literal sense: <hi>ibid.</hi>

               <p>Surely he will not deny that it has been a known custom among the Quakers, to pass by their Neighbours unsaluted. Besides 'tis well known, that when we used to bid them <hi>Good morrow, Good speed</hi> and the like; they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproved such salutations in the words of this Text. Might not the Quaker with equal modesty deny, that ever his Brethren used to <hi>Quake</hi> and <hi>Foam,</hi> as deny a thing so generally known as this is? Have the Quakers forgot, that <hi>Iames Naylor</hi> (before whom they sung their blasphemous Hosanna's) thus applied this Text; That he did so, appears by a <note n="*" place="margin">p. 31, 32.</note> Book called <hi>The Perfect Pharisee,</hi> subscribed by Five Ministers of <hi>Newcastle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if some, or many of the Quakers be laughed out of this absurdity, must my honesty be taxed, because they vary from themselves and one another? But would it not (think you) have been more honest in him and ingenious to have said, <hi>Truly it was our former practice so to apply that Text, but since we saw the folly and weakness of it, and that Spirit we trusted to did deceive us, we have left it off.</hi> I pray God they may henceforth learn to suspect that delusive Spirit which they have trusted so long, and leave off the rest of their errors, not only for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculousness of them, but for Conscience sake.</p>
               <p>But here I must desire the Quakers to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that <hi>Salutation</hi> (which is an outward and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57744:48"/>
civil respect) is by this Quaker implicitly granted to be lawful and commendable; while he insinuates the denying it to be an <hi>absurdity,</hi> p. 32. and while he passes by the Reasons and <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 10. 12.

               <p>I believe you: For any man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense may easily see this distinction in the Conference; For in my reply, I told you <note place="margin">p. 3.</note> that <hi>I accepted the expressions of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If your Controversie had been against the same respects which before you had so hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professed, this indeed had been some <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum;</hi> but seeing it was against a different thing, I doubt the Quaker has brought the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decorum</hi> upon himself, and in the result a great deal of shame too, both on himself and his whole party; for while he inveighs thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all respects, without distinction, and against your unfitness to represent the body of the Quakers upon this very account: From hence it plainly follows, that to represent the Quakers bearing any <hi>sincere and cordial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to their Neighbours</hi> is a grand <hi>Indecorum, a design laid to mistake their Principles, a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representing them, yea the whole body of them to the World.</hi> So that I see, a man had need be cautious, how he represents a Quaker, either as good natur'd, kind, or affectionate; For if he do, beware he meets not with my fate, to be call'd a fool for his pains.</p>

That was an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state, the People of God was then an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward National People, their Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was much outward and shadowy, their Wars were outward, their Ornaments were outward, their Honours and Respects to one another were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And in this State many things were indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Iews, many things permitted &amp; connived at, partly because of the hardness of their Hearts, and partly by reason of their Weakness.

               <p>Was Christ's time then no time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation?

Do's this prove that whatsoever in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Moral Law, or to good manners, he found less perfect, he might not, or did not in his own person reform before his Offering up? Do's this prove that Christ was no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former? What though the Reformation was not so general till the more plentiful effusion of the Spirit, do's this prove it was not actually begun, and set on foot, before Christ's death, both by his Doctrine, and visible effects of it, upon both Jews and Gentiles <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 5. and 8. 10, 13. and 15. 28? Were all Christ's Sermons, the calling of the Twelve Apostles, and the Seventy Disciples, and sending them forth to Preach, His healing of Mens Bodies and Souls together, Was all this no method of Reformation? He disproved the corrupt Traditions of the Elders, whereby they made void the Commandments of God, He reformed the imperfection of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law in the case of Divorces, and reduced Marriage to its Primitive institution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. Denounced eight Woes together against the Scribes and Pharisees, He asserted and cleared the Moral Law (in his Sermon on the Mount) from the false Glosses the Jewish Doctors had put upon it; and advanced the Law of Nature (whereof the Moral, Law is the transcript) to the highest pitch; And was not all this suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make Christ a Reformer?

What though the State of the Church in the time of the Law was in a great measure Outward, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Ceremonies of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ's death expired?

Untill he can prove this, he must allow Christians such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Customs and usages, as are agreeable to this present State; such (among the rest) are Civil Respects, being sutable to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, which Providence and the State of this World have made of persons and places,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57744:53"/>
in the various relations which we find in all Civil Societies: He that is an enemy to this distinction, is an enemy to all Government, which cannot subsist without it; for we must distinguish between Rulers and Subjects, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and Governed, both in Common Wealths and private Families. What madness then is it to think, that Christ meant to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Civil Respects and good Manners, things that are so necessary to uphold this distinction &amp; essential to it, as the due acknowledgment and proper expressions of it? Therefore he abolish'd not those decentCustoms of them, which are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record in the Old Testament, or any where else; But all quotations out of the Old Testament to this purpose must needs be still in force.</p>

                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> By civil vertues and great exploits Men justly gain an Eminency and Renown, and become famous. See <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 11, 14. <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 2. and 1. 16. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 24. and 12. 30. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> When persons have larger privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and immunities granted to them in the Commonwealth, they gain an eminency by them: thus Noblemen are constituted by that the Lawyers call <hi>Dominium Nobilium,</hi> whereby they have <hi>jus praecedentiae,</hi> a right

                  </gap>, and Titles to adorn them, whih are no other than certain marks of their civil valuation. For it is past dispute, that as some Men are of much more value to the publick than others <hi>(viz.</hi> Able Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Iudges, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> So publick Governors have power to determine the rates both of Men and Things, and to signifie the value they set upon one Man above another by giving him a higher place and a title.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> These priviledges being propagated to posterity and made hereditary (for <hi>Patrum conditionem liberi sequuntur,</hi> as the Law speaks) make different Families in respect of superiority and inferiority; These advancements descending to their Children, being encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to civil vertues, and great actions; And 'tis hard to conceive how these things can be otherwise in this World, without <note n="†" place="margin">Nulla Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitas po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistere, nisi eam Ordo ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinear.

               <p>These things and the like must necessarily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish persons into several ranks and classes, as <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> distributed the Roman Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; and this the Scripture freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, for we read also of Nobles <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 11. <hi>Ier.</hi> 27. 20. and the Sons of Nobles <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 17.

               <p>For seeing there are different ranks of Men downwards from the King to the Peasant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as you see it is agreeable to holy Scripture; so all sober men will acknowledge it is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Reason also, to give to each rank such distinct Titles as are proper to express that difference.</p>
               <p>And with what reverence and outward civil respects the Primitive Christians behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to their Governors, may be seen in <hi>Iustin Martyr Apol.</hi> 2. And what is any where said, that true piety is the Fountain of Honour or the like, is meant in a Religious sense, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the inward man, and is not at all intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exclude those civil distinctions among men, in reference to their outward capacities; To suppose otherwise were very ridiculous.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First Absurdity,</hi> in implying that Christ's death put an end to his Moral documents, this of <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 10. being one.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Absur.</hi> that all Political Government is now at an end, and God's People must be now no more an outward National people.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Absur.</hi> In making the use of the Sword unlawful, now in the time of Reformation, in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57744:56"/>
contradiction to <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. where 'tis said that <hi>the Magistrate bears not the Sword in vain,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by condemning two good Centurions, him in <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 9, 10. and <hi>Cornelius Acts</hi> 10. 1, 2. who was after Christ's death. By this Rule neither forreign invasions, nor intestine Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions must be opposed, nor prevented by any outward means; But we have no reason to trust the Quaker here, seeing divers of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren bore Arms and Offices in the late Army, yet at the same time professed Quakerism, and I can name the persons, were there occasion for it.</p>
               <p>4 <hi>Absur.</hi> In going about to prove outward things connived at by Christ, and indulged to the Jews for the hardness of their hearts, by that very Text in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 8. which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and plain instance of his forbidding and reforming those arbitrary divorces which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses suffer'd.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>Absur.</hi> in saying in such general terms that the State of the Church in Christ's time was Outward, and Worship Outward, and in that notion afterwards to vanish; as if after Christ's death, the Church were not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any Outward State, or Outward Worship; And consequently that all vocal Prayers, all gestures of Devotion, all Outward Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea the very notion and being of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church must vanish together.</p>
               <p>6 <hi>Absur.</hi> in making no difference at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the State of the Church under Christ's time, and under <hi>Moses</hi>'s contrary to these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. and 2. 1, 2, 3. and 3. 1,—7.

                  <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s self-contradictions in this passage are these,</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Contrad.</hi> His putting Outward Respects among those things, which he says were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged by our Saviour, to continue till the Reformation, and yet venturing to contradict himself in the exposition he gives of <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 10. wherein he affirms that civil titles are there forbidden.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Contrad.</hi> His saying, Outward honour went off after the death of Christ, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his own acknowledgment of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithet (as he will have it) of <hi>Most Noble,</hi> given by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Festus,</hi> who being a Heathen had no Christian vertue to qualifie him for it, according to the Quakers principles.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Contrad.</hi> His putting Outward respects among other things, that were to cease at the time of Reformation, in contradiction to what himself had implicitly yielded concerning the lawfulness of salutation <hi>p.</hi> 32. which is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward civil respect.</p>

               <p>But <hi>T.</hi> E. has another distinction, and bids his Readers consider <hi>to whom this in Luk.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>was spoken; They were Pharisees, of whom</hi> (T. E. says) <hi>there were several ranks and degrees, there were chief Pharisees, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Pharisees; and they took place one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nay there were seven ranks among them, as</hi> Goodwin <hi>tells us,</hi> &amp;c. p. 40.</p>

               <p>The Quaker is out again; Where did he ever read of inferiour Pharisees? Indeed in

                  <hi>ver.</hi> 1. it's said <hi>one of the chief Pharisees,</hi> but in the Greek 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

For though <hi>Goodwin</hi> tells him that there were seven ranks among the Pharisees, he do's not tell him, that they took place of one another by virtue of higher or lower ranks; for there was no such matter, one Rank looking on themselves to be as good as another: Hence the learned <hi>Scultetus</hi> saith <hi>Pharisaeorum septem non classes aut ordines, sed genera fuisse liquet.</hi> And we may note by <note place="margin">Ex Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vang. lib. 1. cap. 24.</note> the way, that they who go about to explain Scripture upon pretence of their having the Spirit, do (if they want the ordinary means, <hi>viz.</hi> Learning sanctified by the Spirit) soon baffle themselves, and demonstrate they have no true Spirit in them.</p>

               <p>Was there ever so gross an absurdity?

But to let that pass: Did ever Christ establish such an <hi>equality,</hi> as to take away all superiority and subordination? How comes then the Quakers to allow that of <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Servant</hi> p. 43. Christians indeed are in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Almighty God all Equals, as to the capacity to Salvation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28.

               <p>But he concludes his Comment on <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 10. thus, <hi>The words of the Apostle</hi> James <hi>may be understood a general prohibition of that vain Custom of respecting persons upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion whatsoever.</hi> ibid.</p>

               <p>I shewed you before how this Quaker contradicts himself; Now I shall shew how the Quakers contradict one another: In a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pamphlet called <hi>a Treatise of Oaths,</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by thirteen Quakers, in the name of the rest, and dedicated to the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, you will find this expression, <hi>We do with all due</hi> RESPECTS <hi>present you with our Reasons,</hi> p. 3. Now do's St. <hi>Iames</hi> give <hi>a general prohibition against all Respects,</hi> both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, none excepted? Why then do the Quakers contradict their own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent? For according to <hi>T. E.</hi> the most sincere and cordial respects are unlawful, and contrary to the Quakers Principles (as you have heard) and 'tis a vain and evil Custom (as he says here) to give them upon any occasion whatsoever. Why do's he rail against me and tax <hi>my</hi> honesty? Why did he not rather tell his Brethren, that they did not observe their <hi>Decorum?</hi> and that <hi>They were not a fit Company to represent the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Quakers? Yea, do's not this passage look like a design laid to mistake their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples?</hi> Why do's not <hi>T. E.</hi> tell them as much? yet he finds no fault with his Brethren for that which he condemns in Us; And therefore is deeply guilty of that partial respect, which both the Scripture and right Reason do every where condemn.</p>

Par.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot imagine what should hold the Quakers unsatisfied in this matter, unless it be this weak scruple, that they may respect <hi>men</hi> but not the <hi>persons</hi> of men.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Is not respecting <hi>men</hi> and the <hi>persons</hi> of men all one? Can you make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>man</hi> and his <hi>person?</hi> Do the Quakers understand, what the word they are contending for signifies? Do's it import any more, than honour, favour and kindness? To honour a man is to respect him; to favour a man is to respect him; to be kind to a man is to shew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to him; Are these sins?</p>
               <p>As Respecting persons relates to partiality, either in dispensing of the Gospel, or the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of justice, so far it is a great sin; But as it relates to honour, civility, humanity, and kindness; it's in that case so far from being a sin, so far from being prohibited, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly enjoyn'd and commanded us, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 32. And it was reputed a sin in <hi>Israel,</hi> that they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected not the persons of the Priests, and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the Elders, Lam.</hi> 4. 16.

               <p>I would have you to observe also, how the Quaker is come down from the conceit of his Revelations so far, as at last to yield that Learning may be made use of to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true sense of Scripture; which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession has taken away the force of his Eighth Chapter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>But he tells us, that in that Text <hi>Christ condemned also the use of those Titles</hi> [Father and Master] <hi>in every sense, where there is not a true relation,</hi> that is (as he explains it) <hi>by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Law,</hi> which he calls <hi>a direct untruth.</hi> ibid.</p>

               <p>As much learning as the Quaker thinks he has, it has failed him here; seeing this sense which he has added, is neither agreeable to the occasion and scope of that Text, nor is consistent with other places of Scripture, wherein you will find Titles without either of these sorts of Relation: I mention'd some in the <hi>Conference,</hi> which he unhandsomly passes by, as those of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> giving even their Persecutors the Title of Fathers, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 2. and 22. 1. and of our Blessed Saviour, who gave the Title of <hi>Friend</hi> to the Traitor <hi>Iudas, Mat.</hi> 26. 50. Now which of these were due either by <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Law?</hi> Did our Saviour <hi>contrary to his Nature</hi> speak an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth?

               <p>And that the publick Prayers of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians had always a Form of Confession in them, is what all the Ancient Liturgies do manifest.

               <p>I answer, 1. Confession of sins past implies no such thing: Some Authors report, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> rose betimes every Morning to weep for the denial of his Master. 2. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant general confession of our being sinners im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies no wilful course of sin, but the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in them that do it sincerely, <hi>viz.</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant sight and sense of it, a constant sorrow for it, a constant desire, and endeavour to reform it. This we deny not, that such Confession implies daily need of Mercy; but then this is
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57744:64"/>
no more, than what becomes the best of men, while even such do find themselves not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from all infirmity. <hi>Bradford,</hi> whom the Quaker himself acknowledges an Eminent Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, used in his confession to say, <hi>Thou art Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and I am Hell.</hi> We are sure the Quakers have the disease of sin, as well as others, but alas! not the same hope of Cure, because they will not see the need they have of a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 12.</note>

               <p>But after all this I must ask our confident Quaker, 1. How he is infallibly certain, he has obtain'd to an absolute unsinning state of Perfection? For he must grant that he ought to confess, and ask pardon, till he be infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of his being pure from all sin, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all spot and blemish, as pure as <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fell, as the Angels in Heaven, and the Spirits of just men made perfect; for he must grant that he ought to confess and ask forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57744:66"/>
of all, even the least Moral weaknesses, and all defects of Obedience, whereby he falls short in the smallest degree of the absolute perfection of the Law, until he is thus sure his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances are without all defect, and himself without all infirmity. And is <hi>T. E.</hi> indeed sure he is so? and do's he know the hour and minute when he first arrived to this state, and might take confidence to conclude of his abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute perfection? But if neither we nor he himself be sure of this, or of the possibility of it, I think 'tis very safe for us to continue the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of sin, yea and for him too, lest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he should be mistaken, and in some small degree be yet imperfect. For as there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle danger of his displeasing God by any excess of humility in the continuance of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, though he were really arrived to such a perfection; so on the other side in the Case of our State towards God, there being a great deal of danger in our mistaking, I think it is good for him to consider of it, and for us to go on in our course of Confession till we be sure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I must also ask him, how he infallibly knows, that all his sins are for ever pardon'd? for I suppose he will grant that he ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and to ask forgiveness, till he be sure of a pardon.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>

               <p>That indeed is the best ground of hope (if he have it;) but not such as to make Fear or Confession needless: For seeing First, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57744:66"/>
to his own assertion <note n="†" place="margin">p. 68.</note> the state of the best and most perfect Men here is not immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that they may fall from it: Secondly, seeing perseverance to the end is a necessary condition of final pardon, and salvation; it will follow, that though <hi>T. E.</hi> were perfect, yet it were not at all improper for him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, and ask forgiveness of his former sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (according to his own Principles) he is not sure, but he may fall into sin again, which may cause his pardon to be revoked: And as there is no danger of displeasing God (as is said before) in any excess of humility in these Confessions; so the practice of this humility, and the fight and sense of our former sins is a very expedient, and indeed a necessary means to preserve us from falling into sin again. For <hi>this is that</hi> (saith St. <hi>Bernard) which makes it necessary for us to be solicitous with fear and trembling, and always humbling our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mighty hand of God, since though we can know in part what we are, yet it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>

               <p>Quakerism it self cannot plead the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of One Age. But this Doctrine was Preacht by the Popish Fryars as a Foundation for their Merits and Works of supererogation: The wild Anabaptists about 140 years ago pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended also to Perfection: And it's the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Doctrine, <hi>that we may perfectly fulfil the</hi>

                  <hi>Law of God.</hi> But all Orthodox Protestants ever opposed these Men, as much as I do the Quakers herein; who may go and boast, that they have the Pharisees, the old Hereticks, the wild Anabaptists, and the Socinians on their side in this matter; whilst we (by Gods Grace) do, and will hold the constant Doctrine of the Catholick Church.</p>

               <p>I shall be very glad to have a just account of these particulars.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I begin with the <hi>first.</hi> It's very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>Perfection</hi> or <hi>being Perfect,</hi> is taken in different senses in Holy Scripture, sometimes in a <hi>Positive</hi> sense, and sometimes in a <hi>Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>positive Perfection</hi> is that, which includes such a compleatness, wherein nothing is wanting or deficient to the answering and coming up to those measures, by which it is to be judged and examined. Now the measures by which the Perfection of Men must be judged of, are of two sorts,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Capacity of our Nature taken in its best and sinless estate, and the holy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law of God, to which it is in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect exactly conformable; And hence the first sense of Perfection is, when a Man is in a state of enjoying as great good and satisfaction, and as high purity and freedom from all stain of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as either the Nature of Man can arrive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or as the perfect Law of God do's require. This was our state in Paradise, and will be in Heaven; This is the Perfection spoken of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10. and probably <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. and elsewhere.</p>
               <p>The second Measure by which a Man's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is to be judged of, is the capacity of our Nature since the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>all, and the terms which the Gospel Covenant prescribeth, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God accepteth: Hence the second sense of Perfection is, when a Man lives as holily as ever he can in this frail estate; sincerely striving
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57744:70"/>
to do all Christian duties, and to avoid all sin; and supplying his failings by Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; So that God accepts him upon the terms of the Gospel as perfectly righteous, in and through Christ: This may be call'd <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Perfection;</hi> and is spoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14. and 13. 21. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 2. And this is oft exprest by the <hi>Perfect heart;</hi> And in this sense <hi>[Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect]</hi> is opposed to <hi>[Wicked] Iob.</hi> 9. 22. and is explain'd by <hi>being upright. Psal.</hi> 37. 37. And this may be consistent with some fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>That there are two measures of Perfection, appears by that instance I gave you of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> who acknowledges himself <hi>Perfect</hi> according to one measure, and yet <hi>not perfect</hi> according to another, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, and 15. compared. So according to this second measure, and God's gracious acceptance, <hi>Asa</hi>'s heart is said to have been <hi>perfect all his days,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 14. yet came he far short of a sinless perfection; For <hi>the high places were not taken away,</hi> ibid. And he was sinfully passionate against <hi>Hanani,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 10. Who did but his Office in reproving him for relying on the King of <hi>Syria, ver.</hi> 7 And being lame on his feet <hi>sought not to the Lord, but to the Physicians, ver.</hi> 12. Now let <hi>Ellwood,</hi> ask, what Notion the Holy Ghost has of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, who records <hi>Asa</hi> both <hi>perfect</hi> and a <hi>sinner?</hi> Therefore upon the account of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sense of Perfection, the Hebrew word for <hi>perfect</hi> is by our Translators often render'd <hi>upright,</hi> and made use of to express the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry qualification for obtaining God's favour,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57744:70"/>
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. 2. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 5. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23. Elsewhere it is exprest by <hi>a heart that is sound in God's Statutes;</hi> and made to be a ground of sure hope and confidence in God's mercy. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 80. Yea, the Hebrew word signifying perfection is translated <hi>sincerity, Ios.</hi> 24. 14. which <hi>T. E.</hi> seems to deny, <hi>p.</hi> 72. This for the Positive sense of Perfection.</p>
               <p>The next sense of Perfection is <hi>Comparative,</hi> by which is meant such a Perfection, as is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly compleat in it self in respect to the first and highest Measures, but only more compleat than some other, to which it is compared; And this applied to our case, consists in outdoing the lower sorts of Christians, and coming up to the higher measures and degrees of knowledge and practice; and in this sense Perfection is taken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
               <p>Now to apply this threefold distinction of Perfection: The attaining a <hi>comparative per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> is not only desirable, and useful, but possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nay 'tis actually arrived to by some, though not by all, who notwithstanding may be true Christians.</p>
               <p>The attaining an <hi>Evangelical perfection</hi> is not only possible, but also absolutely necessary to all true Christians.</p>
               <p>But an <hi>absolute Perfection</hi> in the first sense (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which the dispute lies) though it be the Crown we aim at, yet is not attain'd by any in this life: which is my next particular, of which I shall now give you an account.</p>

               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>As you propounded it before, it was this, <hi>Whether the best of Men can in this World at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:57744:71"/>
                  <hi>to such a perfection as they need not, or ought not to acknowledge themselves sinners and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>To which query I reply by laying down these propositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That there being two Measures, by which we may judge of our Perfection, Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the perfect and exact Law of God, and the Terms of the Gospel Covenant; the first of these is the Rule of our Duty; the second is the condition of our acceptance, which are not one and the same under the Gospel: The Covenant of Grace as a Covenant requires not the first sort of perfection in order to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance (though the Law do's still call for it;) For if it did, Salvation were impossible for us in our faln and frail estate: Yet still the Gospel is a dispensation of <hi>purity</hi> as well as <hi>grace,</hi> nor is it the design thereof to cancel our Obligation to obedience, but rather to advance it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it rejects not any Moral duty, nor allows any thing that is Morally evil; For as it cannot be, that any thing Good or Evil should cease to be <hi>so</hi> under the Gospel; So it is unsuitable to the design of that Doctrine that establisheth God's Kingdom, to discharge Man from the obedience which he owes as a Creature. Whence it follows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That all, even the least evil is a sin, because the transgression of a Law, as well as the grosser Acts of sin; All evil thoughts, irregular desires, and disorderly passions, and also the omission of the due exercise of good thoughts and desires, as well as of good words
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57744:71"/>
and actions, are breaches of God's Holy Law now, incur His displeasure, deserve His wrath, and need His pardon: for Man's present ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to keep the Law in the rigour of it, do's by no means excuse him of his duty to keep the whole Law; because his weakness is the effect of his own sin and fall, and he is accountable for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Perfection of Practice in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all evil, and performing every Duty, which God requires, ought to be endeavour'd after: yet such an Absolute sinless Perfection in the whole course of our lives is not attain'd in this life, nor was it ever actually attain'd by any meer Man since the fall; which though I formerly proved to you in the <hi>Conference,</hi> yet will I now take more pains with you to confirm it.</p>
               <p>Perfection is opposed to Moral imperfection, and signifies a state and condition absolutely sinless in rigour of Law, such as comes up to the first Measure, and our primitive Capacity before we Fell: Thus the word ought to be taken in this Controversie; And now I shall tell you how far we dispute against it, and this I shall do both Negatively and Affirmatively. <hi>First,</hi> We do not deny it to be desirable, for it is the matter of our highest aims and hopes; Nor <hi>(Secondly)</hi> As wholly and for ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to us, for we believe we shall attain it, when we reach the Heavenly Mansions; Nor <hi>(Thirdly)</hi> As impossible for God to effect now in our present State, who can do every thing which implyeth not a contradiction; Nor
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57744:72"/>
                  <hi>(Fourthly)</hi> Do we discard sincere endeavours after it; For we constantly maintain; That sincere endeavour to perfect Holiness, and to live without all manner of sin, is the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salvation: For what Divine ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it lawful to allow our selves in any sin? That therefore we Assert is as followeth;</p>
               <p>We maintain <hi>(First)</hi> That the absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection here explained, is not the condition of Salvation; seeing even <hi>Babes in Christ</hi> (who are far remote from it) may be saved. <hi>(Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)</hi> We maintain, that it is not the ordinary condition of Christians, but is to be reckoned (though not among the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, things sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply impossible, if God were pleas'd to use His power, yet) among the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, things that do not actually come to pass in this World, which they that please may call Morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that is, so difficult that Men will not actually arrive to it in this lower State, wherein it hath pleased God to set us: And the Grounds of our Assertion are these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The many expressions of the Saints of God in Scripture, who testifie of themselves, that they were not absolutely sinless in rigour of Law; and the constant experience of the People of God, since the Scripture times. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The inconsistency of such perfection with the present weakness of Man's Nature, and the many deplorable circumstances, which are the consequents of his Fall. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The end of Gospel Institutions, which are plainly design'd for an Imperfect State, and of no use, if it were otherwise, in the foremention'd explained
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57744:72"/>
sense. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Abundance of Scriptures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 18. 1 Thess. 4. 1, &amp;c.</note> us to grow in Grace; therefore we can never be past growing in this life: We must abound more and more. These and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers suppose plainly, that we come not to our <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to our ultimate perfection in this life. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Those Scriptunes which shew the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of standing upon terms with God, and the misery we are in, if God should deal with us in rigour of Law: <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no Man living be justified,</hi> Psal. 143. 2. <hi>If thou Lord shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord who shall stand? Psal.</hi> 130. 3, &amp;c. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Those Scriptures which shew our need of Mercy at death and judgment: <hi>The Lord grant unto him, that he may find Mercy of the Lord in that Day.</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 18, &amp;c. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> We may confirm it, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the times of the Old Testament, from <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 7. where <hi>Aaron (the Saint of the Lord</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 106. 16.</note>) with his Successors is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned yearly to offer a Sin-offering, as well <hi>for himself,</hi> as <hi>for the errors of the people;</hi> Which shews plainly, that the Saints in the Old time had not attain'd to an unsinning perfection. And with respect to the New Testament, the same is proved by the description of the Gospel Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness consisting in having sin pardon'd. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 7. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 8, 9. So that after all this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We ought not to be discouraged as to our final estate; because this unsinning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is not the terms of our acceptance with God, nor will the want of it cause our
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57744:73"/>
final rejection: For to assert this, would make void the Covenant of Grace, which admits repentance, proposeth forgiveness, and accepts sincerity; because though it be (as I said) the design of the Gospel to prohibit all sin, and to allow none; yet if through infirmity a Man fall, it provides a Remedy, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 1. And upon performance of the conditions of our accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, secures Salvation.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>I see not why Men should require more, than God is pleas'd to accept, and we in a capacity to perform: So that you need en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large no further in the proof of these; Only let me understand, What is the result, tendency, and consequent of denying the Quakers absolute unsinning State, and asserting the Evangelical Perfection; which was your Third particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>We deny the Quakers absolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, not only as unattainable, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the condition of faln Man, but as it is apt to deceive some Men into a Groundless pride, to make them neglect the means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, despise the mercy of the Death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and rely on their own Merits; as it confounds the Covenant of Works and Grace, and as it stands as that <hi>two-edged sword,</hi> Gen. 3. 24. <hi>keeping the way of the Tree of life,</hi> and making them despair of ever attaining ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Glory, when they once find themselves deceived. But then there are no ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents (as is falsly pretended) by our denying this absolute unsinning righteousness, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:57744:73"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis no discouragement to Christian care and diligence, and the most vigorous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, that any Christian can use; while he attains at present an Evangelical Perfection, and peace and reconciliation with God, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be owned as his child, and an heir of Glory, and of that State of absolute Perfection in Heaven, yea and of a greater degree of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, according to his growth in Grace here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's no Doctrine of looseness, or encouragement to sin; since <hi>that</hi> Grace, which tenders remission of sin to the sincere and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, will never accept the slothful and careless: And it's sufficiently proved, that the Gospel gives no allowance to sin, but promiseth greater rewards to greater degrees of Piety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> The asserting this Evangelical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection hath many good consequents: For it directs to the performance of many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Duties, which else would have no foundation; as the seeking of God's pardoning Mercy, and acknowledging that we deserve from Him much worse than we receive, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the Merits of Christ, and applying them to our selves in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the practice of Confession and Godly Contrition, with the exercises of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, the duty of Humility and many other, which will have no place in <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s <hi>unsinning State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are our Reasons (and it's left to you and the World, whether they be weighty or no;) why we <hi>deny</hi> one kind of Perfection, and <hi>assert</hi> another.</p>

                  <hi>Priest deals dishonestly with us?</hi> And that the Quakers never applied that text to such a sense? But you see he leaves the Argument, and makes it his business to play the Jack Pudding by telling his Reader, that I am <hi>got so high at first step, that the Quakers had need help me down again.</hi> But by his good leave I shall need no such favour from them, being without their help able to vindicate my own expression; therefore I would desire <hi>T. E.</hi> to consider, that the word <hi>[Highest]</hi> is to be limited by the persons we are speaking of: As <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>He that is higher than the Highest regardeth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Highest</hi> there signifies the <hi>Highest among Men:</hi> So Christ presseth Charity and Mercy to the Highest degree they can be acted among Men: And is this <hi>vying perfection with the Creator?</hi> He only set them the Divine Charity for a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, which is the Highest Charity in it self; and prest them to come as near it, as their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was capable of, by exercising it in the highest kind, namely, by forgiving Enemies, and in imitation of the Highest Example. St. <hi>Luke</hi> call'd <hi>Theophilus Most Excellent;</hi> will the Quaker say, he had set him so high, as to make him excel God, or at least to be Equal with him? Or was <hi>he</hi> got so high, as to stand in need of the Quakers to help him down?</p>

               <p>I fear, this was rather a wilful than ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant mistake of your Adversarie's: And do very much wonder, that having learnt from you the distinction of Equality and Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, he should tax you with the neglect of it, <hi>ibid.</hi>

               <p>I shall here enquire how a dear Friend of his understood this distinction; I mean <hi>George Fox,</hi> who blasphemously affirmed that <hi>he was equal with God;</hi> as it was attested by the Oaths of credible Witnesses at <hi>Lancaster</hi> Assizes: see the foremention'd Book call'd <hi>The Perfect Pharisee,</hi> p. 3. Where 'tis also proved, that <hi>Iames Naylor</hi> with no less blasphemy said, that <hi>he was as Holy, just, and good, as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Thus the Quakers talked of old, though now <hi>Ellwood</hi> has learnt (from the Book he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses) this Distinction, and says, <hi>They desire their Charity and Mercy may be real, true, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, of the same nature, kind, quality with God's; but expect it not in the same degree,</hi> &amp;c. ibid. But this is far short of their former boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: And therefore they who are so incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with themselves, must not complain that their Principles are mis-stated while they have no fixed Principles, nor standing Rule of Faith: For every Body knows that the Quakers are not now what they were formerly; Nor do they know themselves what they will be the next year: The Wise man saith, <hi>A fool changeth as the Moon, Ecclus</hi> 6. 11. So that I cannot but think of the witty Apologie of <hi>Cleobulus, How the Moon came and desired her Mother to make</hi>

               <p>Indeed the Proverb is, <hi>They never chose well, that change so often;</hi> yet if <hi>T. E.</hi> bring the Quakers nearer to Truth, I would not have you discourage him: And I fancy he has yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much of his Cause in the definition he gives of Perfection; Which (he says) <hi>is to aim at, and press after a State of being in this life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from sin, and by the mighty Power of God preserved from the act, commission, and guilt of sin; this,</hi> he says, <hi>is that they mean by Perfection,</hi> p. 57.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Not heeding the Tautologies of this description, we will come to the definition it self: where I must desire you to take notice, that after all his boasting of an <hi>unsinning State,</hi> p. 55. though he blames me for interpreting Perfection in several places of Scripture to mean no more than <hi>sincerity,</hi> p. 70. here he defines it to be only the <hi>aiming at and pressing after such a State.</hi> Now consider, I pray, that he that is <hi>aiming,</hi> has not <hi>hit</hi> the Mark as yet; he that is <hi>pressing</hi> after such a State, has not yet <hi>attain'd</hi> to it; This is not that absolute Perfection, which the Quakers used to pretend to: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> concluded that he was not already Perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had not already <hi>attained,</hi> and was but <hi>pressing towards the Mark,</hi> Phil. 3. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Perfectum est cui nihil deest:</hi> He that is strictly <note place="margin">Arist.

               <p>
                  <hi>Finally, Ellwood</hi> has brought his Perfection to signifie no more, than sincere Endeavours to be free from Sin; and thus much we yield and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57744:76"/>
press. <hi>We are perfect Travellers</hi> (as saith St. <hi>Augustine) not perfect possessors;</hi> and our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is capable of increase: For <hi>no Man is perfect</hi> (saith St. <hi>Bernard) who desires not to be</hi>

                  <hi>still more perfect,</hi> &amp;c. But if this be all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Perfection, they are but like their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and is it not unreasonable, that <hi>T. E.</hi> should dispute against his own definition? I wish he and his Brethren would stand to this sense of perfection; for then we should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed as to this point: but I fear from what follows, the Quaker thinks that he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot himself; and his Brethren perhaps will charge him to have betrayed their Cause.</p>

               <p>I doubt as much; for <hi>p.</hi> 59. he infers not only a possibility of living without sin, but in the next page he is expresly for an <hi>unsinning State,</hi> affirming that the commands for it are <hi>plainly produced:</hi> Now indeed one would think, if God command us to be perfectly free from all sin, there might be some, who in this life are truly so; because he commands no impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>

               <p>This is an usual fallacy with <hi>T.

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:57744:76"/>
The Law indeed still demands Perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, though we are utterly unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it; and this most righteously, because it is not God, but our selves who are the causes of our own inability; It is the effect of our own sin; and therefore both our Obedience to the whole Law, and all our primitive Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, which we had before the <hi>Fall,</hi> are by the Law justly required of us. But then the Gospel Covenant in Jesus Christ, who has sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the rigour of the Law for us, requires no such thing, as necessary to Salvation, of us; though it requires our utmost endeavours after it; as has been said.</p>

               <p>I would have you answer this more fully; for I perceive he is not a little pleased with this Device, but relies much upon it; And for <hi>Iob,</hi> he conceives that <hi>it cannot be fairly infer'd, that he was not deliver'd and kept from sin in the precedent and subsequent parts of his life,</hi> p. 64.

               <p>The notion this Quaker has got of Perfection will amount to no more than this, that a Man may be perfect at Morning, fall at Noon, and be Perfect again at Night.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57744:77"/>
with Relapses into sin. I'm sure, I may more justly argue thus; The Saints have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Once, and therefore may sin Twice, and consequently Many times; They have the same Enemies without, and propensities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: And for all <hi>T. E.</hi>'s fallacious Argument, 'tis not so probable, that a Good man shall abstain from sin a <hi>whole Year,</hi> as it is, he shall abstain from sin <hi>one Day,</hi> much less <hi>an Hour;</hi> because the mind cannot be so long fixt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to avoid the innumerable occasions of <hi>Fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> I can keep awake one Night, but not many; not therefore a Week, or a Year, or an Age: yet by <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s Argument, we may stand in a Posture for ever.</p>

I doubt the Quaker must be forced here to leave the Scriptures, and go to the Popish Legend, to prove that <hi>Bonaventure</hi> never committed any sin in his whole life; which story has as little of Truth in it, as <hi>Ellwood</hi>'s Argument has of solid Reason. Finally, if <hi>T. E.</hi> can go no higher than to prove, The Saints are perfect, only while they do not sin; And that the Divine power <hi>can</hi> preserve them from sin for an Age together; All this may be said of Sinners, who yet are no more perfect, then is his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

               <p>'Tis true, as death leaves, Judgment will find us, as to the general State of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy or Unregeneracy; but this is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true concerning all perfections or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Body or Soul, and many other things relating to the State of the whole Man: The Body, which dying is Gorruptible, will not be such when raised again; The Assaults of Satan, and Allurements from various objects, both men and things in the World, after depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hence, have no place. He that to the time of death lived by Faith with respect to things above, will then have a more present sight of another World, and the State of Happiness, and of the Glorious Majesty of God, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: Nor will his State then be (as here it is unto death) subject to weariness and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and such imperfections, whereby he is here oft indisposed for constant vigorous actions, and such compleat perfection of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, as by his Original strength Man was able to exercise before his fall, and which therefore in the strictness of the Divine Law is still required of him, and the least defect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is therefore sinful, and hath need of that Pardon purchased for us by Jesus Christ.

But I pray you mark, that here he wholly passes by the account I gave you in the <hi>Conference,</hi> of the word <hi>[Perfect]</hi> not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways meaning an absolute unsinning State, but frequently no more than sincerity, as you have it sometimes in the Margin of the larger Bibles, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 13.

               <p>He answers, <hi>The First Resurrection, mention'd,</hi> Rev. 20. 6. <hi>which the Apostle refers to,</hi> Col. 3. 1. <hi>If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,</hi> p. 72.</p>

               <p>The <hi>First Resurrection</hi> is the raising up a Sinner from the Death of Sin to Newness of life; and this is <hi>Conversion.</hi> Has not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Quaker mended the matter well? Was St. <hi>Paul,</hi> so long after his Conversion (which we read of <hi>Acts</hi> 9.) dubious, whether he should attain Conversion? After so great profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in Holiness; yea after that he had (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>T.

E</hi>'s. self-contradictions baffle his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coin'd sense? But I would desire him to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the <hi>Resurrection of the Dead</hi> is often taken for the <hi>better part,</hi> that is for <hi>the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to life,</hi> as <hi>Luk,</hi> 20. 35, 36. <hi>they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that World, and the Resurrection from the dead—are equal unto the Angels,</hi> &amp;c. And thus it signifies in this 11 <hi>ver.</hi> He laboured, if by any means he might attain to that better part of the General Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rction, Namely, the endless life of Glory: Now is it any absurdity for St. <hi>Paul</hi> to press after this? or to tell them, that he had not yet attained the full measure of his Perfection, and the end of his Hope, but was only in the Race, <hi>&amp;c?

which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here useth (saith he) <hi>to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his lifting up to meet the Lord in the Air, which is only the portion of Blessed Souls:</hi> We conclude therefore that <hi>[Perfect]</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. must signifie the absolute unsinning State of Perfection, which the Saints shall have in the next World; this St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not attained here in this World; Hence it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>[Perfect]</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 15. must mean some lower degree of Perfection.</p>

               <p>Now you have made me sufficiently sensible, that it is the <hi>Quaker,</hi> and not the <hi>Priest, who was as well out in his notion of the Resurrection, as in that of Perfection.</hi> Now he comes to examine your interpretation of 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>whosoever is born of God sinneth not,</hi> that is (say you) lives not in a wilful course and trade of sin, though not wholly without sin. And whereas you affirmed, that otherwise St. <hi>Iohn</hi> would contradict other plain texts of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 46. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 20. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 9, <hi>&amp;c. T.

               <p>But those texts speak of <hi>All</hi> men in general, Spiritual as well as Natural, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there would be no sense in them: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, while he interprets 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 46. <hi>[there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Child of wrath but sinneth;</hi> or <hi>There is no sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that sinneth not:</hi> thus he makes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as ridiculous as his own Canting: I hope a Spiritual Man is a Man still; &amp; therefore from the testimony of this Scripture, Such an one sinneth.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 9. <hi>Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</hi> you may note, that he makes the latter part of this verse to be only a repetition, as having no other sense than that same, which he has given of the former part: These words, <hi>[Who can say—I am pure from my sin?]</hi> must signifie nothing, if they oppose <hi>T. E</hi>'s. assertion. And that threatning in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24. against a Righteous man committing iniquity (he says) <hi>implies there was a time, when he did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit iniquity;</hi> but do's not consider, that by <hi>committing iniquity</hi> there is meant his falling into gross sins, as appears by the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately added, <hi>And doth according to all the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateons that the wicked man doth:</hi> this implies indeed that there was a time, when the righteous Man did not commit gross sins, but not that there was a time when he lived without all infirmities &amp; moral imperfections. And as for <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 20. <hi>[If I justifie my self, my own mouth shall condemn me; If I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.]</hi> This he would evade by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent discourse of <hi>self-justification;</hi> while the Translators meant no more than (in the sense of the Original) <hi>If I say I am just,</hi> or (as <hi>Olimpiodorus</hi> expounds it) <hi>If I dare to say, I am righteous,</hi> &amp;c. and the latter partof the verse is express enough, <hi>If I say I am perfect,</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:57744:82"/>
&amp;c. If <hi>Iob</hi> was perfect, as the Quaker pleads, what reason can be given, why he should deny it, and disclaim the Grace of God in him? why might he not say, he was so?

prove the Apostles <hi>no Offenders,</hi> he proves them <hi>no Quakers;</hi> while he would shew they were Perfect, he makes them (according to your strict way of reproving others) to be manifest Lyars, in saying <hi>[We,]</hi> while they mean <hi>[Ye.]</hi> Thus while he defends one point, he confutes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in another; <hi>Ea enim mendaciorum natura est,</hi>

               <p>By all this is manifest that 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 18. means not an <hi>absolute Perfection;</hi> which further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and that most evidently in this, that this is asserted of <hi>all that are Born of God;</hi> Now <hi>Babes in Christ</hi> are born of God; But I hope, <hi>T.

And while we are running, we are not yet at the Goal. To tell men of their being absolute Conquerors, while our Adversaries are in Arms, is to make them <hi>secure,</hi> before they are <hi>safe:</hi> No Man can boast, <hi>till he put his Armour off,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 11. And 'tis the Evening that Crowns the Day. Yet we teach, that if Christians be watchful, and use God's Grace aright, they shall not be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded in the Battel, but gain ground of the Enemy more and more, and get the upper hand in this life: The House of <hi>Saul</hi> in them (as I may so speak) shall grow weaker and weaker, and the House of <hi>David</hi> shall grow stronger and stronger; and they shall be absolute Conquerors at the last.</p>
               <p>We do not deny, but that Christians may and must get a comfortable conquest over their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and proceed forwards towards a total overthrow: And this is encouragement sufficient, that (if they be faithful) they shall daily be on the winning and prevailing hand: as men in wrestling with the distempers of their Bodies, are not discouraged, if they know,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57744:85"/>
they may daily get ground of them, and arrive at a comfortable State of health, though they know, they can never arrive at the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State of health in this life. A Scholar is not discouraged in his Studies, though be knows he can never be free from all ignorance; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he may make a very great progress in Learning, and daily be on the improving hand, he seeketh as much learning as he can attain with a comfortable vigour and industry: A Christian may much more comfortably pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue Perfection, because he is assured he shall one day compass it, that is, in Heaven; There it is, where we shall find our selves <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that we may comfortably labour after such acquests and perfections, as are not attainable here below, because our grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endeavours here shall be rewarded with those perfections hereafter; Witness the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, who pressed <hi>forward towards the Mark, and to attain the Resurrection of the dead,</hi> &amp;c.

Moreover it is themost pressing encouragement, that can be exprest, to Christians, in this life to their Duty, and assault their Spiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies with all their might, and in that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to abound more and more, when they are told, that they shall not only receive the Prize, an Incorruptible Crown of Glory, but

               <p>A strange Conclusion indeed! which if true, would damn <hi>T. E.</hi> and all mankind: This is <hi>Socinianism</hi> in the highest degree. What? No redemption? no pardon for Penitents? Has Christ's death done no good to the avoiding of Condemnation? then wo be to all the World. But <hi>T. E.</hi> has found a better way to Heaven, <hi>(viz.)</hi> by being so perfectly free from sin, that God cannot justly condemn him: And hence in this whole Chapter he avoids all mention of <hi>Christ's Merits,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins,</hi> &amp;c. Laying the foundation of his Title to Heaven, upon a <hi>perfect freedom from sin in this life,</hi> p. 92. The Popish Doctrine of Merits is short of this, which takes in Christ's Merits to their own, as giving value to them: but <hi>T. E.</hi> being in a greater degreee <hi>ignorant of God's Righteousness, goes about to establish his own, Rom.</hi> 10. 3. But let him know (if this be his opinion) that a <hi>possibility of not sinning</hi> will not serve his turn, but an actual and total free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from it; If he commit but the least sin, he must be condemned according to his own Position. <hi>For wheresoever there is sin</hi> (says he) <hi>there is also condemnation.</hi> God grant that he may not be dealt with according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his own Principles, but that he may rather see his error to his Conversion, than feel the sad effect of it to his Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The rest of his discourse on this subject is spent in artifices, to render me, and my Doctrine odious: but upon the Principles I have already laid down (in the stating of this Case of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection)

               <p>'Tis very true, that all such acts of Religion, as owe their original to a Positive Command, and have no reason in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing to put mankind upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of them, as in the case of Circumcision, these are not acts of Natural Religion; for <hi>T. E.</hi> may read the definition of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in Bishop <hi>Wilkins</hi>'s Discourse upon that Subject, <hi>pag.</hi> 39. <hi>That is Natural Religion, which Men might know, and should be obliged unto by the meer Principles of Reason improved by consideration and experience, without the help of Revelation.</hi> Now an Oath came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to use among men from the meer Principles of Reason improved by consideration, without the help of Revelation. So that if an Oath be an Act of Religion, it must be an act or part of Natural Religion. For the first that ever required an Oath was <hi>Abimelech</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 23. He required <hi>Abraham</hi> to swear; <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>said, I will swear, ver.</hi> 24. Yet we read not, that either <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s requiring, or <hi>Abraham</hi>'s consenting to it, was by any positive command from God: So that <hi>T. E.</hi> must grant, that Men were led to bind their Covenants by a solemn calling of God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that by the light of Nature, of which more anon. But when I say, an Oath is an act or part of Natural Religion, I do not insist, that it is by Natural Religion commanded pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, simply and <hi>per se</hi> towards God; but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately, implicitly and by consequence, as a necessary <hi>medium</hi> for the publick good in this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57744:89"/>
state of things: For the Law of Nature, that commands the end, must also command the only means; So that the use of an Oath is commanded by the Law of Nature <hi>ex hypothesi,</hi> or from a supposition that it is necessary for the publick good; just in the same sense, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates are commanded by the same Law to make Penal Laws against Vice: But if we were perfectly innocent, neither the one nor the other would be commanded. You may remember I told you in the Conference, that <hi>if there were that truth in men that their bare testimony were infallible, and of sufficient cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Conf. p. 61.</note> 
                  <hi>then there were no need at all of an Oath.</hi> So that we are commanded by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to use Oaths only upon just and necessary occasions. And thus I assert (what I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Conference) that an Oath (rightly taken) that is (as every honest man will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand me, and as I interpreted my self) duly circumstantiated, and taken in <hi>truth, in judgment and in righteousness,</hi> is an Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 2.</note> Religion, and understood plainly by the light of Nature to comprehend a great deal of Religion in it, as having God for the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate object of that appeal, which therein is made to Him, and by which so many of the Divine Attributes are acknowledged and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, as I shew'd you in the <hi>Conference.</hi> And an Oath being such, and so needful to the ends of justice and charity, it remains (as I said) that it is not made unlawful by the Doctrine of Christ, who has prohibited nothing, that hath so much of Morality and goodness in it.</p>

As if I had meant the testimony of these three alone, when I plainly spake of all those testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which might be produced from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Authors, of which these three were the most eminent and plain; And since other Proofs and Examples are so numerous, I thought these might suffice, otherwise I could have cited three hundred as well as three; but indeed this is the first time a Man was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver required to bring in an induction of all Authors in the World to prove the consent of all mankind.

Let us try in a parallel Case: Excommunication is an Act of Religion; Now if I should bring many who say, it must not be used Lightly, and some who forbid to use it at all inslight manner, many who say, a Good man needs not to be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and some, with <hi>Polybius,</hi> who tell us, that in the best and simplest Ages of the Church it was seldom used, but when Heresies and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties encreased, the use of Excommunication encreased also: Doth this prove Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be no Act of Christian Religion?

               <p>You have been shewed that the first Oath that is mention'd, was tender'd by <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> (an Heathen) to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of and taken by him, before any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law was given about it.

is so plain, that I hope, <hi>T. E.</hi> himself will be so ingenuous, as to consider of it.</p>
               <p>But I have now a great complaint to make against him, That whereas (you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) I gave you the Definition of an Oath, and told you, it was <hi>a religious appeal unto God, the seareher of all hearts, as a Witness of what w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Another thing I complain of as a grand O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is, that all this while he has given us no definition of his own, nor any such express description of an Oath, as to make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what he means by it: This is an Omission very injurious to Peace; for as he may state the Case, we may be as much against Oaths (in his sense) as himself.</p>

But the Oath it self, you must understand, is (in reference to Truth) the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. not a mode, nor ceremony of speaking it.

But here in this passage of <hi>T.

               <p>As for Bishop <hi>Gauden,</hi> he speaks of those who have got a <hi>custom</hi> of Swearing, which is another case. But for the Quakers objection, that <hi>Men leavened with hypocrisie &amp; swayed</hi> with <hi>malice and Interest</hi> are not to be trusted, when
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57744:102"/>
they do Swear: I answer, that Experience shews, that Evil men will say much more, than they dare swear to ina Court of Judicature; Many dread Swearing, that do not stick at Lying. But if we grant that some are so wicked, that they will both lye and forswear; what then? <hi>'tis to no purpose to require an Oath of them,</hi> says the Quaker: I answer, yes; for why should a mans wickedness priviledge him from the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Society? this is the way to encourage more to be wicked: We know a Knave's Bond is little better than his his Word, and yet we take his Bond as the best assurance we can have.

               <p>If St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s words must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>T. E</hi>'s. sense, they make Oaths as insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57744:102"/>
during the Law, as in the times of the Gospel; that reason being as good then, as now. And though I might urge, that the Learned have doubted, Whether the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies he Quotes were St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s or no; yet I shall take it as granted, and reply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That it is true of Common discourse, where rash Oaths spoken without any solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do as easily fall from Common Swearers, as Lyes from Common Lyars; But in Judicial Oaths Experience shews, that Men have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er dread upon them: And that this whole Discourse is to be understood only of Common Swearing, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew that a Man is not one whit more to be Credited in his Discourse for the Oaths he mingles with it, I thus prove. <hi>(First)</hi> These are Homilies, which were Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Sermons; and were not directed to the Magistrates, who had the power of giving and requiring Oaths. <hi>(Secondly)</hi> In all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Homiles of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> about Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He plainly speaks only of private mens Swearing among themselves, which he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>superfluous Oaths. Hom.</hi> 5. <hi>ad pop. Antioch:</hi> And there tells the people, he would not give over Preaching against it, <hi>till they had left this evil Custom of Common Swearing;</hi> And advises the Masters and Mistresses of such Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as swore in their Families, <hi>to make them go Supperless to Bed. (Thirdly)</hi> In all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> would not dare (being a Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople)</hi> in the Imperial City to inveigh against the Oaths then used in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57744:103"/>
the Emperors Judicatories; or if he had, his many and bitter Enemies (who laid other fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous things to his Charge) would surely have deeply accused him for this, which yet is never mentioned: So that this can be meant of none but private Oaths in Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> If <hi>T. E.</hi> apply it to publick Oaths, he shall see the weakness of such arguing by a familiar instance: Suppose <hi>T. E.</hi> be to lend 100 <hi>l.</hi> of some Orphans under his Care, Will he not expect and require a Bond? I believe, He will; and I ask Why? <hi>The Man is either one that fears God and is Honest, and then his Word is good without a Bond; or he does not fear God and is a Knave, and then his Bond is of little value:</hi> Would <hi>T. E.</hi> or any wise Man with such plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments be wheehled out of a prudent care of the best security he could get? I speak not this to derogate from the Fathers; but in their Popular Discourses (tis sufficiently known) their Arguments are rather Rhetorical than Logical, and must not always be used as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in Dispute; but as to this Quotation, it is applied by <hi>T. E.</hi> to a purpose contrary to the Author's meaning, and that makes it dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into a meer fallacy. But of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> more hereafter.</p>

                  <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Pelusium</hi> imitates his Master St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and is also to be interpreted of private Oaths, which inredulous Men rrequire of one another in ordinary Communication, and take familiarly, which no doubt are great sins: And that he means it not of Magistrates requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring publick Oaths is plain, because that was always Lawful before Christs time; and (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>T. E</hi>'s. opinion be) <hi>Isidore</hi> affirmeth, <hi>That the Son of God did not add any new Doctrine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above what was in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Lib. 1. Ep. 107. ad Tim.

               <p>To his lesser Authorities I reply, That not one of those he cites were against solemn Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore they (saying much the same, that the two preceding Fathers had done) do confirm us in the belief, the Fathers spoke of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Swearing; for these do so.</p>

Yet I will tell <hi>T.

               <p>To these I answer, First, That <hi>T. E.</hi> minces my Argument, which was this, <hi>Seeing therefore that the ends of Iustice and Charity are so much served by the Religious use of an Oath; would not the abolishing of it derogate from the honour of Christianity? for while the Apostle saith,</hi> An Oath for confirmation is the end of all strife; <hi>if you take away an Oath, you take away that which was ordained by God to be the most effectual means of ending it, and so make Christ not so much the Prince of Peace, as Discord, by making him the abolisher of that which was design'd to compose it</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Conf. p. 62, 63.</note>. Now had the Quaker found my Argument really faulty, why did he not strike at the foundation of it? which is this, <hi>An Oath for confirmation is an end of strife:</hi> by which omission he has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his other reasonings impertinent and vain. I grant it would be for the honour of Christianity, to take away the need of an Oath; but to make a Law against it, while the necessity continues, this is not for its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though Oaths were <hi>attainable</hi> under Judaism and Heathenism, it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57744:105"/>
that they are <hi>Useless</hi> now. <hi>Iustice</hi> in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, and <hi>Government</hi> by Laws and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates were attainable too, the Jews and Heathens being thus kept in order; but must <hi>We</hi> therefore throw these away?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Would All <hi>sincerely embrace</hi> Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I know with <hi>T. E.</hi> that it would make them <hi>upright, just and true, so that they durst not speak a falshood,</hi> and so there would be no need of an Oath. But if <hi>T. E.</hi> let Oaths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone till this come to pass, I promise him, I will not then dispute for them. If men were what they <hi>are</hi> not, than might we spare, what now we <hi>cannot</hi> be without.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to Bishop <hi>Gauden's</hi> words, I see no Argument producible thence against <hi>us;</hi> For the Bishop does not say, that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians refused to take <hi>Any</hi> Oath what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>[indefinitely]</hi> (for then he need have gone no further;) but only such an Oath, as <hi>for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or manner, or Authority was unlawful.</hi> And which of Us does plead for such an Oath? But to give you further satisfaction in this point, I shall hereafter prove, what the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop speaks of the Primitive Christians, <hi>viz.</hi> that they did not refuse any Oaths, but such as were unlawful upon some of these accounts; but did swear <hi>by Gods Name,</hi> as we do, in necessary Cases.</p>

A man may lament it, that these things should be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; but since they are so, they must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.

               <p>And truly if Oaths were taken away, and other like Securities at <hi>T. E</hi>'s.

               <p>To both these places I answer, When the Quakers say, <hi>Oaths are Ceremonial,</hi> they mean, <hi>they are a part of</hi> Moses <hi>his Law,</hi> and <hi>T.

               <p>Was not <hi>(says he)</hi> Circumcision in the Flesh used before the Levitical Law was given? <hi>ibid.</hi> Were not Beasts sacrifiecd long before the Levitical Law was given? will you thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Circumcision, and these Sacrifices are parts of the moral and eternal Law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I answer, Neither were they <hi>properly</hi> Levitical Ceremonies; for first, Circumcision (saith Christ) <hi>is not of Moses, but of the Fathers, Ioh.</hi> 7. 22. And though it be not <hi>Moral,</hi> yet there is a great difference between <hi>that</hi> and <hi>Oaths:</hi> Circumcision hath no reason <hi>in it self,</hi> why it should be observed, nor could the Light of Nature ever have taught it Men, without a Positive institution, which is recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. But Oaths have a reason <hi>in their own nature,</hi> and the Light of Nature led men to use them long before any Law was given about them: <hi>T. E.</hi> confesses, <hi>the Patriarchs used them;</hi> let him shew what Command they had for so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as is evident in the Case of Circumcision) and then Oaths and Circumcision may fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but this is impossible, <hi>Therefore</hi> though Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision be Ceremonial, Oaths are <hi>not</hi> so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to Sacrifices, they are believed by all Divines to have had a Positive institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> as to the offering things slain; some think God taught this to <hi>Adam,</hi> others to <hi>Noah;</hi> and no Man will say that Sacrifices are Levitical Ceremonies: I grant that Sacrificing <hi>slain Beasts</hi> being <hi>Typical</hi> of Christ was Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial; But Sacrifice as it is the <hi>oblation of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>

                  <hi>to God in acknowledgment of His being Lord of all the World,</hi> is a part of <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> as well as Oaths; Mortification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Alms Heb.</hi> 13. 16. and Praise <hi>ver.</hi> 15. are called <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in Gospel Times, and are Eternal Duties; And the Fathers hold, that under the Gospel the <hi>Kind</hi> is altered, but there are <hi>Christian Sacrifices</hi> still; as I could largely prove were there any need for it. Wherefore an Oath doth not agree with Sacrifices, as they were <hi>instituted,</hi> and as they pointed to Christ's Death; but as they are an acknowledgment of God's Sovereignty and Bounty, so they are a part of Natural Religion, and no Ceremonies, and of the same nature and duration with an Oath, both being Moral: And indeed Oaths were never instituted, but supposed; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where they are spoken of in the Law or Prophets, are only restrained to due circumstances, and set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Moral Duties, Deut.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 2.</p>

               <p>A Pure invention of the Quakers! As if all that sware, before Christ brought in Truth, were perjured.

Indeed an Oath is the calling God to Witness to a Truth spoken, as Prayer is the Calling on Him
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57744:112"/>
to supply our wants; Now how strange would it be to say, Prayer is a Type of the supply of our wants without Prayer? yet it is as absurd to say, an <hi>Oath is a Type of Truth-speaking</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Oath; Besides, <hi>thus</hi> Type and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type would have always gone together, or else it was false swearing; And was Christ the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype actually slain with every Sacrifice that was a Type of him?

               <p>'Tis no wonder to me to find this Quaker omitting any material passage in my Book: But as to those instances I gave you, they are the truest and plainest way of interpreting Christ's meaning: for if St. <hi>Paul swore</hi> in <hi>those</hi> writings which were dictated by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> it's plain demonstration, that <hi>all</hi> Oaths are not forbidden. <hi>For the Apostle</hi> (saith St. <hi>Augustine) doubtless knew the Command of our Lord, and yet be swore</hi>

               <p>Certainly he is not so stupid, as to <hi>think</hi> as he writes here; For nothing can be more plain, than that the Oath I mentioned in the 31 <hi>verse,</hi> relates to the precedent passages in the <hi>Chapter.</hi> There were false Apostles at <hi>Corinth,</hi> who had brought the Apostle's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit so low among them, that he is forced to <hi>commend himself, ver.</hi> 5, 6. and to shew that he was not inferiour to those false Apostles, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any Legal Prerogative, or in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Christ, or in any kind of suffering for his Ministry; So that here was sufficient occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to require the solemnity of an Oath, to give the greater assurance to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of his Commission for Apostleship, which they then call'd into question, and required him to prove that he had received it from Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3.

               <p>He supposes you have given him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by saying, <hi>That the Pharisees taught, that it was lawful to swear at any time by God's</hi>

                  <hi>Name, so that they swore nothing but truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which you acknowledge Christ prohibited.</hi> And further he says, <hi>Bishop</hi> Gauden <hi>makes the Lawful Call of Authority, one of the due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances which are necessary in a Lawful Oath,</hi> and that your self should say, <hi>The Use and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of swearing, which remains, is, when a Man is called by lawful Authority to declare his Conscience, in order to the ending of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, wherein his evidence may be concerned.

               <p>As to the <hi>First,</hi> it will not advantage his Cause at all, unless he could prove that I ever said, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> swore either by the Creatures, or by God in ordinary converse. For the sum of what I said was, that swearing <hi>by the Creatures,</hi> though <hi>faslly,</hi> and <hi>by God</hi> at any time in ordinary Converse, if but truly, was allowed by the Pharisees: and that <hi>against the first of them,</hi> viz. <hi>swearing by the Creature,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See Fr. Conf. p. 77, 78.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ opposeth that prohibition,</hi> Mat. 5. 34 35, 36. <hi>But I say unto you swear not at all, neither by Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Against the later,</hi> viz. <hi>swearing by the Name of God in our ordinary converse, he gives this precept,</hi> ver. 37. <hi>Let your Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be yea yea, nay nay,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If Bishop <hi>Gauden</hi> makes the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Call of Authority <hi>one</hi> of the due Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which are necessary in a lawful Oath; it do's not follow, that he allows <hi>no other</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.

                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:57744:116"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Do I any where in all my Book say, <hi>there is no other use of an Oath, but in Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,</hi> as he here suggests cunningly, making two Propositions of one, and so perverting the sense of my words, which were these, <hi>viz. the use and lawfulness of swearing remains (i. e.)</hi> continues; Or more plainly, Oaths continue lawful, though not in Common Converse, yet) <hi>when I am called by lawful Authority to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">See Fr. Conf. p. 84.</note> 
                  <hi>declare my Conscience in order to the ending of any Controversie, wherein my evidence may be concern'd.</hi> If I had said, <hi>the use and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of swearing, which remains, is when,</hi> &amp;c. as he quotes it; then indeed he had had some shew of reason to <hi>imply</hi> here, and <hi>expresly to say,</hi> p. 164. that the only Lawful Use that I give of swearing now under the Gospel is in Judicatories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But seeing no such inference can be deduced from them as they are set down in the <hi>Conference,</hi> Where is <hi>T. E</hi>'s sincerity? Where is his honesty thus to pervert my words? Is this the way to prove himself an adherent to Christianity, which he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 131. <hi>hath made it's Adherents so upright, just and true, that they dare not speak a falshood, though others dare swear it?</hi> I confess indeed that the <hi>Main</hi> Use of an Oath is in Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but not the <hi>only</hi> use; for we may swear in a very weighty Case, when we cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be believed, and when it will be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to them that hear us, if they do not believe; So St. <hi>Augustine</hi> of his own practice, <hi>When I see I am not believed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without an Oath, and that it is very inexpedient to him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves</hi>

                  <hi>me not, weighing this reason, and taking good consideration, I say with great Reverence [Before God] or [God is Witness] or [Christ knows it to be so in my Soul.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Aug. de verb. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post.

And for my part I shall subscribe to the Opinion of Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> (whom <hi>Ellwood</hi> himself calls a <hi>Godly Martyr)</hi> That the two blessed Sacraments (as you have heard <note n="‖" place="margin">See p. 46.</note>) are both <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Oaths,</hi> being therefore called <hi>Sacraments;</hi> That on God's part they are <hi>Seals,</hi> but on our part <hi>Oaths</hi> of Allegiance and Fidelity.</p>

                  <hi>Now then let the Quaker consider,</hi> how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent his Queries of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are, <hi>p.</hi> 161. <hi>Who called him to it?

                  <hi>But he says,</hi> If in these instances <hi>Paul</hi> had sworn, he had not sworn judicially and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, but in his ordinary Communication, which kind of swearing is acknowledged to be forbidden by Christ, <hi>p.</hi> 164.</p>

                  <hi>T. E.</hi> is out again; Is <hi>writing Epistles</hi> ordinary Communication?

               <p>Every Appeal to God (as I granted before) is not indeed an Oath; but then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>When we Appeal to God in a most solemn manner as Witness of what we affirm, and Iudge of our sincerity</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> I told you in these instances did) it cannot be interpreted less than an Oath. If this be not swearing, I <note place="margin">See Fr. Conf. p. 70, 71.</note> know not what it is; And indeed I wonder why the Quakers inveigh against us here in <hi>England</hi> for swearing, when according to <hi>Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s Principles <hi>(if St.</hi> Paul <hi>swore not)</hi> there is no such thing among us.</p>
               <p>As for his old fallacy, that <hi>[to appeal to God is not an Oath, because to appeal to Man, or any other thing is not to swear by that Man</hi>

               <p>Here's another fallacy; Do I in any part of my Book make <hi>[form]</hi> the <hi>genus</hi> of an Oath? or suppose I had; Are all <hi>forms</hi> Ceremonies? The Apostle recommends to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> a <hi>Form of sound words</hi> (of which you have had an account) that is, <hi>sound Doctrine;</hi> Will therefore this Quaker accuse the Apostle of calling the <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> but a <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</hi> He himself saith, <hi>p.</hi> 118. <hi>there is Iustice and the manner of doing Iustice, there is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and the way of shewing Mercy, there is Truth and the manner of speaking Truth.</hi> So say I, there is an <hi>Oath,</hi> and there is the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> or <hi>form</hi> (which is all one) of <hi>expressing an Oath;</hi> Of these forms I produced several both out of the Old and New Testament.

                  <hi>with this formality,</hi> But that he and all may see, it is not our judgment only that <hi>Paul</hi> did not swear, I here produce two very Authentick Witnesses to clear <hi>Paul</hi> from swearing.

I reply, <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> do's not disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of <hi>all</hi> Oaths in this piece of Poetry, but he is arguing against <hi>Common Swearing;</hi> And whereas these Common Swearers alledged the Examples of God and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> both taking Oaths, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> denies, <hi>that God did ever swear</hi> (which I doubt <hi>T.

               <p>If all the Christians in the World were divided into three parts, two of them do use Incense (in their worship) at this day: I do not mention this to justifie the practice, but to shew with what confidence the Quaker prattles, as if it were the <hi>concurrent judgment of all Parties.</hi> Besides, there is a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Types and Ceremonies, which cease of themselves, when the substance is come, and such things as are under a positive prohibition; Circumcision, abstaining from blood, and things strangled, were Ceremonies, yet were they connived at, in the early times of Christianity: But had they been under a positive prohibition, it had been a damnable sin afterwards to have allowed them in any
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57744:121"/>
case: So the using of Incense in Divine Service is Ceremonious, but had it been as expresly forbidden, as the Quakers pretend all swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, the Angel had fallen into sin, (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently from his State) by using it. So that the Quakers instance here comes infinitely short of the case.</p>
               <p>However I shall add, that the Apocalypse, or Book of Revelation is mystical, one part whereof describeth the things of Christianity allusively to <hi>Moses</hi>'s Tabernacle, and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple; on this account the offering of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense is there introduced, to signifie that which it is a symbol of; but the Angel's Oath is no symbol of any thing, therefore not only allowable but useful in Gospel times.</p>

                  <hi>Oath implies an Execration, that is, a cursing or betaking ones self to the Devil (as</hi> Rider <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the word) which makes an Oath more unsuitable to the nature of the Gospel,</hi> &amp;c. p. 169.</p>

               <p>If an Execration be not implied in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Oath, then is the Oath it self excuseable, the fault will only lye at my door, for making such an assertion: But if every Oath do's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imply an Execration, and the true notion of an Execration is <hi>a cursing or betaking ones Soul to the Devil;</hi> then an Oath was as unsuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Law, as it can be to the Gospel: so that the Quaker's Argument will fall every way to the ground.</p>
               <p>Neither do's <hi>Rider</hi> say, it is a Cursing and a Betaking—<hi>but Cursing or Betaking—</hi>For there are Execrations which are a betaking our selves to the Justice of God, in case we falsifie: And such are the Execrations imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Oaths we take.</p>
               <p>Now that such Execrations are understood in every Oath, was the Opinion of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and the incomparably Learned, and no less Judicious Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> whom before I quoted.

               <p>Had he consulted Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> he would have found sufficient reasons given by him for this Assertion: However I must tell <hi>T.

(for so it is in the Hebrew, as both you and <hi>T. E.</hi> may be informed from the <hi>marg.)

               <p>The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> (you know) had grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God forty years in the wilderness; had in the highest affront to His Majesty set up a filthy Idol, most ingratefully murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and brought up an evil report on that good Land whither he was carrying them, wherefore <hi>He sware in his wrath that [if] any of them entered into his rest</hi> (that is, possessed the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> except <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb)</hi> &amp;c. Now in the [If] here consists the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipsis, and the sense must be made out by our supposition, which will run after this manner: <hi>If they enter into my Rest, if ever they have any thing to do in the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>then let that Calf they made be thought their God, and have the honour of bringing them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt: <hi>I have sworn they shall never enter my Rest, which if they ever do, let me be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a lyar, and for ever forfeit the honour of my Veracity.</hi> Here's now the Execration: And does the High God in this acknowledge <hi>some other Being superiour to himself?</hi> &amp;c. Now I would know what evil this can be to God, who (it's true) can incurr no evil, because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not falsifie?

               <p>Do the Quakers then suffer for such things as are meerly indifferent? who do they think will thank 'em for it another day? or will it not be said to them at the great day, Who required this at your hands?

               <p>Kissing then and laying the hand upon the Book, being by all sides accounted no essential parts of an Oath: My wonder then is, what the Quaker here aims at, unless it be to prove his own Party cross and peevish, who it seems do obstinately suffer for that, wherein our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's prohibition is no ways concerned.</p>

               <p>I suppose <hi>T. E.</hi>'s meaning is, That if the Magistrates will dispense with their <hi>kissing of the Book,</hi> &amp;c. they will assure them, that what they speak is <hi>the plain and naked truth,</hi> as they are in the presence of God.</p>

               <p>This either is his meaning, or else he plainly equivocates; wherefore let us take the Quaker in the best sense, and suppose that he equivocates not, yet here must I tell him, that speaking thus in the presence of God is the <hi>summe and substance of an Oath.</hi> This reminds me of a passage which happen'd some few years ago: The King and Council order, That all persons in any Military Imployment should be obliged to take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, otherwise to quit the Service. An ignorant Souldier (who was a Papist, as the story goes) consults his Confessor whether he might take the Oaths? who told him, that he might take the Oath of Allegiance, but not that of Supremacy: But it seems this Souldier understood him quite wrong, and when he came to swear, took the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, but absolutely refused the Oath of Allegiance, for which he was casheir'd. No less ignorant are the Quakers, who it seems
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57744:124"/>
do not really scruple <hi>the summe and substance</hi> of an Oath, but at the form and manner of taking it. To speak thus in the presence of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> to appeal to him as a witness of their sincerity, is what (it seems) they dare yield unto: but to lay their hands on the Book and kiss it, (though <hi>T. E.</hi> calls it a meer Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) yet is it so enormous, that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer <hi>Fines, Imprisonments</hi> (nay what not) than they will do it: Now how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous this is, let all of even common sense and reason judge and determine. However if the Magistrates will be content to take the Quakers Oaths, without kissing of the Book, I am willing that they have my suffrage (if it might signifie any thing) for a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>I have so, and do find that he has not dealt fairly with you; for whereas you compared <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. with <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 2. shewing that the words would not admit a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, but must be limited to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sense; he takes no manner of notice thereof: yet because you said, <hi>That our Lord must not be supposed to have forbidden all manner of Oaths, because of</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.

               <p>I hope you sufficiently see that this is a meer <hi>Bravado;</hi> and also, that not only here but all along, the most considerable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of my Book are omitted. Now I desire to know where he undertook to disprove that the Angel swore? He pretends indeed in the place where he is treating about it, to excuse the action, as if it were done in conformity to the Law, because another Angel used a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor: But how come our Saviour's words to be a general prohibition? If so, the Angels had been included, and consequently (as I before noted) had fall'n from their state, had they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57744:125"/>
transgressed it. So that you may see, with what pitiful shifts the Quaker goes about to evade the Truth, and will persist in his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, though indeed an Angel stand in his way.</p>

               <p>Why not a limitation in swearing as in other things? Christ in this Chapter for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids not all anger, <hi>but anger without a cause, vers.</hi> 22. Not every looking on a Woman, but <hi>looking on a Woman to lust after her,</hi> vers. 28. Not all divorce, but divorce <hi>for every cause,</hi> vers. 32. And so doubtless not all kind of swearing, as may be fully proved from the very Text which plainly contains these two exceptions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That we must not swear at all by the Creatures, for so the words run, <hi>Swear not at all neither by heaven nor by earth,</hi> &amp;c. there's
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57744:126"/>
no full stop after <hi>[swear not at all]</hi> they are but half the sentence, and the Quakers do unmannerly interrupt Christ here in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his Speech, and will not hear him out, nor take his words together, the whole sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence being, <hi>Swear not at all by Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Now what work may be made with any Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture if we thus break it off in the middle? <hi>Have I any power to say any thing,</hi> saith <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 22. 38.</note> thus may we prove him dumb. <hi>There are some standing here, which shall not taste of death,</hi> saith Christ—stop there, and you may <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 28.</note> prove them immortal.</p>
               <p>Besides, if that part of the sentence <hi>[swear not at all]</hi> be full sense, and forbid all Oaths whatsoever, what need was there of adding any particular exceptions, seeing they were provided against in that one general? As if the Law should say, <hi>Thou shalt not kill any man at all;</hi> What need were there to say, not a Merchant, not a Farmer, not a Judge, not a Priest, not a Quaker, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> This would be a meer tautologie, of which I hope the Quaker will not accuse our blessed Saviour. Wherefore many of the Ancients did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this to a prohibition from swearing by Creatures, and particularly S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Hierom</hi> on the place, which I doubt will not please <hi>T. E.</hi> very well.</p>
               <p>A second limitation is taken from the next words, <hi>But let your communication be yea yea, nay nay;</hi> which is the Positive precept, as the former is the Negative, and is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of the evil custom of swearing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57744:127"/>
which shews that our Lord is both forbidding and prescribing matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our ordinary converse, it being strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incoherent to say, <hi>Swear not, no not in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but let your ordinary discourse be yea and nay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shewed you before, that <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 2. <hi>[speak evil of no man]</hi> was as general a prohibition <note place="margin">Confer. p. 74.</note> as this, yet could not bear a general interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but this the Quaker passes by: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I will give you another like Text, in <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 6. an <hi>Israelite</hi> there is commanded, <hi>Not to approach to any that is near of kin to him.</hi> Yet was that restrained to such degrees of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity and Affinity, as are afterwards men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and to such as bear the same Analogy, as <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> note upon the place. Why then may not our Saviour's words be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to what follows after, according to that plain account which I have given you?</p>

               <p>He labours in this place to prove, that <hi>Christ did forbid more than was forbidden by Moses, even solemn swearing; therefore the Text is not to be restrained to the Pharisees Glosses; and so</hi> (he saith) <hi>he doth in other instances.</hi> pag. 175, 176, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>But the question is, whether such a <hi>Law be taken away?</hi> the answer is, that <hi>more is required by Christ than Moses:</hi> Is refining and elevating a Law, an abolishing and repealing of it?</p>
               <p>The Ceremonial Law pointed at Christ, and decipher'd all his Offices, and the Evangelical purity, which upon the offering up of Christ, gave place to its antitype of its own accord, without any further need of an express repeal.</p>

               <p>You said enough before to make it very reasonable, that Christ did not herein forbid <hi>All</hi> Oaths whatsoever. Yet <hi>T.

               <p>Not only the Particle <hi>[But,]</hi> but the whole Sentence is to be interpreted by what goes before and follows after. Had our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour said <hi>[But I say unto you swear not at all,]</hi> and there stop't; And if <hi>[Them]</hi> in the Text be only applicable to <hi>Moses</hi> (as <hi>T.

But whereas our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour mentions swearing <hi>by Creatures,</hi> and <hi>in Communication,</hi> immediately after <hi>[swear not at all;] T. E</hi>'s arguing here from the Particle <hi>[But]</hi> is <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>impertinent;</hi> And 'tis plain, the Quakers interpretation of this Text (and <hi>not</hi> the Priests) <hi>will render the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ superfluous and vain.</hi>

               <p>Now let us examine <hi>T. E</hi>'s notes upon the words of St. <hi>Iames, Chap.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>[But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things my Brethren, swear not.]</hi> Here he grants that <hi>the Apostle did forbid only such Oaths as our Saviour had forbidden,</hi> p. 181.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Having shewed you that our <hi>Saviour</hi> forbids not All Oaths whatsoever, this Text of St. <hi>Iames</hi> must needs fall short of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's purpose. By the by, it will be worth your noting, that he writ to the Jews (who had been strangely accustom'd to swear by the Creatures, and in their Communication) to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57744:129"/>
be the more careful and watchful over their words.</p>
               <p>But I cannot but wonder that <hi>T. E.</hi> should say, that <hi>Christ forbad Oaths</hi> (which are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly lawful during the Law;)</hi> when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has told us, that <hi>the time when our Saviour lived was under the Law,</hi> and that <hi>in this state many things were indulged to the Iews, p.</hi> 37, 38. If so; surely Christ in the time of the Law would not contradict the Law. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if St. <hi>Iames</hi> (as <hi>T. E.</hi> acknowledges) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad Oaths <hi>no further</hi> than Christ forbad them, this Sophister by his own distinction has quite spoiled his Argument.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Par.</speaker>
               <p>But I observe that <hi>T. E.</hi> stands much upon the first and last words of the Text <hi>[But above all things, &amp;c.]</hi> And says, <hi>That he might be sure to leave no Oath unforbidden, he closes up his Sentence with these comprehensive words, Neither by any other Oath,</hi> p. 182.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>As to the first part <hi>[But above all things,]</hi> Let St. <hi>Augustine</hi> be the Expositor, <hi>Why above all things?</hi> (says he) <hi>Is to swear, worse than to steal, or to commit Adultery,</hi> &amp;c?—<hi>these are evil in themselves, so is not swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">This <hi>T. E.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self grants, p. 141, &amp;c. † Aug. in ver. Ap. Serm. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>Why then must we avoid Oaths above all? Not that they are worse than any other sin, but because we most easily slip into them, having gotten a Custom of them†.</hi> So that these words <hi>[above all]</hi> strike at that <hi>irreverence</hi> towards the Majesty of God, which indeliberate swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as that in common talk) makes men continually liable unto. The Apostle then is speaking here of customary Oaths, <hi>not</hi> of solemn and judicial.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:57744:129"/>
As to the other Clause <hi>[Nor by any other Oath,]</hi> I said enough in the <hi>Conference</hi> to prove it referred <hi>to the Head, to Ierusalem,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such like Oaths, which Christ had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mention'd; But the Quaker has past over my Arguments, having had little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to object against them. But I now add, that <hi>in all Examples of a General Rule, the Greater instances should be named particularly, and the Lesser comprehended in a General Phrase;</hi> whereas if the Quaker's Exposition be right, the <hi>lesser Oaths [by Creatures]</hi> are named <hi>particularly,</hi> and the <hi>Greater [by God's Name,</hi> used in Judicatories] are at the most but <hi>hinted at</hi> under a General Phrase of—<hi>[any other Oath;]</hi> which is against the Rules of Speech, and very absurd. <hi>[Swear not by lesser Oaths, by Heaven nor by Earth, nor by any other Oath,</hi> i. e. <hi>not by God's Name in Iudgment:]</hi> this is the Quaker's interpretation.</p>
               <p>And indeed 'tis very odd, that Christ and his Apostles (if they intended to prohibit All swearing by God's Name) should never give one plain word about it, when as they do men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Oaths by Creatures, which are not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>erial. To conclude, St. <hi>Iames</hi> must be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to Communication as well as Christ, as is plain from the very words; And so St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> and Antiquity did expound him, whose practice (being the next enquiry) will be an excellent Commentary on both these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; For if any of those Primitive Fathers did <hi>practise,</hi> or <hi>allow</hi> solemn swearing, they did not surely think that it was forbidden by Christ, or by St. <hi>Iames.</hi>

               <p>But before we come to enquire what thoughts the Ancient Fathers had of Oaths, I must know what you will answer to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>If Men would use themselves to speak Truth, would not this be enough to give Credit to what they say in all Cases?

                  <hi>to fidelity) enjoyn a sincere and upright Man to wear the Badge of Hypocrisie, an Oath?</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant might have argued with his Master at <hi>T.

Thus (to give you one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 10, 11. God enjoyns that

                  <hi>If a Man deliver unto his Neighbour an Ass, or an Ox, or a Sheep, or any Beast to keep, and it dye or be hurt, or driven away, no Man seeing it; Then shall an</hi> OATH <hi>of the Lord be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his Neighbours Goods; and the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it shall accept thereof,</hi> &amp;c.

This however I will confess, that to speak the Truth <hi>is Security enough,</hi> but then an Oath is still necessary (in some Cases) to assure us (as much as is possible) <hi>that it is the Truth</hi> they speak; For we cannot see into Mens Hearts, and therefore hereby we provide against the worst.</p>

               <p>Though the Quaker tells us not whence this passage is taken, yet we may note
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57744:132"/>
it is taken out of those Homilies on St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which bear <hi>Origen</hi>'s Name, but are much doubted of by <hi>Erasmus;</hi> So that 'tis a Question whether this be <hi>Origen,</hi> or some Impostor: But suppose it be <hi>Origen;</hi> He <hi>(First)</hi> in those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Books against <hi>Celsus,</hi> maintains, <hi>That God the Father did not by the Gospel of Iesus bring in Any Commands contrary to the Law of</hi> Moses; <note n="*" place="margin">Orig. in Cels. l. 7.</note> And so he could not think, Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited solemn swearing contrary to <hi>Moses</hi> (as <hi>T. E.</hi> affirms.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis plain <hi>Origen</hi> meant, that Christ had forbid to swear <hi>at all on slight occasions,</hi> because he himself on a weighty occasion do's swear: <hi>God is Witness unto, or upon my Conscience,</hi> is his Oath; <hi>contra Celsum lib.</hi> 1. So that if such expressions of the Fathers as <hi>T.

               <p>Now he is come again to <hi>Basil</hi> sirnamed the Great, who saith, <hi>In the Law the Lord seemeth to allow an Oath to a perfect man, which in the Gospel is altogether forbidden,</hi> &amp;c. ibid.</p>

               <p>This Phrase <hi>[the Lord seemeth to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an Oath in the Law]</hi> do's plainly import, that an Oath was not <hi>really</hi> Lawful then: Now do's the Quaker imagine that St. <hi>Basil</hi> did think an Oath was but <hi>seemingly</hi> allowable during the Law? This will render him more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant than the Quakers are themselves, who confess an Oath <hi>really</hi> allowable <hi>then.</hi> So that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57744:133"/>
if we make sense of St. <hi>Basil</hi>'s words, His meaning must needs be this; <hi>Oaths in Converse are</hi> seemingly <hi>allowed by the Law (though not really so;) In the Gospel they are</hi> not seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, <hi>but</hi> plainly <hi>forbidden.</hi> And that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi> meant Oaths in Communication, we may be sure from those Ecclesiastical Canons he made: Of which the <hi>10th</hi> Canon is, <hi>That He who had sworn with due Circumstances, should not be forced to retract his Oath.</hi> And the <hi>29th</hi> Canon saith, <hi>They who use to swear they will do evil things, ought to be cured by all means, by teaching them</hi> (First) <hi>Not to swear Lightly,</hi> (Secondly,) <hi>Not to persist in their evil purposes:</hi> Whence the famous <hi>Balsamon</hi> in his Notes on these Canons concludes, that St. <hi>Basil was not against lawful Oaths.</hi>

                  <hi>i. e. Then it was forbidden to murder, but now even to strike; T. E.</hi> to make <hi>Gregory</hi> speak like a Quaker, turns the last words, <hi>but now it is not lawful, for any Cause, so much as to smite or beat.</hi> Where he puts in one half of the Sentence out of his own head; and it would make one think (who saw not the Cheat) that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> thought it unlawful for a <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>School-master</hi> to whip a Child for his faults, or for a <hi>Magistrate</hi> to punish a Malefactor by stripes.—But to come to the Matter; I will make it appear that <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> believed the Lawfulness of Oaths upon weighty occasions <hi>(First)</hi> From his own words in this very Dialogue against Common Swearers.

               <p>In his Dialogue He hath these words. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to multiply Oaths, especially commonly, and great Oaths, and on every occasion:—</hi>And a little after, <hi>Swear not to all things, nor always, that is, Playing, Eating, when thou</hi>

               <p>The Quaker (and those other Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, from whom he has this passage) did very cunningly in not mentioning the Occasion of that discourse, which would have spoil'd the Argument. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is writing against one <hi>Elxai</hi> a Judaizing <hi>Heretick,</hi> who commanded his followers to Swear by Creatures, <hi>(viz.) Salt, Water, Earth, Bread,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>Chrysostom</hi> is again produced by him, who says: <hi>It is not lawful to Swear, neither in a just, nor unjust thing,</hi> &amp;c. ibid.</p>

               <p>The places, which <hi>T. E.</hi> cites, are out of those popular Discourses that bear St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Name, but are suspected to be none of his by very learned men; yet suppose they were genuine, you have had already a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient answer given you to all <hi>T. E</hi>'s pretences from hence. <note n="*" place="margin">See p. 189.</note> I shall now further add, that St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s discourse being directed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate persons, must therefore be limited to private unnecessary Oaths, for had his discourse been against the Oaths used in the Imperial Courts, The Emperour doubtless would have called him to an account for his Doctrine, which he was so far from doing, that he advanced him to the See of <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we may more clearly perceive his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by comparing all passages together. He tels us, <hi>how exceeding customary the Sin of Swearing was in his time; that the people used to take the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to Swear by, &amp; to put one another to Swear at the Holy Altar;</hi> and declares, <hi>that the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Swearing was not to be found in any other City, as in that of Antioch, where he then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> * <note n="‖" place="margin">Ad pop. Antioc. Hom. 5. &amp; 16. Hom. de juram.</note>And therefore for the beating down  this profane and irreligious practice, he speaks so zealously and vehemently against Swearing, and expresses himself in such large and general terms, that they who do not weigh one pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage with another, may think that Oaths were <hi>universally</hi> disallowed by him: But to put it out of all dispute, that this was not the sense of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57744:136"/>
that Father, we find him of an Opinion, <hi>that it was the Son of God who Swore by himself to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Hom. 11. ad Heb.</note> And that he made use of the same Oath in the Gospel, when he said, <hi>Amen A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> and expounding the words <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 6. 16. Rev. 3. 14.</note> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, he saith: <hi>By an Oath is determined the dispute of all matters of Contention,</hi> and <hi>that not of this, or of that, but of All.</hi>

               <p>Did our Saviour swear, when he said <hi>Amen Amen,</hi> or <hi>Verily Verily?</hi> If He did, whom did he swear by?</p>

               <p>He swore by himself. However, whether it be <hi>really</hi> so or no, yet it was <hi>so</hi> in the opinion of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> (as I have told you) and of several other Fathers, which shews that they were far from thinking All Oaths forbidden by Christ, while they held <hi>He allowed them by his own Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed what can be more plain, than that our Saviour swore in Judgment as much as any Persons among the Jews in his time were wont to do? For in their Courts the Parties did not speak the words of the Oath, but the Magistrate did Adjure them by the Living God to <hi>tell truly;</hi> And then the answer they made to this adjuring, was accounted an <hi>Answer upon Oath,</hi> and they were reputed to have sworn, and to be obliged by the name of the Living God to speak the Truth. Now the High-Priest according to this Custome, saith to our Saviour <hi>Mat</hi> 26. 63. <hi>I adjure thee</hi>

               <p>As for <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> His words are falsly cited by <hi>T.

This is not what the Quaker alledges, <hi>That Christians ought not to swear at all;</hi> nor doth it sound to <hi>T. E</hi>'s sence, but relates to speaking truth in Communication without an Oath; Yea in the same Apology, he saith: <hi>The Christians need not die for Christ, if they would dissemble, for we might (says he) do that which the Proverb saith, I swear with my Tongue, but my Heart was not made to Swear:</hi> So that it seems Christianity would allow them to <hi>Swear,</hi> but not to <hi>Equivocate</hi> in Swearing.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Lactantius,</hi> His words do plainly relate to common and Customary Swearing, as appears by that Reason he gives, <hi>viz.—lest at one time or other he fall, even by Custom, into perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, that of <hi>Hieroms</hi> must be meant of <hi>flight Oaths</hi> or <hi>Oaths by Creatures;</hi> for St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> himself swears on Great Occasion, <hi>God is my Witness to my Conscience:</hi>

               <p>As for this Citation, you see the Doctor himself here confesses, the <hi>Necessities of the world</hi> will not permit the precept to be obeyed in that <hi>sense.</hi> Should I say, It were a happy thing, if men were never <hi>cold, hungry,</hi> or <hi>sick;</hi> for then there would be no need of <hi>fire, food,</hi> and <hi>physick:</hi> Will <hi>T.

               <p>But further, it is attested by <hi>Dio in the Life of</hi> Antonius, and appears from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that the Christians did <hi>Take an Oath,</hi> when they were Listed Souldiers under the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors; And their form of swearing was <hi>By the Safety of</hi> Caesar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this was in the best and earliest days of Christianity; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when the Emperours became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, the Souldiers Oath was enlarged, but

               <p>To take a Text then, and to compose a Sermon thereon, is to pitch upon some por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, to expound the same, and from thence to raise such observations, and remarks, as (in the Preacher's judgment) tend most to the instruction and edification of the people.</p>

The same practice appears by the more Ancient Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of <hi>Origen</hi> (another of his Authors) on <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, Numbers</hi> and St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> And most plainly by St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Sermons <hi>on the words of our Lord and the Apostle;</hi> where that Holy Father singles out a <hi>verse</hi> or two, out of the <hi>Epistle</hi> or <hi>Gospel</hi> appointed for that Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and Preaches on them. And if <hi>T. E.</hi> please to read his <hi>30th</hi> Sermon <note n="†" place="margin">De verb.

               <p>To these I shall give a distinct An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and in as few words as the matter will bear. And I must tell you that <hi>T. E.</hi> hath here egregiously falsified <hi>my words,</hi> falsified the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and abused both St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I say he hath falsified my words in saying, <hi>I make Humane Learning necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>[Humane]</hi> is a word of his own shuffling in, and never so much as named in the page he quotes, nor in all my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to you upon that Subject. I know that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a true Interpreter of Scripture; and that he had not his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Humane means, but by inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He hath falsified the Scripture in affirming, that <hi>it says expresly,</hi> that <hi>St. Peter was unlearned, &amp;c.</hi> Which is an <hi>express</hi> untruth. For he may as well say, that the Scriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly say, that our Saviour was a <hi>Wine-bibber,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed the Scripture tells us in the place he quotes, that the High-priest and others <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>were unlearned and ignorant Men,</hi> &amp;c. But was all <hi>Gospel</hi> which <hi>They</hi> either said or perceived? Were all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and opinions of the Jewish Council <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi> Truths? This is to make the Scripture own whatsoever it relates of wicked and mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Men.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly, T. E.</hi> has abused St. <hi>Peter</hi> in saying, <hi>He was carnally minded;</hi> This being a calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which He cannot prove; For doubtless St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a Good Man, when he was a Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

               <p>But he thinks that you have contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted your self in asserting <hi>the necessity of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the interpreting of Scriptures (i. e.</hi> the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57744:144"/>
                  <hi>hard places</hi> in the Scriptures, for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding words shew <hi>that</hi> to be your meaning;) When as you afterwards affirm, That the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary points of Religion are not hard to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood;</hi> And he is so pleas'd with this, that for fear the Reader should not take notice of it, he repeats it over and over, as <hi>p.</hi> 212, 215, 234, 268.</p>

               <p>I find He is so tickled with this inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that when he has nothing to say, He fills up his pages with a repetition of this seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Contradiction.</p>
               <p>But I must tell the Quaker, that he deals here most injuriously with me; For these two places of mine, were not spoken upon one and the same occasion, nor do they belong to the same Subject; For in the <hi>90th page</hi> of my Book, I am speaking of <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Interpreting</hi> Scripture to others; In <hi>p.</hi> 92. I am discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of private Christians understanding <hi>so much</hi> of Scripture, <hi>as</hi> is necessary to their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: which they may attain without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Learning,</hi> otherwise none but the <hi>Learned</hi> can be saved. Now the Quaker disingenuously wrests all my Discourse to Preaching, <hi>p.</hi> 213, 214.</p>
               <p>But let us see what consequence there is in his Arguments; an Unlearned Man may know what is necessary to his own Salvation, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> He may be a Preacher unto others. Rare arguing! Is every Man, that can write his own hand-writing, fit to be a Writing-master? Or every Souldier, that can handle his Arms, fit to be a General? Or every Clown, that can draw
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57744:144"/>
a Bill or Bond, fit to be a Counsellor or a Judge? A little knowledge with an honest Heart and good Life may do a Mans own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; but surely it requires more to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Scripture, to Preach, to defend the Faith against Hereticks, to instruct, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, comfort and and reprove in due season. Methinks <hi>T. E.</hi> might have been more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, than to sport himself with his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures, and so falsly to represent the passages of my Book, having done by it, as <hi>Dionyfius</hi> did by <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Statue, Whose <hi>Silver Mantle</hi> he took off, and then clad it with his own <hi>Course Cloth,</hi> and when he had so done, laughed it to scorn.</p>

               <p>I observe that <hi>T. E.</hi> goes on at this rate, picking up three passages spoken on dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent occasions, to raise this observation, that <hi>Learning is only necessary to the understanding of those things which are least necessary,</hi> p. 215.</p>

               <p>Suppose it did follow from my words, that it is a Minister's Duty to Apply things that are plain, and make them more plain; this is no inconsiderable employment.

               <p>And though I said the <hi>Difficult places of Scripture were least necessary,</hi> I did not say <hi>they were unnecessary</hi> (which would have been blasphemy to assert;) For there is not <hi>that</hi>

               <p>Some of them I confess were so, but it was the Excellent Learning of the Protestant Divines which forced them to it; as we may gather from <hi>Andreas Vesselius</hi> Hebrew-profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor at <hi>Lovain</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> who hath these words, <hi>We wonder at the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks skill in Tongues, and all Learning, and they deride our Contempt of these things; Let us wash off this blot, and joyn to Philosophy the knowledge of Tongues.</hi>

(in the last Century) the <hi>Progenitors</hi> of our Quakers <hi>Thomas Muntzor, Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden, Knipperdolling,</hi> &amp;c. with <hi>Heiman</hi> the <hi>Cobler, Theodore</hi> the <hi>Butcher,</hi> who attempted to set up Christs Kingdom by a bloody Rebellion, and Abusing of Scripture: Yea this is confirmed to us by the Miseries of this Church in our late unhappy times; when any Mechanick took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon him to preach, and expound Scripture so long, till they put more Thorns about our Saviours <hi>Doctrine,</hi> than the <hi>Iews</hi> ever did about His Head; And divided this poor Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into innumerable Sects and parties, under which it groaneth; And broached as wild Errours, as ever were heard before.

               <p>It seems then, They were <hi>requisite,</hi> and They were <hi>not requisite;</hi> They were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to enable them to Preach intelligibly to all Nations; And yet not requisite, seeing <hi>this</hi> might have been done by an Interpreter. The fallacy then, which he pretends to be in <hi>My</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, will manifestly appear to be in <hi>his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides, What a ridiculous Method is this, which he prescribes of an Interpreter? For if the Preacher understand not the Language of that people whom he is to instruct, the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter must, who is to know two Tongues at least, that he may interpret <hi>one</hi> by the <hi>other;</hi> And since <hi>Interpretation of Tongues</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Gift in those days, as well as <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Tongues,</hi> the Quakers way is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at all, it being indifferent, whether the Miracle be wrought by the <hi>Preacher</hi> or by the <hi>Interpreter:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if Skill in Tongues be Learning, then were the Apostles Learned in that point; <hi>Theirs</hi> came by <hi>Miracle, Ours</hi> by Gods <hi>Blessing</hi> upon our <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Endeavours;</hi> And though we come diversly by it, yet the <hi>Skill</hi> is the <hi>same:</hi> And though <hi>T. E.</hi> seems to separate the Gifts of Tongues from the Gifts of the Holy Ghost, <hi>p.</hi> 222. Yet we know, They both came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; Neither can we be so absurd, as to fancy, the Spirit gave the Apostles words without Sense, or that he taught them like Parrots to talk without understanding.</p>
               <p>Now because this <hi>Knowledg,</hi> and <hi>Skill</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <hi>it,</hi> is not in this age given to any man
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57744:150"/>
without means, namely, Reading and Study; Therefore it is that we press a necessity of Learning in the Ministers of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>If it be enquired now, of what use Tongues were to the Apostles, I shall grant that they were given to them (who had knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Study) to enable them to speak properly to all Nations in their own Dialect. Now though Tongues be not necessary to us for <hi>this</hi> purpose, yet are they necessary for <hi>other</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses <hi>(viz.)</hi> To enable us to compare the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal with the several Oriental Versions, to fit us for the reading of Ancient Historians, Expositors, and other Authors of such Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as are useful handmaids to Divinity, Which are generally written in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> without the knowledge of which Tongues we cannot know the signification and proprieties of words, the sense of phrases, the variety of Customs, the History of times, the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Fathers, the practice of the Primitive Church, the frauds of Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apostles needed the Tongues to express themselves, having notions by inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: We need them as well to inform us in the Notions of things, as properly, pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Methodically to express our selves, even in our own Country (this will serve to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer another of his objections.) And so Tongues <hi>were</hi> and <hi>are</hi> Necessary for the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> and for <hi>us,</hi> for <hi>those</hi> times and <hi>these</hi> times; And None wholly illiterate either <hi>then</hi> were, or <hi>now</hi> are fit to preach the Gospel.</p>

               <p>This is false, for they were given <hi>both</hi> at one time: But if he mean, that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary teaching of the Spirit was to continue after them, I say as much: But then his not distinguishing between the <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> teaching of the Spirit, has here run him into some gross Absurdities for two or three pages together.</p>

                  <hi>First</hi> he supposes All Christian Believers to <note place="margin">1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Quaker pleads <hi>alike</hi> for all Believers, as if they had <hi>All</hi> the inward and <note place="margin">2.

               <p>He wrongs me infinitely, I put in <hi>Miracles and the rest.</hi> Immediate knowledge and Tongues are by me usually reckoned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because the Apostles received them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and they were Miraculous effects of the Spirit, <hi>both</hi> temporary and extraordinary, and <hi>both</hi> fitted to that Season; And Immediate Teaching is as little to be expected now, as the Gift of Tongues, which was not so Miraculous as <hi>immediate teaching;</hi> it being a greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ignorant men should be acquainted with All <hi>Heavenly Truthes,</hi> as speak All <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Languages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Methinks, when Quakers talk of this <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Teaching,</hi> it's as some do of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone; for while they boast of it, they should shew us One man that <hi>Actually</hi> hath it. And for all their pretences, we see some of them do not depend upon it, but make use of Humane Means, and do read and study, and when they falsly quote an Author, can pretend they were in the <hi>Countrey,</hi> &amp;c. And we all know, that the Quakers being generally devoid of Learning, their discourses, and writings are fuller of tautologies, soloecisms, confusion and darkness, than any other sort of people what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; Whereas if they had the Immediate teaching as the Apostles had, their Notions would be <hi>clear,</hi> their discourses <hi>Methodical</hi> and <hi>Argumentative,</hi> as those of the Apostles were.

in this little Tract. All the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge therefore, that we expect now, must be attain'd only by Gods blessing upon our due use of Means. 'Tis certain, that the best Quaker of them all, did he not read, study, converse <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be as ignorant as a Barbarous <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> and till they can give us an example to the contrary, this pretence of theirs must pass for an absolute imposture.</p>

               <p>Have not divers Quakers stript themselves stark naked, and said the Spirit bid them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver such and such a Message in that posture? Must not then this be a New Revelation in their own sense?</p>
               <p>I shall be glad to hear that all Quakers were really become (as their Champion <hi>Ellwood</hi> pretends they are) of another mind; It would be very well, would they at last renounce all revelations, which are not contained in the Scripture, and search out the sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of what is already Revealed, which they may do with the ordinary assistance of Gods Spirit, and His blessing on the use of means, so far as is needful to their own Salvation.</p>
               <p>Thus far I shall agree with <hi>T.

Now as for those that expect New Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or immediate Teaching (that is a Teaching without means) such do render the Scriptures useless altogether: For he that hath immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the same Truthes <hi>from the same fountain, from whenee the Scriptures do flow,</hi> will not value the Scriptures at all; for who will value a <hi>Copy,</hi> that hath the <hi>Original?</hi> 'Tis the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of this Teaching, that hath made many of the Quakers despise the Scriptures; <hi>What need have such</hi> (says one of them) <hi>of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-teaching without them, when they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the same Spirit within them?</hi>

               <p>The Apostle proceeds to enumerate the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particulars, wherein the Scriptures may by us be profitably made use of; They are <hi>profitable</hi> (says he) <hi>for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction,</hi> Which contain all the intents and purposes of a Rule.</p>
               <p>To shew that the Scripture hath all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that a Rule can have, the Apostle adds, <hi>that the man of God may be perfect, thorowly furnished unto all good Works.</hi> Let this Quaker therefore beware how he digs up Foundations; especially considering, how <hi>many</hi> places there are which make <hi>the Law of the Lord Perfect,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <hi>He Tithed</hi> Abraham. Now since <hi>T.

               <p>His second reason is this, <hi>Had Tithes been due to</hi> Melchizedeck, <hi>then must</hi> Abraham <hi>have paid</hi> Melchizedeck <hi>Tithes of all his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, p.</hi> 279.</p>

               <p>But the main is behind: <hi>We do not read</hi> (says He) <hi>that He gave him Tithes of his own Estate; but that which he gave him the Tenth of was the Spoils,</hi> ibid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>This was answered in the <hi>Conference</hi> also: <hi>It not being material out of what he paid His Tithes, but whatever they were,</hi> Abraham <hi>paid them as a Tithe, and</hi> Melchizedek <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But seeing he insists so much upon this, I shall add, That the Spoils were in strictness his own Estate, having obtained them with the hazard of his Life, in a just and righteous War.

                  <hi>But (Thirdly)</hi> (says <hi>T. E.)</hi> which seems to me a meer trifle, <hi>the occasion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>seems altogether accidental,</hi> ibid.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>That is, accidentally <hi>Abraham</hi> metwith an <hi>occasion</hi> &amp; opportunity to discharge His duty.</p>
               <p>As meer an accidental passage, as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker would have this to be, yet the Apostle draws a solid Argument from thence; and whoever reads the <hi>7th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> will find, that the Apostles design there is to prove the Priesthood of <hi>Melchizedeck's</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that of <hi>Levi</hi>'s, from a threefold Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>(First) He received Tithes of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, or he Tithed him, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>(Secondly)</hi> He blessed him, <hi>and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better, v.</hi> 7. <hi>(Thirdly)</hi> The Apostle proves it the greater and the more blessed Priesthood from the duration of it: <hi>For thou art a Priest for ever after the order of</hi> Mechizedeck, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Now if the account that <hi>Ellwood</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of these two great Men be true, then has the Apostle quite lost his Argument; therefore let us compare <hi>T. E</hi>'s Discourse, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles together.</p>
               <p>Is <hi>Melchizedeck's</hi> Priesthood greater or better than that of <hi>Aarons,</hi> because <hi>Abraham</hi> gave him Tithes? that cannot be: <hi>For Tithes were none of his due, neither did</hi> Abraham <hi>pay them duly, Nor was there in those days any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship, wherein He could perform any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:57744:158"/>
                  <hi>Priestly Office</hi> (As if <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> was a meer Cypher, bore the Name of a Priest, but did not the Work and Office of a Priest.) <hi>It's true</hi> Abraham <hi>gave him Tithes, but he did not pay him Tithes: And when all is done, it was but an accidental business,</hi> and will not bear an Argument. With what dint of Argument might a Jew (upon <hi>Ellwoods</hi> Principles) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead Christianity it self? <hi>What,</hi> Melchizedecks <hi>Priesthood above</hi> Aarons, <hi>because</hi> Abraham <hi>gave him Tithes? that's false even from Christian Principles: Did not Iesus himself say, that it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 20. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>was more blessed to give than to receive?</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>was the giver,</hi> Melchizedeck <hi>was but the receiver; wherefore the Priesthood in</hi> Abrahams <hi>loins was the greater Priesthood, the more blessed Priesthood.</hi> So that if we pursue the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Argument to the far end, with Tithes it overturns not only the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> but indeed the very foundation of Christianity.</p>

               <p>Nothing that I know of, but Men of <hi>Corahs</hi> temper would have quarrelled with it. But as for those Scriptures from which you urged this Maintenance, <hi>The Apostles intent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. Gal. 6. 6.</note> (He saith) <hi>is not to set out what the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is, as who they are, from whom it is to be received, Namely, such as receive their Ministry.</hi> ibid.</p>

               <p>I answer <hi>(First)</hi> Nothing can be more plain, than that the Apostles drift in these Scriptures is, to oblige the People to set forth a maintenance for their Ministers, and those instances of <hi>the Ox treading out the Corn,</hi> &amp;c. shew the equity and reasonableness thereof. <hi>(Secondly)</hi> The question being whether the Ministers of the Gospel ought to be provided for out of mens Estate, for their work and labour in their Ministry; This I perceive is fairly yielded: But then did <hi>T. E.</hi> consider, How this very thing has been opposed all along by his own party, and how miserably they have abused that Text, <hi>freely have ye received, freely give?</hi> However we may fairly inferr from his own words, that they who are <hi>fed</hi> by us, <hi>taught</hi> by us, <hi>planted,</hi> &amp;c. ought not to withhold our maintenances from us. But then <hi>(Thirdly)</hi> The next Question will be this; Whether those who withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the publick Ordinances, are for that reason excusable in withdrawing our maintenances? If this be so, <hi>T. E.</hi> has found out a right expedient, to make all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Men turn either Atheists, or Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in point of interest. But then I must
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57744:159"/>
desire their Friend <hi>Ellwood</hi> to take notice, that if they be not <hi>fed, taught, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by us, the fault is in themselves, and for which we ought not to suffer. <hi>(Fourthly)</hi> The Fallacy and Cheat lies here, that the Quaker do's not distinguish between the first Donors of Tithes, and the present pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Tithes, who are considered in the Rent or Purchase for the Tithes they pay, which I made plain to you at our first Conference, and shall (I hope) make more plain before we part.</p>

                  <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the grand Charter of <hi>England,</hi> runs thus. <hi>Henricus Dei gratia Rex Angliae</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Archiepiscopis, Ducibus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sciatis quod Nos intuitu Dei, &amp; pro salute animae meae, &amp; animarum Anteces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorum, &amp; successorum Nostrorum</hi> &amp;c. That is, He grants this Charter upon this seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretence, that it was for <hi>the good of his Soul, and for the Souls of His Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and successors.</hi> Now shall we argue that this was Idolatry, and therefore <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Charta</hi> was <hi>ipso facto</hi> voyd?

               <p>But I must not let the abuse pass, which he hath put upon me in this Quotation. He so states my words, as his Reader must understand him, that I make explaining and applying the word of God, the sole and the only work of a Minister.</p>

               <p>There is one argument more, which He seems wonderfully fond of: with which He fills up many of his pages, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that you have the Tithe of the Husbandmans <hi>labour, toil, sweat, care, charge, diligence,</hi> nay in one place He thinks you <hi>lay claim to his understanding.</hi> p. 325.</p>

               <p>Whoever reaps the Tithe of <hi>T. E</hi>'s.

               <p>There wanted not those who suggested such stuff as this to the people, in the days of the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> as if they were squeezed and impoverished by the payment of their Tithes; wherefore God calls on them to try, whether they should be losers by it. <hi>Bringye</hi> (saith He) <hi>all the Tithes into the store-house, that there may be meat in my house, and prove me now herewith, if I will not open the windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and pour ye out a blessing, that there</hi>

               <p>Tithes have been long settled in the Nation, and the Church's right to them being antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any Proprietors of Land, who bought their Estates liable to such an Incumbrance, and consequently, had a proportionable deduction in the purchase-Money, and so no injury to them; and if so, why should they grumble at the payment of that which was never reckoned to them in the purchase?</p>

               <p>But Tithes were excepted out of the purchase: For every body knows that they were excepted by the Law of the Nation, and therefore it would have been impertinent to have excepted them in the the Body of the Purchase-Deed. But it any Lands are to be sold, which are exempted from the payment of Tithes, than to be sure the Purchaser shall
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:57744:169"/>
hear of that in both his Ears, and for such a convenience must pay to a Farthing.</p>
               <p>A Friend of mine was lately concern'd in the purchase of a little Meadow-close, the strict Tithe of which was computed at <hi>5s. per an.</hi> but the Parson was bound up by a <hi>Modus</hi> or Composition of <hi>2d. per an.</hi> payable at <hi>Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi> Possibly you will say my Friend had a convenience here, that he paid but <hi>2d.</hi> instead of hay worth <hi>5s.</hi> by the year: but then I must tell you, that its no convenience at all, for his exemption from the Tithes in kind (to my knowledge) cost him <hi>5l.</hi> extraordinary in the purchase.</p>
               <p>This is not a particular, but the general case of all <hi>England:</hi> For in matters of contract and bargain the common rule is, <hi>tanti volet, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti vendidi potest,</hi> every thing is valued, for what it may be sold; and where men meet with conveniencies, they are made to pay for them; and where they meet incumbrances, there they do call for proportionable Deductions: And the Landlords case descends to the Tenant, who pays more or less, according to the Nature and Quality of the thing He holds.</p>

               <p>Cals He this demonstration, when He has so stated the Case, that no certain estimate can be made of the Tithes of such a Farm? A Farm of that value consisting in Tillage may be worth (as He says) 27 l. <hi>per an.</hi> or a Farm of that value consisting in Pasturage may not yield seven shillings a Year to the Parson, for it may be eaten with Horses, and then <hi>T. E.</hi> tells us, <hi>that very little, if any thing at all, is recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for Tithe, p.</hi> 340. Now is it likely that a
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57744:170"/>
Landlord would take ten pounds for that which is worth 27 pounds, or above 10 <hi>l.</hi> in consideration of a Tithe, when the Tenant pays not above seven shillings, or nothing at all? and indeed the one is as probable as the other. But to pass by his Case so fallaciously stated: I will ive him a real Case.</p>
               <p>There is one, whom I could name, that sent to my self to purchase the interest which He had in a certain Prebendal Lease, to which there belonged a Farm, rented at <hi>30l. per an.</hi> I made choice of two Neighbours to view the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of that Farm, and to inform me, whether in their Judgment the Occupant had such a Tack, as he might be able by his <hi>labour, toil, charge,</hi> &amp;c. to maintain his Family, and pay me my Rent: The Method they took to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy me herein, was to know what rates other men in the same Village paid for their Farms, which being computed and compared together, they found, that this Farm was not worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the annual Rent of <hi>25l.</hi> according to the Rates that other men paid for the Grounds they held of the like nature. This was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Seller, who returned this answer, <hi>that it was a mistake that this Farmer paid more than his Neighbours: true it was, that he paid more Rent, but then he had a recompence for it, being discharged from Tithes, which priviledge the other Neighbours had not, who accordingly had an abatement in their Rents.</hi> So that one Neighbour was no better than another: He that paid Tithes had less Rent to pay, and He that had no Tithes to pay was no better, seeing He
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57744:170"/>
paid the value of them in his Rent. And had I gone on with the purchase, I had received no benefit by that exemption, which I must have bought. And I do perswade my selfe there are thousands of the like cases to be found.</p>
               <p>But suppose a Quaker enjoy a Farm of <hi>90l. per an.</hi> Rent, and the Landlord abate <hi>10l.</hi> a year in consideration of Tithes. Or be it que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable whether He abate any thing upon that consideration. I'l tell you what is not question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the Quaker will pay nothing, and will pay this neither to the Landlord nor Priest, and so the one of them shall be sure to be Cozen'd by him.</p>
               <p>Now if a Quaker which Farms <hi>90l. per an.</hi> should say, <hi>Its true Landlord, I should have paid thee</hi> 100l. <hi>but that thou deducts me ten pounds upon the Consideration of Tithes: truly Tithes I dare not pay, but for the ten pounds I have brought it to thy self,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Is not this a modest Quaker think you? If the Landlord do allow a part upon the account of Charges: Tithes are part of that Charge which it seems is allowed by the Landlord, and therefore no loss to the Tenant.</p>
               <p>How compassionate doth he make the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord? (would to God they were all truly so) and how cruel and merciless doth he represent the Priests? Now to shew that this is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right malice and envy, Let it be consider'd, that the greatest part of the Tithes of <hi>England</hi> (to the great dishonour and sin of our Nation, may it be said) are impropriate, and that the greatest Landlords in the Nation have gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Tithes from the Church. Now as kind as he makes them, do they use the People better than the merciless Priests? do they say in <hi>T. E</hi>'s Language to the People: <hi>Neighbours though I claim the tenth part, yet seeing you have been at the pains and charge to get it for me, I'l deal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">pag. 347.</note> 
                  <hi>no worse with you, than I do with my other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, take one part, and leave you two: so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Tithes into three parts, I'l be content with one of them, and do you keep the other two for the pains and charge you have been at in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it.</hi> Now is it usual with Impropriators thus to bespeak the People? If not, then must He account for those soul slanders, which He hath wickedly cast upon the Clergy: As if they were merciless and cruel; Nay they only so. From my heart do I pray to God to bring him to a sense, and to forgive him so great a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.</p>

               <p>I remember you acquainted me that the King has a great Revenue out of the Tithes; namely, the First-fruits and Tenths, which you are disabled to discharge, if your Tithes be withdrawn: so that the Quakers are in this point as well Enemies to the King as the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; and consequently to the Government it self, which is supported by it. Now I do not find that <hi>T. E.</hi> answers the Argument, but catches at a Phrase, that you should call the <hi>First-fruits and Tenths one of the fairest Flowers belonging to the Crown. Herein</hi> (He says) <hi>you are like the Crow, which is said to think her own Bird white, though others see it to be black. And that no Flower can be fair in an English Crown, which was taken out of a Popes Mitre,</hi> p. 355.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>Was there ever so dull a comparison? Do's he call the First-fruits and Tenths my <hi>Crow?</hi> if (forsooth) they must be a Crow, is it mine or the Kings? And though it be plain that my words related not to the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, but Revenue; Yet seeig the Quaker will have it so, I shall tell you, that its very true that this Flower stuck once in the Triple Crown, but then it was stole from the English Diadem.</p>
               <p>I confess the Pope did challenge the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over the Church and Clergy. The first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits and Tenths, was a Homage, whereby the Clergy did own and acknowledge that Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy: The Kings of <hi>England</hi> did themselves that right, as to take the Supremacy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the First-fruits and Tenths as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:57744:172"/>
That you may understand what is included in the Supremacy, I shall acquaint you with a Case. It was disputed in the Popish Schools, Whether a Clergy man could be guilty of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against a Temporal Prince? and resolved in the Negative, <hi>because Treason supposes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between a Sovereign and a Subject: And a Clergyman being Subject to the Pope only, therefore could he not be guilty of Treason against a Temporal Prince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now you see I hope what was included in the Popes claim to Supremacy, and upon what account the First-fruits and Tenths are now paid, which if the King should part with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, even in <hi>Ellwoods</hi> sense; He would part with the <hi>fairest Flower belonging to His Crown.</hi>

               <p>The Quakers used to call Ministers Hirelings for receiving their allotted mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. And therefore in their usual way of railing, used to charge you with selling God's word to the People. To this you said, that they may as well <hi>say the Iudges sells Iustice, because they have an honourable allowance from the Exchequer:</hi> He thinks the Parallel will not hold; <hi>you pretend to be Ministers of Christ, whereas they pretend no higher, than to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of State,</hi> p. 356.</p>

               <p>I thought that every Magistrate had been a Minister of God: St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ill luck, that he had not our inspired <hi>Ellwood</hi> to correct him, when he said, <hi>He is the Minister of God to thee for good,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>and beareth not the Sword in vain.</hi>

We are Ministers of God, Magistrates are Ministers of Justice, and consequently Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of God too: They are dispensers of Justice, we of the word of God; may not then they with equal reason be said to sell Justice, because they receive their maintenances, as we to sell the word of God, because we receive our maintenaners?

               <p>Has the Quakers received some new dispensation from Heaven? If not, how comes it to be lawful to go to Law now in civil Cases, when twenty years ago the same thing was denied by them as unlawful? The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit then by which the Quakers pretend to be inspired, either differs from it self, or is not the same Spirit which the Quakers so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretended to.</p>

Is not this enough to make you abandon for ever all thoughts of Quakerism, when you find their Religion is not fixt, when we know not where to to have them, nor how long to keep them in one mind?</p>
               <p>One of them told me very lately, <hi>that I accused the Quakers falsly in saying that they neglect to crave a blessing upon their Meat, which is now frequently practis'd among them.</hi> I am glad to hear of any Reformation among them, and would to god they would leave off the rest of their fooleries: but if this be their minds now, formerly they talked at another rate: <hi>what</hi> (said they) <hi>we crave a Blessing when we go to meat? that's stinting the Spirit to a Meal, to a Breakfast, a Dinner, or a Supper.</hi> That is, must the Spirit just come, when the Stomach comes? And if the Quakers say Grace now at Meals; yet herein do they take away the Reason of their Dumb Meetings. This is to shew you what a shifting People they are, and how unconstant they are to their own Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but to the case in hand:</p>
               <p>It seems then <hi>T. E.</hi> will allow it now lawful to go to Law in civil Cases (how unlawful soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was before) and I suppose He was wary enough in asserting this; because He cannot but be Conscious, that going to Law is a thing frequently practis'd by the Quakers. But then here I must desire them to take notice, that as dishonourable as they say Oaths are to Christianity, yet they will make their Appeals to Sessions and Assizes, bring Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they know there can be
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57744:173"/>
no proceedings in any Court, but that both Witnesses and Juries must give their Evidences and Verdicts upon Oath. If then it be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so, why will they be any occasion to bring a disgrace and reproach upon Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the Quakers talk so loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against Oaths, many of them (to have the benefit of Wills and Administrations) have taken Oaths, as I am able to make out. An Attorney of great account and practise, told me lately, that two Quakers (Clients of his) took their Oaths in an Answer to an <hi>Exchequer</hi> Bill, and very formally too, put off their Hats, and kiss'd the Book. The late Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> being either as Plaintiff or Defendant, concern'd in a Chancery Suit, a Quaker at a Commission, came very formally to swear against him: One of the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners (from whom I had the account) ask't him, How it came to pass that he being a Quaker would swear? He told him, <hi>Thou knowest that among Huntsmen it was never thought amiss to kill a Fox or Badger, by any means; such being allowed no fair play,</hi> &amp;c. leaving it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to make the application.</p>
               <p>You see then that it's lawful to go to Law in civil Cases, to ingage others to swear, and sometimes to swear themselves: As it interest and envy ought to take place, though contrary to the Principles and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christianity.</p>

               <p>Its true I said it, but not before I first plainly proved it.

Now having discovered their gross ignorance in the interpretation and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that saying of <hi>Ieremiah, The Priests hear rule by their means,</hi> How could I be true to the Souls of Men in saying less?

Alas, what I said of the Quakers were not bitter expressions, but so many sad and serious truths, and spoken out of a Principle of the truest charity and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to prevent their running headlong into eternal ruine and destruction.</p>
               <p>But if no such expressions can proceed but from a <hi>malevolent, crusty, waspish, and viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> Principle, then let me ask my Friend <hi>Ellwood,</hi> whether there is not such a People in the World, who use to call Ministers <hi>Dumb dogs, Hirelings, Serpents, Baals Priests,</hi> and what not?

               <p>He that had seen no more of <hi>T.
