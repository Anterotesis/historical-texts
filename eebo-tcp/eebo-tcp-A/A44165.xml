            <title>The good Samaritane A sermon preached at the parish-church of St. Magnus the Martyr, by London-Bridge, the 13th Sunday after Trinity, being August 25. 1700, upon the Holy Gospel for the day. Printed at the request of the church-wardens, and others of the chief auditors, and humbly dedicated to Sir Charles Duncombe, Knight, and alderman of the ward of Bridge. On account of the most unwonted sort of charity, and noble generosity, which the City of London, and particularly the parish of St. Magnus has lately tasted of.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN ſuch an Age as this, when Notions and Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Eat up the Practice of Piety; when Noiſe and Clamour paſſes for Religion, Covetous Pinching for great Sobriety and Moderation, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmerciful Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity for the Critical Clinch of Juſtice; when Charity not only begins but always keeps at Home; and few are the Examples of a Generous and true Evangelick Spirit, Permit and Pardon me (<hi>Noble Sir</hi>) to make uſe of your Great Name to Patronize this mean Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the <hi>Good Samaritane,</hi> and Recommend to the World thoſe Chriſtian Doctrines, which the <hi>laſt Sundays Holy Goſpel</hi> proclaimed to all good Men: Doctrines which enoble the Soul, and without the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of which Men cannot be Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31619:3"/>It's Truth and Plainneſs is its beſt Recommendation, and wellcom'd it to thoſe Gentlemen who urged its Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication: and thoſe qualifications will oblige true Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: For, the <hi>Holy Goſpel</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus</hi> needs no flouriſhes, and when moſt naked is always moſt Rhetorical and Convincing.</p>
            <p>And they to whom it was Preached are truly Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you, as you have been pleaſed highly to reſpect them; which that, <hi>Noble Benefaction to our Church,</hi> yet of General uſe and ſervice to the publick, will prove a brave and laſting <hi>Monument</hi> of.</p>
            <p>They are of the Number of thoſe who have done themſelves the Honour to Elect you their <hi>Magiſtrate:</hi> By which they have juſtified their Prudence, and exerted a bravery equal to the <hi>Ancient Romans;</hi> who taking good care to chooſe <hi>Wiſe and Noble Senators,</hi> ſecured their <hi>Liberties</hi> from all violence and alienation, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a glorious <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> to the enriching of their Fellow Citizens, and provided wonderfully for all their Poor and Distreſſed.</p>
            <p>And thus you have already done, to the Honour of this great City, the Joy and Satisfaction of all good Men in it, and to the Comfort and Delivery of many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of the Indigent and Impriſoned Members of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31619:3"/>This was a true Year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> to them; and a beginning of a New Life, when they now can work for their maintenance without fear or disturbance; ſay their Prayers, and thank God for their Deliverance without hurry or frightful perplexity; and Contemplate Gods Mercy in raiſing them ſuch a Benefactor, who has delivered them from the dire uſage, that horrid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Cruel and Imperious Jaylors.</p>
            <p>And that thus it ſhould be, that God in all Ages does raiſe up Men for the Eminent Care of his, <hi>his little ones, his Poor deſpiſed and afflicted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> is a moſt admirable proof of his Goodneſs, a great Argument and Inſtance of the Wiſdom and Juſtice of his <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was perhaps the intendment of <hi>Almighty God</hi> in making ſuch an In-equality in the outward Condition of Men in the World, that thoſe of <hi>Fortune</hi> on the <hi>Right</hi> hand ſhould take kind Notice of thoſe on the <hi>Left;</hi> that ſo the <hi>Sick, Poor and Naked</hi> may not ſeem to be forgot by their <hi>Maker,</hi> when they are nouriſhed by the Bountiful hand of thoſe, whom he has enabled and given a Heart to do great things.</p>
            <p>You have been in a moſt Eminent degree already a <hi>Noble Patriot</hi> of your Country; You have <hi>Fed</hi> and <hi>Clothed</hi> the <hi>Hungry</hi> and <hi>Naked;</hi> You have opened

               <hi>Priſon</hi> Doors, and releaſed Captives of Ancient Date, You have been <hi>Phyſick</hi> to the <hi>Sick</hi> and a Cordial to the <hi>Faint;</hi> a <hi>Father to the Fatherleſs, Protection</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> to the <hi>Widow,</hi> and a <hi>Friend</hi> to all that you could have true opportunity to ſerve.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt not omit that great part of your Character, (anſwering <hi>The good Samaritane,</hi>) which the World ought to know and value you for; That in your mighty Charities, you have not been like the <hi>Jews,</hi> to determine them to <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Country</hi>: But, as <hi>God</hi> commanded, who himſelf <hi>makes the Sun to ſhine, and Rain fall on the Juſt and on the Unjuſt</hi>

            <p>And all this is doing what <hi>God</hi> commands; 'tis doing what <hi>Chriſt</hi> came into the World to teach Men to do; this is acting like wiſe Men and good Chriſtians; 'tis doing <hi>more</hi> than <hi>Scribes and Phariſees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Go on (<hi>Great Sir</hi>) who thus have devoted both your ſelf and Eſtate to the true Intereſt of the <hi>Nation,</hi> the Service of this <hi>City,</hi> the Incouragement of <hi>Juſtice,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> of Old had ſeen him only by Faith.

oughteſt thy ſelf to be well known in this, and it is thy Office to ſatisfie others in the matter; thou who profeſſes the Knowledge of the Law, and from whoſe Mouth other Men ſeek it, thou ſhould'st be able to ſatisfy Men from thence; and ſure there thou canſt find it, What is written in the Law? How readeſt thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He anſwers directly now, and ſhews his Proficiency in the Law, and ſaid, ver. 27. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind,</hi> (becauſe indeed he cannot be ſufficiently loved) <hi>and thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> alſo, thou ſhalt love him <hi>as thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> allows and approves of this his diſcreet anſwer, commends him for it; and adds, that ſince he knew his Duty ſo well, nothing remained but for him to do it; ver. 28. <hi>This do and thou ſhalt live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The knowledge of the Law, and the beſt of all Religion is not enough; but to <hi>live, to do accordingly,</hi> that is the Life of all Religion; <hi>Knowledge</hi> does not, <hi>Knowledge</hi> cannot, but doing accordingly moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will give Life. And this was a direct anſwer to his Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> being Baulked, and not a little touch'd with this our <hi>Lord's</hi> Reflection upon his anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; and being convinced that he did not live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Knowledge; being puft up with the uſual affection and vain Glory of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> one of whom he was, he would not in the leaſt own and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any manner of defect; but as if he had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31619:7"/>
been Perfect, very boldly he puts forth a ſecond Queſtion, and demands of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who he eſteems to be his Neighbour, ver. 29. <hi>And who is my Neighbour</hi>?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> you muſt know reckon'd their own <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> the only People to whom were due their affections, or any even the leaſt aſſiſtances and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Foreigners and Strangers they perſued with all manner of Hatred and Scorn; and in afflictions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of relief, they practiſed towards them neglect only, and that to the greateſt degree of Inhumanity.</p>
            <p>This being the conſtant Courſe of their Lives and Converſation with all manner of People but their own, our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> ordered his Diſcourſe ſo, that in the anſwer, the <hi>Lawyer</hi> himſelf ſhould acknowledge their Ill-natur'd folly, and unreaſonableneſs in that matter.</p>
            <p>Which he does by a <hi>Noble Parable</hi> repreſenting the whole of their Diſpute, and teaching that the great Duty of <hi>Love,</hi> of the true <hi>Christian Charity,</hi> is not to be confined to Kindred and Countrey, to Nation and Religion, to Friends and Acquaintance only, but to extend to all Men, of what <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> of what <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi> ſoever, if they really be in Diſtreſs and Miſerable.</p>
            <p>The Parable runs thus, <hi>ver.</hi> 30.
<q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A certain man of the City of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>having Buſineſs at</hi> Jerico, <hi>was upon his Journey thither: but Fortuned on the Rode to be be-ſet with Thieves, who over-powering of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31619:7"/>
him, robb'd him of what he had, even ſtript him of his Cloths, and not content with that abus'd his Perſon, Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to prevent his purſuing of them, then went away leaving him almost dead.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now who ſhould come by that way but a <hi>Prieſt</hi> firſt; who from his Order and Profeſſion of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ought to have been an example of Mercy to others, yet <hi>he paſſed by the other way</hi>; would not ſo much as inquire into the Poor Man's Condition, or take the leaſt Notice of him; but avoids him as if he had been an infection, and as the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed to avoid and refuſe all ſorts of Men, be their Condition ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo bad, who differ'd from them in Religion.</p>
            <p>The next Perſon that came that way was a <hi>Levite, ver.</hi> 32. A man of <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, and Dedicated to the Temple; of the ſecond Order of thoſe who Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in God's Service; a Man there of ſome Devotion, but yet of as little Charity as the <hi>Priest</hi>; He alſo was not in the leaſt moved at the dreadful Condition of the <hi>Traveller,</hi> tho' he proved to be their Countrey-Man and Fellow Citizen of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but he paſſed on alſo, and gave no help at all.</p>
            <p>After both theſe comes a certain <hi>Samaritane,</hi> ver. 33. Now the People of this Town of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> bore always a mortal hatred one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>have no Dealings with the</hi> Samaritans, St. <hi>John</hi> 4.9. They did not ſo much as Trafick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for any thing whatſoever; which was the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31619:8"/>
Reaſon why the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> wondred at our <hi>Saviour</hi> for asking ſome Water of her. <hi>How is it</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>that thou being a</hi> Jew <hi>asketh Drink of me being a Woman of Samaria</hi>? The <hi>Jews</hi> always refuſed and ſcorned any thing from them.</p>
            <p>The like we find from the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was as Croſs and Untoward to all the <hi>Jews,</hi> as will appear by this Inſtance.</p>
            <p>When our <hi>Saviour</hi> with his <hi>Diſciples</hi> was upon his Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where he was to perfect his great Work; they being grown weary, thought fit to ſtay a while and refreſh themſelves in this Town: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly our <hi>Lord</hi> ſends Meſſengers before to prepare for them: the Text ſays there, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.53. <hi>That they did not receive him, becauſe his Face was as tho' he would go to</hi> Jeruſalem: They denied him even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſaries, becauſe his purpoſe was to go on thither, the place which they truly hated; which was a thing In-humane and Barbarous enough, and moved in <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> that furious Queſtion, <hi>Lord, wilt thou that we command Fire from Heaven, and Conſume them as</hi> Elias <hi>did?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Cauſe of this Enmity betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> whether from the difference of their Worſhip; for, <hi>Samaria</hi> boaſted an Altar upon Mount <hi>Gerezim,</hi> about 400 Years before the Structure of <hi>Solomons Temple</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>: or whether from thoſe Old Injuries the <hi>Jews</hi> receiv'd from their Invaſions, when <hi>Samaria</hi> was the Royal City and Seat of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31619:8"/>
               <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after the defection of the Ten Tribes: or whether from that <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>Baal</hi> that <hi>Ahab</hi> after his Ivory Houſe built there, into which he decoyed all the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Worſhippers</hi> of <hi>Baal</hi> and deſtroyed them: or whether from their groſs Idolatries when mixt with the <hi>Aſtirians</hi> after <hi>Salmaneſer</hi> had taken their City and carried the People into Captivity; For tho' there were many <hi>Jews</hi> amongſt thoſe Idolatrous <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet they retained ſuch groſs mixtures of <hi>Heatheniſm, Hereſie,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that our <hi>Bleſſed Lord</hi> did not think them worthy of his firſt and early Call, and therefore gave in charge to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> when he ſent them out to Preach him and his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that they ſhould not enter into any <hi>City</hi> of the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.5. Or laſtly, whether from the words of <hi>David,</hi> which ſeem to prove them neglected by the <hi>God of the Jews,</hi> Pſ. 78.68, 69, 70. <hi>He refuſed the Tabernacle of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>and choſe not the Tribe of</hi> Ephraim (where was <hi>Samaria) but choſe the Tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>even the Hill of</hi> Sion <hi>which he loved; and there he built his Temple on high, and laid the Foundation of it like the Ground, which he eſtabliſhed for ever:</hi> whether from theſe Reaſons or how many of them it matters not, ſince it is plain that the <hi>Jews</hi> always Proſecuted the <hi>Samaritans</hi> with all the Scorn, Deſpite and Malice Imaginable; And the worſt Name they could deviſe on Earth to give any one whom they truly wiſhed Ill to, and hoped to ruin, was to call him a <hi>Samaritane</hi>; Hell only could afford a Partner to it, which in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31619:9"/>
height of their Ranchor they joyned to this, and gave them both to our <hi>Bleſſed Lord, Thou art a</hi> Samaritane, <hi>and haſt a</hi> Devil. St. <hi>John</hi> 8.48. Well, one of this City notwithſtanding the Old Picque betwixt them, perceiving this Poor <hi>Jews</hi> evil Condition and great Danger, was moved with Pity towards him: and he effectually ſerved him. He omitted his own Journey at preſent, dreſſed his Wounds, ſearched them firſt, and cleanſed them with Wine, then poured in Oyl to heal them: takes him to his own Inn, and Orders him to be carefully looked to.</p>
            <p>To comfort and aſſiſt him he ſtays with him there all Night, and on the morrow (becauſe he muſt have regard alſo unto his own Buſineſs) having done what he could, he takes out Money, gives it to the Inn-keeper afore-hand to Oblige him to better Care, and promiſes him at his return to pay more, even all whatſoever he ſhall lay out for the Poor Man's good and recovery.</p>
            <p>Having now told his Story, our <hi>Lord</hi> asks this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Lawyer,</hi> which of theſe three was Neighbour (as he thought) to him that fell amongſt the Thieves: He anſwers, He that ſhewed Mercy on him, <hi>ver.</hi> 37.</p>
            <p>To which our <hi>Saviour</hi> replies, thou ſayeſt right again, <hi>Go and do likewiſe.</hi> Thou underſtandeſt very well thy Duty, ſee that thy Converſation be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thy knowledge; thou knoweſt Truth, thou diſcerneſt what is good, ſee then that thou takeſt care
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31619:9"/>
to make it thy Buſineſs to do accordingly; to expreſs and demonſtrate this good Learning and Knowledge, by Wiſe and Noble Actions, by a Good and Holy Life.
<q>
                  <p>Go and do thou likewiſe.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this great Leſſon that our <hi>Saviour</hi> inſtructs this Son of <hi>Moſes</hi> in, there is ſtill a greater Incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by the Parable, and that is this, The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of the Law, and the works of it, to heal thoſe that are wounded by Sin: neither <hi>Prieſt</hi> nor <hi>Levite,</hi> in their own ſtubborn Rules were able to work Righteouſneſs, and Cure the Diſeaſed in Conſcience.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed thought themſelves perfect in the works of the Law, that they loved <hi>God</hi> ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and ſerved him abſolutely, by being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and exact in their <hi>Sacrifices</hi>; by wearing the <hi>Commandments</hi> in their <hi>Garments,</hi> and the Name of <hi>God</hi> in their Fore-heads, and uſing <hi>Lord</hi> conſtantly in their Mouths; by being very punctual in the Obſervation of all their <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> and by hating all other Nations and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who differ'd from them in Religion.</p>
            <p>But by this Parable is demonſtrated, that <hi>God</hi> delights more in ſincerity and hearty affection than in <hi>Sacrifices</hi>; that he is more pleaſed with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31619:10"/>
the Bowels of Mercy and Love, than the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Offerings.</p>
            <p>And our <hi>Lord</hi> rebukes that ſtubborn ſelf-love of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who lived to themſelves only and no more; who confined all their aſſiſtance and good wiſhes to their own Nation, and Sect, and Family, who to theſe only would ſhew their Acts of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Religion: but behaved themſelves like <hi>Turks</hi> to all the reſt of the World.</p>
            <p>Therefore all that great pretence of the <hi>Jews Religion</hi> is diſcouraged, and that Generous and Charitable one of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is ſtrongly enforced; which teaches all its Proſelites to look farther than themſelves, and provokes them always to do all the good they can, and that to all Men in Diſtreſs; as <hi>our Lord</hi> himſelf came to Save the whole World, even all Mankind who would be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to accept of his Terms of Reconciliation.</p>
            <p>Therefore he is the good and kind <hi>Samaritane,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Keeper</hi>: He was the true <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi> who kept his Sheep, and would not ſuffer them to periſh.</p>
            <p>All we were out of the way with this poor <hi>Jew,</hi> ſpoiled firſt and rob'd of our Innocency by <hi>Satan</hi> and his Thieviſh VViles; then we were Wounded by our own many Sins, our conſtant Failures and infirmities; and laid aſide half Dead, deſtitute of Life as well as of eaſe; no relief could
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31619:10"/>
come from the works of the Law, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> both paſſed by, and as they did not offer, ſo neither were they able to ſave.</p>
            <p>And here is the great Doctrine of the Parable, Health and Salvation only comes from him: <hi>The Bleſſed Jeſus</hi> himſelf, the only <hi>Saviour,</hi> the true <hi>Samaritane,</hi> the careful <hi>Keeper,</hi> he comes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves us, he comforts and reſtores us effectually.</p>
            <p>He ſearches our Sores and diſcovers our Corruption, then he heals and binds up our Wounds.</p>
            <p>He would not turn away his Face from us, but Remembered us in our low eſtate.</p>
            <p>He did all that was poſſible to be done in order to the Healing and Reſtoring of us.</p>
            <p>And when he returned to Heaven, he left us ſtill in very good Hands, his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> to the End of the World: Theſe he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to Comfort, to Cure, and Preach Salvation to us, giving them at preſent a Reward on Earth for looking well to us; appointing them who Preach to live alſo upon the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but promiſing them ſtill a better and greater Reward, when he ſhall come again to make up his Jewels.</p>
            <p>Then are they to receive the full Fruit of all their Labours, and for looking well to their charge they will be doubly Paid and Rewarded for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of their Pains and Care they ſhall lay out for the Recovery of his People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:31619:11"/>And as the Parable it ſelf was a ſufficient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of the Folly of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in determining their Love and Friendſhip to their own People, and obliged this Cunning and Learned Man of the Law to acknowledge the ſame; And the only application that our <hi>Lord</hi> makes of it to him was, that he ſhould put in Practice what he ſo well knew, and had there Ingenuouſly owned; being now convinced that he ſhould make it his Buſineſs to mend his Manners, ſince he had good Learning, and knew the Law, it would leave him without excuſe not to live up to it, if he did not, <hi>Go and do likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the fuller diſcovery of that more Valuable Learning, the <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine in it, that that this <hi>Lawyer</hi> could not ſee, but the happy <hi>Diſciples</hi> might: Nay, that that the former <hi>Prophets</hi> and many <hi>Kings</hi> have deſired to ſee and hear, but could not; ſince all this is clearly revealed to us; ſince we with open Face can behold, as in a Glaſs, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Lord,</hi> how great will our Condemnation be if we do not live accordingly; what will become of us, if after ſo clear Conviction of our Sins and Miſery, and perfect Demonſtration of Chriſt's Love and Mercy, we cannot, we will not yet be perſwaded to <hi>Go and do likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For our further improving then of this Sacred Scripture, what I ſhall inſiſt upon at this time
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31619:11"/>
(with God's aſſiſtance) ſhall be the Proof and Application of this great Doctrine.</p>
            <p>That all our clear Convictions, and Knowledge of Chriſtianity; our skill to diſcover and find out our Duty, the Demonſtrations and great Pretentions of our Religion, and even Faith it ſelf: theſe are all but nothing worth without our Living and Doing accordingly.</p>
            <p>To know, to own, and to commend is not enough, but our great Duty is to <hi>keep God's Holy Will and Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To diſcern, to talk of, and to teach them is not enough, but to <hi>walk in the ſame all the days of our Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold, to <hi>obey</hi> is better than <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and to hearken than the fat of <hi>Rain,</hi> ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> to the Men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 Book, 15 ch. 22. ver.</p>
            <p>To keep Gods Law, to have juſt regard to his Precepts, and that with all manner of ſincerity; to be exemplary in Charity, and fruitful in all good works; this is the Genuine off-ſpring of the beſt knowledge, and the only Demonſtration of the true Chriſtian Faith. Good works flow from thence as Fruit does from the Tree; And without good works, in vain is the pretence of Religion, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is deceit, and a lye, and Faith it ſelf quite Dead.</p>
            <p>But from the diſcovery of the Goodneſs and Mercys of <hi>God</hi> the infinite Love and Condeſcention
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31619:12"/>
of <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi>; the Comfort, Aſſiſtance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings of the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi>; from our Knowledge and Aſſurances of theſe in the Revealed Word, for us to live accordingly, for us to <hi>Go and do likewiſe,</hi> is to Glorify our God, to Edify and improve our Generation, and to declare and juſtify both our Faith and Knowledge before Men.</p>
            <p>When our Learning and Skill in God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is ſeen by our Obedience, when our Light ſo ſhines before Men that they ſee our <hi>good Works</hi>; when our Acts of Converſation are ſuch as we juſtifie in Opinion; Then do we Glorifie our <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> prove our Claim and Intereſt in the Merits of his <hi>only Son our Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> and then do we pleaſe and rejoice the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>: then do we anſwer the end of our Creation; become Ornaments to the Univerſe, while we appear tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful helps amidſt the infirmities and failuers of a miſerable World; and as our example will tend to the Encouragement of others, provoking them alſo to Glorifie God, ſo more eſpecially to the Juſtification of our ſelves in the great Day of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe who are upright in their way, and who walk in the Law of the Lord,</hi> Pſ. 119. ver. 1. <hi>Bleſſed are they who keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and ſeek him with their whole Heart,</hi> ver. 2.</p>
            <p>He does not ſay that they are Bleſſed who can talk of God's Teſtimonies, who know the beſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31619:12"/>
way, and are well inſtructed in the Law of the Lord, but they who do accordingly, they who keep the Law, and ſeek him with their whole Heart.</p>
            <p>He afterwards ſays, ver. 6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed,</hi> or confounded, <hi>when I have reſpect unto thy Commandments.</hi> Now, in knowledge a Man may be confounded, in Opinion, and Fancy, and even in Faith it ſelf: but in Obedience, in having juſt reſpect to God's Commands, in doing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, three we cannot be confounded.</p>
            <p>And our <hi>Bleſſed Lord</hi> himſelf ſays, St. <hi>John</hi> 15.14. <hi>Ye are my Friends if ye do whatſoever I Command you</hi>: 'tis not for knowing only, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; but for doing what Chriſt Commands that demonſtrates us to be his true Friends.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> ſays expreſly, in his 1 Ep. 3 ch. 10 ver. That <hi>Whoſoever does not Righteouſneſs is not of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore is it that the Man after Gods own Heart, prays for his Son in theſe words, <hi>Give to</hi> Solomon <hi>my Son a perfect Heart, to keep thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, thy Teſtimonies, and thy Statutes, and to do thoſe things.</hi> 1 Chron. 29.19.</p>
            <p>Wiſdom and Knowledge <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf had deſired, and obtained from God in a moſt Glorious abundance, above any Inſtance that the World had ever produced; But this is his Godly Father's
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31619:13"/>
Prayer for him, that he might do likewiſe, that he might live and act according to his Superlative Knowledge.</p>
            <p>And it is the particular and highly Honourable Character of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that, <hi>They walked in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. They lived up to their Religion, and obeyed the Statutes and Laws thereof.</p>
            <p>And this is that that was Comfort to <hi>King Hezekiah</hi> in the day of his Sickneſs and Diſtreſs, when the Prophet was ſent to him with this Dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Meſſage, <hi>Set thy Houſe in Order, for thou muſt dye and not Live,</hi> this then refreſhed and encouraged him therefore to appeal with it to his God, Iſaiah 38. ver. 3. <hi>I beſeech thee, O Lord, Remember how I have walked before thee in Truth and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſays, Ch. 11. ver. 6. That <hi>without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, that <hi>Faith without Works,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Holineſs, without doing accordingly, <hi>is Dead,</hi> in the 2, ch. of his Ep. 17. ver. good works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt revive and quicken our Faith. That ſame Apoſtle therefore ſays in the 1, ch. of his Ep. 22. ver. <hi>Be ye doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own Souls</hi>: arguing it to be a mighty Shamm, a Trick and an Impoſition upon

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:31619:14"/>Therefore it is that St. <hi>Paul</hi> preſſes this very hard and affectionately upon the men of <hi>Philippi,</hi> in the 4 ch. of his Ep. to them, the 8, and 9, ver. even all brave and generous Actions, <hi>Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are just, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praiſe, think of theſe things.</hi> Again, <hi>Thoſe things which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and ſeen in me,</hi> thoſe things take you care to <hi>do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that mighty <hi>King and Prophet</hi> a little before his Death, in the laſt great Meeting he had of his <hi>Princes and Nobles,</hi> the <hi>Heads</hi> of all the <hi>Tribes</hi>; being about to take leave of them, and to give them ſome good advice at parting, this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly farewel admonition that his laſt Breath delivers to them; to inforce which, and make them take the better notice of it, he adds ſo great an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that it would be the means to continue them in that good Land, which the bounty of their great God had now placed them in, and to enſure alſo a bleſſing upon their Poſterity. His words in the 1 Chron. 28. ch. and the 8. ver. are theſe, <hi>Now therefore in the ſight of all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God, keep and ſeek for all the Commandments of the Lord your God, that ye may poſſeſs this good Land, and leave it for an inheritance for your Children after you for ever.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:31619:14"/>And when they had Forfeited Gods Favour, and loſt that good Land, and were got into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; the Omiſſion of this Duty is that that <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> in his Confeſſion does attribute to be the great Cauſe thereof; Nehem. 1.7. <hi>We have dealt very corruptly againſt thee, and have not kept the Commandments, nor the Statutes, nor the Judgments, which thou Commandest thy Servant</hi> Moſes: they did not perform well, they did not act the Duties of their Religion; wherefore God ſuffered them to be a Prey to the Heathen, that they that hated them were made Lords over them; And as he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, Ch. 9.36. <hi>Behold we are Servants this day: and for the Land that thou gaveſt to our Fathers, to eat the good thereof, and the Fruit thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold we are Servants in it: And it yieldeth much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to the Kings that thou haſt ſet over us, becauſe of our Sins, alſo they have Dominion over our Bodies, and over our Cattle at their Pleaſure, and we are in great diſtreſs,</hi> ver. 37.</p>
            <p>Whereas on the other ſide, for the Comfort of thoſe who cheerfully obey and do Gods will, they have their deſires and enjoy true Peace; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, That <hi>whatſoever we ask we receive from him, becauſe we keep his Commandments, and do thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight,</hi> 1 St. <hi>John</hi> 3. ch. 22. ver.</p>
            <p>And of all thoſe things, the works of Mercy and Pity, the Buſineſs of the Text, theſe are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>always
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31619:15"/>
the moſt pleaſing in his ſight: Theſe are the fulfilling of the Law, and the ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Goſpel: Theſe are the Honour of Humanity, and by theſe Men are known to be <hi>Chriſt's Diſciples:</hi> The beſt of Men were truly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for them, and no one can be at all Religious without them. Such a Power and Charm they have always had over the wiſe and good, that rather than not to do them, they would even challenge Miſery it ſelf, or chooſe not to be at all; which made that upright and perfect Man cry out, Job 31.16. <hi>If I have with-held the Poor from their deſire, or have cauſed the Eyes of the Widow to fail; Or have taken my Morſel my ſelf alone, and the Fatherleſs have not eaten thereof</hi>; For ver. 18. of the Fatherleſs (he ſays) <hi>From his Youth he was brought up with him, as with a Father:</hi> Of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow (he ſays) <hi>I have guided her from my Mothers Womb.</hi> Again, ver. 19. <hi>If I have ſeen any periſh for want of Clothing, or any Poor without Covering; If his Loins have not bleſſed me, and if he were not warmed with the Fleece of my Sheep; If I have lift up my Hand against the Fatherleſs when I ſaw my help in the Gate.</hi> Then ver. 22. <hi>Let mine Arm fall from tho ſhoulder Blade, and mine Arm be broken from the Bone.</hi> And if he fail'd of a generous improvement, and honeſt uſe of what God had bleſſed him with, then ſaid he, <hi>Let Thiſtles grow instead of Wheat, and Cockle inſtead of Barley:</hi> As then he ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31619:15"/>
ſo neither did he deſire any more increaſe of his Land.</p>
            <p>And for the Encouragement of the Rich and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, the greateſt <hi>Emperour,</hi> the Richeſt <hi>Prince</hi> as well as the wiſeſt <hi>Man</hi> ſays, <hi>Cast thy bread upon the Waters for thou ſhalt find it after many days, Eccleſ.</hi> 11.1. Give of thy ſubſtance freely to thoſe who are abſolutely unlikely to return thy Bounty, and thy reward ſhall be when both it and thy ſelf ſhall be forgotten. The ſame Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſays, that all is but <hi>lent unto the Lord,</hi> who will fully repay whatſoever is laid out. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17.</p>
            <p>And this is the Reaſon that the <hi>Prophets</hi> of old, who ſpoke the Mind and Will of God, took care very earneſtly to deliver this Doctrine to all great Men they were ſent to. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> charges them to <hi>looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to take off heavy Burdens, to let the oppreſſed go free, and break every Yoke; to deal their bread to the hungry, to bring the Poor that wander to their Houſes, and when they ſee the naked to take care and cover them.</hi> Iſa. 58.6, 7.</p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> commands them <hi>no more to oppreſs,</hi> but <hi>reſtore the Pledge to the Debtor; to ſpoil none by violence, but to feed the hungry, and cover the naked with a Garment; to withdraw their hands from iniquity, and execute true Judgment betwixt Man and Man,</hi> Ezekiel 18.7, 8.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>Daniel</hi> adviſed the <hi>King</hi> himſelf in a great ſtreight, that he would take care ſpeedily to <hi>break
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31619:16"/>
off his ſins by Righteouſneſs, and his iniquities by ſhewing Mercy on the Poor,</hi> Dan. 4.24.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> himſelf commands them that they would <hi>let their Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee their good works, and glorifie their Father which is in Heaven,</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16.</p>
            <p>And our great Apoſtle charges them who are <hi>Rich</hi> in this World, that they be not <hi>high-minded,</hi> nor truſt in uncertain Riches: But that they <hi>do good,</hi> that they be <hi>Rich in good works,</hi> ready to <hi>diſtribute,</hi> willing to <hi>Communicate</hi>; aſſuring them that it is the way to lay up in ſtore for themſelves a <hi>good Foundation</hi> againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Nay, our <hi>Bleſſed Lord</hi> himſelf commands them to <hi>make to themſelves Friends of this Mammon of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> with ſo remarkable an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that a Generous and Charitable uſe of theſe Earthly things, will procure them true and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Friends,</hi> when all elſe ſhall forſake them, ſuch as ſhall <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher them to Heavenly,</hi> even <hi>everlaſting Habitations,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9.</p>
            <p>To Apply now what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let this be a ſevere Check to all Sanctity in pretence only; to that Devotion, that Religion that is more in <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Noiſe</hi> than in <hi>Heart</hi> and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31619:16"/>
               <hi>Deed</hi>; whoſe Proſelites boaſt their Love of <hi>God,</hi> and yet hate their <hi>Neighbours</hi>; who are formal, and conſtant, and open in the outward ſhew and profeſſion of their Religion, but have nothing of the inward Life, and Power, and Vigour of true Chriſtianity, which rejoyces in <hi>good works,</hi> and is always exemplary in <hi>ſhewing Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This our witty and Eloquent <hi>Moſaical Man,</hi> that could talk of <hi>loving God with all his Heart, and all his Soul, and all his might, and all his ſtrength</hi>; and then, his <hi>Neighbour as himſelf:</hi> who perhaps was Zealous in his outward Performances of the things relating to the Law; his Prayers and Sacrifices, his Tyths and Offerings; and who could teach others their Duty, was well enabled to give Rules, and direct his Neighbours in Goodneſs; was ſtill but as a Dead Man; he wanted to go and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to learn even of a true moral Heathen, a good honeſt tho' a deſpiſed <hi>Samaritane,</hi> how he might attain <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So Idle and ſilly is all affected Holineſs, when there wants real Performances; ſo trifling is all outward ſhow and glorying, that is without Heart and Subſtance; ſo vain and preſuming are all their pretences to an Eternal happy Life, who live not according to their Faith and Knowledge; who tho' they can very glibly talk, yet are dull and heavy in acting the Duties of their Religion; that their expectation is but a ſnare, their Profeſſion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31619:17"/>
a perfect Cheat, their Knowledge and Glory is in ſhame, and their mighty boaſting will prove at laſt little elſe than Damnation to their Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From this great Tranſaction, and thoſe ſerious Checks given to the furious ſons of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by our <hi>Bleſſed Lord,</hi> we ſee the miſtake of all thoſe who affect infallibility in this Life, and the wrong meaſures they take in pretending to advance the Dominion of Religion, the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> by deſtroying and rooting up all thoſe who are not perfectly of their mind.</p>
            <p>'Twas the conſtant Practice of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> one of whom our <hi>Lawyer</hi> was, to pretend to the Love and Service of <hi>God excluſive</hi> of all others; and to purſue thoſe who came not up to their heights, not only with ſcorn and neglect, as the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> did the wounded Man, but with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence alſo and inveterate Malice.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the <hi>Apostles</hi> themſelves there was a furious <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> (mention'd but juſt now) who were ready to call for Fire from Heaven upon thoſe who refuſed them Entertainment. And in all Ages and Places of the World, as well as at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there have been thoſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> who ſtudiouſly boaſted themſelves and party, Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all others.</p>
            <p>But Wiſdom is juſtified of all her Children, and Righteouſneſs is that that will bring a Man Peace at the laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:31619:17"/>'Tis the integrity of the upright that ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them; 'tis doing likewiſe, not pretending and boaſting only; 'tis ſhewing Mercy and Truth, not doing miſchief and cruelty, that can aſſure us of all the Glories and Advantages of our Religion, and at laſt will advance us to God's Right Hand, there to enjoy Eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is Argument of great Comfort to the honeſt Hearted Chriſtian to hold up his Head, keep his integrity, mind his own Buſineſs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the untowardneſs of his Generation, the multitudes of <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Robbers,</hi> thoſe who lye in wait both to deceive and ſpoil them.</p>
            <p>Tho' the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Levite</hi> go by and leave them in their Diſtreſs; tho' thoſe who think themſelves ſafe, and above the danger of Miſery, ſhew no Mercy at all to them; yet the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> He raiſes them a Friend tho' of a <hi>Samaritane,</hi> he ſees and takes Pity on them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He Remembers us in our low degree,</hi> (ſays <hi>David.</hi>) And again, <hi>When my Father and Mother forſake me the Lord taketh me up.</hi> Pſ. 27.10. When therefore there appears no probable Remedy, neither from the Men of Religion whoſe Profeſſion ſhould Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to Mercy; nor any relief from Parents, whoſe Bowels of Compaſſion cannot fail; even
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31619:18"/>
then comes he to ſave, whoſe Arm is not ſhortned; that <hi>God from whom alone proceeds all Deliverance, whoſe Mercies endure for ever, Bleſſed be his Holy Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Let this be Encouragement to all Men, to be Kind and Merciful, Aſſiſtant and Loving, to all thoſe in Miſery, who ſtand in need of help and Comfort.</p>
            <p>He is our <hi>Neighbour</hi> whoſe Misfortunes and afflictions call for our aſſiſtance; Let us then <hi>Go and do likewiſe</hi>: Not run away from ſuch Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for our Charity; nor at diſtance ſtand and pity them only; but as the good <hi>Samaritane</hi> here, have real compaſſion on them, ſerve them effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; poure in Oil and Wine, and then bind up their wounds, carry them to Lodgings to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care of, and leave them money too.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>good works</hi> are they that will go before us into Judgment; this is that Virtue that will be fullneſs of reward in the end.</p>
            <p>So ſays our bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf if he be to be believed: He tells us, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.31. <hi>That when the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the Holy Angels with him, and ſhall ſit upon his Throne of Glory; and before him ſhall be gathered all nations, that he will ſeperate them one from the other, as a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31619:18"/>
divideth his Sheep from the goats:</hi> Under the Type of ſetting the <hi>Sheep</hi> on the right hand he will advance all the righteous to Glory; And by putting the <hi>Goats</hi> to the left will he doom the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous to miſery.</p>
            <p>Now pray obſerve, that at that great Day when he will recompenſe all according to their <hi>Works,</hi> theſe will then be thoſe <hi>Great Works</hi> ſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reckoned for; theſe will then appear the <hi>Works</hi> that will ſtand by and juſtifie us: ver. 34. <hi>Come now ye Bleſſed of my Father, receive the Kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you from the foundation of the World: The reaſon follows; For I was an hungred and ye gave me Meat: I was thirsty and ye gave me Drink: I was a Stranger and ye took me in: naked and ye clothed me: I was ſick and ye Viſited me: I was in priſon and ye came unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to prevent miſtakes and leave all unkind and unmerciful men without excuſe, he further adds, that it is not to his own perſon that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects all thoſe performances, becauſe he would withdraw that ſhortly from the Earth; but that he would leave them there continual Objects of Love and Mercy, and all that he expected was to be done to thoſe <hi>Miſerable Members of his,</hi> ver. 45. And accordingly would reward them as done to himſelf; as he would alſo reſent the omiſſion with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31619:19"/>
certain puniſhment. <hi>In as much as they did it not to theſe, they did it not to me; Theſe therefore ſhall go into everlasting pain: But the righteous into life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>; They who did it to the leaſt of my Brethren, to the moſt deſpiſed and ordinary of Men when in miſery, they did unto me, I will take care now of their reward. <hi>They ſhall go away into Everlasting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whoſo is Wiſe, ſhall ponder theſe things, will go and do likewiſe, and they ſhall underſtand the Loving kindneſs of the Lord.</hi>
