         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IS there no end of writing Books? Have not
our Ears been filled, and our Eyes wearied
with Hearing and Reading, touching this ſubject,
Both <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Contra?</hi> Are not the later
writers in behalfe of Infants Baptiſme, very
many, <hi>viz. Cardinal Bellarmine,</hi> and a great
number of the ſons of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
who have in this point, dealt as ingeniouſly, as
pithily, as ever any that took up the defence of it
could do? Have we not often heard of it from
the pens of the reformers; in the infancy of their
reformation? <hi>viz. Luther, Melancthon,
Calvin:</hi> with a great number of late Doctors
and Maſters: <hi>viz. Featly, Marſhall, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,
Fuller, Baxter, Audley,</hi> with others?</p>
            <p>Have we not had alſo many who have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not a little on the oppoſite party? And both
by their pens and ſuffrings teſtified againſt the
Baptiſme of Infants: as <hi>Morton,</hi> with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
contemporary; the Miniſters of <hi>Tranſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania:</hi>
and ſince of later years, <hi>Blackwell,
Tombes, Cornwall, Fiſher, Lamb</hi> Senior,
<hi>Lamb,</hi> Junior, <hi>Writer, Haggar,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb facs="tcp:114788:3"/>
who will not be offended becauſe they are
not named? Have the Proteſtants of late ſaid
any thing more then the Papiſts before them? Or
will this Book tell us one thing more then either
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Papiſt,</hi> hath not formerly Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</p>
            <p>On the other hand, what can be ſaid more effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually
to prove the Baptiſme of Infants to bear an
humane ſtamp, and ſuperſcription, and not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
then hath been ſaid over, and again?
What need then of this Book?</p>
            <p>Patience good Reader, and know it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any conceit of the impotency of thoſe that
have written before, or of the excellency of any
thing herein contained, above what hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
written; that hath occaſioned me to ſhew this
to the world: but that the importunity of friends
might be ſatisfied, and the mouths of lying ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
might be ſtopped, that they may be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
out of thoſe ſlanderous reports, whereof they
have been coyners. Thou haſt here the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the diſcourſes that paſſed between <hi>Mr.
Gunning,</hi> and my ſelf. I cannot warrant it
in every tittle perfect, but as fully, impartially, as
<hi>I</hi> am able to give thee: This <hi>I</hi> will affirm, that
willingly <hi>I</hi> have omitted nothing, that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb facs="tcp:114788:3"/>
to the making his arguments, or anſwers ſeem
valid. Indeed <hi>I</hi> did wiſh, <hi>I</hi> could have ſhewed
thee this diſcourſe in a more perfect form then it
is; and <hi>I</hi> did wiſh it heartily: and for the ſame
purpoſe <hi>I</hi> did write unto <hi>Mr. Gunning,</hi> declaring
mine intentions to ſend my papers to the Preſs; and
intreating his favour to come to my houſe (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<hi>I</hi> was not able to ſtir abroad) and to put to
his file: if any thing were omitted, it ſhould be
inſerted: if any thing were inſerted, that was not
ſpoken, it ſhould be expunged: declaring alſo that
<hi>I</hi> would wait for him four or five daies. <hi>I</hi> did
wait twelve daies; and at laſt <hi>I</hi> received from him
(not by writing, but by word) That he could not
come; if <hi>I</hi> pleaſed, <hi>I</hi> might proceed: and if <hi>I</hi> did
any injury to him, hee would let the world know of
it. Thus when <hi>I</hi> could not do as <hi>I</hi> would, <hi>I</hi> was
forced to do what <hi>I</hi> was able to do. <hi>I</hi> have here
propounded to thy conſideration, the matter as well
as <hi>I</hi> can. Read, and in the preſence of the Lord,
(ſetting prejudice aſide) conſider what <hi>Mr.
Gunning</hi> hath produced that is of greater
weight then thoſe arguments Men have formerly
written: <hi>I</hi> leave thee to the peruſall of the Book;
at the latter end whereof, thou haſt an account of
ſome arguments that <hi>I</hi> had intended for to have
<pb facs="tcp:114788:4"/>
urged at that time. Conſider them alſo with the
reſt, and let the Readers (that can) pray unto
the God of peace, that hee would cauſe the Sun
of Righteouſneſs to ariſe; That diviſions may
ceaſe: and all that fear the Lord may be of
one lipp, and of one heart ſerving the
Lord in Godly Simplicity, and
Sincerity.</p>

               <p>MY dear friend, I rejoyce very heartily to ſee you
in health, and to enjoy your ſociety this day:
And ſo much the more, becauſe I have heard that you
were preſent at a diſpute, two ſeveral dayes at <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Danes,</hi> concerning the <hi>Baptiſme of Infants;</hi>
whether it be to be accounted <hi>Lawful,</hi> or <hi>Unlawful.</hi>
Concerning which diſpute I have heard Reports ſo
different, that I find it a matter of difficulty to find
a ground for Credence; I deſire your gentleneſs not to
deny my requeſt, but to grant me ſo much favour as to
make me partakers of your apprehenſions of the whole
matter. That by your impartiall Relation of the
tranſactions of both dayes, I may find ſome good aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of confidence.</p>

               <p>It is no wonder that you ſhould hear various

prejudice upon their ſpirits, Judging before they
have heard, and determining the whole matter
before it begin. Some bringing with them hearts
fraught with envy, anger, and malice: inſomuch
that if they <hi>Could,</hi> they <hi>Would not,</hi> and if they <hi>Would</hi>
they <hi>Could not,</hi> ſincerely diſcern the truth of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

in your eys; I will not refuſe to relate unto
you the ſum of the matter: ſo far as my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory

might well have been ſpared on both ſides, I ſhall
take no notice of them at all.</p>

               <p>I will firſt declare unto you the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of this
diſpute, which was this: A gentlewoman, who
had (through mercy) ſet her heart ſeriouſly to ſeek
the Lord and his face, with reſolution to walk in
his wayes, was not a little troubled in ſpirit about
the many differences in and about Worſhip, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe that profeſs the name of the Lord:
Shee looked upon her former wayes as evill, and
to be forſaken; but what to embrace ſhee knows
not; Foraſmuch as ſo ſoon as ſhee had paſſed
through the Doctrine <hi>Of Repentance from dead
works, and faith towards God</hi> (in which the preſent
differences of the Men of theſe times have created
no ſmal difficulties) Shee meets with a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114788:5"/>
about the <hi>Doctrine of Baptiſme,</hi> which
drives her into a ſtrait; and ſhee remains divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in her thoughts; not being able to reſolve
her ſelf, whether her Infant Baptiſme were of
God, or whether it were contrary to truth, being
none other but tradition of Men, a will worſhip,
and by conſequence vain and unprofitable. While
thus ſhee remains uncertain, not knowing to
which part to adhere whether to thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the faith of the Lord Jeſus do maintain
and uphold the <hi>Baptiſme of Infants,</hi> or whether it
were not her duty to repair to a Baptiſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
to require <hi>Baptiſme</hi> at their hands. If
ſhee make her addreſſes to Counſellours, one ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thus: Fear not your Baptiſme is good and valid.
Another tels her that her <hi>Infant, Baptiſme</hi> is not of
God: Both theſe uſe Arguments, and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
and Reaſons, which captivate her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that ſhee diſcerns not in her ſelf, what
to imbrace, or what to eſchew: And finding at
preſent no way to deliver her ſelf from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
is very deſirous a Conference may be had
between Parties on both ſides, about this matter;
To the end that what ſhee could not be throughly
perſwaded of in her mind when ſhee heard them
ſpeaking aſunder, might (through grace) be
happily obtained by hearing them ſpeak friendly
Together. This was the occaſion of the meeting:
And <hi>Mr. Gunning</hi> (whether ſolicited by <hi>Intreaty</hi>
of others, or moved <hi>Voluntarily,</hi> I know not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly)
was pleaſed to take the buſineſs upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
on the one part, to defend the <hi>Lawfullneſs
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114788:6"/>
of Infants Baptiſme;</hi> And <hi>Mr. Denne</hi> on the other
part, yeelded himſelf to oppugn the <hi>Baptiſme of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two dayes were appoynted for this confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
The firſt day was on the 19th of <hi>November</hi>
laſt, when they met at the place before appoynted:
And <hi>Mr. Denne</hi> whoſe part it was that day to be
the <hi>Reſpondent,</hi> ſtood up in the Pulpit, and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the multitude to be ſilent, and to behave

he ſpake.</p>

               <p>The place of Scripture you have brought is <hi>Allegorical,</hi>
and therefore not ſo proper to be a ground for Faith: not
having one word in it to the matter in hand to be proved:
which is that <hi>Infants canot be ſaved without Baptiſme:</hi>
Now here is in this TEXT, neither the word <hi>Infant,</hi> nor
<hi>Baptiſme,</hi> nor <hi>Saved:</hi> (if your gloſs be layd aſide:) But I
have three things in anſwer to this TEXT, and your gloſs
or expoſition: The firſt is a general rule, which will ſerve
to anſwer not only this, but other arguments, that perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
may be brought. <hi>That Scriptures muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to whom, and of whom they ſpeak; and not to be
applyed to any other, concerning whom it doth not ſpeak.</hi>
So you find in the quoted place, that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Ruler of
the Jews, comes to Chriſt to learn the way of God, that
ſo he might work the workes of God: To this Man, Chriſt
makes anſwer, <hi>except a Man be born again, &amp;c.</hi> ſpeaking
neither of Children, nor to Children: The ſecond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is this: that by being born again of Water, is not
meant Baptiſme, but a <hi>Miſtical</hi> not a <hi>Litteral</hi> Water: as
in many other places of Scripture ſpoken of. Thirdly, if it
were granted that the TEXT, did include Children, and
that by Water were meant Baptiſme; yet will it not follow
that <hi>Children can not be ſaved without Baptiſme,</hi> becauſe
here is only mention made of <hi>entering into the Kingdome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114788:7"/>
of God:</hi> you know that the Kingdome of God hath many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
exceptions in the Scripture: ſometimes it is taken for
<hi>Goſpel Preaching,</hi> ſometimes for a viſible Church ſtate;
<hi>Mat. 13. Sometimes for that happineſs which Men and
Women (and not Infants) do enjoy through beleeving
Rom. 14. 17. The Kingdom of God is not meat or drink;
but righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
This <hi>Kingdom</hi> Infants do not enter into, although they
ſhould be Baptiſed; neither can they enter ſo long as they
continue Infants. Now if Water here do mean Baptiſme,
it will infer no more but this; that except any one be
Baptiſed he cannot enter into a <hi>Church ſtate,</hi> or he cannot
<hi>Enjoy righteouſneſs and peace, and joy, in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
Theſe are three anſwers I have for this TEXT.</p>

And where can you find in the Scripture, eſpecially in the

but <hi>Literal Water,</hi> unleſs the <hi>TEXT</hi> doe declare it to be

               <p>I anſwer firſt of all, it is no reaſon that it ſhould be
meant <hi>Literall Water</hi> here in the firſt <hi>Verſ</hi> becauſe <hi>Literall
Water</hi> is ſpoken of in the 22 and 23 <hi>Verſes:</hi> for thoſe
words are a report of what was done at another time, and
in another place: and hath no reference to this matter at
all. Secondly that the ſcripture is frequent in uſing the
word <hi>Water Allegorically,</hi> is very plain, as <hi>Eſay. 51. 1.
Come to the Waters. John 4. 10. He would have given
thee Living Water.</hi> And as I deny not but in the places
alledged by you, Water is taken Literally: ſo may it be
evidenced that it is very frequent in the ſcriptures to take
Water Miſtically, and the ſence in this place will be very
good, with this interpretation. Thirdly, whereas you ſay
that all ancient writers were of this mind, even <hi>Tertullian</hi>
himſelf. I ſay that cannot be, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſhould be
of your mind, that Infants could not be ſaved without
Water Baptiſme: for he himſelf (who was the firſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                  <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> never once mentioned Infants Baptiſme:
for <hi>Tertullian,</hi> I do not ſay he ſayth in ſo many words,
that Infants Baptiſme is Unlawfull: But in a Sermon of
his, intituled <hi>Qui ſunt Baptizandi,</hi> Who are to be Baptiſed:
He indeavours to perſwade Parents to keep their Children
from Baptiſme, untill they were Capable of it: <hi>You will not</hi>
ſayth he, <hi>Truſt them with Earthly treaſures, untill they
know how to uſe them; why then will you truſt them
with the Heavenly?</hi> (ſpeaking of Baptiſme:) and ſayth he
<hi>Fiant Chriſtiani cum Chriſtum noſſe potuerint:</hi> Let them
be made Chriſtians when they are able to know Chriſt:
And one thing more I muſt tell you, that when I did firſt
read this Sermon of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> I met with one paſſage
which I did not underſtand; neither could I make any ſence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114788:9"/>
of it: wherefore I conſulted one that had written notes
upon <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and he plainly confeſſeth that thoſe words
were added by him to this end: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Authoris ſententiam
mitigarem,</hi> That might qualifie the Opinion of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
concerning Baptiſme: where you ſee what fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
we have had with the writings of the Ancients:
when an <hi>Index expurgatorius</hi> hath paſſed upon them, and
expunged (by confeſſion) many hundred ſentences: and

               <p>I can make it plain out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that he alloweth
the <hi>Baptiſme of Infants,</hi> in caſe of neceſſitie, and danger
of death: Beſides it is known <hi>Tertullian</hi> was an Heretique
and died an Heretique. But I ſhall refer to the Auditors
what hath been ſaid unto this argument. You have ſaid
any one, doth not include all, and that water is not Literall

And whereas you ſeem to imply that the Apoſtles ſhould

               <p>I will prove that Infants are Gods ſervants, and that
he owns them for his ſervants, and calls them his ſervants;
and therefore they muſt neceſſarily be Baptiſed, in regard
they can do him no ſervice at all, but by being Baptiſed.
The proof of this is <hi>Levit. 25. 42. They are my ſervants
which I brought forth of the Land of Egypt.</hi> That is the
Children, as well as Men, and Women: for here the Lord
renders a reaſon of his command, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the Year of

are my <hi>Servants, whom I brought out of the Land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
He ſpeaks of reall ſervice, ſuch as Bondmen do
perform towards their Maſters: now if it be required in
a ſervant to do his Maſter ſervice, and Infants can do no
other ſervice; Then it will follow, that Infants muſt and
ought to be Baptiſed.</p>

               <speaker>Oppo.</speaker>
               <p>That is juſt nothing, they Eat and Drink and Sleep; this

            <sp>
               <speaker>Reſ.</speaker>
               <p>It is good ſervice for a ſervant to be quiet and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,  when and where nothing is required: it is diſſervice
to be buſy and doing when the Maſter requires nothing:
whereas you ſay they Eat and Drink &amp;c. I ſay therein
they are Gods ſervants, and that is the ſervice God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Oppo.</speaker>
               <p>God ſpeaks of real ſervice, ſuch as Bondmen require
from ſervants: will any imagin a Bondman ſerves his
Maſter, that Eats and Drinks and doth nothing elſe? This
is ſtrange ſervice.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Keſ.</speaker>
               <p>Surely Eating and Drinking by Infants is a reall ſervice;
ſuch as Maſters do require, and all that they do require of
their Infant-ſervants: and this proveth very advantageous
for the Maſters profit. Suppoſe I buy a ſervant an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
for Ten ſhillings, this Infant Eats and Drinks, and
thereby grows in ſtature, and I ſell him for Ten pound:
was not his Eating and Drinking reall ſervice? Doth not
the <hi>Ox</hi> in the paſture do the Maſter as reall ſervice (though
he do nothing but Eat and Drink) as the <hi>Ox</hi> that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
dayly at the <hi>Plough?</hi> There will not be any thing
gained by this Argument, untill you can make it appear
that the Eating and Drinking which is performed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
is no ſervice of God.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Oppo.</speaker>
               <p>I will proceed to another argument: <hi>2. Cor. 5. 14, 15.
If one dyed for all, then were all dead: And that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live
unto themſelves, But unto him who dyed for them, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114788:12"/>
roſe again.</hi> It is plain from hence that all Infants were
dead, if Chriſt dyed for them: for thus the Apoſtle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:<hi>If Chriſt dyed for all, then were all dead:</hi> But he
dyed for all, and therefore for Infants, as well as others;
Therefore Infants were dead as others.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Reſ.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs <hi>all were dead:</hi> But what this makes to the

the cloud; and all paſſed thorow the Sea: And were all
Baptiſed unto Moſes in the cloud, and in the Sea: And
did all eat the ſame Spirituall meat: And did all drink the
ſame Spirituall drink: (for they drank of that Spirituall
Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Chriſt.)
But with many of them God was not well pleaſed; for
they were overthrown in the Wilderneſs. Now theſe
things were our Examples,</hi> or <hi>Types</hi> or <hi>Figures,</hi> and in
the <hi>11. verſ. All theſe things hapned unto them for Types.</hi>Here you ſee their Baptiſme was a type of our Baptiſme. In
that Baptiſme Men Women and Children were Baptiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Moſes in the Sea: for it is ſaid, they did all <hi>Eat and Drink

really or corporally preſent in the Sacrament. 5.
That the Sacrament was not a Sacrifice to be offered
to God. 6. That Prayers and Alms made, and given
by the living, did not profit the dead. 7. That Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

               <p>I urge the reaſon of the Apoſtle, which if it hold good
in that it will alſo hold good in this: if the Covenant made
with <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be diſanulled; then alſo muſt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made with Adam, before his fall, be much more
diſanulled; in aſmuch as it hath as great an opoſition. I ſhall
eaſily prove that Covenant to be taken away: If no Man
in the World neither is nor ſhall be judged by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
then it is wholely taken away: But no Man either is
or ſhall be Judged by that Covenant: Therefore it is taken
away.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114788:24"/>
who have not been accuſtomed to wet their feet in
water? I remember <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> writes, that it is very
dangerous; And many thereby are likely to periſh, if
they ſhould not miraculouſly be preſerved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B</speaker>
               <p>I acknowledge <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> to be a Learned
Man in many things; But herein he betrayes his
ſcience: and I am afraid, his conſcience likewiſe:
As touching ſcience, it is eaſy to prove that dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Beleevers, is not ſo dangerous, as dipping
of Infants: yet dipping of Infants was not only
Commanded by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but alſo
generally practiſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> till
the year 1600. yea in ſome places it was practiſed
untill the year 1641. untill the faſhion altered. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
I can make it manifeſt that dipping either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
or Beleevers, is not ſo dangerous as Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Infants: and yet they ſprinkle them at all
times, Night and Day, and Winter and Summer.
And had <hi>M. Baxter</hi> known this to be true, he
would have told where and when any Beleever
was killed, and by whom; that ſo he might have
brought an <hi>Odium</hi> upon the Practiſe: But he gives
us not one inſtance that I know. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
I ſhall tell you my obſervation of many
hundreds, that I have known Baptiſed; of both
Sexes, of all ſorts: Old, Young, feeble perſons,
Women great with child: I never knew any that
had the leaſt harm, or ſuffered any damage in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of health. I have heard many confeſs they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
much benefit in reſpect of their Bodies;
But I never heard any complain, neither did I
ever know any (I ſpeak it to the praiſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114788:24"/>
of God) that died within one year after
they were Baptiſed: excepting one mayd in <hi>Eſſex,</hi>
who died within a few weeks; and <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi>
brethren inſtigated, and ſpurred the Magiſtrate,
untill the perſon Baptiſing her, was ſent to priſon
for Murther, laid in Irons, Arrainged at the Bar,
at the Aſſizes holden at <hi>Chelmford.</hi> And although
witneſſes came in (the one whereof was her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
and teſtified that ſhee was in better health,
then ſhee had been, for ſome years before, for
divers dayes; and that ſhee walked comfortably
abroad; yet the Jury was informed that he was
guilty of <hi>Wilfull Murder.</hi> And had not his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
ſtood him in ſtead, he had been in danger of
his Life. But when he had appealed, neither
<hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor <hi>People</hi> durſt proſecute him any more.</p>
               <p>If therefore <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> and his Brethren could
prove what they affirm to be true; how great the
Cry would be, you may proportionably judge, by
this one ſtory: The whole matter whereof, with
all the circumſtances, are worthy to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Preſs: <hi>ad perpetuam rei memoriam:</hi> That
after ages may take notice what manner of perſons
we live in the midſt of; who Preach, Write, and
Print; that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> are bloudy.</p>
               <p>I have a little more to ſpeak to <hi>Mr. Baxter:</hi> that
if there were ſuch danger in the Dipping of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
as he pretends: It muſt needs be that the
Adminiſtrator muſt be in greater perill then the
Receiver: Foraſmuch as the Baptiſed goeth into
the water but once, the Baptiſt often: where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times he ſtayes the time untill divers perſons
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114788:25"/>
are Baptiſed, if the danger be ſo great, it need not
to be feared that the Sect ſhould greatly increaſe:
by reaſon that the Teachers, will ſoon deſtroy
themſelves. But I can ſhew <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> an old
Man in <hi>London,</hi> who hath laboured in the Lords
Poole many years; converted by his Miniſtry (as
an Inſtrument in the hand of the Lord) more Men
and Women then <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> hath in his pariſh;
yea, when he hath laboured a great part of the day
in Preaching, and Reaſoning, his refection hath
been (not a <hi>Sack-poſſit</hi> or a <hi>Cawdle)</hi> but to go into
the water, and Baptiſe Converts: And he liveth,
when younger and wary perſons have gone to the
grave before him. I wonder that <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>
ſhould forget what he hath read in Authours,
which he deems Authentike: who write, that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbert</hi>
King of <hi>Kent,</hi> with Ten thouſand Men and
Women, were Baptiſed in <hi>Canterbury;</hi> upon the
25th. day of <hi>December,</hi> in the year 597.</p>

               <speaker>A</speaker>
               <p>The Providence of God appears to be very great in
this caſe: as if the Lord did puropſely intend to ſtop
the mouths of <hi>Clamorous adverſaries:</hi> yet I beleeve
he will not acknowledge it to be any miracle, for he will
not willingly grant, that God works miracles among
the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> But did not the Opponent declare
that he had more arguments; which he intended to
have urged? I would willingly hear them.</p>

               <p>You ſhall hear them: That Doctrine which
leaveth power in the hands of Men to kill ſoules,
without their own conſent, cannot be of God: But
the Doctrine, of Infants Baptiſme (as the Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
layes it down) Leaveth power in the hands of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114788:25"/>
Men to kill ſoules without their conſent: therefore
the Doctrine of Infant Baptiſme, laid down by the
Reſpondent, is not of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A</speaker>
               <p>I think the major cannot be denyed, in regard the
Scripture ſaith, Men are not able to kill the ſoule
<hi>Math.</hi> 10. 28. The minor therefore remains to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B</speaker>
               <p>If men have power by his Doctrine to deprive
ſoules of ſalvation; then they have power to kill
ſoules.</p>
               <p>But by this Doctrine, Men have power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
ſoules of ſalvation: therefore (by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine)
Men have power to kill ſoules: The minor is
proved, by the grounds which are laid down, <hi>viz.
Baptiſme is ſo abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, that
no Child can be ſaved without it.</hi> Now we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Parents can and do withhold Baptiſme from
their Children, and thereby (according to his
Doctrine) they kill the ſoules of their Children:
<hi>For he that depriveth us of the meanes, doth deprive
us of the end.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A</speaker>
               <p>I will not undertake the anſwer of this argument:
Becauſe I know not what to ſay to it; <hi>I</hi> leave it for
them that can: I pray you proceed to another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B</speaker>
               <p>That Doctrine which maketh the commands of
Chriſt to be more obſcure, then the commands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by <hi>Moſes;</hi> is not of God: But the Doctrine
of Infant Baptiſme maketh the commands of
Chriſt more obſcure then the commands delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Therefore the Doctrine of Infant
Baptiſme is not of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:114788:26"/>
That Chriſt ſpeaks more plain then <hi>Moſes,</hi>
theſe Scriptures teſtifie, <hi>John 1. 16, 17. Heb. 2. 3.
Chapters, 2. Cor.</hi> 3. from the 6th to the 15 verſe.</p>
               <p>Now it evidently appears that <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered
ordinances plainly and evidently, even in the
ſmalleſt things: he was very punctuall according
to all the form ſhewed in the Mount. If then the
Baptiſme of Infants be a thing of ſo great weight,
ſo abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation of them; How
can it be imagined that it ſhould have been wholly
left out of the Scripture, and not a word of it to
be found: as the defenders themſelves confeſs?
but only by conſequence; and this age is aſhamed
of the conſequences, that pleaſed former ages:
and bring new and unheard of ſequels, to confirm
what they cannot find in plain terms delivered.</p>
               <p>A third argument is this: That Doctrine and
practiſe which begets queſtions that cannot be
anſwered; and is upheld by practiſes which are
ridiculous, is not of God: But ſuch is the Doctrine
and practiſe of Infant Baptiſme: therefore it is not
of God. The queſtions and doubts are theſe
chiefly.

The <hi>Godfather</hi> anſwers, Yea: for this
Child: when the Child hath not any deſire. This
is ſo Ridiculous, that our new Reformers are quite
aſhamed of it, and have ſent the <hi>Antique</hi> faſhion
out of dores: and caſhired the <hi>Godfathers</hi> and
<hi>Godmothers.</hi> There were of old (even of the ſame
antiquity with Infants Baptiſme:) Men that did
not ſpare to Baptiſe dead Men: ſo great a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
did poſſeſs the minds of ſome in the ſecond
and third <hi>Centuries:</hi> The mode was thus; the
dead man lieth upon the bed: A living man
creeps under the bed: the <hi>Prieſt</hi> demands of the
dead man, whether he repents? whether he deſire
to be Baptiſed? The living man anſwers from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the bed, for the dead man; Yea, I do repent,
I do beleeve; I deſire to be Baptiſed; after
which they proceeded to Baptiſe the dead man:
And Scripture they alledged for the Collouring
of this abſurdity, 1. <hi>Cor. 15. 29. Why are they then
Baptiſed for the dead:</hi> and peradventure they
might ſay, it was as plain as any could be brought
for the Baptiſme of Infants. This was about the
year 180. ſo ſoon had men perverted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of Chriſt, and were become Strangers to
his wayes.</p>
