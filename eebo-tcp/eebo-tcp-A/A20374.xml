            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

made mee conclude this generall <hi>Thesis</hi> common to all estates, that <hi>peace is to be preferred before warre,</hi> I will come to an <hi>Hipothesis</hi> proper to the state of England: wher most part of the wealth of the land, and reuenewes of the crowne growe by traffique and intercourse, and whereas almost all traffique is interrupted by the warres, where state in largenesse of territorie and wealth which is the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of warre, is inferiour to that of the enemie: where besides all forraine warres, there is yet besides a great fire of rebellion vnquenched, where associats in warre giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the quarrell, neigbours are suspected neutrals, and shew ill affection, and the people themselues growe weary of the chardge and miserie of warres, there of all places peace should be imbraced, if it be offered and sought for by honourable and fit meanes, if it may be accomplished, But though warres bee diseases, yet I thinke it better to suffer some sicknesse, then to venture vppon euery medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: But to trust an enemies faith, when his perfidie shal vndoe, or extremely indanger vs, and infinitely aduantage himselfe, were <hi>Medicum haeredem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To conclude, as an vnskilfull Phisition may by weakening a naturall bodie, with his medicines bring it from tertian or quartan feuer into an hectique, so an vnprouident statesman may with conditions or treatie, so disarme a state of the friendes reputation, and the strength it hath, as the cure will proue farre worse the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If these reasons were not sufficient to warrant my course, yet consider what choice I had, or what else could I haue done with myselfe, In the court I had small grace and few friends: In mine own house in the country I had not liued a yeere, till the opinion of the worlde obraided mee, with more retirednesse then was fit for my yeares, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time: And to haue gone to trauell, when my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try sent out so great an armie, had bin as much as to haue turned ouer bookes onely to gaze at the babies and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, whilst others were studying the sence.</p>
            <p>For to iustifie my going into <hi>Portugal,</hi> I must plead these circumstances, First, of the person, with whom I went: A poor distressed exiled king, whom I had herd of tentimes repeate the storie of his owne oppressions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:25341:3"/>Secondly, of the enemies against whom I went: An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, cruell, and vsurping nation, that disturb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d the common peace, aspired to the conquest of my countrey, and was a generall enemie to the libertie of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, of the cause in which I went: to deliuer the oppressed out of the handes of the oppressors, and by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the <hi>Spaniard</hi> his handfull at home, to free both mine owne countrey, and our confederats, from the feare and daunger of his attempts.</p>
            <p>And lastly, of the time in which I went. A time when mine eyes full of disdaine, had so lately seene their falsly called inuincible <hi>Armado</hi> saile by our shores, when all the braue heartes of this kingdome boyled, till they sawe that insolent enemie taught both to knowe himselfe, and to value vs. And when my heart was perswaded by both these circumstances, I engaged my meanes, kinsfolkes, friendes, and followers, else neither the aduenture had beene made vp, nor the iourney perfourmed, It being no allowed action of her Maiesties, but a mere aduenture of priuate men. And when I was so farre in, I confesse I was not of their humour, that loue to wager vpon other mens hances, or sit at home like merchants, whilst their hopes and goodes are ventured abroad.</p>
            <p>For my going without charge, or leaue, I must auowe, the one, as out of counsell and excuse, the other, as by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. I chose to goe without charge, that I might bee free to execute the lesse: I commanded not, that I might not be obnoxious to the successe, and because I had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne the vioage, If I had stood vpon the commission. And I could take no second place, hauing before the same time and in the same army had place aboue the generall. But though I had no chardge, yet I made my brother ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the horse, and my faithfull friend Syr <hi>Roger Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s</hi> colonell generall of the infantry, 7. or 8 of my fast friendes colonels, and 20. at the least of my domestickes,
<pb facs="tcp:25341:4"/>
captaines, so as I might haue authoritie and party enough when I would. For my want of leaue I must plead neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, her Maiestie hauing resolued to sende none of my qualitie, and many at home shewing enuie inough to those poore gent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that were named, which made me fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see with what successe I should haue sued for leaue.</p>
            <p>For my conducting her Maiesties forces to the French King in 92. I must alledge, that the sending of the succours was resolued on before my name was in question. And if I had not offered myselfe to the iourney, some other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man that neuer had place in the warres, might (as the phrase is in the common law) haue beene promoted <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> leape ouer my head. Also I felt that my fortune had bred mee enuie, and that enuie procured mee strong and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous opposition, and this opposition would not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caryed, but by her Maiesties great fauour, and that the greatnesse of her Maiesties fauour, must growe out of the greatnesse of her seruantes merite: and I sawe no way of merite lie so open to me, as by my seruice in the warres, the times themselues and my owne beginning fitting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and at that time none of my countrey, of my rancke disposing himselfe that way: If besides all this it be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that I went to a king, who for his admirable valour, and often fighting with his owne handes, was not onely the most famous king, but also the most redoubted Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all Christendome.

            <p>But perhaps in these actions, wherein either I had no charge at all, or was commaunded by others, or offered
<pb facs="tcp:25341:4"/>
myselfe to the seruice, when the imploiment was before resolued on, I hauing no parte or interest in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, my Apologie will be the better allowed of, then in my two last Sea iourneyes, wherein I am charged to bee the authour of the counsell, aswell as the executor of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, wherefore first for the first.</p>
            <p>For the counsell of going into <hi>Spaine,</hi> I protest I had no more parte in that, then my L. <hi>Treasurer,</hi> my L. <hi>Admirall,</hi> and master <hi>Secretary,</hi> who were all priuie from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and did assent, and aduice to the iourney as much as I did, her Maiestie did first moue for the defensiue, vppon intelligence that the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> did both purpose and prepare to assaile her, finding that she did strengthen the low countries, and fortisie against him, molested him in his <hi>Indies,</hi> choaked him by Sea: So that his counsell resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that to be the shortest and easiest way to all his ends, to begin with <hi>England.</hi> And when her Maiestie was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and able to take the starte, it was thought both a wise and safe counsell, not to lease so great, and so faire an opportunitie. For the proiect of going to <hi>Cadz</hi> I haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer confessed it was my Lord <hi>Admirals</hi> my colleagues. If any man will single me out to chardge me alone with any thing, it must needs be that whè all the charg of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was past the armie leauied &amp; marching to the <hi>Rande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous,</hi> and the low countrey fleete that was to ioine with vs in the way, that then I was as constant in the iourney, as I had bin all the while before when I might haue sold the honour of my Soueraigne, the securitie of my countrey, the contentment of our confederates, the hopes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most whole fortunes of hundreds of my friendes that I had drawne into that iourney, for some priuate gaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to myselfe.

And when I was possessed of <hi>Cadz,</hi> I offered to stay with 3. or 4000. men, if that whole fleete could haue furnished vs but with three moneths victuals, witnesse the whole counsell of warre. And by these means I doubted not to haue brought the warres in those partes to a shorte ende, and also to haue made the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> weary of seeking to dislodg me: But my letters was ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answered nor liked here, nor I at <hi>Cadz</hi> able to feede my selfe, and the men of warre, till a supply might haue come. So that except to bee of that minde my fellowes were, that were called to councel, or to haue ioyned with my Lord <hi>Admirall</hi> when he offered to take an equall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of commaundement with me, both by Sea, and by land, to haue sought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

My first, chiefest, and
<pb facs="tcp:25341:6"/>
maine designe being to assayle the <hi>Adelantado</hi> in <hi>Farroll: Farroll</hi> was the <hi>Randeuous</hi> I gaue, to <hi>Farroll</hi> I directly sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped my course: and at <hi>Farroll</hi> I had mastered the fleet, that lay there whole yeares threatning my countrey, or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that armie into the hils, or sacrificed my selfe. The causes frustrating this designe, were first the violent long tempest, which tooke vs in the height of 46. scattered our fleete, disinabled and almost drowned most of our principall shippes, And when we could no longer beate it vp against the winde, draue vs backe vppon our owne coast: Next that vnreasonable stormie weather, which kept vs a moneth after we were put backe from attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to goe foorth againe: and lastly our wantes, which forced vs to discharge our whole land armie sauing 1000. men, for mine owne excuse how long I dured ere I turned backe, and to what desperate case I brought my shippes, there bee witnesses enough. Also her Maiestie and her counsell know, what proffer of seruice I made her, when I came vp post from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> accompanied with Syr <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rawleigh,</hi> if shee would but haue let me gone, but with halfe the fleete, and lesse then half the land armie to such place as my selfe and the counsell of warre had chosen for to be. sure the enemie and not her Maiestie should feele the waight and charge of the iourney.

Nor troopes of souldiers cannot limit it, for there will be nothing to pay them, when any thing aboue the kings ordinarie is demanded of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it will be answered, is not he our enemie? Why doe wee acknowledge him as our prince? Is he our prince? Why doe we stand out against him as against an enemie? besides all low strangers besides, and the enemie will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse vpon any sodaine by force, for his meanes depend vpon himselfe, the others vpon the will of a people that will be glad to spaie the purse, when they see present wars, and the enemies number will be farre greater then the States, banish straungers on both sides, yet the enemie shall be strengthened with espaniolized <hi>Netherlandes,</hi> and the states defended but by such as shall take oathe to the enemie. Stipulation of other princes cannot limit it, for the state wilbe oppressed on the suddaine, when their helpes will come too late, and those princes that were glad to make peace, when the enemie was weake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnited, and the low countries flourishing, will not begin a new quarrell, when the enemies strength is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, themselues deuided, and the lowe countries lost. Yet those that I haue named are the least assurances, that
<pb facs="tcp:25341:11"/>
either our peace makers can pro pound, or the vnited pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces receiue, I wil adde further, that as it is certaine, no peace is to be had with the vnited prouinces, except a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne be acknowledged: so is it with out all doubt that there can be no peace concluded, except popish religion, be either vniuersally established, or else freely exercised in the townes and prouinces where nowe it is banished, Allowe the first, that they banish Gods true seruice, to bring in idolatrie, the leaue truth to receiue faslhood, they refuse the protection of the most merciful god in heauen, to win the fauour of the most tirannical prince in the erth, Allowe the second you bring in a pluralitie of religions, which is no lesse crime, and which is against the pollicie of all states, because where there is not vnitie in the Church, there can be no vnitie nor order in the state, for as the mingling of poyson with wholesome liquor in one vessell, doth not corrupt that which is <hi>Letheal,</hi> but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that which is wholesome, so the poysoned doctrine of these espaniolized <hi>Iesuites</hi> once brought in, will quickly leaue no one professour in al the vnited prouinces. So that I conclude it were both folly and impietie, for them to make any such peace, or for vs to drawe them to it, yea more folly in vs, then euer was committed in any state. For what will not the enemie be able to doe vpon vs, when besides the forces he now hath, he shall haue a countrey in his handes able to find him 60000. or 80000. souldiers, 500. shippes of warre, besides insinite numbers of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting vessels, and commodious Portes that are but a dayes sayling from the very heart of <hi>England.</hi> But the low countries shall be giuen to the Infant, shee marryed to the Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> and so that state deuided from the crowne of <hi>Spaine</hi> in a farte safer hand.

strength I meane aswell the strength of the gouernours to force the people if they bee aduerse, as the strength and sufficiencie of their meanes to endure so great and so sharpe a warre, as will fall vppon them.) Of the chiefe gouernours resoluing there, may be these doubtes, that they shall be tempted by the enemies offers, who if he can wil purchase the seuerally, that he may reduce them vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally. And that they shall be terrified with the danger of counsell, for it soundes both harshly aforehand, and is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e to fal out vnsuccessinely at the first, the enemie being so much maister of the fields as some place will be caried. I know they doe pretend to be resolute one way, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against giuing eare to treatie, but that may be eyther to moue vs by example or to make vs to leaue pressing of them to a treatie, or to seeme to hold out to the last that we may seeme rather to haue vndone them, then they to vndoe themselues. But if they vpon mature deliberation should chuse the continuance of the warres as the lesse of the two euils, yet that they people will be like affected it is not probable, for when a people that hath been long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yted with the miserie of the war, shall heare the pleasing name of peace, when they that had two mightie Princes ioyned with them in a straight defensiue and offensiue league, shall see themselues abandoned first by <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and then by <hi>England,</hi> when one the one side for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the warres, they shall haue newe and great contributions demaunded of them, and one the other side they shall be offered all plausible conditions of peace, nay when they shall see <hi>England</hi> by making peace, get the trade of <hi>Spaine</hi> from them, and they alone by standing out, shall be barred of that Nauigation which hath made them so mightie in shipping, and so encreased in wealth and riches, what then the multitude is like to chuse, is it not easie to iudge? And if the people be not conformable of themselues, how by the authoritie of the gouernours of the state (which are called the generall states) they may
<pb facs="tcp:25341:13"/>
be forced I doe not see, First because it is not an absolute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and necessary, but a limited and voluntarie obedience which they yeelde. Secondly because the state hath not (as the state of <hi>Rome</hi> had, and the state of <hi>Venice</hi> hath) one place that as the head doth commaund and direct all the partes of the body, but is compounded of equal parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Zealand</hi> is as absolute as <hi>Holland, Friseland</hi> as eyther of them, yea not onely the least prouince, but the least town holdes it selfe to haue a kinde of Soueraigntie, and will haue as free a voyce as the greatest. Thirdly because of the former manner of proceedinges, which hath not byn to send commaundementes to binde, but deputies to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade: not to resolue and conclude in the greatest cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in any one counsell, or assembly, but to sound and feele the disposition of euery prouince, and so to winne them to like of that they haue deuised of. And l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stly because that euen amongst themselues, they are for the time ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall states, there is not like to be vnanimitie in opinion, and then though they that dissent (being sewe) will not beare the enuie to stande in counsell against the greater parte, yet it is easie for them, when they come home to worke in the particular prouinces and townes, such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust of that which shall be generally propounded to all, as the resolution will sticke, and the whole businesse bee ouerthrowne, it being vnsafe for them to denie libertie of voyce to any, such libertie being the true cause of their taking armes, and standing out against the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. But admit both by the gouernours of state and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it were resolued that the low Countries alone should remaine in war, how are their meanes, or is their strength like to maintayne warre. Of all forraine helpe they are vtterly destitute, <hi>Fraunce</hi> makes no diuersion, <hi>England</hi> can yeeld no succours, and in all Christendome their is no other prince or state likely or able to back them. Their owne meanes and abilitie grow either by the fruit of the earth, or by traffique and merchandise, for the fruites of
<pb facs="tcp:25341:13"/>
the earth, that meanes is like to be but small, for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being maister of the fields, and able to deuide his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into diuerse places, will euery day eyther winne from them, part of that they hould, or at the least, so infecte those partes that are already in the <hi>States</hi> obedience, as except it bee in <hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>Zealand,</hi> which the enimie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet come vnto, the husbandrie will bee ill followed, and yealde little profitte. And as for their meanes by traffique, it is vnlikely that merchauntes, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue their dwellinge, to peaceable places nere hande, where they may haue safe and free trade, will remayne in the <hi>Low Countreies,</hi> which onely is in warre, of all these partes of Christendome: and if they keepe their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet will the <hi>Spaniarde</hi> without doubt banish them the trade into <hi>Spaine,</hi> when both <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Easterlinges</hi> shall supply him, and will seeke both to banish and impeach them of other trade, as much as hee can, pretending that they are now the onely perturbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of the peace of Christendome. So as I conclude, when I thinke with myselfe what the gouernours of the state of the vnited prouinces are like to resolue, what the people in generall will be like to desire, howe hardly the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will be forced against their liking, or the meanes of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> make them subsist to themselues, I see nothing but danger that the enemie will shortly and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dély be master of all the country: which how it importeth vs to preuent, it hath bin before made plain. I will now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what conditions we are like to haue for our selues, so we wil forsake our confederats, restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of places we can not demand, as <hi>Fraunce</hi> did, for the enemie holds none of ours. Reparation of damage we can as little seeke for, for from him we haue sustained no losse. And trade into the <hi>Indies</hi> our zealous peacemakers wil not stand for, least the enemie offended wil grant no peace. Traf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ique into <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> we shall haue, and that is the onely condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that carries any shewe of aduantage to vs. But if we
<pb facs="tcp:25341:14"/>
consider howe greedie our merchantes will be of such a trade at first, and how easie it will be for a faith breaking enemie to confiscate all our countrimens goodes, and to embarge and vse <hi>English</hi> shipping against <hi>England,</hi> wee would not bragge to much of this aduantage. But on the other side he will require alteration in our gouernment, or in the execution of our lawes for matters of religion, deliuering vp the townes her Maiestie hath in the <hi>Loue Countries,</hi> and reparation of all the damages susteyned in the wars. The first is a condition only for a conquerour to impose, and vnfitte for a braue state (that in all the wars heretofore hath had the better) once to heare mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The second should neuer be asked of a Queene so iust, as shee will not yeald vp the keyes of a countrey, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by her best confederates, into the handes of her greatest enemies, nor of a prince so wise, as shee will not adde strength to him, whose strength alreadie shee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth so much suspected, nor inable him to inuade, whose ambition and malice thirsteth after inuasion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. The third condition is vnpossiblè to be graunted, for the losse the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath receiued in these wars, amounteth to a greater summe then the treasure of al the kings in Christendome. If It be asked how I knowe that these conditions will be demaunded, I answere, I learne <hi>Albertus</hi> mind of <hi>Albertus</hi> himselfe, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions out of the instruction giuen to the <hi>Spanish</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners If it be sayd though in the intercepted letters and instructions, such conditions were to bee asked but neuer meant, they should be insisted vpon, I answere, that in the instruction to the <hi>Spanish</hi> commissioners, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly set downe in the first and third condition: the lega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e shall be pressed to vrge the <hi>French</hi> king, to stand with them in obtayning them: and for the second, if the <hi>English</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners doe cut of all hope of deliuering the townes, that then the treatie shall instantly breake of, which is as much as if he should say, except <hi>England</hi> will giue vs the
<pb facs="tcp:25341:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
keyes of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> whereby we may reduce them, and let vs haue the Port of <hi>Flushing</hi> in which our Galleys may winter, and from which we may set out our fleete for the conquest of <hi>England</hi> whensoeuer we will breake, wee will haue no peace with <hi>England</hi> at this time. But if it be graunted that the <hi>Low Countries</hi> wil maintaine the wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and that <hi>Spaine</hi> will grant vs good conditions so we wil abandon the states, how wil it appear that it is possible for vs betwixt these two to hold a neutralitie. If we do not the vnited prouinces some fauour vnderhand, at least by letting them be serued by such of our nation, as will vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily offer themselues vnto them, their state cannot be maintained, nor they kept our friendes whom we suffer to perish. On the other side, if we doe them in this kinde or any other, any fauour which shall keepe them from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, we giue the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and the Archduke a newe quarrell, and so make them of new become our enemies. Besides her Maiestie hath bestowed in the action in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> at the least 4 millions of crownes, and shee hath in pawne for the debt which the states owe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, the townes of <hi>Flushing</hi> and the <hi>Brill:</hi> to reimburse that which is due, and to maintaine the warres the states are vnable, to deliuer the townes without reimbursement were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to loose all the treasure spent, and the authoritie and bridle which her Maiestie hath vpon that people, which is one of the greatest securities of her state: to keepe them (especially <hi>Flushing</hi>) and to remaine in new treatie in my vnderstanding seems altogether vnpossible, for when the enemie shall see that neither by treatie, nor offer of his large conditions, the states will be wonne, he will assayle them by force, yea he will take that way which will bee shortest and easiest for the reduction of the whole, which will be to bring his Galleys into the riuers, and to transport men into the Ilandes, for so by peircing into <hi>zeland,</hi> he shall make his way into <hi>Holland,</hi> and if hee haue once good sooting in these 2. prouinces, he is straight ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

But iniurious are these to the men of warre that fight for them, and defend them, in thinking our Armes which haue euer done honour to our countrey, stricken terrour to the heartes of our enemies, lesse able to defend our countrey, then their treaties which haue neuer beene free from scorne and disaduantage. Iniurious are they to the countrey which bredde them, which being one of the brauest, strongest, and happiest states of Christ endome, is iudged by these men as weak as their owne weake hearts, Iniurious they are to her Maiestie who hath ruled them, who being so great, so glorious, so victorious a Queene, shall be iudged vnable to maintaine warre, when she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue peace but at the pleasure of her enemie.

But of this question, whether we should think the peace good for vs, which the peacemakers wil procure I haue stood long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. I come now to the last question of all, whether they doe enter into the treatie of it with due circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. My purpose is not to deale with complementall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, or the <hi>Pantilios</hi> of honour (though I iudge them in their proper time and place worthy of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration) but the materiall circumstances which any prince or state should waigh before they enter into trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I iudge to be these. The time of treating, whether it yeald most aduantage for peace or warre. The persons of the treators, whether or no the enemy with whom we treate may make aduantage by pretence, if nothing be concluded. The assurance of the treatie, or strength of the knette which is tyed, and the state and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wee are like to be in, whensoeuer it breakes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>olues. The onely reason which they that would haue peace do vse to proue that this season is fittest, and yealds most aduantage for peace, is, that now the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> is so weake and poore, that he will be brought to that, which he neyther would heretofore, nor will hereafter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer agree vnto. Therefore say they this is the onely time for peace, but sure except they were better <hi>Logicians</hi> or could frame better arguments, I would scarse wish them to be trusted with arguing for a treatie. The conclusion is directly contradictory to their owne proposition: for is he now vnablest of all times to encounter vs in warre? then is this of all times the fittest season to make warre. Is this the season he chuseth to recouer himselfe by peace? then of all times peace now should least be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now, now is the fittest time to make warre vpon the

               <hi>Spaniard,</hi> his losses are not recouered, his coffers are not filled, his fleete not made, his Sea prouisions not supplied, his Indies not quiet, his sonne in law in new Soueraignty not setled. But her Maiesties late batteries haue made way to her greater and higher attemptes: Terror accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the powerfulnesse of her Armies, feare possesseth the heartes of her enimies, and God himselfe by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse hath iudged her cause: All the world hath seene what hath happened, and the actions past. The common conclusion is, <hi>Victrix causa, quia dijs placuit.</hi> So on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, now of all times is the vnfittest season to make peace, when the state of our best confederates is so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by practise, threatned by force, and sollicited to their owne vndoing by forrayne princes, as except<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> wee both incourage them, and cleaue fast to them, their ruine is at hand. Now it is no time to make peace with the chiefe enimy of our religion, when a conspiracy is in hand, against all the professors of it The newes is too rise, and too credible, that this vndertaking <hi>Pope,</hi> after his victories so glorious in <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and his powerfull recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling of two great kinges, in the heate of so greate a war: that now he will not leaue, till he make a generall league against all such, as doe not, or will not acknowledge the omnipotency of his <hi>Bulles.</hi> Now if we shew our selues so weake, that wee follow not the aduantage we haue, wee shall hereafter be thought so weak, as we may haue any condicions bee inforced vpon vs Now if we refuse the condicions, which our friendes will offer to purchase in our constancy, wee must resolue, hereafter to take such condicious as the enimy will giue, though it bee to our losse. But if wee will needes slatter ourselues, that our agreeing to peace, when the enimy desires it, can make any sounde and durable league betwixt vs: wee shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly finde when it is too late to say, <hi>Inter victos vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores<expan>

that the pretence and beginuing to treate of peace, without concluding, is like to be very gainefull to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, and preiudiciall to vs: for if he, which now is not able to guard his Indian fleete, may but while we are tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, haue one or two returnes in safetie, if he which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer feeles the strength of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> as they are vnited, can for the present seuer them in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and affoction, as he may here after more easily deuide them in partes, If he that neuer wantes mallice, but now wantes strength, can sing vs a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then for assuring, wee giue the enimy as good as he can desire, in forbearing him when hee is weakest, and letting goe our aduantage, when it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, wee shew, that nothing can draw vs to warre, if wee may haue peace. On the other side, if a nation that yet neuer treated with vs, but to deceiue vs, and thinkes our religion but heresie, our church schismaticall, our Queene excommunicated, so as by their owne principles, they are neither to keepe faith with vs, nor let vs receiue good by a contract with them: what assurance, I say, can wee haue of such an enemie, and in such a bargaine? First to deceiue vs, and serue their owne turne, by making peace and then breaking of it, they hold it no fault. Next if they did purpose to keepe it, the <hi>Popes</hi> dispensation would take it away. And lastly if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> will keepe a shewe of good forme, and not voluntarily breake faith when his turne is serued: the <hi>Pope</hi> may to chardge him to breake with vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as conscience and obedience shal couer his malice and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when he makes them play, he will quickly after giue the assault: his fleete that now is weake, shalbe supplyed but with those Gallions he buildes, and with all the good ships of Christendome that will be bought or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, his coffers that now are emptyed, wil be so full of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as he will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
