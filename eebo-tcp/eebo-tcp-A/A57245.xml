            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HEre is preſented to thy view things new and old, when Chriſt and his diſciples declared the truth: Some mocked, ſaying? what new doctrine is this? Mark <hi>1. 27.</hi> What will this babler ſay, Acts <hi>17. 18.</hi> For thou bringeſt ſtrange things to our eares, ver. 20. and many of them ſaid he hath a devil and is mad, why hear ye him? John <hi>20. 20.</hi> When Chriſt declared the truth, the Prieſts cryed blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; the high Prieſt rent his clothes, ſaying, he hath ſpoken blaſphemys, what think ye? and they all condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to be guilty of death, Mat.

            <p>I have the teſtimony of my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the love of truth, and deſire to learn, drew me into this ſearch, and cauſed me to diſſent, not for contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but for truths ſake; the truth we

that all things that are done, are done by the will of God; and pag. 196. all confeſs, God could have hindered ſin to be if he had ſo pleaſed, but he would not hinder it, therefore it was his will it ſhould be, the will of God, and not ſin, is the cauſe of Gods decree, and the being of all things, the will and pleaſure of God is the Wombe from whence ſpringeth every work of the Creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.

God willed and decreed his glory and mans happineſs; therefore he willed and decreed the means to it: the end and moving cauſe of his willing ſin to be, is for his glory, which cauſe it was neceſſary for ſin to be; if ſinne had not been, how ſhould the goodneſs of God in giving man eternal life in glory appeared, his love in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chriſt to die? if there had not been ſinne, there had been no need of Chriſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, nor of his death and righteouſneſs; moſt of the great works of God in this world and that to come, have dependence or reference to

ſin; how ſhould we have lived by Faith, exerciſed the fruits of the Spirit, or have any happineſſe or glory in the world to come, if it had not been for Chriſt? and Chriſt had not been, if there had been no ſinne: he that willeth the end, willeth thoſe things that are neceſſarily referred to that end; taking away ſin was decreed before the world, therefore the being of ſinne was decreed; Chriſt's death was determined before the world; for the end of Chriſt was to reſtore <hi>Adam's</hi> fall; if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, there had been no need of a Chriſt to reſtore him: The Saints were choſen to life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world; choice hath reference to the fall, therefore
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34064:56"/>
the fall of Adam was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed: If the will of man had been the firſt and chief cauſe of the being of ſin, then the will of man ſhould be the cauſe of Gods will, and ſo man ſhall be the originall cauſe of the ſalvation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo much the cauſe of it, that without his will it could not have been: and ſo the determination of God what to do, ſhall not be from himſelf, but from the will of man, which is contrary to <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 11. if man ſhould will ſin before God willed it, then ſhall the will of God depend and wait upon the will of man: as if God ſhould ſay, If man will ſin, then I will will his ſalvation: and if God ſhould firſt will to

ſend Chriſt to ſave man, and leave it to mans will and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whether he ſhall fall or no, then it was poſſible for man to ſtand, and ſo to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the decree of God: for if man had not ſinned, Gods decree of ſending Chriſt had been void and of none effect: Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> if the fall was decreed, if man had power to ſtand, then he had power to fruſtrate Gods decree, which no wiſe man will affirm; and then that ſaying that <hi>Adam</hi> had power to keep the Law, is without truth; if he had, conſider <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 29, 36.

becauſe he is under no Law, God commands men to keep the Law, that no man can do; he commands men to think no vain thoughts, and not to ſin; we cannot but think ſome vain thoughts, and in many things we ſin all; Chriſt ſaith, <hi>No man can come to me except the Father draw him,</hi> John 6. 44, 37. if they be drawn they come; <hi>draw us and we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 4. if I put ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſtrength to move the earth, motion muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; when men ſin they are beguiled, enticed, deceived, drawn away, <hi>they like men have tranſgreſſed,</hi> Hoſ. 6. 7.</p>

            <p>Take for inſtance, that the fear of the torments of Hell is no ſuch preſerver againſt ſin, is evident; for thoſe that ſin with the greateſt greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the greateſt ſinners, they do believe there are hell torments; for though they be never ſo wicked, they hope it doth not belong to them; or they hope to repent and lead new lives, before they die; though they ſin for the preſent they hope to make God amends for all, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian being drunk ſaid that he was now in the ſtate of damnation, but he ſaid he would be in the ſtate of grace

            <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, he ſhould have died; this is proved,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34064:72"/>
firſt, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> in his creation had a naturall body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44. that which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural is not eternal, v. 46. (he was of the earth earthly) 57, 48. therefore mortall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, 53, 54.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Man in his firſt being was corporall and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be ſeen, things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34064:73"/>
a poſſibility to return into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if he obeyed not the will of his maker.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Man in innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy needed food, &amp;c. that which depends upon mutable and earthly things, is earthly and mutable; we ſee it in all other creatures that live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on periſhing things, at laſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; and herein man by the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> hath no preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above a beaſt: Heaven and Earth were created, therefore had a beginning; and although they have a much longer life than man, are to have an end, [Heaven and earth ſhall be diſſolved] 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had not died (Rom. 5. 12.) he ſhould have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in this world, he ſhould
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34064:73"/>
not have gone to the world to come; therefore by his fall he loſt no happineſſe nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life in that world; for he could not by that fall loſe more than he had, and was to have; death is according to nature, but to attain immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is above nature. <hi>Adam</hi> being earth and from the earth, his enjoyment, life, and loſs, and puniſhment, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be earthly; how cometh he then by his fall to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a puniſhment never to end, unleſs by his fall he could purchaſe eternall life, which none will affirm? eternall life cannot be by the firſt man, much leſs by Sin.</p>
            <p>I deny not but the <hi>wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. there is a difference to be put between
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34064:74"/>
a naturall death and a judiciall death; the firſt is from nature, the ſecond is from ſinne, if the common death that all die, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. 27. were the puniſhment of ſin, as moſt men think, then Chriſt by freeing his from the puniſhment of ſin, by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring death for them, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity he muſt free them from dying a naturall death; but Chriſt freeth not his from a natural death, yet freeth them from the puniſhment of ſin; therefore to die the common death is no part of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne: for where ſin is ſatisfied, or pardoned, or forgiven, the puniſhment is not inflicted; if it be, how is it forgiven? even men when they pardon inflict not the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34064:74"/>
puniſhment; all confeſs, ſome mens ſins are pardoned, how then cometh it to paſſe that they die for ſin, whoſe ſin is pardoned? [He that keepeth my ſaying ſhall not ſee death] <hi>John</hi> 15. 21. is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a naturall death, but to periſh, a judiciall death, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that there ſhall be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, the juſt and unjuſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15. the unjuſt would enter into life, but ſhall not, <hi>John</hi> 5. 20. [Unto whom I ſwore in my wrath, that they ſhould not enter into my reſt] <hi>Pſalm</hi> 94. 11. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 4. 7. [and your ſelves thruſt out] <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 28. when they riſe to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the laſt day, they ſhall be conſumed with the earth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34064:75"/>
by fire, that's their end; ſo that not to enter, to be thruſt out, the ſecond death, and to periſh, is one thing, if they live for ever, and have eternal life, how do they periſh? and how is the end of thoſe things death? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. if there be no end, to be carnally minded is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6. how is this true if they live for ever, and not die?</p>
            <p>Sin being a tranſgreſſion of the Law is a legall ſin, and ſo is to have a legall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for ſome ſins is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. inflicted by God, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 9, 10. and by man; a legall death is not from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but from ſin, and is a ſecond death; if a man for murder be put to death, in dying he dieth the firſt and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34064:75"/>
ſecond death, for in dying he dieth a naturall death, and a judiciall death: this later is a ſecond death, in that it is not from nature, but from ſin.</p>
            <p>Men put the ſtreſſe of the puniſhment of ſinne upon the ſecond death, but what that ſecond death is they cannot agree among themſelves; the Miniſters in their late Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the Bible on <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 9. (on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power) inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it not to be deſtroyed by Antichriſt, nor by the Turk, v. 9. ſo then according to their interpretation it is not a puniſhment never to end. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith the ſecond death is a totall ſeparation from God; if ſo, it is not a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without end, and in that

God is every where, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 7, 8. if they be any where, how are they abſent from God?</p>
            <p>If the ſecond death be a death, it is not a life of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry never to end; that is not a death, unleſs eternall life be a death; they confeſs eternall life in miſery is worſe than death; if ſo, then it is not a death, but another thing.</p>

               </gap>ſt death is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the body, a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſoul and body; the ſecond death muſt be like it; the ſecond death is an image of the firſt, elſe how is it a death, and a ſecond death? the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> being man, was an image of the firſt; the Scripture ſaith, <hi>the ſecond death is like the firſt,</hi> Luke 6. 1.

               <hi>Proof</hi> III. Their opinion of a puniſhment after this life never to end, makes not ſin, but Chriſt to be the cauſe of their ſo ſuffering: this is evident; becauſe if Chriſt had not come, there had been no Reſurection, and if no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection there could be no ſuffering of any torment after this life: for if no reſurrection they ſhould have periſhed, in the grave there had been their end, If Chriſt be not riſen, they which are fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep are periſhed] 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 17, 18. that the Reſurrection came by Jeſus Chriſt is alſo evident; for Chriſt ſaith, [I am the Reſurrection] <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 75. by man, that is, Chriſt came the Reſurrection, ver. 21. [Therefore it is called the

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34064:81"/>
not have lived for ever, and therefore not ſuffer for ever; and is it not very hard and unreaſonable, and contrary to the word to charge Chriſt to be the cauſe of their ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? ſeeing Chriſt came [in love to the world] <hi>John</hi> 16. 36. [to ſave, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy] <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 59. &amp; 19. 10. not to make any miſerable, [he came to ſave ſinners] 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Lu.</hi> 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Proof</hi> IV. The Scriptures declare what Chriſt came to do, namely, to deliver us from the hand of our enemies, <hi>Luke</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:34064:81"/>
1. 74 [to taſt death for every man] <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2. 9. See <hi>Lu.</hi> 4. 18. [the laſt enemy is death, he aboliſhed death] 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10 he hath promiſed delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from death and grave; I wil redeem thee from death, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13. 14. that keeps my ſayings ſhall not ſee death, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 51, 52. O death where is thy Sting? O grave where is thy Victory? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. I will ranſome thee from the power of the grave; he ſaith not from the torments of hell, nor from the puniſhment ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to end: O death I will be thy plagues, O grave I will be thy deſtruction, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 4. ſo that if there be a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after death and grave, there is no mention of Chriſts delivering us from that; and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34064:82"/>
in that the Scripture ſaith [He is able to ſave from death] <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 5. 7. is as much as to ſay, ſalvation from death is ſufficient, and that there is no farther thing to be delivered from than death and grave, if there were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from them had not been ſatisfactory, becauſe not ſufficient; for if there is to be a puniſhment after death, who ſhall deliver us from that? Chriſt delivereth from death and grave, no further deliverance from any thing is mentioned: therefore he hath not delivered his from more, and therefore there is no further thing to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from; ſo that ye may ſee that their opinion makes void Chriſts ſuffering, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34064:82"/>
the Saints comfort; for if a puniſhment for ever be due to man for ſinne, Chriſt muſt for ever ſuffer that torment to free us from it, or we muſt ſuffer it; the Proteſtant Writers confeſs, that the way and means that Chriſt freeth us from the puniſhment of ſin, is by his ſuffering that puniſhment we were to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: to this the Scriptures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>Galatians</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53. 4, 5, 6, 7. ſo that if Chriſt our ſurety hath not ſuffered the ſaid torments for ever, then hath not Chriſt ſuffered e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; namely, that which we were to ſuffer, and ſo not delivered us from the ſaid pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.

14. not onely to ſome men, but to all people, <hi>v.</hi> 10. this is glad tidings indeed, good news from Heaven, the beſt news that ever was, that God hath good will to men; there is no ill will, all is good will to men; this cauſeth peace and praiſe, glory be to the higheſt for his ſweet peace and good will to men, to all people.</p>
            <p>Concluſion; in reading the Scriptures we are not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand any text in ſuch ſenſe as is not plain in Scriptures, or contrary to Scriptures, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of nature, or againſt the general goodneſs of God to mankind, or to leſſen the goodneſs of God, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the gracious ſpirit and mercifulneſs of a Saint, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind of Chriſt

which he declared when on earth, or contrary to the fruits of the bleſſed Spirit, the nature of the love, goodneſs, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God; or that ſhall tend to contradict or leſſen the glory of God, or leſſen the greatneſs and riches of his grace: for it is not to be imagined that God who is onely wiſe ſhould doe and teach contrary things.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, from hence ariſe no inconveniency to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, nor is it any diſhonour to God, nor any grief, nor hinders faith and love in any good man, nor any diſcouragement to any in ſerving of God, that there is not to be a puniſhment for any to endure that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver end. There is not any thing more plaine then that which hath been ſaid to him that will

agree to truth; ſome will not agree to any thing, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo plain and certain, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the tradition of their Fathers; this their way is their folly, and their poſterity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their ſaying, Pſal. 49. 13. [who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?] Iſa. 53. 1.</p>
            <p>Some believed the things that were ſpoken, and ſome believed not, <hi>Acts 28. 29.</hi> they make a man an offender for a word, and lay a ſnare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn away the juſt for a thing of nought, <hi>Iſa. 29. 21.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O God the Lord, the ſtrength of my ſalvation, thou haſt cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my head in the day of battel, <hi>Pſal. 140. 7.</hi>
