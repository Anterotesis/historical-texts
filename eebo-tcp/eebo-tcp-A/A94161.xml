         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Amen <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> Glory, Glory for ever to the Lamb; whoſe is the Dominion over all for ever and ever. Sing and rejoyce ye Lambs, and little Ones, whoſe glory, whoſe ſtrength, whoſe deliverance, is in, through, and from God alone; whoſe expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not from the Hills and Mountains, but from God alone; ſing, I ſay, and rejoyce and ſhout for joy and gladneſs of heart, for God commeth with thouſands, and ten thouſands; nothing, nothing, nothing ſhall let the Deliverance; he will work on your behalf within and without: Sing and rejoyce ye ſingle-hearted Ones, whom nothing can ſatisfie but God alone, God alone to reign, rule in you, to be over all the Earth, and none beſides him; all fleſh laid low, humbled, blown upon, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, the glory of all fleſh ſtained. Sing and rejoyce ye little ſingle-hearted Ones; this ſhall be, and is the tendency, the plain tendency of all theſe things, is to this; Fear you not, nor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, all ye that thirſt, breath after, long for this, and yet cannot ſee it, but are ready to ſink and faint, and be diſcouraged, by letting many things, appearances, enter you; faint not, nor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, God is at hand in all theſe things, his Hand in all is over all, and will break forth through all theſe Clouds of darkneſs and confuſion, to your joy and gladneſs, even to your exceeding joy and gladneſs of heart; you ſimple ſingle-hearted Ones, who ſeek the Lord God, and not another, who ſeek, breath after the Exalting of God, and not another; who breath and groan in the Singleneſs and Simplicity, and Uprightneſs of your hearts, that all in you, and every where, that is contrary to God, may be broken down, burnt up, ſlain, without reſerve, for ever, and nothing elſe. And groan, thirſt after, breath after, pant for the day of God, to break forth in Power and great Glory, for the relieving of the Creation, that groans to be delivered, that if poſſible, all, even the worſt of men may be ſaved, delivered from the bondage of Corruption, and may come to know, feel, poſſeſs the Liberty, the Freedom of the Sons and Daughters, the Redeemed of God, and may know what they have been doing, are doing, and may do no more ſo.</p>
            <p>O ye Single-hearted, who thirſt after the Living God, whom nothing can ſatisfie but God alone, his Will to be over all eſtabliſhed, done in you; fear you not, nor be not diſcouraged, nor drawn forth in this hour, but be ſtill, and wait, and be patient, and contented in the ſtillneſs of your minds, and keep out of Appearances; for our God is at hand to execute the Vengeance written; and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance upon all accounts, lingers not, is the Word of the Lord God to all the Upright-hearted upon the face of the whole Earth, more eſpecially to any that may be under tryal, or deep temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inward or outward, whoſe hearts are ſingle and upright towards God, who love no Iniquity, who wait, pant to be perfectly delivered from all for ever, whom nothing leſs can ſatisfie, than to be <hi>free indeed,</hi> and there abide for ever; even to be freed from all Deceit and Violence, delivered <hi>from all evil,</hi> and every appearance thereof, for ever, is your deſire and expectation, even that the Will of God may perfectly take place in you, and abide in the Dominion over all, for ever.</p>

And Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſhall be ſaved from all adverſity, inward and outward. The Mouth of the Lord of Hoſts hath ſpoken it: and all that wiſh her evil, ſhall be aſhamed, diſappointed, and confounded. This is the Word of the Lord God, that ſhall ſtand for ever, over the Heads of all the avowed and ſecret heart-Enemies of Iſrael; She ſhall be built up, and not broken down. Therefore hear and fear, and conſider all ye Rebellious Ones, all ye treacherous deceitful Evil-Willers of the People whom the Lord God hath bleſt, againſt whom no Inchantments ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, no Violence, no Deceit within or without. This I do declare in the Name and Authority of the Living God, ſhall ſtand, is ſealed, for ever, Amen</hi> Hallelujah. <hi>Howl, howl ye Rebellious, tremble ye Hypocrites, be covered with ſhame, confuſion, diſappointment, ye Envious Ones: for the Lord our God reigns, and is over all for ever; and all the Sincere in heart ſhall ſee, underſtand, rejoyce in it, though many may be under miſtakes at preſent: but as ſincere, miſtakes ſeen, will not be juſtified, covered, but given up, confeſt: and theſe things God will in due time reveal. In the mean while, let patience and forbearance be the place of all, to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in tenderneſs and compaſſion towards all, eſpecially ſuch as are in a meaſure of Sincerity, in whom Deceit rules not, to wait upon ſuch, and follow them in much meekneſs and compaſſion: for to the Sincere in heart God will in due time reveal; God will not deny himſelf; Light is ſown for the Righteous and ſincere Single-hearted, even though for a time they may be under ſome miſtakes in ſome things, yea, even in many things ſometimes. Therefore let none curſe, whom the Lord hath bleſt; and will bleſs for ever: but let patience, and forbearance, and tenderneſs, compaſſion and readineſs to forgive, and heal, and cover, bind up, be the place of all.</hi>
