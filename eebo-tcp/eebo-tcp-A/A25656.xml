            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that being Informed by one <hi>Alexander Banks,</hi> not long before in Service with Mr. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> that ſeveral ill Books ſeditious and dangerous to the Government, had been Printed by his Maſter, and that many had been diſpos'd of, and that himſelf had help'd to Compoſe part of a Book, called the <hi>Prodigal returned home,</hi> and that he doubted not, if ſearch was ſpeedily made, ſome part of them might be found in the Houſe, he on the 21<hi>th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> laſt, taking to his aſſiſtance one Mr. <hi>Clinch</hi> a Conſtable, and ſuddenly entring the Houſe, found ſeveral of thoſe Books in Quires, and that he found another ſeditious Book, in the hands of Mr. <hi>Thomſons</hi> Maid ſervant, which ſhe had taken from her Miſtriſs, further urging, that he had formerly Printed and Publiſhed the Appeal, and the Libellous Pamphlet Intitled the Noble Peers Speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Thomſon</hi> ſince his confinement, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed he had Printed Three Hundred of the Books, for which he was brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Tryal, but that he had done them for a gentle Man, that was to carry them beyond the Seas, not deſigning to diſperſe them in <hi>England,</hi> and that he had named the Author, but his name he could not well remember: The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence having proceeded thus far againſt the Priſoner, <hi>Alexander Banks</hi> was Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and demanded whether he had not Compoſed part of the Book in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, who with many abrupt ſtammerings, endeavoured to deny it, although he had formerly ſworn it, and his Examination taken by Mr. Recorder, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for which willfull Retraction, being ſharply reproved, Mr. <hi>Clinch</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable was Examined, who confirmed all that Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> had ſworn, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the finding the Books in the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> adding, that meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Mrs. <hi>Thomſon,</hi> and perceiving her to hold ſomething ſlyly behind her, he demanded what it was, to which ſhe replied nothing, but he preſſing her to ſee it, her Maid took it out of her hand, and went about to eſcape with it, but was taken, and the Book ſeized, which imported matter of very evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, the Evidence being thus full, that the Jurors might the better underſtand the malicious deſign of the Libel, divers Paragraphs on which the Proſecution was grounded, were Read, Importing, that the Proſelites of the Reformed Churches, by reaſon of the Hereſie they embraced, were not capable of Salvation, and that St. <hi>Peter</hi> being once appointed Head of the Church, the Pope as his Succeſſor, derived this Power from him, and that all Eccleſiaſtical dignities muſt of neceſſity hold of him and the Biſhops <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be of his Conſtituting, Inſinuating how <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, had the whole Power of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Affaires in his hands, and that Chriſtian Princes intermedled not therein, when he ſent St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and his <hi>Monks</hi> into this Nation, who Eſtabliſhed the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and ſubjected the Eccleſiaſticks to the Sea of Rome, In fine, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together appeared to juſtifie the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and plead for the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, magnifying the Pontifical Prelates, and juſtifying them in their Uſurpation, and unlawful claime.</p>
            <p>To this the Priſoners Council made reply, that he hoped what had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, would not extend to make his Client guilty of publiſhing the Books (which he could not deny were ill and not juſtifiable) for as much as it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, he had expoſed any of them to ſail, to which it was replied, that he had confeſſed he had Printed them, and it could not be Imagined he deſigned them for waſt Paper, or to diſpoſe of to any other end, than to diſperſe them, or that they might be diſperſed, and that ſuch things were of ill conſequence, nor had this been the firſt Libel the Priſoner had Printed, as had appeared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Evidence, when little or no other defence being made, the Right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Lord Chief Juſtice, gave the Charge, fully ſumming up the Evidence, and minding them eſpecially, of what the Priſoner had voluntarily confeſſed, laying open the dangerous effects ſuch Libells might produce; declaring, that upon the Evident proof they had before them, and the confeſſion of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner which had been ſworn, they could no leſs then find him Guilty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon laying their Heads together, without going from the Bar, they gave in their Verdict, that <hi>Nathaniel Thomſon</hi> was Guilty of the Treſpaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in order, to receive the Judgment of the Court.</p>
