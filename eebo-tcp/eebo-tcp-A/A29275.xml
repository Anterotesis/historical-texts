         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Of the hiding the Church.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Certain kinde of ſtrangeneſs may ſeem to ſeize on men
that read the preſcribed Form of Church-Diſcipline con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the two former Treatiſes that I have written
thereof out of the Word, as being new and unheard
of, and by that means cauſe many to reject it, though
indeed it be that which was firſt in the Church, and long ſince turned
out of doors by the Policy and Tyranny of Antichriſt. Now to the
preventing of cauſleſs conjectures of novelty, and the like, in the
hearts of men, I have thought good to ſet forth the cauſes,</p>
            <p>1. Why it came to be hid.</p>
            <p>2. How it come to be hid.</p>
            <p>3. How long it was to be hid, as foretold of God in the Scriptures;
which will ſerve much to take away thoſe Objections which many
make, 1. About the hiding of the Church: 2. About the ſtrange and
unheard of way this ſeems to be to the world; and is no other thing
then was foretold of God to be done by the world, when it ſhould
be brought to light, <hi>Cant. 6. 10. Who is ſhe that looketh forth as the
morn, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, terrible as an Army with
banners?</hi> Theſe things ſet out the degrees the Church was to come
out by;</p>
            <p>1. As the morning out of the dark night, having light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
mixt with it.</p>
            <p>2. It came out as the Moon, having many ſpots in it, ſubject to an
encreaſing and decreaſing light, or a night-light, or rather a changing
light, not permanent.</p>
            <p>3. Is that of the Sun, Lord of the day, who by its light fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40357:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
darkneſs, and by his heat revives the pleaſant plants of God from
their ſeeming deadneſs, their life lying hid in them.</p>
            <p>4. Its time of thus coming forth and way <hi>is terrible as an Army
with banners</hi> indeed in a time of War.</p>
            <p>5. Its coming out is wondred at, and enquired after, with a <hi>Who is
this?</hi> a great enquiry is in the world after it, as after an unknown,
and an unuſual unheard of birth; and ſo much the more wonderful,
becauſe as another Sun it will appear to all the world by a glorious
heavenly light.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of this admiration, is the long hiding of this Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy
from the world, who as the Sun is carried from us as it were
into another world, that it ſhined not to us; in the time of whoſe
abſence we are ſate down in darkneſs, which continueth ſo long, that
we know not the light when it comes forth, but is wondred at, and
hated; hence it muſt have an Army, and be terrible to bring it forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6. 1. It is driven into the wilderneſs</p>
            <p>2. It is hid, and ſo hid, as after from the face of the Dragon, <hi>v.</hi> 14.
as that the Dragon could not finde her, nor make diſcovery of her.</p>
            <p>3. Ye have the time, how long it is to be hid, expreſſed of God,
<hi>v.</hi> 6. 1260 days; which days being ſet down prophetically, muſt be
underſtood of ſo many years, which are 1260 years.</p>
            <p>1. This agreeth with Antichriſts time of Tyranny, as in <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. 5.
Antichriſts time is forty two moneths, which accounting thirty days
for every moneth, as in ſome places they do, it makes juſt 1260 days,
prophetically years; which clearly ſhews the time of the Churches
hiding, its obſcure condition, in which it ſhould not be known to the
world what her eſtate was, which agrees with the time of Antichriſts
Reign. Its hiding begins with the beginning of the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
Reign, and ends with the diſſolution of him.</p>
            <p>2. We may collect the time, we having ſet down in Scripture Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 18. which is to be in the year 666. when Popes
and Papacy have their final, fatal and fearful end, for as in <hi>v.</hi> 5. it is
to continue no longer then the forty two moneths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> The number of the Beaſt 666, may be to be underſtood of the
times of the beginning of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> 1. The 666 ſo could not be the number of the Beaſt, but of
the time going before the Beaſt, the number of years unto the Beaſt,
but not of the Beaſt, which is the number in the Text ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>2. This number of the Beaſt muſt contain the beginning and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40357:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
end of the Beaſt, or that cannot be the number of him, which is to
be limited onely to his beginning and end.</p>
            <p>1. His number is much more then 666, being to be 1260 years,
and ſo that could not be its number poſſibly.</p>
            <p>2. It could not be much of the firſt 666 years, becauſe Antichriſt
could not be revealed in moſt of that time, there was that did hinder
which would hinder until taken out of the way, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>3. If the year 666 were to be underſtood of the time Antichriſts
beginning was to be, it were no ſuch wiſdom as the Text holds it out
to be, to account the number, unleſs we ſay Antichriſt is yet not come,
but is to begin to be 1666; for 666 comes not to be accounted by any
account of numeration again until the time, in the account of tim<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
from Chriſt to this day.</p>
            <p>4. As for <hi>Potters</hi> account drawn to prove the Antichriſt of <hi>Rome</hi>
from the ſquare Root of the number 666, being 25, there may be
ſomething of God in it; and the number drawn from Names by
others, from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to this day, men adding ſeveral ſignifications
and ſignificators, as their fancy lead them to; to which I leave them,
and time to reveal the truth thereof.</p>
            <p>Now that this may be more plain to us, it is added by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the Text, that <hi>the number is the number of a man,</hi> that is, <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus
numerans,</hi> then the time of the Beaſt is the <hi>numerus numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
now in the number numbring it is of man.</p>
            <p>1. To ſhew, That the number is ordinarily to be numbred, as
among men is uſed in their other ordinary accounts.</p>
            <p>2. To ſatisfie us, and to take us off from any unuſual kinde of caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up Antichriſts accounts.</p>
            <p>In that he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he ſhews it was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
indeed with ſome, but not with all men.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>John</hi> being himſelf a Jew, borroweth this custom, proper to the
people, to ſet out Antichriſts number by, which is to ſet down in their
numbring of years, the figures containing the leſſer number, but leaving
out the Millenary number, that ſo by this taking it from the cuſtom
of the Jews, it may be hid from the Gentiles; which kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the leſſer computation among the Jews.</p>
            <p>Now if you deduct out of 1666, the number of 1260, then the
time of Antichriſts riſe, and the Churches hiding, muſt be in the
year 406.</p>
            <p>1. About which time the <hi>Goths</hi> invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> and upon which the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40357:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ten Kings, ſignified by the ten Toes of <hi>Daniels</hi> Image, aroſe out of
the Roman Empire, divided in the two Iron Thighs before of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
and <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Sons of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> after which Eſtate
the Iron and Clay are mixed, the Popes and Kings of the earth Reigh
together. Now the Hiſtory and Myſtery being compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
meeing in one, agree as one in all things, as in the ſame one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of truth, proves it ſufficiently unto us to be of God.</p>
            <p>2. About this, or not long before, <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Poictoyrs</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who
lived about 380, ſaith, <hi>The Church was not be found in his days in
Houſes, in Temples, and in Cities, but in Priſons, Mountains, Dens,
Deſerts and Caves of the earth.</hi> But in the 26 years after, there was a
more exceeding encreaſe of darkneſs then in far more time before.</p>
            <p>3. To theſe times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to the Primitive and pureſt times, have the
learned had recourſe to, to Reform the Church by in our days, and
not to the times ſince.</p>
            <p>4. The differences amongſt us about Church-Government, in that
they are in a maner undetermineable, abundantly prove the hiding of
it in the Word to us, which ſhould determine all, and decide all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
for us.</p>
            <p>5. About that time, or a little before, though many did retain the
truth of Doctrine, yet had loſt the truth of Diſcipline, and few after
the firſt 250 years, wrote any thing of it in a maner: Now as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
ſtayed laſt, ſo it came by <hi>Luther</hi> firſt again; and after by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to reveal the Diſcipline: and it is my opinion, That until 1666
the ful &amp; perfect diſcovery of Church-diſcipline wil not be ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practiſed in the Church, as ſhall be; the time between this and that
being to prepare for it: And at that time there will all things that
concern the Church Government, be revealed and erected in the
world amongſt men; though I conceive, that according to Chriſts
promiſe, theſe now laſt and moſt cruel days of Antichriſt, for the
Elects ſake, ſhall be ſhortned; and that God, before the end of this
time, may give us by ſome means a general knowledge of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Form of Government, though not ſo plainly and perfectly as
in the time appointed.</p>
            <p>6. That the Church now hid ſhall then come forth, is manifeſtly
implyed, in that God ſets down the expreſs number of the days it is
to remain hid, which God would not have limited it to, if it had
been his minde to have it hid for ever from the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>7. The mighty oppoſition of the Spirits of godly men againſt all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40357:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or any Government yet exerciſed, carrieth much evidence with it,
That the Governments known are not of Divine Inſtitution; The
Spirits of Gods people will be ſubject to Gods Government, as the
Apoſtle in another caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32.</p>
            <p>8. When ever the whole Goſpel platform of the Churches Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
ſhall be ſet up, man will not be neceſſitated to borrow pieces
of Prudentials to patch it up, Gods wiſdom will ſufficiently be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in the Word for the Government of his Church.</p>
            <p>1. Concluſion is not to cry down all thoſe things which at preſent
have with them the appearance of Novelty.</p>
            <p>2. Not to admire nor dote upon thoſe things at preſent ſeem old,
a thing whereunto we ſee the world wonderfully carried after, when
indeed were things fully and plainly diſcovered to us, new things
would be old, old things would be new; which vanity <hi>John</hi> ſtrikes at
in his 1 Epiſt. <hi>Cap. 2. v.</hi> 7, 8. by which means men can ſcarce be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to try things, whether they are truth or no, but caſt them away
as new, though they were from the beginning: And we our ſelves
now, and our fathers in King <hi>Edwards</hi> days heretofore, have ſeen
how hard old Hereſies, Superſtitions, Traditions and Popiſh Vanities
are to be caſt down, and how hardly the Truth comes to be ſet up
among a people; and proves a people are not eaſily taken off from
their old ways in Religion, but as the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> would ſet up <hi>Dagon</hi>
again and again after its fall. The old (as we account old) is pleaſing
more to Nature then the new; that of Popery was more Natural
and corrupt then that of Epiſcopacy; Epiſcopacy much more then
that of Presbytery; and that of Presbytery more then that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency,
which the world cannot bear, how then the way of the
Lord Jeſus, which will finde more oppoſition with the world, then
ever any Government yet found in all the world, or its divine, holy,
pure nature and power would not be made appear.</p>
            <p>3. The old will be a new Government, when ever brought forth
to light, and the new old.</p>
            <p>4. Let us not be overſtrict in ſuppreſſing all thoſe Doctrines that
ſuit not with our judgement or practice in Church-Diſcipline, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we ſhould keep the way of God which is hid, to be hid for ever
unto us, <hi>Matth. 11. 25. God hides things from the wiſe and prudent,
and reveals them to babes;</hi> he as a moſt free Agent makes known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and myſteries to whom he pleaſe, and commonly to the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
means, that none may glory in man, nor man in himſelf, but all
in God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:40357:6"/>
5. In the ſpirit of humility I beſeech all publike perſons to conſider,
how ſad a thing it would be, if the time of the Churches Revelation
being at hand, any thing of Power or Authority ſhould be made uſe
of to keep it from us, and from the world, did not the Spirit of God
ſtir up the Spirit of man within him for the love of Chriſt and the
Goſpel, to undergo any thing, what means may this be to bolt out
the Kingdom of heaven from us, and to ſhut it up from us for ever.</p>
            <p>6. Concluſion hence is, that until the Kingdom eſtate be brought
forth to the world, the world will not ſee peace. It is good for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
and Miniſters to help it forth, but not to hinder it; a woman
in travel, though her throws for a time ceaſe, yet they leave her not,
but come upon her, until ſhe be delivered of her childe: the woman
now travels in pain again to be delivered, as heretofore <hi>Rev. 12. 2.
Iſa. 56. 8. Shall a Nation be born at once?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well obſerved of learned <hi>Broughton,</hi> That while <hi>Solomons</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
lay waſte, all the world was in war, and in flames of fire, as it were;
but when it was reſtored, God bleſſed all the world with a ſweet
peace; which change of our eſtate, obſerve it well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will be in ſome
kinde agreeable hereunto, as all ſhall ſee who live to behold it, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
118. 22, 25. when the ſtone ſhall become the head ſtone, laid for the
building, God will ſend proſperity, and not before.</p>
            <p>A third general ground to prove the Churches not being yet come
forth, may be from <hi>Rev. 12. 7. There was war in heaven, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The holy Spirit having ended with the Churches time in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
comes to ſhew what ſhould ſucceed it in her coming
thence.</p>
            <p>2. In her beginning viſibility there is a war between thoſe are of
her viſible Members; in this war many Miniſters are caſt down, or
Angels, <hi>v. 8. Their place was found no more in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Ver. 10. A voyce cryed, ſaying, in heaven, Now is come ſalvation,
and ſtrength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>1. Here is a clear difference made betwixt heaven before the war,
and the kingdom after the war.</p>
            <p>2. This diſtſtinction is apparently clear in the Word (now) if now,
then not before, being the moſt certain note and diſtinction of time.</p>
            <p>3. When this comes, comes <hi>Salvation, strength, and the power of
his Christ,</hi> and not before; ſhewing, there would in this war be
much weakneſs until then, and then God would bleſs it with ſtrength
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40357:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and power, by which the Church ſhould prove victorious in the
world. But of theſe things I forbear to ſpeak more of, but refer it
unto the Expoſition I have intended to write, much more particularly
and at large, if the Lord give leave, as theſe things come to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed
of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Theſe are dubious Scriptures, and therefore the proof cannot be
ſufficient; and again, many are the contrary Expoſitions made by the
learned againſt this of yours, which are rather to be aſſented unto, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. Friend, the hiding and time of the hiding of Church muſt be
hence, or now here.</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture is dubious indeed before, but plain in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling.</p>
            <p>3. The Scripture was given againſt doubts, not to occaſion them;
and to reveal beforehand the purpoſes of God to his Church, near be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the accompliſhment whereof God uſually reveals them by the
Word and Spirit to ſome of the Church, as in <hi>Huſſ. Prediction of</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Brightman <hi>of the fall of Epiſcopacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the contrary Expoſitions made of ſome of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
that I have read, I ſhall in brief inſert.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Junius</hi> makes the 1260 days to be from the beginning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
to the end of the deſtruction and Temple, which was done
before <hi>John</hi> wrote his book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> who ſaith of the things
in the book, they are <hi>things ſhortly to come to paſs;</hi> ſo that I think it
is clear, he alludes to nothing paſt in this book.</p>
            <p>2. Others make this time agree with the wiſe mens coming to
Chriſt, and end with <hi>Herods</hi> death, which is ſufficiently anſwered in
that made to the former.</p>
            <p>3. Opinion is, That the 1260 days, and the time, times and half a
time, are one and the ſame, being three years and a half.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. Theſe are not the ſame, they differ in maner of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as in the words themſelves appear.</p>
            <p>2. They differ in time, the one before the Churches coming forth,
the other after; many things came to be done between, as the
War, and fall of the Dragon, the fall of the Angels, the coming of
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The one I think concerns the Jewiſh Church, who is the woman
brought forth the Male Childe; the other the Gentiles: The Jews
ſhall have their place appointed them of God for ſafety, their time,
times and half, as the Gentiles their 1260 days, whom infinite floods
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40357:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of perſecution moſt certainly are to attend; from all which God
will moſt graciouſly ſave that people, and joyn them to himſelf.</p>
            <p>1. This War is at the end of the 1260 days.</p>
            <p>2. At the end of the two Witneſſes Propheſie, when God will have
the Church miniſtred unto in another way then before, and all other
ways of miniſtery before extant, will ceaſe and be put an end unto.</p>
            <p>3. The ſame hour is an earthquake, a ſtrange change of things In
Church and ſtate, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>1. If it be to come, we are warned of it as of the ſaddeſt time the
Saints yet ſaw, which we ſhall inſtantly know.</p>
            <p>2. This ſorrowful ſad time ends in a heavenly happineſs, the time
of ſuffering being to endure but three years and half.</p>
            <p>3. It occaſions the greateſt change of things that ever was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
on earth.</p>
            <p>4. Herein the deliverance will be ſo wonderful, that the enemies
will be affrighted at it, and ſee God ſo in it, as to glorifie God, when
that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. will be fulfilled, <hi>God making the Lyon to lie down with
the Lamb, the Calf and the Bear together, and ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy;</hi>
ſo that the Church will after this ſad dying time, ſee God honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her again, more then ever ſhe was honored in this preſent
world.</p>
            <p>1. Again, to return to the former purpoſe, this being one Viſion,
the two numbers cannot be of the ſame time.</p>
            <p>2. It is not to be thought, that this Book being ſo ſhort, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
in it ſo much of Hiſtory and Propheſie, as concerns the Church
to the end; and Antichriſt riſe and fall, withal, that in that there
is a repetition of one and the ſame thing, in one and the ſame
Viſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> You make the 42 Moneths, Rev. 13. 5. and the 1260 days
the ſame, Rev. 12. 7. though theſe are ſet out by differing terms, as the
other of a time, times, and half a time, differs in terms from the 1260
days.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. This of the 42 Moneths and 1260 days, are ſpoken of in
two Viſions.</p>
            <p>2. Theſe are of the ſame thing meant, it is plain, which is, the one
of Antichriſt, and her time of Tyranny; the other, of the Church,
and her time of ſuffering under this ſame Tyranny of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>3. This ſweetly ſets out the wiſdom of God, ſetting out one by
the Moons Government, the Governeſs of the night and ſea on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40357:7"/>
which ſhe ſits and rules; and the other by the Sun, the Governor of
the day, and Church, in which he reigns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Illuſt.</hi> That as the Iſraelites in the time of their perſecution had
light in their dwellings, when their perſecutors were under dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>2. To ſhew; That the worſt of Saints eſtate was more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
then the beſt of the enemies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25.</p>
            <p>God would ever keep, and teach us to keep a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the godly and ungodly, in this, as in the other diviſions made
of God betwixt them, ſet down in the Scriptures; as Iſrael had
the bright ſide, the Egyptians the dark ſide of the Cloud toward
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Fox, Conſtat enim ſub Nerone, Domitiano, Trajano, Severo
Commodo, Decio Diocleſiano, Imperium draconis longe ſupra triennium
conſtitiſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore he takes the ſecond greater number from the Baptiſt
to</hi> Conſtantine, Quae perſequutionum tempora ſi certè ex Hiſtoriis
ſupputentur uſ vnictum Satanam ſub Conſtantino, effluxerunt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
42, Anni 294.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the way of making up this account, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe is very unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable,</hi>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Daniel enumerat ſuas Hebdomadas, itidem &amp; nos ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulos
menſes in Septenarium annorum numerum deducamus: à primo
enim perſecutionis initio hoc eſt decollationis Johannis Baptiſtae, ad pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
eccleſiae ſub Conſtantino reſtitutam Anni 294.</p>
            <p>1. Theſe things ſquare not, they muſt with this Expoſition bring
in the times of Perſecution, before the beginning of the Propheſie.</p>
            <p>2. Nor was this the beginning of Perſecution: The beginning of
the Perſecution I ſuppoſe rather to have been in <hi>Herods</hi> murthering
the thouſands of Infants of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the driving of Chriſt
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was many years before.</p>
            <p>3. There is an expreſs direction for that way of account to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi>
Propheſie, but none to this.</p>
            <p>4. I ſuppoſe there is no way juſtly to account theſe moneths by,
but theſe two:</p>
            <p>1. By the years they make, which is three years and an half.</p>
            <p>2. By reducing them to days, which are 1260.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> ſaith, That the Churches perſecution muſt be more
then three years and an half; and therefore not to be accounted by
the years they make.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:40357:8"/>
2. The Reaſon why God accounts Antichriſts time, the perſecutor,
by moneths, and the Saints time, the preſecuted, by days, I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of before.</p>
            <p>Cooper <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Galloway <hi>on the words ſaith,</hi> The words are uſed
of God as a Riddle, in which he ſignifies a time unknown to us, but
certainly known to him: For ſhall we think the Church will be forced
to flee into the wilderneſs but three years and an half, from Chriſts
Reſurrection to the end of the world?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Mead Apoſt. of laſt times, <hi>ſaith,</hi> The days of this hiding of
the Church, begun at the healing of the deadly wound the Beaſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
which was in the deſtruction of <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Goths</hi> about 410.</p>
            <p>And if we conſider, That the Church was ſet up in the Heathen
world after Chriſts death, we have no cauſe to draw the beginning
of the hiding of it from the beginning, or any other part of time
of his life; but rather thus, The Church is viſible in the ten perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
the red or bloody Dragon, the Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
it, which were Antichriſts Predeceſſors, belonging all to the ſixth
Head of that ſeven headed beaſtly Monſter, who could not by all
their open killing courſes deſtroy the Chriſtian Profeſſion, though
many thouſands were ofttimes ſlain in a day; but when that the
ſeventh Antichriſtian Head came up, who was worſe then all: She
hath the Spots of the Leopard, the Feet of the Bear, the Mouth of
the Lyon, the Power and Authority of the Dragon, and that all
written in the Viſion, <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. from <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to the 10. appears, becauſe
in this Viſion the Horns have their Crowns on them, which was
onely permitted under the Reign of the ſeventh Head, and
not under the Reign of the ſixth, <hi>Revelations</hi> 12. 3. The Crowns
are on his heads, he permitted not Kingly power to any to Reign
with him, as the Pope, unleſs to two or three onely extraordinarily,
as in <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Lucius:</hi> When the ſevernth Head Reigns, ſhe by force.</p>
            <p>1. Perſecuting the ſincere truth as bloodily as the Heathen Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
before her, or worſe, and pulling down the building of Truth.</p>
            <p>2. Setting up a counterfeit way of her own, carrying a falſe light
with it, by which ſhe bewitched the Nations with her cup of abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
deceiving ſilly ſouls with the outward ſhews of Religion
and Piety, by which ſhe overthrew more then by her cruelty, and
did more againſt the Church, then by open rage of fire and faggot.</p>
            <p>3. By corrupting Hiſtory, by falſe Expoſitions of Scriptures, by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40357:8"/>
ſubtile diſtinctions, by corrupt and falſe Traditions, by abominable
Blaſphemy, ſpeaking againſt God, his Tabernacle, his Saints, rendring
them odious to the world, a way too common in theſe days, which
came from <hi>Rome.</hi> I wiſh ſome men in time to conſider who is meant
by the <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren,</hi> who are to be caſt down; without
queſtion it is not the Devil onely, he was caſt down a long time ſince,
they accuſe them before God night and day; their day, who ever
they are, is near, yea next, and he or they muſt be caſt down, upon
which followeth much joy in heaven among them that dwell therein
for their fall: See, God gives them the Devils name, that do the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
work.</p>
            <p>4. As I ſuppoſe the truth appears plain, That the firſt ten verſes
do appertain to the Reign of the laſt and ſeventh Head of beaſtly
Antichriſt; and then it is more plain, That the 42 moneths is the
time of that Heads continuance, and that the Churches hiding began
in her time, and ends with her ending.</p>
            <p>5. The perſecution was grievous, without queſtion, and tedious,
before the Church could be brought to ſuch obſcurity, as appears in
the Heathen Dragon, who was made red with her blood; and as
<hi>ver. 4. With his tail he had caſt down the third part of Stars to the
earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. It was not given to the ſixth Head, but this ſeventh Head, to
overcome the Saints; the other Head made War, but could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them, this doth; which it could not have done, had it not been
given him to do, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 7.</p>
            <p>7. If we make the hiding of the Church to be the time before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi>
then there was never a time in which it was viſible: Now if
it were never viſible, how could it be ſaid to be hid at all.</p>
            <p>8. It hath been the practice of the godly and learned, to judge her
viſibility to be before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and not ſince, approving the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the firſt and nearer times to the Apoſtles, as moſt pure, and
the after times more corrupt: Had not theſe firſt times the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Churches, godly faithful Miniſters, precious Chriſtians, moſt
ſound and ſincere Doctrine, and the onely Goſpel-Diſcipline? which
ever ſince hath been perſecuted, reviled, corrupted, blaſphemed by
that ſinful Man of Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pareus</hi> ſaith, It began to be hid 606, and then its hid eſtate ends,
and the Church comes forth in the year 1866.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moulin</hi> begins it <hi>Anno</hi> 755, then it ends 2035.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40357:9"/>
               <hi>Brightman</hi> begins it 426, then it ends 1686. who comes neareſt to
Antichriſts end determined of God, and the juſt computation of
the time of the Churches obſcurity, which ends 1666.</p>
            <p>Now in that it was ſaid, <hi>Then to be hid,</hi> there remains ſome thing
to be done, more remarkably eminent to the brining forch of the
Church, then as yet hath been manifeſted to the world, is a thing I
think not by any to be gainſayed.</p>
            <p>But for the Elects ſake theſe days, Chriſt foretelling the cruelty of
Antichriſts time, who is indeed the Abomination of deſolation ſpoken
of by the Holy Ghoſt; which propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> computed and
compared with this, clears moſt excellently the truth: But this I
leave to be ſpoken of in expounding the Revelations.</p>
            <p>It is not amiſs to write a word more to manifeſt and make more
plain the minde of God, by the hiding of the Church.</p>
            <p>1. Manifeſtation or Demonſtration is to be taken from the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical
expreſſions uſed, and the Hiſtory alluded to, by which Gods
it out to us; ſo ſets that whiles the Wilderneſs hides the Church,
yet it is ordained to ſhew the way how it came ſo to be hid.</p>
            <p>2. The Hiſtory alluded to is, either that of Iſraels coming out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>Elijah's</hi> flying unto the Wilderneſs, or both; but eſpecially
<hi>Elijah's</hi> eſtate ſets it out abundantly more clear, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. and 18.
and 19.</p>
            <p>1. In his flight and hiding <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
            <p>2. In his feeding miraculouſly by the Ravens, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
            <p>3. After many days he comes to <hi>Ahab</hi> again.</p>
            <p>4. The godly are not hid onely from the wicked, but godly <hi>Elijah</hi>
thinks himſelf above, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 14, 18. when God had ſeven
thouſand had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. In this time <hi>Baals</hi> Prophets are ſlain, 1 <hi>Kings, 18. 40. Rev.</hi> 12. 8.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Cap. 9. 2. Jezabel.</hi> threatens him with death, he flyeth
again, and where, but into the Wilderneſs, which is after his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and firſt flight, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
            <p>7. This flying into the Wilderneſs is after the rain, ſignifying the
Miniſtery after the long drought of the means of grace.</p>
            <p>8. This wilderneſs eſtate is very fearful to him, and will be to the
Saints, <hi>cap. 19. ver. 4. Rev.</hi> 12. 15.</p>
            <p>9. In this time the Lords Altars are caſt down, and Groves to
<hi>Baal</hi> ſet up, and Altars, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 26.</p>
            <p>10. The Prophets are ſlain, 1 <hi>Kings 19, ver. 10. Rev.</hi> 11. 7.</p>

11. Shews the ſtrange effects this perſecution brings on the world
by an earthquake, which is a change and removing of things that were,
and ſetting up things that cannot be ſhaken; Rocks and Mountains
are rent before the Lord, and a refining fire comes purging up the
droſs, then came the ſtill voyce in which God was ſaid to be.</p>
            <p>Concluſion generally is this; hence in the hiding of the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Antichriſt, it is to be as that under <hi>Ahab</hi> (who as Antichriſt made
Iſrael to ſin, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Word is of an active and paſſive ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
in which the Prophets are to be ſlain, the Altars, that is, all publike
form of true worſhip pull'd down, Baalitical Altars ſet up, not a man
left viſible, that is known to ſerve God, or that muſt not be forced
to kiſs <hi>Baal,</hi> and how to <hi>Baal,</hi> in which time great inquiry and ſearch
is made after any man that ſhall worſhip the true God in truth, to
deſtroy him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 10. and yet to meke it more evidently plain
in this perſecution, not onley <hi>Ahab</hi> the King, but <hi>Jezabel</hi> the Queen
hath hand in it, which ſhew, that Antichriſt hence was, to have the
name one while of a Woman, Whore, another while of the Man,
Dragon, which makes the Agreement, between the Type and Antitype
remarkable; and then laſty, his firſt hiding was for many days, one
reaſon why God accompts the hiding of the Church by days,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Apply theſe to the Church eſtate, and it may be abundantly proved,
yet that of <hi>Elijah</hi> was but the type onely, as the moddel to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his many days being nothing to theſe, &amp;c. in the Text.</p>
            <p>2. The Churches hiding now, exceeds theirs abundantly, that was
under the Moſaical Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>1. As it was hid in the word as well as in the practice, ſo that I
know not the Man this 1260 years paſt, can ſay he hath found it.</p>
            <p>2. Hid in the writings of thoſe practiſed it: God in judgement
to the world, permitting them to be adulterated, as that way by
which he would accompliſh his own ends in the world, they but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
his councel therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Fulk on Rev. 12. ver. 6. Hic locus apertè demonſtrat non ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
fore eccleſiam mundo conſpicuam, quod maxime urgent Papiſtae,
nam ſi ſemper omnium viſui expoſita erit quomodo in deſertum fugere
dicatur?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Barnard</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6. underſtands by the 1260 days, 1260
years, and on the 14 <hi>Verſe,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Her flying into the wilderneſs, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40357:10"/>
ſhe was hid in the wilderneſs, and by her flight, loſt her viſibility
before her enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Galloway</hi> ſets forth the hiding of the Church
in his Comment on <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6. by the hid eſtate of the Popiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue
in <hi>England, Who are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>without publike ſtate of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or open free exerciſe of holy Function.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then this I think could be nothing choſen more fitly or fully, to
clear the thing intended for Antichriſts riſing; he riſeth by taking
down the Goſpel frame of Goſpel Government, makes that to be
hid, that he may appear onely; when Chriſt ſets up the Government
of the true Church he ſhall pull down the frame of the falſe again;
Chriſt and <hi>Belial</hi> cannot agree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr.</hi> Taylor <hi>in his Tract called,</hi> Chriſts victory over the Dragon,
being an Expoſition on Rev. 12. ver. 14 <hi>he ſpeaks excellently and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
ſaith he,</hi> The flight was not in reſpect of motion, but of state and
condition; not a change of place, but of condition and ornaments.</p>
            <p>And after Antichriſt ſits ſtill in the Temple of God, neither is the
woman yet got out of the Wilderneſs, <hi>page</hi> 789. indeed in this the
man hath ſaid, in a maner all; Who can ſay more to us alive then
he, though dead, now ſpeaketh?</p>
            <p>Concluſion is this, That all the 1260 days of the Churches hiding,
or near to the 1666 year of Chriſt, the Church frame will be hid,
and the exerciſe of Goſpel Miniſtery and Government concealed,
which God in mercy to the Elect, will ſome few years, becauſe of the
bloody wars and deſtructive times ſhall about the end of theſe times
come on the world, by reaſon of Satans rage (who knoweth well,
far better then we, his time is ſhort of raigning on the earth, and that
Chriſt raign will immediately begin, in which Antichriſt, Satans firſt
born ſon, muſt down, and he himſelf be bound a 1000 years) ſo that
few men would be preſerved alive: Did not the Lord ſhorten them,
as few as they ſeem in number to be, being in all but 18 years: If 18
years of war ſhould continue in this Kingdom more, what would
become of us? we thought we ſhould not endure ſeven years war,
but the famine would deſtroy us: Oh, if this be done in Heaven, let
the earth and ſea take heed to it; as ſhort as the time ſeems to be,
great will the deſtruction be on Antichriſtian Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
not leaving a King, nor ſcarce a Kingdom among them,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 11, 12.</p>

1. Pet. 4. 7. The time is come that judgement muſt begin at the houſe
of God If it firſt begin at us, what ſhall be the end of them that obey
not the Goſpel of God?</p>
            <p>Note here, it is plain judgement muſt begin at us, at the houſe of
God.</p>
            <p>2. The time propheſied of, it ſhould begin at us, is come.</p>
            <p>3. The end is unutterable, unconceiveable, God will make in
Popiſh and Heathen Kingdoms, the perſecuted, the Church, they have
the dregs of this next cup, wrung out for them to drink, which in
this 18 years ſucceeding, the whole world cannot keep them from it,
nor it from them; but as fuel for this fearful fire, muſt be devoured,
of which, who ſhall be happy, will be warned, as <hi>Noah</hi> to the ſaving
himſelf and family, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7.</p>
