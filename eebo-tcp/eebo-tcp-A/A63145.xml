            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TRYAL
AND
CONDEMNATION
OF
JOHN GILES,
That Notorious Ruffian,
For that he, in the Company of two more, fell upon, and Grievouſly Wounded
John Arnold <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
OF
Monmouth-Shire,
One of His Majeſties Juſtices of the Aſſizes, in a
place called Jackanapes-Lane, between Bell-Yard
and Chancery-Lane, near Temple-Bar, on the 15th
of April laſt paſt: With ſeveral Remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
appertaining thereunto; the like
Cruelty not happening in any Age. This being a
Warning to all Proteſtants, to beware of Bloody
Papiſts for the future, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THe Tryal of <hi>John Giles</hi> being put off on Thurſday laſt, by reaſon
of his not having, as he pleaded, his Witneſſes in readineſs, for
want of timely Notice, was brought on this Wedneſday, being
the 14th of this inſtant <hi>July,</hi> 1680. After the Jury was Sworn
the Indictment was read, being in Words to this effect, That the
Priſoner <hi>John Giles,</hi> of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> in the Weſt, did on the 15th
of <hi>April</hi> laſt paſt, ſet upon, and grievouſly wound, <hi>John Arnold</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of
His Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> and that
he, with the reſt of his Accomplices and Abettors; did endeavour to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Life of <hi>John Arnold</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After which Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> was ſworn, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51626:2"/>
upon his Oath did averre, that he having a matter of Debate between himſelf
and one Mr. <hi>Harbert,</hi> that was to be tryed before His Majeſties Honourable
Privy Council, he came up out of <hi>Monmouth</hi> Shire to attend the ſame, and
being arrived at <hi>London,</hi> took him a Chamber; and that he being out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
late on the 15th of <hi>April,</hi> about his Occaſion, was coming through
<hi>Bell-yard</hi> near <hi>Temple-Bar,</hi> where he obſerved two Men in Gray Camblet
Cloaks to follow him, and by the glimpſe of a Candle that was brought
out of a Houſe, obſerved the Priſoner to be one of them; they came out
Laughing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till they came near to <hi>Jackanapes-lane,</hi> where one of them ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
before him, the other caſt his Cloak over his Head, and forcing him, <hi>Vt
&amp; Armis,</hi> about Six or Seven yards into the ſaid Lane, gave him three or
four Blows ſo hard that ſtunned him; ſo that he falling down, they barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
fell upon him, one of them preſſing his Breaſt with his Knee, whilſt
another run him into the Thigh near the Belly with a Rapier, the which
made him ſenſible of what they intended; ſo that whileſt he endeavoured
what he could to ſave himſelf and ſecure his Life from the Murderous Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians,
they wounded him in two places upon the Left Arm; two Wounds
he received upon his Breſt, and one in his Belly, that ſlaunted through the
Fleſhy part about Five or Six Inches; but they finding that their Swords would
not penetrate deep into his Breſt, by reaſon of a Whale-bone pair of Bodice
Quilted, that he privately wore; they cryed, <hi>Dam him, Rot him, he has
got Armour on, Cut his Throat.</hi> Upon which one of them, ſuppoſed to be the
Priſoner, pulled out a Knife, and endeavored to cut his Throat, the which
he defended with his Hands to the utmoſt of his power; ſo that through the
Mercy of God they had not their Will there; but notwithſtanding, they Cut
and Mangled his Face after a moſt Barbarous Manner; and ſo eager were
they to act then Helliſh Miſchief, that one of them run his fellow Villain
into the Leg for haſte, the which he underſtood, by hearing him ſay, <hi>Dam
ye, you have ſpoiled my Leg,</hi> or words to that effect; but as Providence
would have it, before they could accompliſh their Ends, a Linkman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of a certain Door frighted them; ſo that leaving him for dead, they
put up their Swords, ſaying, <hi>Now pray for the Soul of Captain</hi> Evans, which
<hi>Evans</hi> was a Popiſh Prieſt, who had been lately Executed at <hi>Monmonth,</hi>
and ſo departed, Laughing aloud, at the dire Miſchief they had done. Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi>
being asked what particular Marks he knew the Priſoner by, he ſaid,
<hi>That he knew him not only by his Viſage, but by his Voice;</hi> and that when
he was Apprehended, he picked him out from amongſt ſeveral others, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
then that he was the Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Walter Moore,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stephen
Phillips</hi> being Sworn, gave Evidence, That he being in Company with <hi>John
Giles</hi> the Priſoner, an Argument was rais'd by ſome of the Company about
the <hi>Plot,</hi> which <hi>Giles</hi> undertook to vindicate, ſaying, <hi>There was no Plot;</hi>
and that they were Rogues and Thieves that did affirm there was any, and
that if any of the Popiſh Lords ſhould Suffer, it would bring a Bloodier War
upon the Nation than has been known theſe many Hundred Years: And go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on yet further, to the Buſineſs of Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> ſome of the Company
was ſpeaking what a Baſe and Barbarous Attempt was made upon him, as
they ſuppoſed, by ſome of the Popiſh Party; <hi>Giles</hi> reply'd, <hi>Dam him, Rot
him, they ſay he had Armour on,</hi> or more poſitively, <hi>that he had Armour on;</hi>
which being but the next day after the Aſſaſſination, no ſuch thing was then
publiquely known, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was further Sworn againſt him by Mr. <hi>William Richmond,</hi> That a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before this Barbarous Act was done, they being together in St. <hi>Martins
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51626:2"/>
Lane, Giles</hi> asked him, if he knew where he might buy a good ſtrong Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier?
And that they having walked about that Evening to ſeveral places
between Eight and Nine of the Clock came home to their Lodging,
which was at the <hi>Kings Arms</hi> in <hi>Drury-lane,</hi> where <hi>Richmond</hi> going up to
his Chamber, left <hi>Giles</hi> a Smoaking by the Fire-ſide, and as he was informed,
about Nine, or ſomewhat paſt, he was called out by ſome unknown Perſon,
which was a little before the Miſchief Acted, and that he did not come to Bed
that Night till about One of the Clock; he being in the Chamber about Twelve,
and ſeeing the Maid of the Houſe making the Bed, asked her, <hi>Who ſhe made a
Bed for ſo late,</hi> to which ſhe reply'd, <hi>For a Gentleman that was below, who
would needs lie by himſelf;</hi> and that <hi>Giles</hi> as he went by his Chamber Door
to Bed, called to him and bid him Good Night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was further Sworn by <hi>George Richmond,</hi> that <hi>Giles</hi> coming down to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth-Shire,</hi>
he was asked for ſome Horſe-hair which he had promiſed, to make
fiſhing-lines; to which he replied, that he had left a great deal at a Farriers in
<hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but that he durſt not ſtay to call for it, for fear of being purſued, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Account of Mr. <hi>Arnold;</hi> and that having broke his Sword,, he brought it
to one <hi>Peter Darceys</hi> a Sword-Cutler in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>skley</hi> a place in <hi>Monmouth-Shire,</hi> to be
mended; who upon ſight of it, ſaid, How now <hi>Giles,</hi> What haſt thou been fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Devil? To whom he replied, as being confident of him, knowing
him to be a Papiſt: No not with the Devil, but with damn'd <hi>Arnold;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his Wife jogged him, bidding him have a care what he ſpoke, leſt he
was over-heard; the Witneſs before-mentioned and the Cutlers-boy, being then
in the Shop, this being about the ſeventh of <hi>May</hi> laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe being the moſt material Points of Evidence for the King, his Council ſtood
up and made his Apology to the Court, ſaying, That if he thought the Priſoner
was Guilty of the baſe and barbarous Crime of which he ſtood charged, he
would not open his mouth in the Cauſe; but that if his Breviates were true, by
which he was to Plead in the Priſoners behalf, he doubted not but that he
yet might be proved Innocent: Upon which the Witneſſes for the Priſoner
were called, being for the moſt part <hi>Welſh-People; Morgan Gibbeon, John
Champion, Elizabeth Edmut:</hi> ſwore that they or ſome of them were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in his company that Evening the Fact was committed, till the time he went
to Bed, the which was about 10 of the Clock as ſome Affirm, others Eleven;
ſo that they confounded themſelves about the particular time, and often ſwore
backwards and forwards; eſpecially upon any croſs Queſtion that was asked
them by the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roger How</hi> upon Examination, If he knew where <hi>Giles</hi> was about 10 of the
Clock that Evening the Fact was done? Atteſted that he was ſitting by the
Kitchin Fire ſmoaking Tobacco, and that he ſaw him about half an hour paſt
Ten go up to bed: When as <hi>Ann Bibby</hi> another of his Witneſſes, ſwore, That
ſhe ſaw him by the ſaid Fire near Twelve of the Clock, and that he did not
go to Bed till about Twelve. Such Contradictions had they amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
by reaſon they had not compared Notes to the purpoſe, in ſo Villainous
and baſe a Vindication. The Maid of the Houſe where he lodged, being ſworn,
was asked by the Court, What time ſhe made the Priſoners Bed? Who differing
from the reſt, anſwered about 9, and that he then went to Bed, being poſitive
as ſhe ſaid of it, till <hi>William Richmond,</hi> who was in the Chamber with her,
recollected her Memory by ſeveral Tokens, that it was about one of the Clock:
A long time ſhe denied that he was there, and that ſhe ſaw him not to her
knowledge all that Night, ſtanding obſtinate in the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till by a Love
Intreague that paſſed between them, her Equivocation left her, and ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51626:3"/>
what has been before recited. Next <hi>Walter Powel,</hi> the Sword-Cutlers
Apprentice, was called to Atteſt what was ſaid by <hi>Giles</hi> in his Maſters
Shop; who upon Oath Atteſted that <hi>Giles</hi> was in the Shop, and that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
did ask him, Whether he had been fighting with the Devil or not? To which
he replyed, No, no, with the Devil <hi>Arnold:</hi> which Equivocation was looked
upon as an Evaſion which the Youth had been taught in the behalf of the
Priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anne Bibby</hi> and ſeveral others were Examined, but their Teſtimonies were
ſo inconſiderate, that they rather injured the Priſoner than furthered his Cauſe
one Point. Further material for Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> was it, that <hi>Giles</hi> had reported, that
Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> or ſome of his Acquaintance or Friends, had done the Cruelty, on
purpoſe to caſt it upon the Catholiques, thereby to revive the Plot and raiſe a
Perſecution upon them: This he ſaid he believed, becauſe Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his, the Duty of his Office, very zealous for putting the Laws in
Execution againſt Recuſants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all the Witneſſes were Examined by the Court, and the Jury their Charges,
repeating over, for the better refreſhment of their Memories, the brief or ſum
of what had been Sworn on both ſides; and laying open to them the Heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Fact, how it concerned not onely Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> in private, but
the whole Magiſtracy of the Nation; and that although it was only an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment
of Treſpaſs, yet it was of ſo high a Nature, that it deſerved the
ſevereſt Puniſhment the Law could inflict: upon which the Jury going out,
brought him in, after about half an hours Debate, guilty of the ſaid Treſpaſs.
Upon which the Court thought fit to defer Judgement till the Saturday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
on which day the Court being ſet, <hi>Giles</hi> was brought to the
Bar, and received this Sentence, That he ſhould ſtand in the Pillory, and
pay to the King Five hundred Pounds Fine, and afterwards give Security for
Warrant of his good Behaviour, during his Life time. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
