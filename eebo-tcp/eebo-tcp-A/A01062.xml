            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Here shall you see lust Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing, auarice, guilty of murther, &amp; dignity, seeking his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with vsurpation, yet all subuerted by vertue.

And although it be altogither not worth estimation, and to be accounted no requitall for so many good turnes, yet I desire you to accept the same in steed of a better, and the summe of that which my abilitie at this time can affoord: Which beeing but a fancie, vouchsafe to esteem, though not agreeing with your grauitie, yet (as many both Noble and wise in such like matters haue done) to be red for recreation.

And for that I know your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and curtesie to be such, as that you wil not misconceiue me, but esteeme well hereof, and my affection to you, to bee exprest in the dedicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, I haue adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tured to dedicate the same to your protection, though altogither vndeseruing the title of your patronage, which your further kindnesse shall binde me hereafter to requite the same, with some worthier worke col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by my labors.

But if contrary to my thought, this my summer fruite be gathered before it be ripe, I promise amends with olde fruite, that hath bene a yeare in ripening, and in the beginning of the next winter comming forth.

            <p>As for such as either rashly condemne without iudgement, or lauishly dislike without aduice, I esteeme them like the downe of Thistles, inconstantly dispearst with euery blast, accounting their discontent, my content: not caring for to please those that are pleased with nothing.</p>
            <p>But did my gaines, counteruaile my labours, I would then frame my fancie to sit their humours, but getting nothing, I can loose no lesse, onely to haue a good opinion of the well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to learning, is all I craue: and that I hope your good mindes will affoord.</p>

            <p>Which <hi>Ornatus</hi> perceiuing, drew towards her, and gr√©eted her with these sp√©eches.

And seeing himselfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of her sight, the night approching, departed home to his fathers house.

            <p>The next day thinking to shake off all further remembrance of her, he gate into company of his most chosen friends, wherein before time h√©e tooke most delight, yet nowe by reason of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature, hee rather seemed weary thereof.

            <p>After that night was past, earelie the next morning h√©e wandred towardes the place where h√©e hadde behelde her with such exceeding content, and by the way as h√©e went, h√©e met with a gentlewoman named <hi>Adellena,</hi> of meane birth, and small liuing, yet of good education, who oftentimes resorted to <hi>Arbastus</hi> house, and was going thither at that instant, into whose company hee insinuated himselfe, for that h√©e sawe her alone, and said as followeth.</p>
            <p>Gentlewoman, I am bolde to intreat a word or two with you. Sir replied she, with a good will, I will satisfie you in what I can. Know you not (quoth he) <hi>Arbastus?</hi> I do quoth she, both know him, and am very well acquainted with him, vnto whose house I am nowe going. So woulde I quoth h√©e if I durst, for I serue <hi>Ornatus,</hi> sonne to <hi>Allinus,</hi> whome I doo not doubt but you know well, of whom I would tell you more, but that I feare to commit his secrets to them I knowe not, and thereby vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly doe him iniurie: but woulde you vouchsafe but to heare them, k√©epe them secret, and withall adde your help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sir replied <hi>Adellena,</hi> I knowe not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

will make m√©e acquainted with your minde, I will either doo my good will to further him, or else conceale what you shall commit to my priuitie.</p>
            <p>Then said h√©e, my maister not long since walking in yonder valley, beheld <hi>Artesia,</hi> faire <hi>Artesia,</hi> daughter to <hi>Arbastus,</hi> to whose beawtie h√©e is exceedingly inth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>alled, that vnlesse some meanes of comfort be found to ease his torments, I feare m√©e it will in daunger his life: whom you onely may pleasure, by making his loue knowne to her, in such sort as shall best agr√©e with your wisedome. This is all, and yet so much, that the reuealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may doo much harme. And to effect such a contract, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure peace and vnitie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wixt their parents. Therefore I intreate your aide and furtherance herein: with which good newes, if I returne to him, I knowe it will br√©ed no little comfort to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet heart.</p>
            <p>Sir (said sh√©e) since I perceiue his loue is grounded vpon vertue, not drawne thereto by any desire of reward, I vndertake to b√©e his assistant therein, and will to the vttermost of my best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours labour to procure his content: Which this day I will in some sort put in execution. And if you returne to m√©e to morrow, you shall knowe her answere. I wil said he, and so they departed. <hi>Ornatus</hi> hauing left her, entered into many cogitations of his rash attempt, accounting himselfe ouer credulous to commit his secrets to her priuitie, of whose fidelitie hee had neuer made try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: sometimes comforting himselfe with hope of good euent, and againe dispairing of comfort, for that h√©e supposed <hi>Artesia</hi> would rather esteeme him as an enemie then a friend, by reason of their parents hatred, and therefore would the more hardly bee drawne to giue any credit to his sute. And reuoluing a chaos of these and such like confused cogitations, he attained his fathers house, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the time tedious vntill his appointed m√©eting with <hi>Adelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>; which h√©e ouerpast with great care. <hi>Adellena</hi> after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from him, soone attained to <hi>Arbastus</hi> house, vsing her selfe as shee had formerly done, yet withall, carefull how to execute the charge sh√©e had in hand, which shee could by no occasion vtter,
<pb facs="tcp:14095:7"/>
till after dinner when sh√©e found <hi>Artesia</hi> all alone in the gardein, insinuated her self into her company, which <hi>Artesia</hi> kindly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, entring into varietie of discourses, and continuing some time in giuing certaine hearbes their proper names: amongst the rest, <hi>Artesia</hi> espied an hearbe with partie coloured leaues, demanding of <hi>Adellena</hi> if shee knewe the name thereof, which she told her she did not. I haue oftentimes quoth <hi>Artesia</hi> seene this hearbe, and it hath two prettie names, it is by some called Loue in Idlenesse, and by some Haris Case: with that <hi>Adellena</hi> fetcht a d√©epe (thogh counterfeit) sigh, which <hi>Artesia</hi> noting, said: What maketh you sigh to heare it named Haris Case? Mary (quoth sh√©e) one way because those two names so all agr√©e, an other, for by the same I call to remembrance the hearts griefe I heard a young man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of procured by loue, which was not in idlenesse, but I think in good earnest. Why quoth <hi>Artesia,</hi> can loue procure such hartes griefe to any, and not rather content? Yea said shee, because the partie in loue, hath no hope to attaine the good liking of the partie be loueth. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> quoth <hi>Artesia,</hi> I account him a foole that will loue so deeply without hope of reward: and that to b√©e rather fondnesse then true friendship, that pleaseth his affections with such inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. But I pray tel m√©e what is he into whose secrets you were so suddenly admitted? Not admitted (quoth she) for vnawares I heard his complaints, which afterwardes I promised him not to make any acquainted withall, but the partie whome he so in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ierly loueth. Then quoth <hi>Artesia,</hi> I may not know, neither doo I care, for it is but a vanitie that troubleth ones cogitations. Yes quoth sh√©e, you may and shall if you please, know who he is, conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will neither be offended with me for telling you, nor reueale what I shall impart. Why quoth she, am I the pretie, or doth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way concerne me, that I should be offended? If it be, then k√©epe your counsels vnreuealed, for it will proue vnsauorie to my sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, for be it far from me to be troubled with the vaine sutes of doting louers. Yet let me answere quoth <hi>Adellena,</hi> you heare too greeuous a conceit of loue, which is the diuine puritie whereby heartes are vnited in vertue.

therefore not to b√©e abhorred: and for that any shoulde loue your selfe, can that be an offence to you, but rather b√©e accepted in kinde sort? w√©e should by nature loue them that loue vs, then will you contrarie to nature, y√©eld hatred for loue? For you ind√©ed are the partie that is beloued, and the partie that is so farre in loue with you euery way to be commended, &amp; one way disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mended, whose name I will not reueale, &amp; then I hope I shall br√©ed no offence to your eares.

            <p>
               <hi>Adellena</hi> thought long till she was gone fearing least <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> should vpon some occasion open the Casket againe, and so find the Letter, whilest sh√©e were there, therefore sh√©e soone founde meanes to depart.

<pb facs="tcp:14095:9"/>
in all her parts, and s√©eing the light stil burning, she maruelled at her drowsinesse that had before forgate to put the same out, and by this meanes called to remembrance <hi>Adellenas</hi> sp√©eches, maruelling what hee should bee that was in loue with her, and suddenly againe, reprouing her selfe for giuing her mind libertie to think of loue, she would haue banisht al further remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof out of her minde, but the more shee laboured, the more vnable shee was to preuaile in ouermaistring her fancies, that being both vexed with her selfe, and <hi>Adellena,</hi> shee vttered these speeches.</p>
            <p>What disquiet is this possesseth my heart, procureth such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted cogitations to rise in my fancies, and disturbeth my rest?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Rnatus</hi> desirous to heare how <hi>Artesia</hi> had accepted his Letter, came to <hi>Adellenaes</hi> house, and found her w√©eping for anger, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to know the cause thereof, which sh√©e declared to him at large, which wrought suche an exc√©eding passion of griefe in his mind, that without y√©elding her either tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ks for her paines or other sp√©ech, h√©e departed: being so much ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with inward sorrow, that finding a solitarie place, h√©e laide himselfe downe vpon the earth, vttering these lamentations.</p>
            <p>O miserable castiffe, what haste thou to do but lament when thy ill fortune y√©elds nothing but cause of lament? Why shoulde thy life last to endure these tormentes, and not rather to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue into vns√©ene essences? Could any thing haue happened to m√©e more miserable, then to beholde <hi>Artesia,</hi> and now to endure her crueltie? or more fortunate, if sh√©e had bene mercifull? But my Destenies haue drawne m√©e to like her that hateth m√©e, and to become thrall to a cruell vnrelenting enemie. Well, my loue is sw√©eter then my life, and therefore I wil venture life and all to purchase her liking.</p>
            <p>Hauing said this, h√©e a while sat silent, when suddeinly to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

            <p>Syr replied sh√©e, I know not what further meanes to vse, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dare I any more attempt to trie <hi>Artesias</hi> curtesie, who is alreadie so much offended with me, that I feare to loose her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for euer, if I should vtter that againe that is so vnwelcome to her.</p>

               <hi>Ornatus</hi> hearing her sp√©eches, thought sh√©e was vnwilling to prosecute his sute any further, with a heauie hearte left her, ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into many thoughtes and cogitations which way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himselfe.

            <p>At length h√©e thought with himselfe what should make <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> so hard hearted as to giue no credit to my sp√©eches: it is not her want of lenitie, pittie, or wisedome, for sh√©e is yong, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore subiect to loue: bewtifull, and therefore to b√©e wonne wise, and therefore wil with consideration pittie my sorrowes.

My Name: for by that sh√©e reputeth m√©e an enemie: then were I not <hi>Ornatus,</hi> she woulde peraduenture giue some regard to my sutes. Therefore I will chaunge my name, and b√©e an other then I am, that sh√©e not knowing m√©e, may (if not loue m√©e) yet disist to hate m√©e: then beganne hee to studie

what meanes to vse to enioy her sight (without the which h√©e could not liue,) and yet not be knowne what he was. Amongst many other deuises, this tooke d√©epest roote. Within fewe dayes after (hauing prouided all things necessary) he attired himselfe like a virgine of a straunge Countrey (which h√©e might well be esteemed to be by his youth.) And taking with him his Lute, whereon he could play exc√©edingly well, in the silent of the night he departed towards the sea coast, which was neare vnto <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastus</hi> house: and seating himselfe vpon the Rockie shoare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to play vpon his Lute.

            <p>Faire damosell, pardon my boldnesse, if I haue disquietted you, I little thought to haue found such guestes in this homely place. <hi>Syluia</hi> knowing him to be <hi>Arbastus,</hi> arose, but made him no answere: when presently the olde shepheard came in, vsing great reuerence to <hi>Arbastus,</hi> who demaunded of him, what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosell that was, whereupon the olde man declared all that he knew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arbastus</hi> then thus said: Damosell, I vnderstand by this shepheard some part of your misfortunes, which I so much pitty, that offer to do any thing resteth in me to do you pleasure. And for that this homely place is not agr√©eable to your birth, which may be greater then I can iudge of, let me desire you to accept of such entertainment as my habitation y√©eldeth, whither you shall be welcome. <hi>Syluia</hi> being glad of that profer, yet fearing to be discouered by his willingnesse to y√©eld, made this answere.

               <hi>Ornatus</hi> being alone by himselfe, began to meditate of the good successe he had in this attempt, and how fortunatelie all things had fallen out to further him in his loue. But most of all h√©e meruailed how the eyes of all that beheld him were blinded, that they could not perceiue what he was. In these &amp; many such like comfortable meditations he spent some thr√©e or foure dayes, taking most great content in beholding <hi>Artesiaes</hi> perfections, that he was more and more inthralled in the bands of vowed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, hearing her sp√©ech, noting her behauior, admiring her vertue, commending her curtesie, affecting her bewtie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing each liniament of her diuine torme, in his deuoted affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with such immooueable resolue of constant loyaltie, that h√©e did not onely loue her, but also honor her as an I doll, beeing by <hi>Arbastus</hi> admitted her companie, that at all times h√©e was with her. <hi>Artesia</hi> likewise tooke no little pleasure in <hi>Syluians</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in whom so much curtesse abounded, that euery one both liked and commended her.</p>

For she thought if she spake true, sh√©e had good cause to say that sh√©e did, and her selfe more to be blamed then any. For notwithstanding she had giuen <hi>Adellena</hi> so flat a denial, yet her conscience knewe, that some sparks of loue were kindled in her breast: That her heart being somewhat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest with these thoughts, caused the water to stand in her eyes. <hi>Ornatus</hi> s√©eing all this, took no little comfort therat, especially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he perceiued <hi>Artesias</hi> heart to relent, but for that by his disguise, being known no other then a woman, he kept silence, when saine

            <p>I remember such Histories (quoth <hi>Artesia)</hi> but what was the end of their loue, was it not most miserable? I grant it was, (quoth <hi>Syluian</hi>) which was procured by their parents crueltie, but not their loue, wherein, notwithstanding, they tooke such felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that they rather chose to die togither then to be parted: which argueth, that the enmity twixt parents, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>not break off loue twixt the children, yet might such tragical euents haue bin preuented by wisedom. But how know I (said <hi>Artesia)</hi> whether <hi>Ornatus</hi> loue b√©e so constant or no? Can you haue any greater proofe thereof, then his own letters, the forsaking of his parents, and liuing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture in pennurie: but if you doubt of that, once againe trie him. Well (said <hi>Artesia</hi>) I asked but thy counsaile, but in stead thereof, thou vsest perswasion: but s√©eing thou art so forward to doo me good, which I hope is thy intent, if thou wilt keep my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, thou shalt know both my minde, and what I intend.

pittie <hi>Ornatus,</hi> and grant him his request: for that with often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring him, I cannot forget him, neither doth any thought please mee, but when I thinke of him. But there are so many slips to hinder our loue, that though I loue him, I shall neuer enioy him. For should my parents know hereof, they woulde prie so warily into my actions, that it were impossible for m√©e once to haue a sight of him, whome I doo scarce remember, I haue so sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome s√©ene him. You may (quoth <hi>Syluian)</hi> both loue him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy him, and since you haue begun to like of him, he being worthy thereof, and equalling you in affection, increase that loue: &amp; might I but once come to speake with him, I woulde not doubt but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

confesse I am in loue, which doth not any way worke any such effect in me as you speake off, but I take all comfort therein, my sences, heart, head, &amp; all my parts, take exc√©eding pleasure therein. Why then (quoth <hi>Artesia</hi>) sit you thus pensiuely alone, as it s√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me bewayling your estate to be in loue? I do not (quoth <hi>Syluian</hi>) sorrow that I am in loue, but that I am not beloued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: for being in loue, I haue vowed to liue so euer, and sooner shall end.

What a world is this, what villanie can be intended, that some either for fauour or reward, wil not execute? If I should trust her that is so easily wonne to do such a hainous d√©ed, might I not be accounted madde? yes, and therefore I wil not trust her: <hi>Artesia</hi> being once dispatcht, she shall follow next. <hi>Ornatus</hi> on the countrary part, was glad that he had felt the depth of <hi>Floretus</hi> counsell, thinking likewise that he was so farre in loue with him (taking him for a woman,) that for his sake he sought. <hi>Artesias</hi> death: which was the onely meanes to helpe him attaine her loue, which he likewise determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue her knowledge of, and discouer himselfe, hoping that when she sawe his innocencie, his faithfull loue, and how by his meanes her life was preserued, she would y√©eld him due guerdon for his good will.

Ay mee, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knde, and most vnnaturall Vnckle, canst thou speake me so faire and intend me so much harm? Who would haue thought so foule impietie, had ben shrowded vnder so faire pretext?

simple, to trust th√©e with his secrets? no I feare mee this is some pollicie inuented by thee to some bad cud. Yet I pray th√©e pardon me: for what canst thou get by telling me so vnlesse it were so? or not rather haue kept his counsell, &amp; then thou mightest haue b√©en my heire. And pardon I ask of th√©e good <hi>Ornatus,</hi> though thou art absent, for that I accused thee as accessarie to my fathers death, when thou art innocent.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T fel so out the next day, that the King with diuers of his company, amongst whom was his only sonne and heire <hi>Lenon,</hi> being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with trauell, arriued at <hi>Arbastus</hi> house, thinking to haue founde him there, but the King hearing of his suddaine death, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c√©edingly sorie, perswading himselfe as all men else did, that he was slaine by some of <hi>Allinus</hi> house? which made him make small tariance there, but departed to his Pallace. Now it fortuned that <hi>Lenon</hi> behelde <hi>Artesias</hi> bewtie, and was with the first view thereof, exc√©edingly bewitched, that after he was gone, he could by no meanes forget her? but determined ere long, to returne to s√©e if he could attaine her loue. Now the time was come that <hi>Floretus</hi> had appointed to set abroach his villany, and (according as <hi>Ornatus</hi> had before told <hi>Artesia</hi>) he came to her, perswading her for a season to lie in the Countrey, which she as forearmed consented vnto, and so the next morning, she with <hi>Syluian, Floretus,</hi> and diuers others, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted: at night <hi>Floretus</hi> returning, and leauing with her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had promised <hi>Syluian,</hi> and onely two seruants that were to prouide them necessaries, but knew no part of the conspiracie. When <hi>Ornatus</hi> and <hi>Artesia</hi> were alone togither, for that she was vndoubtedly assured of his loue, faith and sideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, she vsed these comfortable sp√©eches to him. <hi>Ornatus,</hi> whereas alwaies before this time too vnkindly I haue reputed you as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:14095:25"/>
it was strange to me to entertaine loue, but now I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeeld my selfe to be her subiect, and your true and faithful friend: committing my life to your custodie, and my loue and selfe to be yours to dispose of. <hi>Ornatus</hi> hearing her sp√©eches, was rauished with a heauen of ioy, with a gentle and kind behauiour, foulding her in his armes, and imprinting a sw√©ete kisse vpon her rosiate lippes, he said. Neuer was poore wretch exalted to more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse then I am, by being inriched with this inestimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of your loue. O how rich a reward haue I now reapt for my cares, and what glorie, ioy or wealth, can be compared to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of your loue? O heauenly <hi>Artesia,</hi> how fortunate haue you made <hi>Ornatus</hi>? how haue you blest <hi>Ornatus</hi>? how full of ioy is <hi>Ornatus,</hi> by your sw√©ete consent? was euer any so vnworthie, so exalted, for his kindnesse and loue? I wil performe more then my tongue can vtter, and bee more faithfull then your heart can wish. Then began they to imbrace each other, and to surfet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the sollaces, true loue yeeldeth. He sometimes lending her a kisse, and she with interest paying two for one: for one sw√©et looke two, and so many imbracings as are not to be explicated: their hands and hearts ioyned in such firme bandes of true affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is not to be dissolued: and sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etting with such exc√©eding content, as is impossible to be described. These stormes of loue somewhat mittgated, they began to consult of their daungerous estate, and to deuise how to preuent the intended mischiefe. In this place they continued some two dayes in exc√©eding content, still expecting to heare from <hi>Floretus</hi>: who the third day fearing to trust any with a matter of such waight, came himselfe to bring the potion, (yet in shew of kindnes to visite <hi>Artesia</hi>) deliuering the same to <hi>Syluian,</hi> willing her the next night to giue it her, which she promised him faithfully to accomplish.</p>
            <p>When he was gone, <hi>Artesia</hi> came to <hi>Ornatus</hi> to knowe what newes <hi>Floretus</hi> brought, who tolde her all, and shewed her the poyson in a glasse, which he had charged should be giuen to her the next day. With that <hi>Artesia</hi> beganne to wayle and exclaime against her Vnckle, in most extreame sort. But <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:25"/>
intreated her to cease such vaine griefe, which could not hurt him, but her selfe, promising her to preuent the same, if sh√©e would follow his counsell<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> which she willingly yeelded vnto. Then quoth h√©e, let vs presently depart hence to <hi>Adellenaes</hi> house, which you know is not farre off, who you know is agreed with vs alreadie, where I will leaue you, and returne. Which said, while the seruants were absent vpon some speciall occasion, they departed with little labour, arriuing at <hi>Adellenas</hi> house, who was readie to receiue them, and after many farwels, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> returned backe to the Lodge. And when it was supper time, the seruants brought vp meate, but <hi>Ornatus</hi> tolde them that <hi>Artesia</hi> was scarce well, and therefore they would not sup that night. And being alone by himselfe, he studied what excuse to make for <hi>Artesias</hi> absence, when <hi>Floretus</hi> should come, spending that night in much care, and many vnquiet cogitations, which tooke away his sleepe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Floretus</hi> was no sooner returned from the Lodge, but h√©e met <hi>Lenon,</hi> who of purpose came to m√©ete <hi>Artesia,</hi> whom <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus</hi> kindly saluted: maruelling much wherefore h√©e came: to ease which doubt, <hi>Lenon</hi> said.</p>
            <p>My friend <hi>Floretus,</hi> I come to visite the faire <hi>Artesia,</hi> to whose beawtie I am inthralled, not as regarding her wealth, but her sweete loue, of whome you onely haue the gouernment: therefore I pray befriend me so much, that I may come to sp√©ech with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For it is not her possessions I regard, but her loue, therefore I pray resolue me of your minde herein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:26"/>My Lord replied h√©e, your offer is so bountifull, besides my dutie vrging me, I am readie to performe your will to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of my power. I thanke you good <hi>Floretus</hi> quoth <hi>Lenon,</hi> then I pray th√©e bring m√©e to her, for my loue is impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. My Lord replied he, that can I not do instantly, for <hi>Artesia</hi> some two daies past, with the straunge damosell <hi>Syluian,</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thence, and are nowe at the Lodge: whither (if you please to to take such entertainment as this place y√©eldeth) w√©e wil both goe to morrow morning. Agreed quoth <hi>Lenon,</hi> I will accept your profer. When the time of rest was come, <hi>Floretus</hi> being alone by himselfe, entred into these cogitations. What inconueniences hast thou runne into <hi>Floretus</hi>? Thou hast hyred one to murther <hi>Artesia,</hi> in hope to get her wealth, and made <hi>Syluian</hi> acquainted with thy counsell, which wealth thou maiest now attaine by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing her life: and besides, winning her to loue <hi>Lenon,</hi> thou shalt finde him thy faithfull friend for euer. What wert thou then best to doo? if thou shouldest murther her, h√©e would make enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of her death, and so thou b√©e vndone: If not, then wil <hi>Syluian</hi> b√©e displeased, and so bewray thy drift: that the mischiefes thou by folly hast runne into, are so intricate, that thou knowest not which way to shunne them. Were it not better to saue her life, and winne her Loue for <hi>Lenon,</hi> then to poyson her, and so to die my selfe? If I saue her life, <hi>Syluian</hi> will be discontented: what of that? then let <hi>Syl√πian</hi> smart for it, for if she wil not b√©e conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that I shall doo, she shall neuer liue to bewray my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. And therefore wil I first trie her, and finding any suspition thereof, I will stabbe her my selfe, whose death I may eastlier an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere then <hi>Artesias.</hi> Early the next morning, <hi>Lenon</hi> and he rode to the Lodge, where no sooner arriued, but he met with <hi>Syluian,</hi> to whom he said: How now <hi>Syluian,</hi> I haue newes of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to bewray to th√©e, <hi>Lenon</hi> whome thou here beholdest, is sonne to the King, who is d√©eply in loue with <hi>Artesia,</hi> and hath giuen me assurance of all <hi>Arbastus</hi> liuings, if I can win <hi>Artesia</hi> to match with him, now I thinke it good to deferre our purpose as concerning her death, vntil w√©e haue made triall whether sh√©e

Which if we can effect, we shall be quit of so cruel a d√©ed, enioy her heritage, and haue an assured friend of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> whilest we liue: therefore let me know your opinion herein. <hi>Syluian</hi> was exc√©edingly amazed to heare his sp√©eches, thinking that if he did tel him where <hi>Artesia</hi> was, she should be wrested from his possession, and so himselfe disappointed of her loue: and on the other side, he thought what michiefe would arise if he should say he had already giuen her the poyson, yet his loue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maistring the feare of any daunger, made him say, All this I like: but <hi>Floretus,</hi> it is now too late, for I haue caused <hi>Artesia</hi> to drink the poyson you deliuered me, and she is dead, which was of such force, that all her bodie purpled into blisters and swellings, which because I knew would bewray what we had done, I tooke her bodie and conueyed it into a deepe pit, where it is impossible to be found. <hi>Floretus</hi> now fearing to haue his treason bewrayed, thought to stabbe <hi>Syluian</hi>; and so to be rid of them both, that in a monstrous rage he drew his dagger, and vnawares strooke <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian</hi> in the left arme, who f√©eling the smart, with violenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With that <hi>Lenon</hi> parting them, demaunded what the matter was: <hi>Floretus</hi> thinking rather to accuse, then be accused himselfe, and terrified with affright, saide that wicked woman hath murthered <hi>Artesia.

            <p>
               <hi>Adellena</hi> brooking no delay which in those affaires was daungerous, stood not to immitate of those gr√©efes, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily euery thing fell out, but with all haste returned to <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> who espying her comming, thought her countenance bewrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some vnwelcome accident; hastily enquiring how <hi>Ornatus</hi> did. <hi>Adellena</hi> for want of breath could not speake a good space, but at the last sh√©e said. <hi>Artesia,</hi> tedious lament is not now to be vsed, but sp√©edie counsell how to saue <hi>Ornatus,</hi> for h√©e is carried before the King, is accused by <hi>Floretus</hi> to haue murthered you, for comming to the Lodge with <hi>Lenon</hi> the Kings sonne, who pretendeth great loue to you, and not finding you, <hi>Ornatus</hi> tolde <hi>Floretus</hi> he had giuen you the poyson, whereupon <hi>Floretus</hi> wold haue slaine him, but <hi>Ornatus</hi> taking his dagger from him, had done the like to him, had not <hi>Lenon</hi> stept betwixt them. Then <hi>Floretus</hi> accused him for your death, and he <hi>Floretus</hi>: and both were yesterday carried before the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:28"/>Ahlas poore <hi>Ornatus,</hi> said <hi>Artesia,</hi> what miserie is befallen th√©e for my sake? howe art thou rewarded for preseruing my life? Good <hi>Adellena,</hi> counsell me what is to be done: <hi>Ornatus</hi> being amongst them a reputed straunger, hauing no friend to pleade for him, and peraduenture ouerswayed by <hi>Floretus</hi> persurie, may haue his life indaungered, and the rather for that he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be a <hi>Natolian.</hi> Therefore <hi>Adellena,</hi> if thou louest him or me, will saue both his and my life, and discharge him of that false accusation, runne to the Court, and finding out <hi>Lenon,</hi> tell him at my safetie, and request him for my sake to pittie poore <hi>Sylui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Adellena</hi> according to her commaundement, mounted a Horse, and with great sp√©ede by that time it was night, attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Court, and finding out <hi>Lenon,</hi> vttered these speeches. Most worthie <hi>Lenon,</hi> vouchsafe to heare me speake: The faire <hi>Artesia</hi> whome you suppose dead, is aliue and in safetie at my house, who hath sent me vnto you in the behalfe of <hi>Syluian,</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring some wrong might b√©e done to her, as inspected to b√©e her death, when she onely hath preserued her life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenon</hi> was so amazed at her sp√©eches, that h√©e could not tel what to say, being exc√©edingly gr√©eued for <hi>Syluian,</hi> but at length tolde her what his Father had done: which appalled her sences with deadly feare. <hi>Lenon,</hi> notwithstanding it somewhat gr√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him for <hi>Syluian,</hi> yet his heart was glad to heare of <hi>Artesias</hi> safetie, and therefore h√©e determined to goe with <hi>Adellena</hi> to visit her; which likewise h√©e performed, and entring where shee was, making exc√©eding lamentation, he said.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Artesia</hi> hearing his sp√©eches, with verie gr√©efe fell into a deadly traunce, both <hi>Lenon</hi> and <hi>Adellena</hi> hauing much a doo to bring her life againe. And being conueyed to her bed, when her sences were come to their perfect vse, and <hi>Lenon</hi> standing by her, whose sigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which saide, another flood of brinishe teares ouerflowed her eyes, and her passage of sp√©eche was stopt by heart-pearcing
<pb facs="tcp:14095:29"/>
sighings, which in confused multitudes issued with her sw√©ete breath, neuer ceasing her lamentes, but still bewayling her true Loues absence, that it pearced <hi>Adellenaes</hi> hearte with suche sorrowe, that sh√©e wept as fast as <hi>Artesia,</hi> both being so much greeued, that they seemed to striue howe to exc√©ede one another in laments. In which sorrowfull estate, <hi>Artesia</hi> remained so long, that sh√©e waxed extreame sicke; and grewe to that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that <hi>Adellena</hi> feared her death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenon</hi> likewise being come to the Court, gat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> being left in the Countrey of <hi>Natolia,</hi> tooke his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes in such heauie sort, that had not his hope to see <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> againe withheld him, h√©e had offered himselfe some outrage, for a season giuing himselfe to forlorne and carelesse desperation, neyther regarding which way to prouide for his safetie, nor otherwise respecting what daunger hee might runne into in that straunge Countrey, for the Moores had landed him in a waste and desolate Coaste of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Thus carelesse did h√©e continue a whole night and a day, not so muche as s√©eing toode to preserue him from famine: but in the ende, hunger constrained him to s√©eke succour, but when his stomacke serued him, hee coulde finde no meate, that with the extremitie thereof, calling to remembrance his estate, h√©e vttered these plaints.</p>
            <p>Thus contrary is Nature to her subiects, sometimes hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to the tappe of all felicitie, and then with violence tumbling them downe headlong into the depth of extreame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.</p>
            <p>Was euer more fortunate, and suddenly miserable then I am? Coulde euer any man whatsoeuer, attaine more heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felicitie and happinesse then I did, by being possess of <hi>Artesia?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:30"/>
and now againe more accurst being thus far absented from her: and banished my natiue soyle into a straunge Countrey, readie to be famished or deuoured by wild beasts, or that which is worst, neuer likely to see <hi>Artesia</hi> againe. How could any man containe himselfe from desperatenesse, being so miserable as I am? How can I withholde my hands from murthering my selfe, when by doing it, I should bee ridde out of a wretched life? What should I doo, which way should I goe? Here I am in a desolate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented place, where no humane creatures inhabit, but wilde beasts, without foode, without weapons, in womans apparrell, and without hope of comfort. Shall I state here? then shall I b√©e famished: shall I leaue this place and trauell further? then I goe further from my beloued, and m√©eting with some raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous beast, may be deuoured. Now being hungrie I want foode, and here is none, vnlesse I will eate the earth, leaues of tr√©es, or rootes of the grasse. Well I will s√©eke my fortune, b√©e it good or ill: and in this desperate moode hee trauelled on, and by good fortune founde a Tree laden with exc√©eding, pleasant, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruite, with which h√©e slenched his hunger: not farre from which place, he tooke vp his nights lodging.</p>
            <p>Early the next morning he arose, first filling his belly, and then his lappe with that pleasant fruite, the taste whereof, was lyke pleasant wine, that being drunke in abundance, will make the head light: which made <hi>Ornatus</hi> hearte merrie, that he trauelled on space, but Fortune not contented with the miserie he had endured alreadie, sent him in an other affliction: hee entered into a place like a Forrest, beset with Tr√©es of huge proportion, scattered here and there, where h√©e met with a wild and fierce Boore, that haunted those Desarts, who espying <hi>Ornatus,</hi> with a terrible groyning bristled himselfe comming towardes him, <hi>Ornatus</hi> being now driuen to his vttermost shiftes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to runne with all his force from the beast, but hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the more sp√©ede had almost ouertaken him, when one of the Apples <hi>Ornatus</hi> carried about him fell downe, and the Boore espying the same, staled his haste to take it vp, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:14095:30"/>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> had gotten some little ground of him, and s√©eing him so much affect the fruite, cast downe another Apple after which the Boore runne, with gr√©edinesse deuouring the same. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> was glad of this poore shifte, and still cast downe one Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and then another, that in the ende he had almost throwne away all, and notwithstanding that, feared to be destroyed, but the Boore f√©eling his belly full, and his hunger stauncht, left off his egar pursute and followed him more cearelesly, whom he still fedde with Apples, so long as his store lasted, that in the ende the Boore being drunke with the pleasant fruite, began to r√©ele and stagger, and lying downe fast a sl√©epe, which <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> s√©eing, hauing no other then a knife about him, with the same approached the Boore, and without feare, violently thrust the same so d√©epe into the Boores briffled side, that it pearced his heart, and he after some strugling died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> then helde vp his hands to heauen for ioy, exc√©eding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applauding this his fortunate and vnexpected escape; which he tooke as a fortunate presage of good successe. But yet before he could determine what to doo, Fortune once againe showed her mutabilitie, for when <hi>Ornatus</hi> had parted the Boores head from his huge bodie, and with the same was readie to depart, there past by as it seemed, a knight gallantly mounted, in gr√©en armor, who espying a woman bearing the Boores head, drew towards her, and said: Woman where hadst thou that Boores head? I pray th√©e deliuer it me. <hi>Ornatus</hi> made this answere. Sir I n√©ed not doo either, vnlesse I know more cause then as yet I doo. The Knight hearing that short answere, alighted, and saide: I will shewe no other reason but that I will haue it: with that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to striue for the same, but <hi>Ornatus</hi> hauing more minde to his sword then to keepe the Boores head, suddenly caught holde on the <hi>Natalians</hi> sword, and drew the same out, which when he had gotten, he said: Disloyall and discourteous Knight, now wil I k√©epe the Boores head in despight of th√©e, with that hee thrust at him, and contrary to his thought, wounded him so d√©epe that he le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:14095:31"/>
knowing how discurteously he would haue vsed him, let passe all further remorse, and casting off his womans apparell, put on the Knights apparell and Armour, mounted the st√©ede, and with the Boores head, roads backe the same way h√©e sawe the Knight come, and within a little space, found a beaten way that conducted him to a goodly Towne, whose Turret toppes he sawe long before h√©e came to the same: then began h√©e to studie what to doe, sometimes thinking it best not to enter into the Towne, from whence it is likely the Knight h√©e slewe came, and so he b√©eing taken for him might b√©e knowne, and so afterwards indaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his death. For peraduenture the Knight might be of good estimation, and of purpose sent to slay the Boore, and if it should be knowne that he had slain him, his friends would for the same, and the rather for that he was a straunger, prosecute sharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge against him. Whilst he was in these meditations, he came neare the Towne, not fully resolued what to doo, where he was soone espied of some of the people, who s√©eing the Boores head, came running towards him making exc√©eding ioy: which when he saw, he thought it too late to turne back, but that he must go on and hazard the worst: and being entred the Towne, a number of the Inhabitants flocked about him, some with garlands, some with praises, and all with ioy, vttering these sp√©eches. Welcome home most braue <hi>Alprinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> then perfectly knew that the Knights name was <hi>Alprinus,</hi> and went of purpose to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lea the Boore, whome they tooke him to be, and that he must of necessitie be knowne? which draue him into exc√©eding care what excuse to make, to auoide the danger of death. Then presently he beheld a troope of bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Damosels, with the sowndes of sw√©ete Musicke comming towards him, (amongst whom, one as chiefe and more bewtifull then the rest, was crowned with a wreathe of flowers, bearing another in her hand) who all at once applauded his victorie, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before him, vntill he came into the middest of the Towne where satte the chiefe Magistrates, where the Damosell that was crowned, thus spake to him.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> hearing her sp√©eches, thought to trie the end of this aduenture, which could be no worse then death, which of force he must now hazard, alighted, laying downe the Boores head vpon a Table that stood before the Auncients, with humble and comely behauiour kissing the Damoselles hande, who set the wreathe of Flowers vpon his head, and taking him by the hand, brought him before the Auncients, one of whome stoode vp and said? Worthie Gentleman, whereas before thou wert by vs adiudged to die as worthie thereof, for this thy valiant d√©ed, we fr√©ely pardon thee, and acquite th√©e from all trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that thou host commited against any whomsoeuer vntill this present houre.</p>

And Gentleman quoth he, take her as thine owne, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as she was by birth adopted mine: and after my death, be thou inheritour of my land.</p>
            <p>To all this <hi>Ornetus</hi> gaue a reuerent consent, and the night now approaching, he with <hi>Lucida</hi> went to her fathers house, where was a great feast prouided, from which <hi>Ornatus</hi> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe in this sort. When he was entred the house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still Armed, only lifting vp his Beuer, he tooke <hi>Lucida</hi> by the hand, and withdrawing her aside, said.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Yesterday, I trauailed through the Forrest, or desart, where I met <hi>Alprinus,</hi> sore wounded, and flying from the Boore that pursued him with celeritie: which when I behelde, to rescue him from death, I set vppon the Boore, and by good fortune slew him: which when he behelde, he declared to me the cause of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ming: which when I heard, pittying his estate, I bid him take the boores head, and withall, helpe him to mount his st√©ed, but his woundes would not suffer him to ride, that I was in some feare of his life.

            <p>Now I most humbly intreat you for his sake, to conceale what I am, that I be not knowne: and so both disappoint your selfe of his loue, and him of safetie.

This said, she went to her father, and so preuailed with him, that he was contented sh√©e should haue the tending of him: whome she tooke to a chamber, suffering none to

            <p>My Lord (replied <hi>Artesia)</hi> I thanke you for your good will, but I know not how to accept of your loue, being yet so far from knowing what it is, that if I should but dreame thereof, my heart would be out of quiet: besides, many cares continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the same, and my meane estate so farre vnworthy thereof, with innumerable other discontents and cares that I would make my selfe subiect vnto: that I had rather a thousand times remaine in the estate I am now in.

            <p>In this sort did he daily visite her, still growing more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, amongst many other, this conference past betwixt them: <hi>Artesia</hi> (quoth he) how long shall I sue, and be frustrated in my hopes, by your vnkindnesse? is your heart hardned against me? Or am I of so base conditions, that you cannot conceiue well of me? Or is it possible you beare so hatefull a conceit of loue as you make shewe for? then may I accuse mine eyes, that haue betrayed my sences, in making them your thrall: then may I thinke my woe began, when I first began to loue.

            <p>
               <hi>Artesia</hi> hearing her sp√©eches, beganne to consider ind√©ede what follie it was to refuse her meate, and for feare to shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten her selfe by distemperating her selfe, which might bee the meanes to further <hi>Lenons</hi> intent, whome shee knewe would seeke her life, if h√©e coulde not winne her loue, sh√©e presently left off suche desperate behauiour, and with well wayed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, attended the euent of the worst misfortune, that from that time shee both eate her meate, and did all that sh√©e coulde to comfort her selfe, still liuing in good hope of <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> returne.</p>
            <p>Some fewe dayes after, <hi>Lenon</hi> came to the Fortresse againe, enquiring of <hi>Flera</hi> howe <hi>Artesia</hi> fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

me alone to perswade her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenon</hi> was ruled by the olde woman, and came where <hi>Artesia</hi> was saluting her, but sh√©e disdaining either to looke on him, or heare him speake, withdrewe her selfe from his presence. Wherewith h√©e departed, willing <hi>Flera</hi> to doo that which sh√©e had vndertaken. And <hi>Flera</hi> finding her as sh√©e thought in a fit moode, beganne to commune with her of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, amongst which loue was one. <hi>Artesia</hi> a while heard her, but in the end, perceiuing her drift; cut her off with these sp√©eches.</p>
            <p>Olde iniquitie, I knowe whereto thy talke tendeth: thinkest thou I will euer harbour a thought of <hi>Lenon,</hi> that hath vsed m√©e thus dishonourably? no rather will I rent my wofull heart from out my brest before his face: neither n√©edest thou tell m√©e that h√©e hath intreated thee to speake for him, for I knowe too well both his and thy intent, which shall nothing preuaile, but harden my heart against him. Therefore doo not speake to me, for I will not heare th√©e, nor answere th√©e: but hate him, th√©e, and thy counsell, and remaine so constant in despising him, that a thousand deathes shall not alter m√©e. Is it loue that hath made him with violence carrie me from my friendes, make me a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and commit me to the custodie of such a hellishe hagge as thy selfe? If that be his loue, let him turne it to hatred, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer trouble me, but with hating me: for in so dooing, he shall better please me.</p>

Therefore y√©elde to that which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest or stand to my mercy. Canst thou bestowe thy loue better then on so honourable a Prince?

            <p>
               <hi>Artesia</hi> trembling for feare, made this answere onely to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her, I am contented to b√©e ruled by <hi>Lenon,</hi> whose meaning I knowe is honourable.

If this will not satisfie you, then do the worst you can: for death is more welcome to m√©e then life in these extremities.

Sir, I know not how to mitigate my grief, when it increaseth: or how can I be voyd of care, vnlesse I should grow altogither carelesse, being only subiect to woe, &amp; none so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as my selfe, hauing indured so many afflictions &amp; crosses in all respects, that I know not how to assure my selfe of the least quiet? Then giue me leaue to continue my endlesse plaints, &amp; doo not blame me of impatiencie, nor think I suspect your speeches, or distrust your fidelitie, if in some sort I continue my sorrowes: for I haue so long continued in them, as I can better away with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> then mirth: for that to me is a stranger. Yet notwithstanding my hart will harbour some quiet, if by your curtesie I may rest in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, and b√©e sheltred from wrong. By this time they were arriued at their place of harbour, which was betwixt the hollow

of two Rocks, or rather Rockie Ilands, where their ship lay safe from weather, and so farre vnder their shadowe, that it could not b√©e s√©ene.

When hauing fastned their ship, <hi>Luprates</hi> brought <hi>Artesia</hi> into the Caue, who beholding the same, was surprised with an exc√©eding discomfort, of euer getting from thence.</p>
            <p>Some of the ruder sort liking <hi>Artesia,</hi> began their rude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour towards her, but <hi>Lupratus</hi> stepping vnto them, vttered these sp√©eches.

Then performe those conditions, and let her belong to vs all, or to the chiefest of vs, &amp; in so doing, neither of vs shall sustaine wrong: thus began they to contend about <hi>Artesia,</hi> euery one desirous to possesse her, &amp; yet neither willing any shuld haue her but himselfe, that they were likely to mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>She had scarce ended those words, but <hi>Ornatus</hi> espied a ship euen then come a shore, where theirs was cast away, most of the men landed, which was the shippe wherein <hi>Lenon</hi> was, who beheld the other shippe cast away, and the storme being ceased arriued there. From whome <hi>Ornatus</hi> knewe not howe to hide himselfe: and <hi>Artesia</hi> not so much as thinking <hi>Lenon</hi> had bene in it, but that it was some ship that likewise by the storme was driuen to lande there. Presently the men beganne to spredde themselues euery way, and some of them soone espied <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> giuing <hi>Lenon</hi> knowledge thereof, who immediately came towardes her, most kindely saluting her, but sh√©e beeing exc√©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly dismayed with his sight, whome sh√©e most mortally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for verie griefe burst into teares, that in aboundance gusht from her eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenon</hi> maruelling thereat, (and little thinking howe much sh√©e hated him, and how vnwelcome he was) rather expecting thankes for his paines then reproofe, said; My deare <hi>Artesia,</hi> bee not now discomforted, since there is no further cause of care, I haue most diligently laboured to release you from griefe euer since <hi>Allinus</hi> by treason conueyed you from my custodie: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your absence in great heauinesse, for that it pinched my heart to thinke you shoulde fall into suche distresse: but nowe that all those misfortunes are past, I beseech you goe with m√©e to the Court, where I will labour to procure your content.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artesias</hi> heart was vexed to heare his speeches, that she made him this answere.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:46"/>Most discurteous <hi>Lenon,</hi> none but your selfe are cause of my woe, whose sight more tormenteth m√©e, then all the afflictions I euer endured: <hi>Allinus</hi> carried me ind√©ed from the gr√©ene For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, not by treason, but to shelter me from dishonour, which you did intend, else would you not haue inffered mee to endure such miseries as I did by my hellish k√©eper. Thinke you I haue cause either to thinke you intend my good, or take any comfort by your presence, when you onely disquiet me, not suffering me to enjoy my libertie, but would perforce constrain me to that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not like. Had you left me in <hi>Adellenas</hi> house, then had I not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into such miseries as since that I haue endured, nor <hi>Allinus</hi> for his vertue haue bene brought to pouertie, that being before my professed enemie, s√©eing my miserie, it so mollified his heart, that he hath pittied me, and sought my libertie, and onely by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, not by iustice, haue you sought his ouerthrow. Then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you leaue me here, for I had rather indure the hazard of my misfortune, then liue to be tormented with your importunacie. <hi>Lenon</hi> was so amazed to heare her vnkind reply, litle thinking he had bene so much out of her fauour, that he could not tel what to say: sometimes thinking to leaue her there, and vtterly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake her, but that thought was soone ouercome by his affection or violent sting of desire to enioy her loue: that once againe he said; Why <hi>Artesia</hi> doo you regard my good will no more, then for my paines, to y√©elde me rebukes: and for my loue, disdaine? That I caused you to be brought from <hi>Adellenas</hi> house, was, for that being there you were subiect to many misfortunes. And if I imprisoned <hi>Allinus,</hi> it was for that I supposed him your enemy, and feared he would haue done you wrong: so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer I did with intent of good, you repay me with dislike: &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert all my doings to the worst meaning: wherein you shewe your selfe too cruell, that will not y√©eld me the least fauour for my constant loue. O <hi>Artesia</hi> be not so hard hearted, <hi>Artesia</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding many faire promises, vowes, and protestations he made, would not y√©eld to go with him, but desired rather that he would leaue her there. <hi>Lenon</hi> tolde her, though not for his sake,
<pb facs="tcp:14095:46"/>
yet for her safetie, it were best for her to goe: which said, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his seruants to place her in a Litter. Which when sh√©e sawe sh√©e must n√©edes doo, shee called to <hi>Ornatus,</hi> saying: Good Palmer go along with m√©e, that for the kindnesse you haue show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in preseruing my life, I may y√©eld you some recompence. And (quoth sh√©e) to <hi>Lenon,</hi> I request nothing of you for my selfe, but for this straunge Pilgrim, who when by the storme the ship was cast away, I readie to perish, caught me out of the water and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued my life: and do not for his good will to me, vse him as you did my deare <hi>Syluian,</hi> whom you banished, for that she preserued my life from my vnkind vnckle, with that shee wept exc√©edingly. Then <hi>Lenon</hi> asked <hi>Ornatus</hi> what h√©e was, I am (quoth h√©e) as you see, a Pilgrim, that was forced to come aboord the Pyrates ship, and (amongst the rest) was readie to perish, but that by the diuine prouidence, I was ordained to preserue that vertuous Damosels life. For that d√©ede quoth <hi>Lenon,</hi> I will reward you most kindly: therefore go along with vs. Then they all departed to the Court. <hi>Lenon</hi> presently caused <hi>Artesia</hi> to b√©e lodged in a most sumptuous place of the Court, appointing diuers Damsels to attend her, thinking by those meanes to win her to consent to loue him: but all proued vaine, his care was cast away, his cost to little effect, and his kindnesse vnregarded. For <hi>Artesia</hi> was so constant to <hi>Ornatus,</hi> that sh√©e hated <hi>Lenon</hi>: her heart was wholly imployed to wish his good, and <hi>Lenons</hi> ill. For she deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined neuer to loue him, though shee were assured of <hi>Ornatus</hi> death: that she spent her time in continuall care &amp; sadnesse, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no signe of ioy, no shewe of comfort, but euen as one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded no rest, nor tooke felicitie in any thing, that <hi>Lenon</hi> both admired the same, and laboured by many meanes to alter that humour: but the more h√©e sought to please her, the more she was displeased: and more discontented at his kindnesse then any thing else. In this sort she continued many dayes, without the least shewe of alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> all this while remaining in the Court, (making the cause of his state) to receiue <hi>Lenons</hi> promised reward, whereas

Can <hi>Artesia</hi> thinke either valour or vertue to rest in th√©e, when sh√©e shall know how neare thou art her soe, but darest not touch him? will sh√©e not est√©eme shee a coward and vnworthie to enioy her loue? Nay when sh√©e knoweth this, will she not alter her loue? Why shouldest not thou s√©eke thy owne content, though it b√©e with his discontent? thou art euery way as good as h√©e by birth, though h√©e now rule the land: hath not thy father said, that his father was but a Captaine in the last Kings dayes, and by treason put his lawfull King to death, and so wanne the rule?

Therefore I pray thee giue consent to follow my counsel herein. <hi>Ornatus</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be imployed in that businesse, which fell out according to his hearts desire: and therfore made him this answere.

Leaning her arme vppon a Chaire, and her ch√©eke laide vppon the backe of her hand: when hee beheld her sitting in this discomfortable sort, his hart was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to melt with remorse: and h√©e breathed forth so bitter a sigh, that sh√©e heard the same, which he perceiuing came towards her with humble behauiour, saying. Most vertuous Ladie, pardon my presumption, in presuming thus vnmannerly to interrupt your quiet: <hi>Lenon</hi> the Prince hath appointed me to be your atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dant, therefore I bes√©eche you, notwithstanding I am his substitute: commaund me in any doubtful sort, and I will most willingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my vttermost indeuours to purchase your content. <hi>Artesia</hi> raising her selfe from the ground, said. Pilgrim, I thanke you for your kinde profer, and am glad you are my keeper, for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: one, for that I trust your vertues will not suffer me to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured, the other, for that I would heare out your discourse of my deare friend <hi>Ornatus,</hi> which I was hindred from by <hi>Lenons</hi> suddaine finding me. Ladie, (quoth he) you shalbe assured of the one, and heare more of the other, if first you will vouchsafe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, to heare my sp√©ech, and suffer me to execute the charge <hi>Lenon</hi> hath giuen m√©e, and I haue vndertaken. Why what is
<pb facs="tcp:14095:48"/>
that (quoth <hi>Artesia</hi>) I wil not be offended? <hi>Lenon</hi> hath made knowne to me his loue, and how long, and with what constancie it is grounded, commaunding and intreating me in his behalfe to become an humble suter vnto you: he telleth me that stil you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently disdain him without cause, reason, or consideration. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly desire, both for that he is constant, a Prince, and of good and vertuous gifts, y√©elde to his loue or else to satisfie me of the chiefest reasons that withold you from the same. Pilgrim (quoth she) for that my minde perswadeth me, you in wisedome will conceiue of reason: and will be faithfull in concealing that which I shall disclose: I answere you thus. First, admit <hi>Lenon</hi> did loue m√©e (yet by his vsage I finde the contrary) nor I cannot fancie him, for that I alreadie haue plighted my faith to another, more worthie then himselfe, which is that most vertuous &amp; kinde Gentleman <hi>Ornatus,</hi> who likewise equalleth me in affection: and therefore I should dishonour my name, breake my faith, and reape perpetuall infamy, if I should shewe my selfe so inconstant. These I thinke are reasons (to a reasonable creature) sufficient, and of such force, as none can contradict: and therefore no more can be said therein. Besides were not all this so, you haue no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to perswade me to that which I haue so often denied, and will neuer y√©eld vnto. Your reasons ind√©ed (quoth he) are great, and the cause such, as should no way be violated: but now you are subiect to his mercie: and he may inforce you to that which you are most vnwilling to haue done: then what remedie haue you, but rather to y√©elde, then indure such extremitie as he may vse? Yes, (quoth she) when I can preserue my selfe no longer from his lust, death shall rid mee from his power, which I will execute vpon my selfe, rather then condiscend to y√©eld him so much as an outward shewe of fauour. Therefore I pray vse no more words tending to the breach of my faith, and furtherance of his loue, for kne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore <hi>Ornatus</hi> said? My most deare and kind <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesia,</hi> by whose loue my life is preserued. I am not able to expresse the ioy my heart conceiueth, by this fortunate m√©eting, b√©eing likewise as sory to thinke of the misfortune you haue indured by my carelesse ouersight, and how to get you from this place, and from <hi>Lenons</hi> affection, whom I know to b√©e of such vnciuill a disposition, that he will leaue no disloyall meanes vnattempted to further his intent.</p>
            <p>Therefore in this vrgent extremitie, if you will be contented to est√©eme me as your friend, and follow my directions, I will labor all that I can to get you from this place. My true friend <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (said <hi>Artesia</hi>) I haue dedicated my self to your disposition, and made my selfe all one with you, both in heart, body, and minde, that whatsoeuer you would wish your selfe, you do to me, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer pleaseth you, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>not displease me, for I am your selfe: therfore I commit all things to your wisdome &amp; rest to be ruled, counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ordered by you, in whatsoeuer you shall thinke conuenient: and will doo any thing you shall counsaile me vnto, both for our escape from hence, or otherwise: accounting my blisse yours, and yours mine, your cares mine, and your quiet, my content.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenons</hi> loue is most hatefull vnto me, and iniutie to you, then what meanes can you work to ridde me, of that and reuenge your owne wrong, performe, for my consent is readie to y√©eld to any thing you shall thinke conuenient.</p>
            <p>I most humbly thank you, said <hi>Ornatus,</hi> and first I think this is the best course, to procure my good liking with him, and to rid vs from hence, that at his next comming, you shewe a little more friendly contenance vnto him, then heretofore you haue done, as shall best agr√©e with your wisdome, and he perceiuing that my seruice hath done more for him then euer he could attaine, will not only credit me, but also be ruled by m√©e in any thing I shall counsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:14095:50"/>
I would neuer of my selfe y√©elde vnto, for that my loue to you, and hate so him, would not suffer me so much to dissemble: but I pray God deliuer me well from forth of his power, that I may in quiet enioy your sw√©ete company. These sp√©eches being ended, they parted with a sw√©ete kisse, he sighing, and she for griefe shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding teares. Not long after <hi>Lenon</hi> came to <hi>Ornatus,</hi> requesting to know whether he had preuailed any thing with <hi>Artesia</hi> in his behalfe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> My Lord (quoth he) I haue vsed many perswasions to her, which in some sort haue preuailed, but hereafter I doo not doubt by my perswasions, but to winne her full consent: if you with wisdome will be directed by me, and not with rashnesse marre all: therefore goe in vnto her, but not to rashly, and s√©e if she be not altered, <hi>Lenon</hi> imbraced him in his armes, saying: thou bringest me tydings of exceeding comfort, for which I will reward thee most bountifully, With that he gaue him a purse of gold: which <hi>Ornatus</hi> tooke, thinking that should be a meanes to further him, and hinder the giuer <hi>Lenon</hi> entred <hi>Artesias</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, vsing many kinde speeches and submisse behauiours, whome she vsed more kindly then euer she had before done, which both filled his heart with ioy, and made him according to the Pilgrims directions, more carefull of his behauiour, least by any boldnesse he might offend her, that hauing past some small time with her, he departed.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Ornatus</hi> studying how to release <hi>Artesia,</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whose intent, the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:14095:50"/>
else to giue him open defiance for war. The articles were these: that <hi>Allinus</hi> shoulde b√©e restored to his lands, and the dammage and losse he had sustained, should b√©e repaied to the full, that his wife should b√©e recalled from banishment, and that he should y√©eld vp <hi>Artesia</hi> to <hi>Allinus,</hi> if sh√©e should b√©e in his custodie and that the King and <hi>Lenon</hi> should bee sworne to performe all this. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> was easily wonne, and therefore presently sent foure of his Noble men as Ambassadors, to request the performance of those conditions. Who euen at that instant were landed in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and newes thereof brought to the Court, the King being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe somewhat sickly, sent <hi>Lenon</hi> to m√©ete them, and giue them entertainment: who was loth to go from <hi>Artesias</hi> sight, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring himselfe of the Pilgrims faith, committed her wholly to his custodie. <hi>Ornatus</hi> thought it now the fittest time to s√©eke to escape, but he was hindred by other of <hi>Lenons</hi> seruants, whome he had secretly appointed as ouerseers to looke into the Pilgrims action: that it was impossible for him to attempt any thing that way, but it must needs both be discouered and preuented. <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> s√©eing himselfe disappointed of his purpose that way, made <hi>Artesia</hi> acquainted with what h√©e intended, and how he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, spending the time of <hi>Lenons</hi> absence continually in her company. But hauing met the <hi>Armenian</hi> Ambassadors, brought them to the Court, where they were honourably entertained, and hauing declared their Embassage, <hi>Thaeon</hi> the King, tolde them they should receiue answere within two daies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenon</hi> hearing the articles, counselled his father not to y√©eld to performe any such conditions, but rather to send <hi>Turbulus</hi> defiance For (quoth hee) your Maiestie are as absolutely King of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> as hee of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and then what dishonour were it vnto you to stoope to his commaund, and shewe your selfe as it were affraid of his threats? for to binde your selfe to this, were to become his subi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> finding him remote from the Camp, came to him, and after salutation, said: Sir <hi>Phylastes,</hi> I am sent vnto you by a deare friend of yours, named <hi>Ornatus</hi> who trusteth so much in your vertues, that he is willing to put his life into your hands, which you shall hazard, in denying him one small fauour, which with safetie you may graunt. First therefore, I request but your promise for your warrantie, and then I will declare what I haue in charge.</p>
            <p>My friend (quoth <hi>Phylastes</hi>) thou tellest me newes of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when thou sayest thou comest from <hi>Ornatus,</hi> whom I feare is long since dead: but if thou knowest the contrary, and canst resolue me thereof, I promise and sweare to performe whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou shalt demaund: for I am sure <hi>Ornatus</hi> knoweth that I loue him, nor maketh any doubt thereof, which if hee doo, he iniurieth that loue and friendship that hath past betw√©ene vs.</p>
            <p>Then kinde sir (quoth he) that <hi>Ornatus</hi> is not dead, but in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and I am that <hi>Ornatus,</hi> that notwithstanding my sp√©ech, make no doubt of your loue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phylastes</hi> beholding his countenance, knewe him well, and for ioy caught him in his armes.

Then I bes√©ech you remit this care for my safetie, for I will preserue my selfe from daunger for your sake.

Besides, my honor vrgeth m√©e, reuenge of iniuries done to your selfe and me, and my fathers safetie, are reasons sufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade your consent: besides many other causes more forcible then these, too tedious to recite.

With these studies hee sat a good while silent, till hee perceiued them inclinde to sleepe, and casting his eye aside, espied a bill hanging by the wall, to which hee stole secretly, and taking hold of the same, he drew towards them, entring into these medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.

With that two heraults were sent from either General, to part the souldiers, which done, <hi>Ornatus</hi> before the open assembly said. <hi>Lenon,</hi> first I saye I am a Gentleman, as absolute and as good as thy selfe: Prince I am none, neither art thou by right, but that by tyrannie and vsurpation thou holdest the same. I come as <hi>Artesias</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, to challenge th√©e of disloyalty, as the outrages thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, by detaining her libertie, do manifest. I challenge th√©e for dooing iniustice against <hi>Allinus,</hi> whom thou withholdest from his right, by trecherous malice. I challenge th√©e, as a partaker of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastus</hi> death, for that thou sufferest and vpholdest his murtherer <hi>Floretus,</hi> that hath deserued death. I challenge th√©e for oppression laid vpon this whole land. And lastly, for detaining <hi>Ornatus</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, who neuer was impeached of treason: and therefore if thou darest answere my challenge, I am here readie, otherwise, I here pronounce th√©e for a coward, &amp; a miscreant, not worthie to beare Armes. <hi>Lenon</hi> made this replie. Being accused by a straunger, without cause, I regarde it not, and b√©eing iudge my selfe, will not by th√©e be adiudged: but for thy proude challenge, I will answere th√©e, as little regarding what thou canst doo, as thou boastingly dost vaunt of thy valor. Therefore euen now before I deport, I will without delay abate thy haughtinesse, though thy accusations are manifestly false: for I both loue and esteeme <hi>Artesia</hi> as deerely as I doe my selfe: my title to the Crowne, is iust: for <hi>Allinus</hi> hee is both a traitor at home, and abroade: first in causing his comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

bands, to destroye the Countrey. For <hi>Floretus</hi> pardon, it is mercie, not iniustice. As for oppression done to <hi>Ornatus,</hi> all knowe, I neuer iniuried him: but if h√©e take the Iustice that is done to his traiterous father, as done to him, I cannot helpe that: but reuenge it thou, since thou art his Champion. <hi>Ornatus</hi> had much adoo to stay to heare out his speeche, which galled him to the very heart, that without speaking a word more, hee smote at <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and <hi>Lenon</hi> with courage, answered his blowes, beginning a most flerce and forceable incounter, and with like furie continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, til both had receiued many wounds, and their steeds beganne to be furious and madde, with the smart of some strokes that mist their ayme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> calling to remembrance, first the iniuries he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that <hi>Lenon</hi> &amp; none else could dispossesse him of <hi>Artesias</hi> Loue, and many other wrongs he had done him and his parents, thought nowe to reuenge them all, and dispossesse <hi>Thaeon</hi> of the Crowne by <hi>Lenons</hi> death, reuiued his spirits with such courage, that he began with renewed strength to assaile <hi>Lenon,</hi> who euen then began to fainte, &amp; would haue yeelded, but that shame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him. Which when <hi>Ornatus</hi> perceiued, h√©e thought at once to ende the strife, that with one forceable blow, h√©e gaue him so de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doo you not s√©e what destruction he hath brought vpon this land? Are not almost all the Nobilitie slaine and destroyed? Are not your liberties, goods and friends, taken from you? Is not the whole land in an vproare, and euery one driuen from his quiet at home, to venture his life in the fielde, and all this for satisfaction of his will and selfe commaund, not grounded vpon lawe nor iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? Examine your consciences, is he your lawfull King? did he not murther your lawfull King, onely to make you his vassels? Againe, doth <hi>Allinus</hi> s√©eke to do his Countrey wrong? doth h√©e come to oppresse you? doth h√©e s√©eke to abuse your libertie? No: h√©e onely commeth to claime his possessions, by iniustice taken from him: he commeth as vrged by griefe, not to liue as a bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed man, being himselfe, his wife, children and familie, driuen to liue in miserie and slauerie, for the satisfaction of his Lust. Then I bes√©ech you good souldiers, consider well what you do, whom you defend, a traytor: and whom you resist, a deare friend, that loueth and tendereth your liues as deare as his owne: whose estate the <hi>Armenians</hi> pitie, to whome he was neuer gratious: but his own Countrey mens harts are hardned against him, repaying crueltie for his loue, and resistance to withhold his right.
