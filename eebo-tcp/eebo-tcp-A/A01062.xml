            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Here shall you see lust Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing, auarice, guilty of murther, &amp; dignity, seeking his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with vsurpation, yet all subuerted by vertue. Which I am bold to present vnto you, not for the woorth, but to expresse my good will, which is not vnmindfull in some sort to gratifie the manifold curtesies I haue receiued of you. And although it be altogither not worth estimation, and to be accounted no requitall for so many good turnes, yet I desire you to accept the same in steed of a better, and the summe of that which my abilitie at this time can affoord: Which beeing but a fancie, vouchsafe to esteem, though not agreeing with your grauitie, yet (as many both Noble and wise in such like matters haue done) to be red for recreation.

And for that I know your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and curtesie to be such, as that you wil not misconceiue me, but esteeme well hereof, and my affection to you, to bee exprest in the dedicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I haue adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tured to dedicate the same to your protection, though altogither vndeseruing the title of your patronage, which your further kindnesse shall binde me hereafter to requite the same, with some worthier worke col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by my labors.

But if contrary to my thought, this my summer fruite be gathered before it be ripe, I promise amends with olde fruite, that hath bene a yeare in ripening, and in the beginning of the next winter comming forth.

            <p>As for such as either rashly condemne without iudgement, or lauishly dislike without aduice, I esteeme them like the downe of Thistles, inconstantly dispearst with euery blast, accounting their discontent, my content: not caring for to please those that are pleased with nothing.</p>
            <p>But did my gaines, counteruaile my labours, I would then frame my fancie to sit their humours, but getting nothing, I can loose no lesse, onely to haue a good opinion of the well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to learning, is all I craue: and that I hope your good mindes will affoord.</p>

And seeing himselfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of her sight, the night approching, departed home to his fathers house.

            <p>The next day thinking to shake off all further remembrance of her, he gate into company of his most chosen friends, wherein before time hée tooke most delight, yet nowe by reason of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature, hee rather seemed weary thereof.

            <p>After that night was past, earelie the next morning hée wandred towardes the place where hée hadde behelde her with such exceeding content, and by the way as hée went, hée met with a gentlewoman named <hi>Adellena,</hi> of meane birth, and small liuing, yet of good education, who oftentimes resorted to <hi>Arbastus</hi> house, and was going thither at that instant, into whose company hee insinuated himselfe, for that hée sawe her alone, and said as followeth.</p>
            <p>Gentlewoman, I am bolde to intreat a word or two with you. Sir replied she, with a good will, I will satisfie you in what I can. Know you not (quoth he) <hi>Arbastus?</hi> I do quoth she, both know him, and am very well acquainted with him, vnto whose house I am nowe going. So woulde I quoth hée if I durst, for I serue <hi>Ornatus,</hi> sonne to <hi>Allinus,</hi> whome I doo not doubt but you know well, of whom I would tell you more, but that I feare to commit his secrets to them I knowe not, and thereby vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly doe him iniurie: but woulde you vouchsafe but to heare them, kéepe them secret, and withall adde your help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sir replied <hi>Adellena,</hi> I knowe not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Gentleman, yet I haue heard him much commended, in whome if I coulde any way pleasure, I woulde vse both diligence and secrecie, promising you vpon my saith and credit, if you

will make mée acquainted with your minde, I will either doo my good will to further him, or else conceale what you shall commit to my priuitie.</p>
            <p>Then said hée, my maister not long since walking in yonder valley, beheld <hi>Artesia,</hi> faire <hi>Artesia,</hi> daughter to <hi>Arbastus,</hi> to whose beawtie hée is exceedingly inth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>alled, that vnlesse some meanes of comfort be found to ease his torments, I feare mée it will in daunger his life: whom you onely may pleasure, by making his loue knowne to her, in such sort as shall best agrée with your wisedome. This is all, and yet so much, that the reuealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may doo much harme. And to effect such a contract, might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure peace and vnitie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wixt their parents. Therefore I intreate your aide and furtherance herein: with which good newes, if I returne to him, I knowe it will bréed no little comfort to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet heart.</p>
            <p>Sir (said shée) since I perceiue his loue is grounded vpon vertue, not drawne thereto by any desire of reward, I vndertake to bée his assistant therein, and will to the vttermost of my best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours labour to procure his content: Which this day I will in some sort put in execution. And if you returne to mée to morrow, you shall knowe her answere. I wil said he, and so they departed. <hi>Ornatus</hi> hauing left her, entered into many cogitations of his rash attempt, accounting himselfe ouer credulous to commit his secrets to her priuitie, of whose fidelitie hee had neuer made try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: sometimes comforting himselfe with hope of good euent, and againe dispairing of comfort, for that hée supposed <hi>Artesia</hi> would rather esteeme him as an enemie then a friend, by reason of their parents hatred, and therefore would the more hardly bee drawne to giue any credit to his sute. And reuoluing a chaos of these and such like confused cogitations, he attained his fathers house, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the time tedious vntill his appointed méeting with <hi>Adelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>; which hée ouerpast with great care. <hi>Adellena</hi> after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from him, soone attained to <hi>Arbastus</hi> house, vsing her selfe as shee had formerly done, yet withall, carefull how to execute the charge shée had in hand, which shee could by no occasion vtter,
<pb facs="tcp:14095:7"/>
till after dinner when shée found <hi>Artesia</hi> all alone in the gardein, insinuated her self into her company, which <hi>Artesia</hi> kindly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, entring into varietie of discourses, and continuing some time in giuing certaine hearbes their proper names: amongst the rest, <hi>Artesia</hi> espied an hearbe with partie coloured leaues, demanding of <hi>Adellena</hi> if shee knewe the name thereof, which she told her she did not. I haue oftentimes quoth <hi>Artesia</hi> seene this hearbe, and it hath two prettie names, it is by some called Loue in Idlenesse, and by some Haris Case: with that <hi>Adellena</hi> fetcht a déepe (thogh counterfeit) sigh, which <hi>Artesia</hi> noting, said: What maketh you sigh to heare it named Haris Case? Mary (quoth shée) one way because those two names so all agrée, an other, for by the same I call to remembrance the hearts griefe I heard a young man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of procured by loue, which was not in idlenesse, but I think in good earnest. Why quoth <hi>Artesia,</hi> can loue procure such hartes griefe to any, and not rather content? Yea said shee, because the partie in loue, hath no hope to attaine the good liking of the partie be loueth. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quoth <hi>Artesia,</hi> I account him a foole that will loue so deeply without hope of reward: and that to bée rather fondnesse then true friendship, that pleaseth his affections with such inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. But I pray tel mée what is he into whose secrets you were so suddenly admitted? Not admitted (quoth she) for vnawares I heard his complaints, which afterwardes I promised him not to make any acquainted withall, but the partie whome he so in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ierly loueth. Then quoth <hi>Artesia,</hi> I may not know, neither doo I care, for it is but a vanitie that troubleth ones cogitations. Yes quoth shée, you may and shall if you please, know who he is, conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you will neither be offended with me for telling you, nor reueale what I shall impart. Why quoth she, am I the pretie, or doth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way concerne me, that I should be offended? If it be, then kéepe your counsels vnreuealed, for it will proue vnsauorie to my sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, for be it far from me to be troubled with the vaine sutes of doting louers. Yet let me answere quoth <hi>Adellena,</hi> you heare too greeuous a conceit of loue, which is the diuine puritie whereby heartes are vnited in vertue.

therefore not to bée abhorred: and for that any shoulde loue your selfe, can that be an offence to you, but rather bée accepted in kinde sort? wée should by nature loue them that loue vs, then will you contrarie to nature, yéeld hatred for loue? For you indéed are the partie that is beloued, and the partie that is so farre in loue with you euery way to be commended, &amp; one way disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, whose name I will not reueale, &amp; then I hope I shall bréed no offence to your eares. Doe so quoth <hi>Artesia,</hi> for in concealing the same, you please me, &amp; if you will be welcome into my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, vse no more of these speeches.

After this communication ended, they parted, <hi>Adellena,</hi> home to to her house, and <hi>Artesia</hi> to her supper, and afterwards to her chamber, where at first, some colde thoughts of those spéeches past in her fancie, but afterwards shée spent the rest of that night in quiet sléepe.</p>

               <hi>Adellena</hi> hauing receiued this Letter, tolde him shée would deliuer the same, which the next day shée performed in this sort: Being come to <hi>Arbastus</hi> house, shée continued most part of the day in <hi>Artesias</hi> company, not once renuing the least remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the talke shée had with her the day before, but espying her open her Casket wherein shée put her workes, whilest <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesia</hi> was busie, she priuily conueyed the Letter vnseene into the same, which by and by <hi>Artesia</hi> locked, for none but her selfe had the vse thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adellena</hi> thought long till she was gone fearing least <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> should vpon some occasion open the Casket againe, and so find the Letter, whilest shée were there, therefore shée soone founde meanes to depart. When the time of rest was come, and <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> alone in her bed, taking a booke (according to her vsuall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) to reade a while, shee suddenly fell a sléepe, and in her sléepe was possessed with a dreame, wherein her thoughts called to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance <hi>Adellenas</hi> speeches, which mooued such a disquiet conceit of anger in her brest, that thinking shée had chid her, with the motions of her spirites shée awaked, féeling and excéeding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature
<pb facs="tcp:14095:9"/>
in all her parts, and séeing the light stil burning, she maruelled at her drowsinesse that had before forgate to put the same out, and by this meanes called to remembrance <hi>Adellenas</hi> spéeches, maruelling what hee should bee that was in loue with her, and suddenly againe, reprouing her selfe for giuing her mind libertie to think of loue, she would haue banisht al further remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof out of her minde, but the more shee laboured, the more vnable shee was to preuaile in ouermaistring her fancies, that being both vexed with her selfe, and <hi>Adellena,</hi> shee vttered these speeches.</p>
            <p>What disquiet is this possesseth my heart, procureth such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted cogitations to rise in my fancies, and disturbeth my rest? I was not wont to trouble my thoughts with such vaine cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the more I labour to suppresse, the more they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</p>
            <p>Coulde <hi>Adellenas</hi> speeches haue such force (which I had welnigh forgotten) as thus long to sticke in my remembrance?

               </gap>keth to intrappe my chastitie? Accursed be her lippes for vttering them, and would to God I had bene deaffe that I might not haue heard their inchaunting sound.</p>
            <p>This saide, she catcht vp her Booke, thinking by reading to driue away all remembrance thereof, but her heart was so fully possest with a kinde of cogitation what hée shoulde be, that she nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coulde reade, or when she did reade, remember what shee did reade: and finding this meanes not auaileable, shée started from her bedde, opening her Casket to take out her sampler, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in shée tooke most delight, when suddenly shée espied the Letter, and reading the superscription, was halfe astonished thereat, especially howe it should come there, and what the contents should bée, béeing oftentimes in minde to teare the same in péeces and not to reade it, which her hearte woulde not suffer her to doo before shée had séene what was the contents: yet striuing to ouermaister her affections, shée tore the same
<pb facs="tcp:14095:10"/>
in the midst: which done, such a remorse rose in her fancie, vnited with a desire to know further thereof, that leaping into the bed, shée closed the same togither, and betwixt a willing and vnwilling minde, redde the same throughout. With that, fetching a déepe sigh, shee said: Aye me poore soule, how are my affections betraied to mine enemie? Was it <hi>Ornatus</hi> shée ment? can it bée that hée wil proue my friend, that is my professed enemie?

            <p>O miserable castiffe, what haste thou to do but lament when thy ill fortune yéelds nothing but cause of lament? Why shoulde thy life last to endure these tormentes, and not rather to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue into vnséene essences? Could any thing haue happened to mée more miserable, then to beholde <hi>Artesia,</hi> and now to endure her crueltie? or more fortunate, if shée had bene mercifull? But my Destenies haue drawne mée to like her that hateth mée, and to become thrall to a cruell vnrelenting enemie.

what meanes to vse to enioy her sight (without the which hée could not liue,) and yet not be knowne what he was. Amongst many other deuises, this tooke déepest roote. Within fewe dayes after (hauing prouided all things necessary) he attired himselfe like a virgine of a straunge Countrey (which hée might well be esteemed to be by his youth.) And taking with him his Lute, whereon he could play excéedingly well, in the silent of the night he departed towards the sea coast, which was neare vnto <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastus</hi> house: and seating himselfe vpon the Rockie shoare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to play vpon his Lute.

But the third day it fortuned <hi>Arbastas</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad hunting, was by a violent storme driuen to séeke shelter, and must fortunately lighted on the shepheards Cottage, where he boldly entered without calling, and suddenly espying <hi>Syluia,</hi> was halfe astonisht to beholde a damosell so bewtifull and richly attired in that homely place, but after that he had a while viewed her well, <hi>(Syluia</hi> being alone) with a curteous behauiour he thus spake.</p>
            <p>Faire damosell, pardon my boldnesse, if I haue disquietted you, I little thought to haue found such guestes in this homely place. <hi>Syluia</hi> knowing him to be <hi>Arbastus,</hi> arose, but made him no answere: when presently the olde shepheard came in, vsing great reuerence to <hi>Arbastus,</hi> who demaunded of him, what da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosell that was, whereupon the olde man declared all that he knew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arbastus</hi> then thus said: Damosell, I vnderstand by this shepheard some part of your misfortunes, which I so much pitty, that offer to do any thing resteth in me to do you pleasure. And for that this homely place is not agréeable to your birth, which may be greater then I can iudge of, let me desire you to accept of such entertainment as my habitation yéeldeth, whither you shall be welcome. <hi>Syluia</hi> being glad of that profer, yet fearing to be discouered by his willingnesse to yéeld, made this answere.

Which cruell déed of yours, no doubt will be one day repayed with the like disdaine, where you shall most affect. I know his loue was firme, constant and immoueable, which maketh me so much the more pittie his estate: I know his meaning was both vertuous &amp; honorable, his birth you know, what vertues abounded in him, all can witnesse: and how hartily he loued you, the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> witnesse.

Being as readie to blame her selfe, as <hi>Adellena,</hi> and yet willing to do neither. For she thought if she spake true, shée had good cause to say that shée did, and her selfe more to be blamed then any. For notwithstanding she had giuen <hi>Adellena</hi> so flat a denial, yet her conscience knewe, that some sparks of loue were kindled in her breast: That her heart being somewhat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest with these thoughts, caused the water to stand in her eyes. <hi>Ornatus</hi> séeing all this, took no little comfort therat, especially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he perceiued <hi>Artesias</hi> heart to relent, but for that by his disguise, being known no other then a woman, he kept silence, when saine

hée would haue spake, least he should discouer himselfe. <hi>Adellena</hi> séeing she had disquieted <hi>Artesia,</hi> being her selfe full of griefe, and vnwilling to vrge her any further, departed. And <hi>Artesia</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing her selfe from <hi>Syluians</hi> company, into an Arbor, vttered these spéeches. And can it be that <hi>Ornatus</hi> loue was so great, that for my sake hée hath done this?

Admit it were so, I am not bound to fauour him, is he not my enemie, &amp; sonne vnto my fathers cheefest foe? what reason then haue I eyther to giue credit to his loue, or her protestation, when both may be fayned? Well I will be aduised before I yéelde my selfe to loues intangling baytes, and before I loue, I will know whome I loue. I but <hi>Artesia</hi> thy fancie yéel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth remorse alreadie, and thy conscience bids thée pittie him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loueth thée, for loue in a reputed enemie may be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and loyall as in an open friend, and an enemie becomming friend, will be the more constant: then what hast thou to do, but make further proofe of his constancie, and finding him true, yéelde reward to his desert? Soft <hi>Artesia,</hi> wade not too far: if he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, if hee be loyall, if he loue thée so intirely, if nowe thou hast made him forsake this countrey, or procure his vntimely death, then is there nothing else to be don for thée, but to pittie his death, and accuse thy selfe of some discourtesie. All this while <hi>Ornatus</hi> shrowding himselfe from her sight, by the thicknesse of the gréene leaues heard her spéeches, to his excéeding comfort, and againe closelie withdrew himselfe. <hi>Artesia</hi> hauing ended her spéeches, her hart being opprest with many doubts, arose and came to <hi>Syluian,</hi> to whom she said: My minde is much troubled with the newes <hi>Adellena</hi> told me of <hi>Ornatus</hi> absence, whom for that you know not, I wil tel you what he was.</p>

But it may be (as you say) <hi>Ornatus</hi> hath not done himselfe outrage, but onely abandoning company, liueth in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, and so meaneth to die: which if it bee so, then in my fancie, you might do well to let him by some meanes vnderstand that you did pittie him Stay there quoth <hi>Artesia,</hi> you must first know whether I can do it or no: for If I should say I pittie with my lips, and he not find it so, it would driue him to more dispaire, and therefore I will leaue off to do that, vntill I can finde whether I can do so or no.</p>
            <p>These her spéeches draue <hi>Ornatus</hi> into a perplexed doubt

This is <hi>Adellenaes</hi> doing, and according as I thought they are agréed: shée left this letter here, and her may I blame, and not him.

            <p>
               <hi>Syluian</hi> thus answered: since you haue giuen me licence to speake that which my heart thinketh, first I say, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for <hi>Adellena,</hi> if it were her déede, she did but the part of a friend, but it was very vnlikely, for that shée was not here since yesterday. Neither can I think any man can dissemble so much as to make these protestations, and yet be false. For his

            <p>I remember such Histories (quoth <hi>Artesia)</hi> but what was the end of their loue, was it not most miserable? I grant it was, (quoth <hi>Syluian</hi>) which was procured by their parents crueltie, but not their loue, wherein, notwithstanding, they tooke such felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that they rather chose to die togither then to be parted: which argueth, that the enmity twixt parents, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not break off loue twixt the children, yet might such tragical euents haue bin preuented by wisedom. But how know I (said <hi>Artesia)</hi> whether <hi>Ornatus</hi> loue bée so constant or no? Can you haue any greater proofe thereof, then his own letters, the forsaking of his parents, and liuing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture in pennurie: but if you doubt of that, once againe trie him. Well (said <hi>Artesia</hi>) I asked but thy counsaile, but in stead thereof, thou vsest perswasion: but séeing thou art so forward to doo me good, which I hope is thy intent, if thou wilt keep my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, thou shalt know both my minde, and what I intend. Assure your selfe (quoth <hi>Syluian)</hi> I will rather loose my life then prooue vnfaithfull. Then said shée, I confesse to thée <hi>Syluian,</hi> that loue hath made entrance into my heart, that I would willingly both
<pb facs="tcp:14095:17"/>
pittie <hi>Ornatus,</hi> and grant him his request: for that with often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring him, I cannot forget him, neither doth any thought please mee, but when I thinke of him. But there are so many slips to hinder our loue, that though I loue him, I shall neuer enioy him. For should my parents know hereof, they woulde prie so warily into my actions, that it were impossible for mée once to haue a sight of him, whome I doo scarce remember, I haue so sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome séene him. You may (quoth <hi>Syluian)</hi> both loue him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy him, and since you haue begun to like of him, he being worthy thereof, and equalling you in affection, increase that loue: &amp; might I but once come to speake with him, I woulde not doubt but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Well quoth <hi>Artesia,</hi> I commit all to you, my life, for that dependeth on my loue, being willing to doo any thing that shall not disagrée with modestie.

               <hi>Adellena</hi> hearing her spéeches, was so astonish at theyr strangenesse, that for a good while she stood as one sencelesse, but at the last, she made this answere. Your demaunds are such, as that I know not how to answere them: but heauens punish mée, if I dissemble. I saw not <hi>Ornatus</hi> since the time hée came to mée, to know how you accepted the letter I conueyed into your Casket. For that Letter I am altogither ignorant therein, neither did I euer sée the same before now: I neuer spake with <hi>Ornatus,</hi> sawe <hi>Ornatus,</hi> or heard from him since I last gaue him your answere: neither doo I know where hee is: but this I know, that hée is not to bée found: but poore Gentleman, languisheth in loue, which I dare protest, loueth you most dearely, neither neede you misdoubt that hée is absent, or thinke that hée is hidden at my house, for it is too true, hée hath taken such gréefe at your vnkindnesse, as will I feare me indaunger his life.</p>
            <p>I would it were not so, but that he were at my house, then would I counsaile him rather to forget to loue, then indaunger his life thereby.</p>
            <p>May I beléeue (quoth <hi>Artesia)</hi> that this thou sayest is true? Heauens let me liue no longer (quoth <hi>Adellena)</hi> if I dissemble.

               <hi>Syluian</hi> I would gladlie vtter a matter of an importance, if you will vouchsafe me gentle audience: So it is fayre Damosell, that my heart hath long time béen inthralled to your bewtie, which I haue retrained to vtter, fearing to be refused: but knew you how faithfully my heart is deuoted to your seruice, and with what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I haue concealed the same, you would pittie me. My estate is sufficient to maintaine you well, though not so worthily as you deserue: you shall liue with me in contented ease, and haue so faithfull and constant a friend, as no torment nor affliction shall alter.</p>

First considering that <hi>Floretus</hi> had the disposing of her, and therefore he must please him: least otherwise he might bée depriued of her company. Then he began to thinke of <hi>Arba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi> murther, knowing assuredly, that it was not acted by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers counsel, but rather by some secret foe, that might as well bée <hi>Floretus</hi> as any other, for that hée was the next heire, if <hi>Artesia</hi> hindred him not: which conceit tooke such effectuall instance in his fancie, that with that his suspect, beholding <hi>Floretus</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, countenance, and little inquiry for the murtherer, he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inspected him, which by the diuine prouidence, rather then by any euident proofe, was stirred in his opinion. Such murther is neuer vnreuealed, and though neuer so closely done, yet God by some extraordinary meanes or other reuealeth the same. So came it to passe with <hi>Ornatus,</hi> although hée was no war priuie to any such act, or had any probabilitie thereof, yet hée thought that <hi>Floretus</hi> countenaunce bewrayed his treacherie, and therefore hée longed to haue some conference with him, to sée if hée could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the truth, whereby he thought both to discharge himselfe of that suspect <hi>Artesia</hi> had of him, and also when shée sawe his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and constancie, she might yéelde to loue him: purposing to leaue no meanes vnattempted to trie him: which he did the next time be spake with him, in this sort.</p>

               <hi>Syluian</hi> hearing that, thought it better to sweare a thousand oathes and breake them all, then by nicenesse to indanger the life of <hi>Artesia,</hi> which she supposed he aymed at promised him by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny protestations, to kéepe secret whatsoeuer he tolde her: wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Floretus</hi> vrged with hope to win her loue, and imboldned in mischief, cared not what he did to attain his wil, said as followeth. <hi>Syluian,</hi> you sée <hi>Arbastus</hi> is dead, which was one stop that kept me from inioying great possessions, and my purpose is, so you wil but vouchsafe to ayde me therrin, to be ridde of <hi>Artesia:</hi> and then all that belongeth to her by her fathers death, shall bee yours to dispose of. <hi>Syluians</hi> heart throbde to heare his spéeches, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to sift him to the full, said as followeth. <hi>Floretus</hi> I am sure you speake this onely to trie me, and so intrap me, and not of any intent you haue to performe the same, wherein you shall doo me great wrong, and your selfe no good: for I cannot beléeue you beare the least thought to do it. By heauen quoth hee, it is my full intent, and for that you may be assured thereof, it was I that slew <hi>Arbastus,</hi> howsoeuer the matter is imputed to <hi>Allinus,</hi> and purpose likewise to be rid of <hi>Artesia,</hi> onely for your sake.</p>
            <p>Therefore make no doubt of my resolution: for I am ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely purposed to do it.

art deceiued, she is so farre in loue that she doteth, and would I am sure to any thing at my request. What a world is this, what villanie can be intended, that some either for fauour or reward, wil not execute? If I should trust her that is so easily wonne to do such a hainous déed, might I not be accounted madde? yes, and therefore I wil not trust her: <hi>Artesia</hi> being once dispatcht, she shall follow next. <hi>Ornatus</hi> on the countrary part, was glad that he had felt the depth of <hi>Floretus</hi> counsell, thinking likewise that he was so farre in loue with him (taking him for a woman,) that for his sake he sought. <hi>Artesias</hi> death: which was the onely meanes to helpe him attaine her loue, which he likewise determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue her knowledge of, and discouer himselfe, hoping that when she sawe his innocencie, his faithfull loue, and how by his meanes her life was preserued, she would yéeld him due guerdon for his good will.

for that you supposed him to be an actor in <hi>Arbastus</hi> death, but both he and <hi>Allinus</hi> are innocent, and farre from any such thought, for your vncle <hi>Floretus</hi> was his murtherer, which hée tolde me himselfe: he hath béene oftentimes importunate to win my loue (which an other possesseth) but I suspecting as much as I now find to be true, held him of with this delay, that he had not wealth to maintaine me.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T fel so out the next day, that the King with diuers of his company, amongst whom was his only sonne and heire <hi>Lenon,</hi> being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with trauell, arriued at <hi>Arbastus</hi> house, thinking to haue founde him there, but the King hearing of his suddaine death, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedingly sorie, perswading himselfe as all men else did, that he was slaine by some of <hi>Allinus</hi> house? which made him make small tariance there, but departed to his Pallace. Now it fortuned that <hi>Lenon</hi> behelde <hi>Artesias</hi> bewtie, and was with the first view thereof, excéedingly bewitched, that after he was gone, he could by no meanes forget her? but determined ere long, to returne to sée if he could attaine her loue. Now the time was come that <hi>Floretus</hi> had appointed to set abroach his villany, and (according as <hi>Ornatus</hi> had before told <hi>Artesia</hi>) he came to her, perswading her for a season to lie in the Countrey, which she as forearmed consented vnto, and so the next morning, she with <hi>Syluian, Floretus,</hi> and diuers others, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted: at night <hi>Floretus</hi> returning, and leauing with her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had promised <hi>Syluian,</hi> and onely two seruants that were to prouide them necessaries, but knew no part of the conspiracie. When <hi>Ornatus</hi> and <hi>Artesia</hi> were alone togither, for that she was vndoubtedly assured of his loue, faith and sideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, she vsed these comfortable spéeches to him. <hi>Ornatus,</hi> whereas alwaies before this time too vnkindly I haue reputed you as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:14095:25"/>
it was strange to me to entertaine loue, but now I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeeld my selfe to be her subiect, and your true and faithful friend: committing my life to your custodie, and my loue and selfe to be yours to dispose of. <hi>Ornatus</hi> hearing her spéeches, was rauished with a heauen of ioy, with a gentle and kind behauiour, foulding her in his armes, and imprinting a swéete kisse vpon her rosiate lippes, he said. Neuer was poore wretch exalted to more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse then I am, by being inriched with this inestimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of your loue. O how rich a reward haue I now reapt for my cares, and what glorie, ioy or wealth, can be compared to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of your loue? O heauenly <hi>Artesia,</hi> how fortunate haue you made <hi>Ornatus</hi>? how haue you blest <hi>Ornatus</hi>? how full of ioy is <hi>Ornatus,</hi> by your swéete consent? was euer any so vnworthie, so exalted, for his kindnesse and loue? I wil performe more then my tongue can vtter, and bee more faithfull then your heart can wish. Then began they to imbrace each other, and to surfet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the sollaces, true loue yeeldeth. He sometimes lending her a kisse, and she with interest paying two for one: for one swéet looke two, and so many imbracings as are not to be explicated: their hands and hearts ioyned in such firme bandes of true affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is not to be dissolued: and sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etting with such excéeding content, as is impossible to be described. These stormes of loue somewhat mittgated, they began to consult of their daungerous estate, and to deuise how to preuent the intended mischiefe. In this place they continued some two dayes in excéeding content, still expecting to heare from <hi>Floretus</hi>: who the third day fearing to trust any with a matter of such waight, came himselfe to bring the potion, (yet in shew of kindnes to visite <hi>Artesia</hi>) deliuering the same to <hi>Syluian,</hi> willing her the next night to giue it her, which she promised him faithfully to accomplish.</p>
            <p>When he was gone, <hi>Artesia</hi> came to <hi>Ornatus</hi> to knowe what newes <hi>Floretus</hi> brought, who tolde her all, and shewed her the poyson in a glasse, which he had charged should be giuen to her the next day. With that <hi>Artesia</hi> beganne to wayle and exclaime against her Vnckle, in most extreame sort. But <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:25"/>
intreated her to cease such vaine griefe, which could not hurt him, but her selfe, promising her to preuent the same, if shée would follow his counsell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which she willingly yeelded vnto. Then quoth hée, let vs presently depart hence to <hi>Adellenaes</hi> house, which you know is not farre off, who you know is agreed with vs alreadie, where I will leaue you, and returne. Which said, while the seruants were absent vpon some speciall occasion, they departed with little labour, arriuing at <hi>Adellenas</hi> house, who was readie to receiue them, and after many farwels, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> returned backe to the Lodge. And when it was supper time, the seruants brought vp meate, but <hi>Ornatus</hi> tolde them that <hi>Artesia</hi> was scarce well, and therefore they would not sup that night. And being alone by himselfe, he studied what excuse to make for <hi>Artesias</hi> absence, when <hi>Floretus</hi> should come, spending that night in much care, and many vnquiet cogitations, which tooke away his sleepe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Floretus</hi> was no sooner returned from the Lodge, but hée met <hi>Lenon,</hi> who of purpose came to méete <hi>Artesia,</hi> whom <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus</hi> kindly saluted: maruelling much wherefore hée came: to ease which doubt, <hi>Lenon</hi> said.</p>
            <p>My friend <hi>Floretus,</hi> I come to visite the faire <hi>Artesia,</hi> to whose beawtie I am inthralled, not as regarding her wealth, but her sweete loue, of whome you onely haue the gouernment: therefore I pray befriend me so much, that I may come to spéech with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>xcéedingly amazed to heare his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that he could not tell what answere to make, nor how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse her absence. <hi>Lenon</hi> séeing him in such a studie, continued his spéeches, saying: <hi>Floretus</hi> be not vnwilling I should match with <hi>Artesia,</hi> for that shall no way binder your preferment, who think peraduenture the longer shée liueth vnmarried, the more wealth you shall get by her, but to rid you of that doubt, be but a meanes to win her consent, and I vowe by heauen, I will not take one peniworth of <hi>Arbastus</hi> substance from you, but fréely giue it you all. For it is not her possessions I regard, but her loue, therefore I pray resolue me of your minde herein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:26"/>My Lord replied hée, your offer is so bountifull, besides my dutie vrging me, I am readie to performe your will to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of my power. I thanke you good <hi>Floretus</hi> quoth <hi>Lenon,</hi> then I pray thée bring mée to her, for my loue is impatient of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. My Lord replied he, that can I not do instantly, for <hi>Artesia</hi> some two daies past, with the straunge damosell <hi>Syluian,</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thence, and are nowe at the Lodge: whither (if you please to to take such entertainment as this place yéeldeth) wée wil both goe to morrow morning. Agreed quoth <hi>Lenon,</hi> I will accept your profer. When the time of rest was come, <hi>Floretus</hi> being alone by himselfe, entred into these cogitations. What inconueniences hast thou runne into <hi>Floretus</hi>? Thou hast hyred one to murther <hi>Artesia,</hi> in hope to get her wealth, and made <hi>Syluian</hi> acquainted with thy counsell, which wealth thou maiest now attaine by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing her life: and besides, winning her to loue <hi>Lenon,</hi> thou shalt finde him thy faithfull friend for euer. What wert thou then best to doo? if thou shouldest murther her, hée would make enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of her death, and so thou bée vndone: If not, then wil <hi>Syluian</hi> bée displeased, and so bewray thy drift: that the mischiefes thou by folly hast runne into, are so intricate, that thou knowest not which way to shunne them. Were it not better to saue her life, and winne her Loue for <hi>Lenon,</hi> then to poyson her, and so to die my selfe? If I saue her life, <hi>Syluian</hi> will be discontented: what of that? then let <hi>Sylùian</hi> smart for it, for if she wil not bée conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that I shall doo, she shall neuer liue to bewray my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. And therefore wil I first trie her, and finding any suspition thereof, I will stabbe her my selfe, whose death I may eastlier an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere then <hi>Artesias.</hi> Early the next morning, <hi>Lenon</hi> and he rode to the Lodge, where no sooner arriued, but he met with <hi>Syluian,</hi> to whom he said: How now <hi>Syluian,</hi> I haue newes of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to bewray to thée, <hi>Lenon</hi> whome thou here beholdest, is sonne to the King, who is déeply in loue with <hi>Artesia,</hi> and hath giuen me assurance of all <hi>Arbastus</hi> liuings, if I can win <hi>Artesia</hi> to match with him, now I thinke it good to deferre our purpose as concerning her death, vntil wée haue made triall whether shée

wil loue him or no. Which if we can effect, we shall be quit of so cruel a déed, enioy her heritage, and haue an assured friend of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> whilest we liue: therefore let me know your opinion herein. <hi>Syluian</hi> was excéedingly amazed to heare his spéeches, thinking that if he did tel him where <hi>Artesia</hi> was, she should be wrested from his possession, and so himselfe disappointed of her loue: and on the other side, he thought what michiefe would arise if he should say he had already giuen her the poyson, yet his loue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maistring the feare of any daunger, made him say, All this I like: but <hi>Floretus,</hi> it is now too late, for I haue caused <hi>Artesia</hi> to drink the poyson you deliuered me, and she is dead, which was of such force, that all her bodie purpled into blisters and swellings, which because I knew would bewray what we had done, I tooke her bodie and conueyed it into a deepe pit, where it is impossible to be found. <hi>Floretus</hi> now fearing to haue his treason bewrayed, thought to stabbe <hi>Syluian</hi>; and so to be rid of them both, that in a monstrous rage he drew his dagger, and vnawares strooke <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian</hi> in the left arme, who féeling the smart, with violenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

With that <hi>Lenon</hi> parting them, demaunded what the matter was: <hi>Floretus</hi> thinking rather to accuse, then be accused himselfe, and terrified with affright, saide that wicked woman hath murthered <hi>Artesia. Syluian</hi> made no answer vntil <hi>Lenon</hi> laid hold on her, demanding where <hi>Artesia</hi> was, she answering, that by the intiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that wicked <hi>Floretus,</hi> I gaue her a drinke that vnknowing to me hath poysoned her. O wicked creature saide <hi>Lenon,</hi> thou hast condemned thy selfe to death.

Good <hi>Adellena,</hi> counsell me what is to be done: <hi>Ornatus</hi> being amongst them a reputed straunger, hauing no friend to pleade for him, and peraduenture ouerswayed by <hi>Floretus</hi> persurie, may haue his life indaungered, and the rather for that he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be a <hi>Natolian.</hi> Therefore <hi>Adellena,</hi> if thou louest him or me, will saue both his and my life, and discharge him of that false accusation, runne to the Court, and finding out <hi>Lenon,</hi> tell him at my safetie, and request him for my sake to pittie poore <hi>Sylui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Adellena</hi> according to her commaundement, mounted a Horse, and with great spéede by that time it was night, attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Court, and finding out <hi>Lenon,</hi> vttered these speeches. Most worthie <hi>Lenon,</hi> vouchsafe to heare me speake: The faire <hi>Artesia</hi> whome you suppose dead, is aliue and in safetie at my house, who hath sent me vnto you in the behalfe of <hi>Syluian,</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring some wrong might bée done to her, as inspected to bée her death, when she onely hath preserued her life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenon</hi> was so amazed at her spéeches, that hée could not tel what to say, being excéedingly gréeued for <hi>Syluian,</hi> but at length tolde her what his Father had done: which appalled her sences with deadly feare. <hi>Lenon,</hi> notwithstanding it somewhat grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him for <hi>Syluian,</hi> yet his heart was glad to heare of <hi>Artesias</hi> safetie, and therefore hée determined to goe with <hi>Adellena</hi> to visit her; which likewise hée performed, and entring where shee was, making excéeding lamentation, he said.</p>
            <p>I beséech you gréeue not faire Damosell for <hi>Syluian,</hi> for no harme is done to her, onely my father vppon her owne confession and <hi>Floretus</hi> accusation, hath banished her, to her owne Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Artesia</hi> hearing his spéeches, with verie gréefe fell into a deadly traunce, both <hi>Lenon</hi> and <hi>Adellena</hi> hauing much a doo to bring her life againe. And being conueyed to her bed, when her sences were come to their perfect vse, and <hi>Lenon</hi> standing by her, whose sigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hée was no sooner gone, but <hi>Artesia</hi> vttered these lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Most accursed wretch that I am, to bée thus separated from my deare Loue, whose curteous minde is the fountaine of all vertue: how vnfortunate am I made by my fathers death, and my Vnckles crueltie, but especially by his losse, that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustly banished into a straunge Countrey, where hee prooe true and loyall Gentleman, neuer set foote? how vnhappie was hée made, when hée first beganne his loue? but now most miserable, by séeking to preserue my life, hath cast away his owne; and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be disappointed of my loue, hath quite diss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which saide, another flood of brinishe teares ouerflowed her eyes, and her passage of spéeche was stopt by heart-pearcing
<pb facs="tcp:14095:29"/>
sighings, which in confused multitudes issued with her swéete breath, neuer ceasing her lamentes, but still bewayling her true Loues absence, that it pearced <hi>Adellenaes</hi> hearte with suche sorrowe, that shée wept as fast as <hi>Artesia,</hi> both being so much greeued, that they seemed to striue howe to excéede one another in laments. In which sorrowfull estate, <hi>Artesia</hi> remained so long, that shée waxed extreame sicke; and grewe to that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that <hi>Adellena</hi> feared her death.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> being left in the Countrey of <hi>Natolia,</hi> tooke his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes in such heauie sort, that had not his hope to see <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> againe withheld him, hée had offered himselfe some outrage, for a season giuing himselfe to forlorne and carelesse desperation, neyther regarding which way to prouide for his safetie, nor otherwise respecting what daunger hee might runne into in that straunge Countrey, for the Moores had landed him in a waste and desolate Coaste of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Thus carelesse did hée continue a whole night and a day, not so muche as séeing toode to preserue him from famine: but in the ende, hunger constrained him to séeke succour, but when his stomacke serued him, hee coulde finde no meate, that with the extremitie thereof, calling to remembrance his estate, hée vttered these plaints.</p>
            <p>Thus contrary is Nature to her subiects, sometimes hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to the tappe of all felicitie, and then with violence tumbling them downe headlong into the depth of extreame mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.</p>
            <p>Was euer more fortunate, and suddenly miserable then I am? Coulde euer any man whatsoeuer, attaine more heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felicitie and happinesse then I did, by being possess of <hi>Artesia?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:30"/>
and now againe more accurst being thus far absented from her: and banished my natiue soyle into a straunge Countrey, readie to be famished or deuoured by wild beasts, or that which is worst, neuer likely to see <hi>Artesia</hi> againe. How could any man containe himselfe from desperatenesse, being so miserable as I am? How can I withholde my hands from murthering my selfe, when by doing it, I should bee ridde out of a wretched life? What should I doo, which way should I goe? Here I am in a desolate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented place, where no humane creatures inhabit, but wilde beasts, without foode, without weapons, in womans apparrell, and without hope of comfort. Shall I state here? then shall I bée famished: shall I leaue this place and trauell further? then I goe further from my beloued, and méeting with some raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous beast, may be deuoured. Now being hungrie I want foode, and here is none, vnlesse I will eate the earth, leaues of trées, or rootes of the grasse. Well I will séeke my fortune, bée it good or ill: and in this desperate moode hee trauelled on, and by good fortune founde a Tree laden with excéeding, pleasant, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruite, with which hée slenched his hunger: not farre from which place, he tooke vp his nights lodging.</p>
            <p>Early the next morning he arose, first filling his belly, and then his lappe with that pleasant fruite, the taste whereof, was lyke pleasant wine, that being drunke in abundance, will make the head light: which made <hi>Ornatus</hi> hearte merrie, that he trauelled on space, but Fortune not contented with the miserie he had endured alreadie, sent him in an other affliction: hee entered into a place like a Forrest, beset with Trées of huge proportion, scattered here and there, where hée met with a wild and fierce Boore, that haunted those Desarts, who espying <hi>Ornatus,</hi> with a terrible groyning bristled himselfe comming towardes him, <hi>Ornatus</hi> being now driuen to his vttermost shiftes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to runne with all his force from the beast, but hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the more spéede had almost ouertaken him, when one of the Apples <hi>Ornatus</hi> carried about him fell downe, and the Boore espying the same, staled his haste to take it vp, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:14095:30"/>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> had gotten some little ground of him, and séeing him so much affect the fruite, cast downe another Apple after which the Boore runne, with gréedinesse deuouring the same. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> was glad of this poore shifte, and still cast downe one Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and then another, that in the ende he had almost throwne away all, and notwithstanding that, feared to be destroyed, but the Boore féeling his belly full, and his hunger stauncht, left off his egar pursute and followed him more cearelesly, whom he still fedde with Apples, so long as his store lasted, that in the ende the Boore being drunke with the pleasant fruite, began to réele and stagger, and lying downe fast a sléepe, which <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> séeing, hauing no other then a knife about him, with the same approached the Boore, and without feare, violently thrust the same so déepe into the Boores briffled side, that it pearced his heart, and he after some strugling died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> then helde vp his hands to heauen for ioy, excéeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applauding this his fortunate and vnexpected escape; which he tooke as a fortunate presage of good successe. But yet before he could determine what to doo, Fortune once againe showed her mutabilitie, for when <hi>Ornatus</hi> had parted the Boores head from his huge bodie, and with the same was readie to depart, there past by as it seemed, a knight gallantly mounted, in gréen armor, who espying a woman bearing the Boores head, drew towards her, and said: Woman where hadst thou that Boores head? I pray thée deliuer it me. <hi>Ornatus</hi> made this answere. Sir I néed not doo either, vnlesse I know more cause then as yet I doo. The Knight hearing that short answere, alighted, and saide: I will shewe no other reason but that I will haue it: with that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to striue for the same, but <hi>Ornatus</hi> hauing more minde to his sword then to keepe the Boores head, suddenly caught holde on the <hi>Natalians</hi> sword, and drew the same out, which when he had gotten, he said: Disloyall and discourteous Knight, now wil I kéepe the Boores head in despight of thée, with that hee thrust at him, and contrary to his thought, wounded him so déepe that he le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:14095:31"/>
knowing how discurteously he would haue vsed him, let passe all further remorse, and casting off his womans apparell, put on the Knights apparell and Armour, mounted the stéede, and with the Boores head, roads backe the same way hée sawe the Knight come, and within a little space, found a beaten way that conducted him to a goodly Towne, whose Turret toppes he sawe long before hée came to the same: then began hée to studie what to doe, sometimes thinking it best not to enter into the Towne, from whence it is likely the Knight hée slewe came, and so he béeing taken for him might bée knowne, and so afterwards indaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his death. For peraduenture the Knight might be of good estimation, and of purpose sent to slay the Boore, and if it should be knowne that he had slain him, his friends would for the same, and the rather for that he was a straunger, prosecute sharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge against him. Whilst he was in these meditations, he came neare the Towne, not fully resolued what to doo, where he was soone espied of some of the people, who séeing the Boores head, came running towards him making excéeding ioy: which when he saw, he thought it too late to turne back, but that he must go on and hazard the worst: and being entred the Towne, a number of the Inhabitants flocked about him, some with garlands, some with praises, and all with ioy, vttering these spéeches. Welcome home most braue <hi>Alprinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> then perfectly knew that the Knights name was <hi>Alprinus,</hi> and went of purpose to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lea the Boore, whome they tooke him to be, and that he must of necessitie be knowne? which draue him into excéeding care what excuse to make, to auoide the danger of death. Then presently he beheld a troope of bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Damosels, with the sowndes of swéete Musicke comming towards him, (amongst whom, one as chiefe and more bewtifull then the rest, was crowned with a wreathe of flowers, bearing another in her hand) who all at once applauded his victorie, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before him, vntill he came into the middest of the Towne where satte the chiefe Magistrates, where the Damosell that was crowned, thus spake to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:31"/>Syr <hi>Alprinus,</hi> your conquest hath released these Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of care, extolled thy fame, preserued thy life, and wonne me for thy Loue.

            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> hearing her spéeches, thought to trie the end of this aduenture, which could be no worse then death, which of force he must now hazard, alighted, laying downe the Boores head vpon a Table that stood before the Auncients, with humble and comely behauiour kissing the Damoselles hande, who set the wreathe of Flowers vpon his head, and taking him by the hand, brought him before the Auncients, one of whome stoode vp and said? Worthie Gentleman, whereas before thou wert by vs adiudged to die as worthie thereof, for this thy valiant déed, we fréely pardon thee, and acquite thée from all trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that thou host commited against any whomsoeuer vntill this present houre.</p>
            <p>And taking the Damosell by the hand saide, <hi>Lucida,</hi> according to thy desire, and his desert, I yéelde thée vp to be his wife. And Gentleman quoth he, take her as thine owne, as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as she was by birth adopted mine: and after my death, be thou inheritour of my land.</p>
            <p>To all this <hi>Ornetus</hi> gaue a reuerent consent, and the night now approaching, he with <hi>Lucida</hi> went to her fathers house, where was a great feast prouided, from which <hi>Ornatus</hi> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe in this sort. When he was entred the house, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still Armed, only lifting vp his Beuer, he tooke <hi>Lucida</hi> by the hand, and withdrawing her aside, said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucida,</hi> I nowe finde your loue to bée infallible, and your constancie to excell all women that I haue knowne? and that <hi>Alprinus</hi> is so farre indebted vnto you, as that he shall neuer (might hée liue a thousande yeares) bee able to recompence this inestimable fauour of your loue, which hath preserued my vnworthie life from destruction.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding your Loue <hi>Alprinus,</hi> his debt is

so great as can no way bée gratified, I request one further fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour at your handes, wheron my chéefest felicitie dependeth, yea my life, your loue, and perpetuall good, which I feare to vtter, lest you should misconceiue the same, there being n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Lucida</hi> maruelled at his spéeches, indéed louing him so well, that she would haue spilt her owne blood for his sake, saying: <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prinus,</hi> what neede you make doubt of my consent to any thing whatsoeuer it be for your sake? knowe you not howe faithfull I haue continued, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And notwithstanding all this, doo you make a question whether I will yéelde consent to any thing that shall be for your good? O <hi>Alprinus,</hi> if your loue were so constant as mine, if you intended to continue my loue for euer, if your heart felt so déepe a sting of loue as mine, you would not make such a doubt of my loyaltie, of my truth true loue and constancie.

alreadie studied a deuice, said, It ill agreeth with my nature to dissemble: and hardly could I haue béene drawne thereto, but that desire to preserue loue, drewe me thereto for knowe most worthy <hi>Lucida,</hi> that I am not <hi>Alprinus,</hi> but one that for his sake, hath vndertaken this: The truth whereof, if you will heare with patience, I wil declare.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, I trauailed through the Forrest, or desart, where I met <hi>Alprinus,</hi> sore wounded, and flying from the Boore that pursued him with celeritie: which when I behelde, to rescue him from death, I set vppon the Boore, and by good fortune slew him: which when he behelde, he declared to me the cause of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming: which when I heard, pittying his estate, I bid him take the boores head, and withall, helpe him to mount his stéed, but his woundes would not suffer him to ride, that I was in some feare of his life.

            <p>Now I most humbly intreat you for his sake, to conceale what I am, that I be not knowne: and so both disappoint your selfe of his loue, and him of safetie.

            <p>My Lord (replied <hi>Artesia)</hi> I thanke you for your good will, but I know not how to accept of your loue, being yet so far from knowing what it is, that if I should but dreame thereof, my heart would be out of quiet: besides, many cares continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the same, and my meane estate so farre vnworthy thereof, with innumerable other discontents and cares that I would make my selfe subiect vnto: that I had rather a thousand times remaine in the estate I am now in. Therefore, I intreate you to settle your loue elsewhere, more agreeable to your estate and fancie: for I shall thinke my selfe most fortunate, if I neuer fall into that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of disquiets: but will during my life, labour to kéepe my selfe free from loues bands. <hi>Lenon</hi> would not take this for an answere: but with many other spéeches continued his sute, whom <hi>Artesia</hi> still put out of hope: that he departed for that time excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly disconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, leauing her no lesse disquieted in her thoughts how to auoid his loue.</p>
            <p>In this sort did he daily visite her, still growing more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, amongst many other, this conference past betwixt them: <hi>Artesia</hi> (quoth he) how long shall I sue, and be frustrated in my hopes, by your vnkindnesse? is your heart hardned against me? Or am I of so base conditions, that you cannot conceiue well of me? Or is it possible you beare so hatefull a conceit of loue as you make shewe for? then may I accuse mine eyes, that haue betrayed my sences, in making them your thrall: then may I thinke my woe began, when I first began to loue. O <hi>Artesia</hi> be not so cruel, as to punish me with this disdaine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:35"/>My Lord (replied shée) I séeke not your disquiet: for at the first motion I tolde you my minde, which shall neuer alter, neither is my heart hardened against you more then others: for I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to loue: then seeing you sée my intent, it were a point of wisedome in you to shake off this fonde and foolish loue, which is but a toy, and an idle fancie, that is bred by vanitie: and doo not séeke to make loue growe without a roote, for in my heart it shall neuer take roote: but rather when it is rooted, I will pull out heart and all, but I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then (quoth be) you are led by obstinacie and not by reason, for that you are subiect to loue, you cannot denie: then why not me before another, considering my loue is more faithfull then any other? And I being most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, why should I not be first accepted? <hi>Artesia</hi> was wearie of his spéeches, hauing her constant thoughts onely bent on <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>: therefore to rid him from her, she said; It is in vaine to vse many words, neither am I like to those that will at the first séeme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Faire Damosell, how can I be satisfied with that vnreasonable answere, when my life dependeth on your consent: which your deniall will finish: then giue mée leaue to say, I cannot bée so satisfied: but being extreamely refused, I must growe perforce to be as vnreasonable in my request. Consider you not what digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I might aduance you too, by making you my wife, consider you not the pleasures, ioyes, and abaundance of all contents you might enioy with me, and how faithfully I loue you, and with what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie I séeke your loue, and yet notwithstanding you remaine obdurate? My power is great, that whereas I sue, I might commaunde, and by authoritie compell you to consent: then bée not so ouerconceited, as so obstinatelie to reiect your good. And think, that if my loue were not constant, I might vse extreames, which would soone alter your minde.</p>
            <p>Suppose (replied <hi>Artesia)</hi> I were so péeuish as you terme
<pb facs="tcp:14095:35"/>
me, yet being borne frée, I am not to be made bond by constraint: and were you the greatest king in the world, you could not rule the heart, though you might by iniustice punish the bodie: for it is not kingdomes, wealth, nor crueltie, can turne hatred to loue: but it may sooner turne loue into hatred. But by your spéeches I may partly know your thought, and the lippes vtter what the heart intendeth: doo with mée what you will, I cannot loue: neither will I loue you, were you Monarche of all the world.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Lenon</hi> was ruled by the olde woman, and came where <hi>Artesia</hi> was saluting her, but shée disdaining either to looke on him, or heare him speake, withdrewe her selfe from his presence. Wherewith hée departed, willing <hi>Flera</hi> to doo that which shée had vndertaken. And <hi>Flera</hi> finding her as shée thought in a fit moode, beganne to commune with her of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges, amongst which loue was one. <hi>Artesia</hi> a while heard her, but in the end, perceiuing her drift; cut her off with these spéeches.</p>
            <p>Olde iniquitie, I knowe whereto thy talke tendeth: thinkest thou I will euer harbour a thought of <hi>Lenon,</hi> that hath vsed mée thus dishonourably? no rather will I rent my wofull heart from out my brest before his face: neither néedest thou tell mée that hée hath intreated thee to speake for him, for I knowe too well both his and thy intent, which shall nothing preuaile, but harden my heart against him. Therefore doo not speake to me, for I will not heare thée, nor answere thée: but hate him, thée, and thy counsell, and remaine so constant in despising him, that a thousand deathes shall not alter mée. Is it loue that hath made him with violence carrie me from my friendes, make me a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and commit me to the custodie of such a hellishe hagge as thy selfe? If that be his loue, let him turne it to hatred, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer trouble me, but with hating me: for in so dooing, he shall better please me.</p>
            <p>Often <hi>Flera</hi> would haue replied, but <hi>Artesia</hi> would not suffer her, that shee beganne to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the olde Beldame had executed some part of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended reuenge and crueltie vpon her in this sort, shee saide:
<pb facs="tcp:14095:38"/>

Stand not vpon those nice tearmes with mée quoth <hi>Flera,</hi> but here sweare to yéeld to loue him, for so thou maiest delay him, and frustrate his hopefull expectation, whom thou art not woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to touch, much lesse to beare such a presuming minde as thou doest, in scorne of his loue. Therefore yéelde to that which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest or stand to my mercy. Canst thou bestowe thy loue better then on so honourable a Prince?

            <p>
               <hi>Artesia</hi> trembling for feare, made this answere onely to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her, I am contented to bée ruled by <hi>Lenon,</hi> whose meaning I knowe is honourable. Therefore I pray do not offer mée this ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But followe my counsell, and I will sette you downe a course, whereby you shall attaine your desire, and bee voyde of any such daunger, which is this. First lette vs all repaire to the Court, and humblie intreate the King for his release, if hee will not graunt that, then that hée woulde haue his cause tryed by the rest of the Péeres of the land; Which if hee also denye, then may wée with good cause venture our lines in his rescue: The multitude hearing <hi>Trasus,</hi> in signe of consent, all cryed, <hi>Trasus, Trasus,</hi> shall be our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:14095:42"/>Then presently euerie one with such furniture as they had, hasted to the Court, and comming togither, would not seeme to enter by force, but with a full consent yéelded to <hi>Thrasus</hi> directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

By sea he thought his labours would be in vaine, and if he should go to finde her by land, he knew not whether she might be at sea, and so conueyed into forraine Countries. At last remembring he had heard <hi>Mylo</hi> say she was rescued from <hi>Allinus</hi> in the desert where his Cattel fed, hée determined to trauell thither, though he had little hope to finde her there.

            <p>The Pyrates hauing as is before saide, taken <hi>Artesia</hi> from <hi>Allinus,</hi> and with her such wealth as they could find about them, hauing withall furnished themselues with the spoyle of such Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell as fed in those places, returned to their Ship, and with haste hoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

minde was now altered, and he intended to vse her in most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and decent sort, and not by crueltie, but curtes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, to winne her loue. But beholding her teares, and excéeding lamentation, and how impatientlie she indured the extremities shée was driuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, comming towards her with a most submisse gesture, friendlie countenaance, and gentle spéech, hée said. Faire Lady, be not any thing disquieted that you are made captiue to suche as delight in spoyle, for though our mindes are otherwise bent to all inciuilitie, yet to your selfe shall no wrong be offered, such vertue hath bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie imprinted in my heart, and whereas heretofore without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, both I and the rest of my consorts haue not regarded the plaints, distresse, nor what wrong wee haue offered either to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die or damosell, yet towards your self is my heart altered, and my meaning honestly be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: that I assure you not onely of quiet, and to bée voyd of all wrong by vs to be done, but also, wherein soeuer I may work your wil, quiet, ease, or desire, I wil most willingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my vttermost indeuours.

Sir, I know not how to mitigate my grief, when it increaseth: or how can I be voyd of care, vnlesse I should grow altogither carelesse, being only subiect to woe, &amp; none so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as my selfe, hauing indured so many afflictions &amp; crosses in all respects, that I know not how to assure my selfe of the least quiet? Then giue me leaue to continue my endlesse plaints, &amp; doo not blame me of impatiencie, nor think I suspect your speeches, or distrust your fidelitie, if in some sort I continue my sorrowes: for I haue so long continued in them, as I can better away with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then mirth: for that to me is a stranger. Yet notwithstanding my hart will harbour some quiet, if by your curtesie I may rest in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, and bée sheltred from wrong. By this time they were arriued at their place of harbour, which was betwixt the hollow
<pb facs="tcp:14095:43"/>
of two Rocks, or rather Rockie Ilands, where their ship lay safe from weather, and so farre vnder their shadowe, that it could not bée séene. Themselues conueying such wealth as they from time to time got into hollow Caues, of great largenesse, where was al things necessarie; and the rest of <hi>Luprates</hi> fellowes called him vp. When hauing fastned their ship, <hi>Luprates</hi> brought <hi>Artesia</hi> into the Caue, who beholding the same, was surprised with an excéeding discomfort, of euer getting from thence.</p>
            <p>Some of the ruder sort liking <hi>Artesia,</hi> began their rude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour towards her, but <hi>Lupratus</hi> stepping vnto them, vttered these spéeches. My maisters, thus long haue I liued your Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in this place, with care respecting your good as much as mine owne, and taking but an equall share with you, of such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes as wée haue taken, and rather the least part, now onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of my faith and fidelitie, I request to haue this Damosell as my prize, the rest of the wealth take you. In dooing which, you shall binde mée vnto you for euer. One of the rest liking <hi>Artesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aes</hi> bewtie as well as hée, and of a more rude minde, disdaining that hée alone should haue her possession, said. Captaine, all which you say wée confesse to be true: neither hath our care bin any way lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yours: therfore, there is no reason why you shuld claime any peculier priuiledge aboue any of vs: besides, you knowe wée made a law, and bound our selues to performe the same by oath, which was, that none should possesse any thing without the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral consent of vs all. Then performe those conditions, and let her belong to vs all, or to the chiefest of vs, &amp; in so doing, neither of vs shall sustaine wrong: thus began they to contend about <hi>Artesia,</hi> euery one desirous to possesse her, &amp; yet neither willing any shuld haue her but himselfe, that they were likely to mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus for a time this strife was ended, and <hi>Artesia</hi> was by <hi>Luprates</hi> kindly vsed for many daies: in the end their victuals began to waste, &amp; they thought it high time to seek for more, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they determined to fetch in some as before they had done.

Had you left me in <hi>Adellenas</hi> house, then had I not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into such miseries as since that I haue endured, nor <hi>Allinus</hi> for his vertue haue bene brought to pouertie, that being before my professed enemie, séeing my miserie, it so mollified his heart, that he hath pittied me, and sought my libertie, and onely by cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, not by iustice, haue you sought his ouerthrow. Then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you leaue me here, for I had rather indure the hazard of my misfortune, then liue to be tormented with your importunacie. <hi>Lenon</hi> was so amazed to heare her vnkind reply, litle thinking he had bene so much out of her fauour, that he could not tel what to say: sometimes thinking to leaue her there, and vtterly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake her, but that thought was soone ouercome by his affection or violent sting of desire to enioy her loue: that once againe he said; Why <hi>Artesia</hi> doo you regard my good will no more, then for my paines, to yéelde me rebukes: and for my loue, disdaine? That I caused you to be brought from <hi>Adellenas</hi> house, was, for that being there you were subiect to many misfortunes. And if I imprisoned <hi>Allinus,</hi> it was for that I supposed him your enemy, and feared he would haue done you wrong: so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer I did with intent of good, you repay me with dislike: &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert all my doings to the worst meaning: wherein you shewe your selfe too cruell, that will not yéeld me the least fauour for my constant loue. O <hi>Artesia</hi> be not so hard hearted, <hi>Artesia</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding many faire promises, vowes, and protestations he made, would not yéeld to go with him, but desired rather that he would leaue her there. <hi>Lenon</hi> tolde her, though not for his sake,
<pb facs="tcp:14095:46"/>
yet for her safetie, it were best for her to goe: which said, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded his seruants to place her in a Litter. Which when shée sawe shée must néedes doo, shee called to <hi>Ornatus,</hi> saying: Good Palmer go along with mée, that for the kindnesse you haue show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in preseruing my life, I may yéeld you some recompence. And (quoth shée) to <hi>Lenon,</hi> I request nothing of you for my selfe, but for this straunge Pilgrim, who when by the storme the ship was cast away, I readie to perish, caught me out of the water and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued my life: and do not for his good will to me, vse him as you did my deare <hi>Syluian,</hi> whom you banished, for that she preserued my life from my vnkind vnckle, with that shee wept excéedingly. Then <hi>Lenon</hi> asked <hi>Ornatus</hi> what hée was, I am (quoth hée) as you see, a Pilgrim, that was forced to come aboord the Pyrates ship, and (amongst the rest) was readie to perish, but that by the diuine prouidence, I was ordained to preserue that vertuous Damosels life. For that déede quoth <hi>Lenon,</hi> I will reward you most kindly: therefore go along with vs. Then they all departed to the Court. <hi>Lenon</hi> presently caused <hi>Artesia</hi> to bée lodged in a most sumptuous place of the Court, appointing diuers Damsels to attend her, thinking by those meanes to win her to consent to loue him: but all proued vaine, his care was cast away, his cost to little effect, and his kindnesse vnregarded. For <hi>Artesia</hi> was so constant to <hi>Ornatus,</hi> that shée hated <hi>Lenon</hi>: her heart was wholly imployed to wish his good, and <hi>Lenons</hi> ill. For she deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined neuer to loue him, though shee were assured of <hi>Ornatus</hi> death: that she spent her time in continuall care &amp; sadnesse, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no signe of ioy, no shewe of comfort, but euen as one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded no rest, nor tooke felicitie in any thing, that <hi>Lenon</hi> both admired the same, and laboured by many meanes to alter that humour: but the more hée sought to please her, the more she was displeased: and more discontented at his kindnesse then any thing else. In this sort she continued many dayes, without the least shewe of alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> all this while remaining in the Court, (making the cause of his state) to receiue <hi>Lenons</hi> promised reward, whereas

Can <hi>Artesia</hi> thinke either valour or vertue to rest in thée, when shée shall know how neare thou art her soe, but darest not touch him? will shée not estéeme shee a coward and vnworthie to enioy her loue? Nay when shée knoweth this, will she not alter her loue? Why shouldest not thou séeke thy owne content, though it bée with his discontent? thou art euery way as good as hée by birth, though hée now rule the land: hath not thy father said, that his father was but a Captaine in the last Kings dayes, and by treason put his lawfull King to death, and so wanne the rule? Then <hi>Ornatus</hi> reuiue thy spirites, séeme not dismaied with any daunger feare not misfortune, séeke to release thy Loue, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thy life therein: for liuing thus thou shalt be depriued of her loue. <hi>Lenon</hi> will by force or faire meanes ouercome her, and then maiest thou blame this delaie.

<pb facs="tcp:14095:47"/>
not chuse but note him, and withall remembred how earnestly <hi>Artesia</hi> had intreated him on the Pilgrims behalfe, whome he thought she estéemed, and therefore suddenly this cogitation arose in his fancie, to vse him as an instrument to win her loue: that calling <hi>Ornatus</hi> vnto him, hée said: Pilgrim, I pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hée blame me not for forgetting to performe my promise made to <hi>Artesia</hi> as concerning thée, which I haue not neglected for want of good will, but by reason of thousands of cares that daily torment me, only procured by her vnkindnesse: but if thou wilt vndertake on my behalfe to perswade her to yéelde to my iust request, for that I thinke thou maist preuaile with her aboue any, I will not onely reward thy former kindnesse so shewen to her, but also for thy paines herein, promote thee to high dignitie. Therefore I pray thee giue consent to follow my counsel herein. <hi>Ornatus</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be imployed in that businesse, which fell out according to his hearts desire: and therfore made him this answere.

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Rnatus</hi> at his first comming, found her sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the darkest corner of the Chamber, bewayling her misfortune, with salt teares bedeawing her purple cheeks: her ornaments disorderly put on, and her golden tresses han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging carelesly downe, which added bewtie to her swéete beawtie, and though disordered, most comely. Leaning her arme vppon a Chaire, and her chéeke laide vppon the backe of her hand: when hee beheld her sitting in this discomfortable sort, his hart was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to melt with remorse: and hée breathed forth so bitter a sigh, that shée heard the same, which he perceiuing came towards her with humble behauiour, saying. Most vertuous Ladie, pardon my presumption, in presuming thus vnmannerly to interrupt your quiet: <hi>Lenon</hi> the Prince hath appointed me to be your atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant, therefore I beséeche you, notwithstanding I am his substitute: commaund me in any doubtful sort, and I will most willingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my vttermost indeuours to purchase your content. <hi>Artesia</hi> raising her selfe from the ground, said. Pilgrim, I thanke you for your kinde profer, and am glad you are my keeper, for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: one, for that I trust your vertues will not suffer me to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured, the other, for that I would heare out your discourse of my deare friend <hi>Ornatus,</hi> which I was hindred from by <hi>Lenons</hi> suddaine finding me. Ladie, (quoth he) you shalbe assured of the one, and heare more of the other, if first you will vouchsafe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, to heare my spéech, and suffer me to execute the charge <hi>Lenon</hi> hath giuen mée, and I haue vndertaken. Why what is
<pb facs="tcp:14095:48"/>
that (quoth <hi>Artesia</hi>) I wil not be offended? <hi>Lenon</hi> hath made knowne to me his loue, and how long, and with what constancie it is grounded, commaunding and intreating me in his behalfe to become an humble suter vnto you: he telleth me that stil you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently disdain him without cause, reason, or consideration. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I humbly desire, both for that he is constant, a Prince, and of good and vertuous gifts, yéelde to his loue or else to satisfie me of the chiefest reasons that withold you from the same. Pilgrim (quoth she) for that my minde perswadeth me, you in wisedome will conceiue of reason: and will be faithfull in concealing that which I shall disclose: I answere you thus. First, admit <hi>Lenon</hi> did loue mée (yet by his vsage I finde the contrary) nor I cannot fancie him, for that I alreadie haue plighted my faith to another, more worthie then himselfe, which is that most vertuous &amp; kinde Gentleman <hi>Ornatus,</hi> who likewise equalleth me in affection: and therefore I should dishonour my name, breake my faith, and reape perpetuall infamy, if I should shewe my selfe so inconstant. These I thinke are reasons (to a reasonable creature) sufficient, and of such force, as none can contradict: and therefore no more can be said therein. Besides were not all this so, you haue no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to perswade me to that which I haue so often denied, and will neuer yéeld vnto. Your reasons indéed (quoth he) are great, and the cause such, as should no way be violated: but now you are subiect to his mercie: and he may inforce you to that which you are most vnwilling to haue done: then what remedie haue you, but rather to yéelde, then indure such extremitie as he may vse? Yes, (quoth she) when I can preserue my selfe no longer from his lust, death shall rid mee from his power, which I will execute vpon my selfe, rather then condiscend to yéeld him so much as an outward shewe of fauour. Therefore I pray vse no more words tending to the breach of my faith, and furtherance of his loue, for kne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of whom if you can tell me any tidings, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séech you impart them vnto me: thereby to adde comfort to mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate my care.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> was so rauished to heare her vtter such heauenly spéeches, that he had much adoo to refraine from imbracing her: vttering these spéeches. How happie is <hi>Ornatus</hi> by attaining the loue of so vertuous and constant a Ladie, worthy to be admired, eternized, and for euer honored? what comfort may these pleasing words bring to his heart? What torment can be not account plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, indured for so swéet a Ladies safety? and what paines should he refuse to procure her swéet content? O <hi>Artesia,</hi> diuine <hi>Artesia, Ornatus</hi> is not able to expresse his content, nor your desert: vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to recompence your kindnesse, and euerlastingly bound to you in all f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His reward is greater then his paine: his pleasure more then euer his sorrowe could be: and his gaines a thousands times beyond his losse. Why shuld I then conceale the troth of his safetie from you? With that he said: Behold <hi>Artesia,</hi> your <hi>Ornatus</hi>: with that he discouered himselfe vnto her, &amp; she perfectly knewe him. Being almost ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with that heauenly sight: when with a swéete behauiour, they both imbraced eache other, intermingling their kisses, with teares of ioye that in aboundance distilled from their eyes, surfetting so much in that sweete delight, that they were loath to part, but that feare to be espied, compelled thm.

At last hauing somewhat recreated themselues, and with sodaine ioy bannisht some part of their care, they thought it

Therefore <hi>Ornatus</hi> said? My most deare and kind <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesia,</hi> by whose loue my life is preserued. I am not able to expresse the ioy my heart conceiueth, by this fortunate méeting, béeing likewise as sory to thinke of the misfortune you haue indured by my carelesse ouersight, and how to get you from this place, and from <hi>Lenons</hi> affection, whom I know to bée of such vnciuill a disposition, that he will leaue no disloyall meanes vnattempted to further his intent.</p>
            <p>Therefore in this vrgent extremitie, if you will be contented to estéeme me as your friend, and follow my directions, I will labor all that I can to get you from this place. My true friend <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (said <hi>Artesia</hi>) I haue dedicated my self to your disposition, and made my selfe all one with you, both in heart, body, and minde, that whatsoeuer you would wish your selfe, you do to me, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer pleaseth you, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not displease me, for I am your selfe: therfore I commit all things to your wisdome &amp; rest to be ruled, counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ordered by you, in whatsoeuer you shall thinke conuenient: and will doo any thing you shall counsaile me vnto, both for our escape from hence, or otherwise: accounting my blisse yours, and yours mine, your cares mine, and your quiet, my content.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenons</hi> loue is most hatefull vnto me, and iniutie to you, then what meanes can you work to ridde me, of that and reuenge your owne wrong, performe, for my consent is readie to yéeld to any thing you shall thinke conuenient.</p>
            <p>I most humbly thank you, said <hi>Ornatus,</hi> and first I think this is the best course, to procure my good liking with him, and to rid vs from hence, that at his next comming, you shewe a little more friendly contenance vnto him, then heretofore you haue done, as shall best agrée with your wisdome, and he perceiuing that my seruice hath done more for him then euer he could attaine, will not only credit me, but also be ruled by mée in any thing I shall counsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I would neuer of my selfe yéelde vnto, for that my loue to you, and hate so him, would not suffer me so much to dissemble: but I pray God deliuer me well from forth of his power, that I may in quiet enioy your swéete company. These spéeches being ended, they parted with a swéete kisse, he sighing, and she for griefe shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding teares. Not long after <hi>Lenon</hi> came to <hi>Ornatus,</hi> requesting to know whether he had preuailed any thing with <hi>Artesia</hi> in his behalfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My Lord (quoth he) I haue vsed many perswasions to her, which in some sort haue preuailed, but hereafter I doo not doubt by my perswasions, but to winne her full consent: if you with wisdome will be directed by me, and not with rashnesse marre all: therefore goe in vnto her, but not to rashly, and sée if she be not altered, <hi>Lenon</hi> imbraced him in his armes, saying: thou bringest me tydings of exceeding comfort, for which I will reward thee most bountifully, With that he gaue him a purse of gold: which <hi>Ornatus</hi> tooke, thinking that should be a meanes to further him, and hinder the giuer <hi>Lenon</hi> entred <hi>Artesias</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, vsing many kinde speeches and submisse behauiours, whome she vsed more kindly then euer she had before done, which both filled his heart with ioy, and made him according to the Pilgrims directions, more carefull of his behauiour, least by any boldnesse he might offend her, that hauing past some small time with her, he departed.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Ornatus</hi> studying how to release <hi>Artesia,</hi> to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whose intent, the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> to yeeld thereto, requested him to send Ambassadours into <hi>Phrygia,</hi> either to request performance of certaine articles, or
<pb facs="tcp:14095:50"/>
else to giue him open defiance for war. The articles were these: that <hi>Allinus</hi> shoulde bée restored to his lands, and the dammage and losse he had sustained, should bée repaied to the full, that his wife should bée recalled from banishment, and that he should yéeld vp <hi>Artesia</hi> to <hi>Allinus,</hi> if shée should bée in his custodie and that the King and <hi>Lenon</hi> should bee sworne to performe all this. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> was easily wonne, and therefore presently sent foure of his Noble men as Ambassadors, to request the performance of those conditions.

            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> finding him remote from the Camp, came to him, and after salutation, said: Sir <hi>Phylastes,</hi> I am sent vnto you by a deare friend of yours, named <hi>Ornatus</hi> who trusteth so much in your vertues, that he is willing to put his life into your hands, which you shall hazard, in denying him one small fauour, which with safetie you may graunt. First therefore, I request but your promise for your warrantie, and then I will declare what I haue in charge.</p>
            <p>My friend (quoth <hi>Phylastes</hi>) thou tellest me newes of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when thou sayest thou comest from <hi>Ornatus,</hi> whom I feare is long since dead: but if thou knowest the contrary, and canst resolue me thereof, I promise and sweare to performe whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou shalt demaund: for I am sure <hi>Ornatus</hi> knoweth that I loue him, nor maketh any doubt thereof, which if hee doo, he iniurieth that loue and friendship that hath past betwéene vs.</p>
            <p>Then kinde sir (quoth he) that <hi>Ornatus</hi> is not dead, but in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and I am that <hi>Ornatus,</hi> that notwithstanding my spéech, make no doubt of your loue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phylastes</hi> beholding his countenance, knewe him well, and for ioy caught him in his armes.

            <p>I thanke you (quoth <hi>Ornatus</hi>) to enter into the tedious discourse of my afflictions, would be tedious: but in few words I will tell you all. I loued <hi>Artesia</hi> long, but found no hope nor meanes to attaine my loue, which made mee disguise my selfe into womans apparell, naming my selfe <hi>Syluian,</hi> and was fortunately entertained by <hi>Arbastus,</hi> whose death I founde to bee acted by <hi>Floretus,</hi> who falling into loue with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then I beséech you remit this care for my safetie, for I will preserue my selfe from daunger for your sake.

Besides, my honor vrgeth mée, reuenge of iniuries done to your selfe and me, and my fathers safetie, are reasons sufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade your consent: besides many other causes more forcible then these, too tedious to recite.

With these studies hee sat a good while silent, till hee perceiued them inclinde to sleepe, and casting his eye aside, espied a bill hanging by the wall, to which hee stole secretly, and taking hold of the same, he drew towards them, entring into these medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And shall I now commit murder, and indanger my soule by so hainous a sin? what will <hi>Artesia</hi> say if she know thou art so bloodily bent? and that thy heart is so hard, as to shead thine own countrey mens blood? <hi>Ornatus</hi> be wel aduised before thou do this déed, and bethink of some other meane: auoid the danger thou art readie to fall into.

<pb facs="tcp:14095:56"/>
First requesting the seruants to be carefull of her good, and then without delaye, both furnishing himselfe and <hi>Phylastes,</hi> with rich armor and horse, of which there was great choyce in that Castle: and for that the day began to appeare, they thought it time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, least their comming from thence might be discouered: There might one behold sorrow at parting in his right forme, hart-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sighes, breathing sad Farewels, and sorrowfull teares at so sad a parting, when their lippes were parted, their hands still fast, their hands disioynd, then their voyces oftentimes vttering, that woful word, Farewell: and when they were past hearing, their eyes vnwillingly leauing each others sight, he being without loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king backe, and shée within looking after, so long as she could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the glimering glance of his bright armor, and he being pass sight of her, with watry eyes beholding the place of her abode, thus parted they, as if they had parted neuer to méete. Drawing nigh the armies, they beheld them met and in hot skirmish, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding still a good space, to sée to whether partie it was likely the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie would incline: and in the ende they beheld the <hi>Armenians</hi> begin to retrait, and <hi>Lenon</hi> with <hi>Thaeon</hi> his Father in the midst of the throng, making excéeding slaughter, and proud of their dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med conquest: which set <hi>Ornatus</hi> heart on fire, that hée rusht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the thickest of his Countrey men, yet not once offering a blow, nor sheading a drop of the bloud he loued, but onely making way to come to <hi>Lenon,</hi> which made them not offer to staye his passage: but admiring what he was, let him goe frée; after whom <hi>Phylastes</hi> hasted. The Souldiers séeing those two newe come Knightes offende none, admired what they should be, not one of them all offering a blow, because they offered none. By this time <hi>Ornatus</hi> was come to the place where <hi>Lenon</hi> was, who euen then &amp; not before had met <hi>Allinus,</hi> betwixt whom many blowes and some woundes were giuen and receiued, but <hi>Allinus</hi> had the worst by reason of his age. <hi>Ornatus</hi> knowing his Father by his armour, came betwixt them with his sword drawne, saying: <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> staye thy hand: let age goe frée, and let thy youth cope with mée, that am come to challenge thée before both the Armies: and
<pb facs="tcp:14095:57"/>
therefore as thou art the Kings Son, a knight and honorest arms, giue order by thy Herault, to staye the furie of the Battailes, till thou and I haue tryed our valours, otherwise this Knight and I haue vowed to huht thée from place to place, and neuer giue ouer, vntil wée haue spilt thy bloud.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenon,</hi> hearing this Champions proud challenge, sayd: If thou art a knight, a gentleman as I am, and canst shewe wherein I haue wronged thee, I will answere thée, otherwise knowe, that I scorne thée, although I know my selfe of sufficient strength to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate thy haughty presumption, were it neuer so great. With that two heraults were sent from either General, to part the souldiers, which done, <hi>Ornatus</hi> before the open assembly said. <hi>Lenon,</hi> first I saye I am a Gentleman, as absolute and as good as thy selfe: Prince I am none, neither art thou by right, but that by tyrannie and vsurpation thou holdest the same. I come as <hi>Artesias</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, to challenge thée of disloyalty, as the outrages thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, by detaining her libertie, do manifest. I challenge thée for dooing iniustice against <hi>Allinus,</hi> whom thou withholdest from his right, by trecherous malice. I challenge thée, as a partaker of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastus</hi> death, for that thou sufferest and vpholdest his murtherer <hi>Floretus,</hi> that hath deserued death. I challenge thée for oppression laid vpon this whole land. And lastly, for detaining <hi>Ornatus</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, who neuer was impeached of treason: and therefore if thou darest answere my challenge, I am here readie, otherwise, I here pronounce thée for a coward, &amp; a miscreant, not worthie to beare Armes. <hi>Lenon</hi> made this replie. Being accused by a straunger, without cause, I regarde it not, and béeing iudge my selfe, will not by thée be adiudged: but for thy proude challenge, I will answere thée, as little regarding what thou canst doo, as thou boastingly dost vaunt of thy valor. Therefore euen now before I deport, I will without delay abate thy haughtinesse, though thy accusations are manifestly false: for I both loue and esteeme <hi>Artesia</hi> as deerely as I doe my selfe: my title to the Crowne, is iust: for <hi>Allinus</hi> hee is both a traitor at home, and abroade: first in causing his comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:14095:57"/>
bands, to destroye the Countrey. For <hi>Floretus</hi> pardon, it is mercie, not iniustice. As for oppression done to <hi>Ornatus,</hi> all knowe, I neuer iniuried him: but if hée take the Iustice that is done to his traiterous father, as done to him, I cannot helpe that: but reuenge it thou, since thou art his Champion. <hi>Ornatus</hi> had much adoo to stay to heare out his speeche, which galled him to the very heart, that without speaking a word more, hee smote at <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and <hi>Lenon</hi> with courage, answered his blowes, beginning a most flerce and forceable incounter, and with like furie continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, til both had receiued many wounds, and their steeds beganne to be furious and madde, with the smart of some strokes that mist their ayme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> calling to remembrance, first the iniuries he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that <hi>Lenon</hi> &amp; none else could dispossesse him of <hi>Artesias</hi> Loue, and many other wrongs he had done him and his parents, thought nowe to reuenge them all, and dispossesse <hi>Thaeon</hi> of the Crowne by <hi>Lenons</hi> death, reuiued his spirits with such courage, that he began with renewed strength to assaile <hi>Lenon,</hi> who euen then began to fainte, &amp; would haue yeelded, but that shame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him. Which when <hi>Ornatus</hi> perceiued, hée thought at once to ende the strife, that with one forceable blow, hée gaue him so de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Doo you not sée what destruction he hath brought vpon this land? Are not almost all the Nobilitie slaine and destroyed? Are not your liberties, goods and friends, taken from you? Is not the whole land in an vproare, and euery one driuen from his quiet at home, to venture his life in the fielde, and all this for satisfaction of his will and selfe commaund, not grounded vpon lawe nor iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? Examine your consciences, is he your lawfull King? did he not murther your lawfull King, onely to make you his vassels? Againe, doth <hi>Allinus</hi> séeke to do his Countrey wrong? doth hée come to oppresse you? doth hée séeke to abuse your libertie? No: hée onely commeth to claime his possessions, by iniustice taken from him: he commeth as vrged by griefe, not to liue as a bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed man, being himselfe, his wife, children and familie, driuen to liue in miserie and slauerie, for the satisfaction of his Lust.

the King appeared on the walles, demaunding what hee would haue. To whom <hi>Ornatus</hi> said: Tell <hi>Thaeon</hi> the King, that wée come to him from the Péeres of the Realme.

            <p>Quoth hée, I would haue you yéelde, least by resistance, you procure a greater mischiefe to your selfe, then is by vs pretended. Suppose I should yéelde (quoth he) how would you vse mee? Like a King (quoth <hi>Ornatus)</hi> honourablie. I haue found (said hee,) so small cause to trust you, that it were fondnesse to put my life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in compasse of your mercie: therefore I will kéepe my selfe where I am, not doubting ere many dayes, to haue so many friendes, as shall both chase thée, and the <hi>Armenians</hi> from the walles, and so out of this Countrey: which hée spake vpon the confidence he had in certaine friends, that had promised to gather newe forces, but meant neuer to performe the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ornatus</hi> was much troubles in his minde, to thinke what was become of <hi>Artesia,</hi> maruailing that hée spake not of her, nor could heare of any of her seruants, that hee might giue him know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge howe shée fared.

The nobles likewise gaue consent to that the multitude li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and <hi>Ornatus</hi> was chosen king, whom they wold haue crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but at his desire they defered the day of his Coronation for a month.

Thou makest brags of thy victorie, when thou mayst rather with shame kéepe silence, &amp; with remorse, repent that thou hast sought the death of thy lawfull king, béeing thy selfe a traitor. As hee would haue spake more, <hi>Ornatus</hi> interrupted him, saying: Hold thy peace, &amp; do not stir my mind to more sharp reuenge by thy replie, for I scorne to heare thée speake, therefore giue ouer, least I punish that tongue of thine for vttering such high words in defence of vice.</p>
            <p>Since (quoth <hi>Lenon</hi>) thou wilt not heare me speak in defence of my selfe, let me be conueyed from thy presence, for thy sight is as odious vnto mee, as mine to thée. Whilest they continued in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dellenas</hi> house, a messenger came running in breathlesse, vttering these speches: Behold most worthie <hi>Ornatus,</hi> I bring a message of much woe and heauie import: yesterday there was a messenger came to the court, that brought a letter in <hi>Artesias</hi> name to <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastes,</hi> as supposing him to be your selfe, wherein shée requested you to méete her this night at the Lodge in her Parke. <hi>Phylastes,</hi> who presently sent out a messenger to giue you knowledge therof, not hearing of his returne, went himselfe with some twentie in his company, to the place appointed, and entring, hée found not <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesia</hi> there, but a crew of Rebells, amongst whom <hi>Lucertus</hi> was chiefe, who all at once set vpon him and his followers, taking him for your selfe, hauing so many aboue the small number that were with <hi>Phylastes,</hi> that they had soone slaine most of them that were with him, and himselfe not able to withstand such a multitude, had receiued many grieuous wounds, &amp; had bin surel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Early the next morning, <hi>Ornatus</hi> putting himselfe in his Palmers weedes, and couering <hi>Artesias</hi> face with a vale, &amp; carrying <hi>Lenon</hi> with them bound, departed towards the Court. The next morning the Péers of the Land being still there, assembled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, amongst whom was <hi>Allinus,</hi> that likewise had found his Ladie, who hearing of his happie successe against <hi>Thaeon,</hi> was that morning newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at the Court, and by him entertained with excéeding ioy.</p>

The Nobles beholding him, were amazed at his sight, but beeing assured it was he, by the perfect knowledge they had of him, <hi>Ternus</hi> said: <hi>Lenon,</hi> I had alwaies thought thou hadst borne the mind of a Gentleman, but now I finde the contrary in thée, and that in the most shamefulst degrée.

With that, Duke <hi>Ternus</hi> and all the rest came to him, vsing him with such behauiour as belonged to him they had chosen King, seating him in an Imperiall chaire. Hée being set thus, said: My Noble Lords, I thank you for intituling mée with this excéeding honeur: therefore my desire is, since you haue elected mée of your free and bounteous hearts so be your King, let mee this day and instantlie, be installed with possession of the Dyademe, for that I haue nowe no further cause of care to cause me defer the same: &amp; likewise, that I may giue iudgement against these most wicked conspirators. The Nobles with ioyfull hearts gaue consent, and immediately crowned him, with bended knées doing him reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: which done, <hi>Ornatus</hi> rising from his imperiall seate, came to <hi>Artesia,</hi> taking her by the hand, and leading her vppe the throne, seated her in the chaire, placing the Crowne vppon her head, saying: My Lords, I pray likewise be contented w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> that I do, &amp; as you haue elected mée king make this your Quéene: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> puld hee off the vale from <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> face, and her cleare beautie appeared to the admiration of all, who beholding, in humble sort did her reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, making excéeding shouts for ioy, their harts being all excéedingly glad of her safetie.</p>
