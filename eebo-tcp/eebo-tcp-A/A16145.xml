            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Haue bene very vnwilling (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader) to enter into these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies of Discipline, that haue now some space troubled the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. I remembred the wordes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> to <hi>Lot;</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="margin">Gen. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Let there I pray thee, be no strife betwixt thee and me, nor betwixt my men and thine for we be brethren;</hi> and did thereby learne that all strife betwixt brethren, was vnnaturall. I could not forget the saying of our Sauiour; <note n="2" place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> 
               <hi>Peace I leaue with you, my peace I giue you;</hi> and so col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected how <hi>carefull</hi> we should be to <note n="3" place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> 
               <hi>keepe the vnitie of the spirite in the band of peace.</hi> Prophane writers could tell me; <hi>by concord, the weakest things growe strong; by discord, the mightiest states are ouerthrowen:</hi> and that made me loath to increase or nourish the dislikes and quarels that haue lately fallen out in this Realme, betwixt the Professours and Teachers of one and the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: yet when I sawe the peace of Gods Church violated by the sharpnesse of some mens humours; and their tongues so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, that they could not bee discerned from open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, I thought as in a common danger, not to sit looking till all were on fire, but rather by all meanes to trie what kind of liquor would restinguish this flame.</p>
            <p>Another reason leading mee to this enterprise, was the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my duetie to God and her Maiestie. for finding that some men broched their disciplinarie deuises vnder the title of Gods eternall trueth, and professed they could no more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb facs="tcp:2102:3"/>
the defence thereofthen of the Christian faith; and others defaced and reproched the gouernement of the Church heere receiued and established, as <hi>vnlawfull, irreligious</hi> and <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi> (for what lees are so sower, that some hedge wines wil not yeelde?) I was mooued in conscience, not to suffer the sacred Scriptures to be so violently arrested, and ouer-ruled by the summons and censures of their newe Consistories; as also to cleere this state of that iniurious slander, as if not knowing or neglecting the manifest voyce of Christes spirite, we had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and preferred the dregges of Antichrists pride and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie.</p>
            <p>These causes of great and good regard led mee to examine the chiefe groundes of both Disciplines, theirs and ours; and to peruse the proofes and authorities of either parte; that by comparing it might appeare, which side came neerest to the synce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itie of the Scriptures, and societie of the auncient and vncorrupte Church of Christ. The which wholie to propose by way of Preface woulde bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding tedious; shortely to capitulate, that the Reader may knowe what to looke for, will not altogether bee super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous.</p>
            <p>The maine supportes of their newe deuised Discipline are; <hi>the generall equalitie of all Pastours and Teachers; and the ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lay Elders with them to make vp the Presbyterie, that shall gouerne the Church.</hi> On this foundation they build the power of their Consistorie, that must admonish and punish all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, heare and determine all doubts, appease and ende all strifes, that anie waie touch the state and welfare of the Church. Against these false groundes, I shewe the Church of God from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> from <hi>Moses</hi> to Christ, and so downeward vnder Patriarkes, Prophetes, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, hath beene alwayes gouerned by an inequalitie and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie of Pastours and Teachers amongst themselues; and somuch the very name and nature of gouernement do inforce. for if amongst equals none may chalenge to rule the rest; there must of necessitie be superiours, before there can bee Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours. It was therefore a ridiculous ouersight in our new plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmers,
<pb facs="tcp:2102:3"/>
to settle an ecclesiasticall gouernment amongst the Pastours and Teachers of the Church, and yet to banish all supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie from them.</p>
            <p>Some finding that absurditie, and perceiuing confusion of force must follow where all are equall, and no Gouernour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; confesse it to bee <hi>an essentiall and perpetuall part of Gods ordinance, for each Presbyterie to haue a chiefe</hi> amongst them; and yet least they should seeme to agnise or admit the auncient and approued maner of the Primitiue Church retained amongst vs, which is, to appoint a fitte man to gouerne each Dioecese; they haue framed a <hi>Running regencie,</hi> that shall goe round to all the Presbyters of each place by course, and dure for a <hi>weeke,</hi> or fome such space; for the deuise is so newe, that they are not yet resolued what time this changeable superioritie shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. With this conceite they maruelouslie please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, in so much that they pronounce this onely to be Gods institution, and this ouerseer or Bishop to be Apostolike; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they reiect as humane; that is, as inuented and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by man against the first and authentike order of the holie Ghost.</p>
            <p>Thus farre wee ioyne, that to preuent dissention and auoid confusion there must needes, euen by Gods ordinaunce, bee a President or Ruler of euerie Presbyterie; which conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because it is warranted by the groundes of nature, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and trueth, and hath the example of the Church of God <hi>before, vnder, and after the Lawe</hi> to confirme it, wee accept as irrefutable; and laie it as the ground-worke of all that ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But whether this Presidentship did in the Apostles times, and by their appointment, goe round by course to all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours and Teachers of euerie Presbyterie, or were by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction committed to one chosen as the fittest to supplie that place, so long as hee discharged his duetie without blame; that is a maine point in question betwixt vs. Into which I may not enter, vntill we haue seene what the Apostolike Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries were, and of what persons they did consist at the first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of the Church.</p>
            <p>Certaine late writers, men otherwise learned and wise, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie misliking in the gouernement of the Church the Romish
<pb facs="tcp:2102:4"/>
kind of Monarchie, and on the other side shunning as much popular tumult and Anarchie, preferred a middle course be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them of Aristocracie; thinking the Church would then bee best guided, when neither <hi>one, for danger of tyrannie;</hi> nor <hi>all, for feare of mutinie</hi> did beare the swaie; but <hi>a number of the grauest</hi> and sincerest, vndertooke the managing of all matters incident to the Ecclesiasticall Regiment. And for that there was no possibilitie in euerie Church and parish to finde a full and sufficient companie of Pastours and Teachers, to consider and dispose of all causes occurrent; and the people (as they thought) would the better endure the proceedings and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of their Consistories, if some of themselues were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee Iudges in those cases as well as the Preachers; they compounded their Presbyteries partlie of Pastors, and partly of Laie Elders, whome they named GOVERNING PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTERS; and by this meanes they supposed the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church would bee both permanent and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
            <p>To proclaime this as a fresh deuise of their owne, would be some what odious, and therefore they sought by all meanes as well with examples, as authorities, to make it seeme aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. for the better accomplishing of their desire; first, they tooke hold of the Iewish Synedrion, which had Laie Elders mixed with Leuites in euery Citie to determine the peoples causes, and that order being established by <hi>Moses,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced it as a perpetuall paterne for the Church of Christ to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. To that end they bring the wordes of our Sauiour, <note n="1" place="margin">Math. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Tell it the Church, if he heare not the Church, let him be to thee as an Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nike and Publicane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, they perused the Apostles writings, to see what men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might bee there found of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Gouernours,</hi> and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on this sentence of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> 
               <note n="2" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The Elders which rule well, are woorthie of double honour; speciallie, they that labour in the worde and doctrine;</hi> they resolutelie concluded, there were some Elders in the Church that <hi>gouerned,</hi> and yet <hi>laboured not in the worde and doctrine;</hi> and those were Laie Presbyters. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this place they made no doubt, but Laie Elders were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the Church in the Apostles times, and so setled
<pb facs="tcp:2102:4"/>
their iudgements in that behalf, that they would heare nothing that might be said to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, because it would bee strange that Laie Elders e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie where gouerning the Church vnder the Apostles, no Councill, storie, nor Father, did euer so much as name them, or remember them, or so conceiue the wordes and meaning of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vntill our age; they thought it needefull to make some shewe of them in the Fathers writings; least other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, playne and simple men should maruell to see a new sort of gouernours wrenched and forced out of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> wordes, whome the Church of Christ in fifteene hundred yeeres neuer heard of before. And therefore certaine doubtfull speaches of the Fathers were drawen to that intent; as where they saie, <note n="1" place="margin">

               <hi>the Church had her Elders, without whose counsell nothing was done;</hi> yea, some of them were so forward and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare of their laie Presbyters, that wheresoeuer anie Councill or Father mentioned Presbyters, they straightway skored vp the place for laie Elders.</p>
            <p>This is the warpe and webbe of the laie Presbyterie, that hath so enfolded some mens wits, that they cannot vnreaue their cogitations from admiring their newe founde Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories. And in deede the credite of their first deuisers did somewhat amuse mee, as I thinke it doeth others, till partlie enclined for the causes aforesayd, and partlie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, where I might not refuse, I began more seriouslie to rip vp the whole; and then I found both the slendernesse of the stuffe, and loosenesse of the worke, that had deceiued so many mens eies.</p>
            <p>As first, for the Iewish Synedrion; I sawe it might by no meanes bee obtruded on the Church of Christ. for the Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of <hi>Moses</hi> law being abolished by the death of Christ, as well as the ceremoniall; the Tribunals of <hi>Moses</hi> must no more remaine, then the Priesthood doth. <hi>Moses</hi> Iudges were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to execute <hi>Moses</hi> lawe. the punishments therefore and iudgements of <hi>Moses</hi> law ceasing, as vnder the Gospel there can be no questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but they do; all such Consistories as <hi>Moses</hi> erected must needs be therewith ended &amp; determined. Again they were
<pb facs="tcp:2102:5"/>
ciuill Magistrates, that <hi>Moses</hi> placed in euery Citie to iudge the people, and had the sword to punish as the lawe did limite; Leuites being admixed with them to direct them in the doubts and difficulties of the lawe. Such Presbyteries if they frame vs in euery parish without the magistrates power and leaue; they make a faire entrie vpon the Princes sword and scepter, vnder the colour of their Consistories, which I hope they will be well aduised before they aduenture. Lastlie, that laie Elders in <hi>Moses</hi> lawe did meddle with discerning or iudging <hi>betwixt trueth</hi> and <hi>falsehood,</hi> things <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>vnholy,</hi> persons <hi>cleane and vncleane,</hi> or did intermeddle with the <hi>sacrifices or seruices of the Tabernacle,</hi> I doe not read; but rather the execution and superuision of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things and dueties belonged to the Prophetes, Priests and Leuites. So that laie Presbyteries vnder the Gospell can haue no agreement with the Synedricall Courtes of Moses, much lesse anie deriuement from them; vnlesse they will tye all Christian kingdomes to the Tribunals and Iudicials of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> lawe, and giue their Elders the sworde in steade of the word, which God hath assigned to Princes, and not to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
            <p>The wordes of Christ in the 18. of <hi>Mathew, Tell it to the Church,</hi> which they vrge to that ende; if they were spoken of such Magistrates as <hi>Moses</hi> appointed, and to whome the Iewes by the prescript of his Lawe, were to make their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; then pertaine they nothing at all to the Church of Christ; but were a speciall direction for those times, wherein our Sauiour liued, and those persons, that were vnder the Law. If they be taken as a perpetuall rule to strengthen the iudgement of Christes Church, then touch they no way the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrions of the Iewes, or any other Courts established by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> Let them choose which they will; neither hurteth vs, nor helpeth them.</p>
            <p>The place of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at a glimce seemed to make for them; but when I aduisedly looked into it, I found the text so little fauouring them, that in precise termes it excluded Lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as no Gouernours of the Church. for the Apostle there chargeth, that all <hi>Presbyters</hi> which rule well, should haue dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble honor.

               <hi>Thou shalt not musle the oxe that treadeth out thy corne,</hi> and <hi>the workeman is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his wages.</hi> Now by no precept, nor example, will it euer be prooued, that Lay <hi>Presbyters</hi> had in the Apostles times, or shoulde haue by the word of God at any time, double honour and maintenance from the Church of Christ. Wherefore they must either giue all Lay Elders double maintenance, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> willeth, which they doe not; or shut them cleane from these wordes, which yeelde double maintenance by Gods law to <hi>Presbyters</hi> that rule well. What the meaning of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is in this place, though much might bee saide, and is saide of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which I haue omitted; yet to satisfie the Reader, I haue laide downe foure seuerall expositions too long to bee heere inserted, which I willingly permit to the censure of the wise, whether euerie one of them be not more consonant to the true intent of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> then theirs is, and as answerable to his wordes.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Paul</hi> in plaine words did not disclaime Lay Elders, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no right to chalenge double maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from the church, nor other places contradict them; yet were there no reason vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the needlesse and iointlesse construction of this one sentence to receiue them. for by what logicke prooue they out of this place, there were some <hi>Presbyters</hi> that <hi>gouerned well, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not</hi> at all in the worde <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which is as much as <hi>specially</hi> or <hi>chiefly,</hi> doth distinguish (as they thinke) the one sort from the other by a superior degree. doth it not distinguish as wel things as persons? and note so well diuers respects as diuers subiects? for example if we should say, <hi>Magistrates that gouerne well, are worthy of double honor, specially they that heare the complaints of the poore.</hi> Were he not very fansiful that would hence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, there are <hi>ergo</hi> two sorts of magistrats, one that <hi>gouerneth wel,</hi> another that <hi>heareth the complaints of the poore?</hi> Againe, out of these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>Counsellors that be wise are acceptable to their Princes, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as are faithfull; workemen are rewarded for their skill, but specially for their paines; Pastors</hi> that be <hi>vertuous</hi> are to be <hi>wished for,</hi> but <hi>specially if they be learned:</hi> wil any sober man inferre that

               <hi>fidelitie</hi> and <hi>wisedome, skil</hi> and <hi>industrie, learning</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> do not meet in one subiect, because <hi>specially</hi> goeth betwene them? Nothing is more common, then by this kind of speach to note as well two diuers qualities in one man, as two sundrie sortes of men; yea thereby to preferre a part before the general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising that part. As <hi>Teachers are to be liked for their learning, specially for their knowledge in the Scriptures; good men are to bee loued for their vertues, specially if they be liberall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In these speeches,</hi> they will say, <hi>the persons be diuers, as well as the things for some</hi> Counsellors <hi>be wise, that be not faithfull; some workemen expert, that be not painefull; some Pastours learned, that be not vertuous.]</hi> That prooueth true, not by any force of these speeches, but by the defect of the persons that want fidelitie, industrie and integritie. for the words rather imploy that both parts should be, and therefore may be found in one man before he deserueth this adiection of <hi>specially.</hi> As a Counseller must be wise, and specially faithfull, before he can be acceptable to his Prince. A workeman must be painefull, as well as skilfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he deserue his wages. A Pastour must not only be honest, but also able to discharge his duetie, before he should be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed. And so by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words they may conclude, a Presbyter must not only gouerne well, but also labour in the word, before he may be counted to be <hi>specially,</hi> or <hi>most woorthie of double honour:</hi> other collection out of the Apostles wordes they can make none.</p>
            <p>And that shall wee soone finde, if wee resolue the Apostles wordes in such sort, as the nature of the Greeke tongue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth vs. The words stand precisely thus; <gap reason="foreign">

               <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb facs="tcp:2102:6"/>
               <hi>of double honor;</hi> well gouerning is the cause of double honour, neither is double honor due to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they <hi>gouerne well.</hi> Then resolue the Apostles wordes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a causall or conditionall adiunction, which is plainly the speakers intent, and we shall see howe little they make for two sortes of <hi>Presbyters. Presbyters, if they rule well, are worthie of double honour, specially, if they labour in the word; or Presbyters for ruling well are worthie of double honour; specially, for labouring in the word.</hi> Here are not two sortes of Elders, (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue) the one to gouerne, the other to teach; but two duties of eche <hi>Presbyter;</hi> namely to teach and gouerne, before hee can be most worthie of double honour.</p>
            <p>Their owne rules confirme the same. Those whome they cal <hi>Teachers</hi> or <hi>Doctours</hi> must they not <hi>labor in the word?</hi> There can be no doubt they must. Are they then <hi>most woorthie,</hi> or so <hi>worthie</hi> as Pastors be of double honour, who not onely <hi>labour</hi> in the word, but also <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>attend</hi> the flocke to rule it well? I trust not. Then Pastors are most worthie, and consequentlie more worthie then Doctors of double honor, because they not only watch to gouerne wel, but also labour in the word.</p>
            <p>If any man striue for two sorts of persons to be contained in these wordes, though there be vtterly no reason to force that collection, we can admit that also without any mention of Lay Elders.

<pb facs="tcp:2102:7"/>
them only by the place; as if Pastors were to <hi>ouersee and feede</hi> the flocke <hi>in the pulpite,</hi> and <hi>Laie Presbyt ers in the Consistorie.</hi> Which if they doe, they allow onely wordes to Pastours, and yeeld to laie Presbyrers, both Pastorall words and deedes; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them authoritie <hi>to feede &amp; watch</hi> the flocke of Christ more particularly and effectually then Pastours doe, or may by their doctrine. Such labyrinths they leape into, when they seeke for those things in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacred Scriptures, which were neuer intended.</p>
            <p>But were the word of God in this point indifferent, which for ought I yet see, is very resolute against them; the generall consent of alantiquitie that neuer so expounded S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, nor euer mentioned any laie Presbyters to gouern the Church, is to me a strong rampire against all these new deuises. I like not to raise vp that discipline from the dead, which hath lien so long buried in silence, which no father euer witnessed, no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill euer fauoured, no Church euer followed since the Apostles times, till this our age, I can be forward in things that be good, but not so foolish, as to thinke the church of Christ neuer knew what belonged to the gouernment of her selfe, till now of late; &amp; that the sonne of God hath bin spoiled of halfe his kingdome by his owne seruants and Citizens for these 1500. yeeres, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remorse or remembrance of any man, that so great wrong was offered him. I can yeelde to much for quietnes sake; to this I can not yeelde. They must shewe mee their Lay <hi>Presbyteries</hi> in some ancient Writer; or else I must plainly auouch their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories (as they presse them) to be a notorious, if not a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious nouelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ierome, Ambrose</hi> and others, are brought to depose, that the first Church had her Senate and Elders, without whose aduise nothing was done. but how wrongfully the deuise of Lay El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is fathered on them, I haue declared in a special discourse, I wil not heere repeate it; onely this I say, if any of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that in the Primitiue or Apostolike Church Lay <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> did gouerne Ecclesiasticall affaires, I am content to recall all that I haue written of this present matter; if not, it is no great praise, nor good policie for them to abuse the names and wordes of so many learned Fathers, to the vtter discredite of themselues and their cause in the end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2102:7"/>
Since then the Church of Christ, in, and after the Apostles times was not gouerned by Lay <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as this newe disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline pretendeth; it resteth that we declare by whom both the Apostolike church and the Primitiue after that were directed &amp; ruled; which I haue not failed to performe in many chapters, as farre foorth as the Scriptures doe warrant, and the vndoubted Stories of Christs Church do leade.</p>
            <p>In the Apostles I obserue foure things, needefull for the first founding and erecting of the Church, though not so for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing and maintening thereof; and foure other points that must be perpetuall in the Church of Christ. The foure extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary priuiledges of the Apostolike function were: Their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediate from Christ, not from men, nor by men; Their commission extending ouer all the earth, not limited to anie place; Their direction infallible, the holie Ghost guiding them whether they wrate or spake; and Their operation wonderful, as wel to conuert and confirme beleeuers, as to chastice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge disobeyers. Without these things the Church could not beginne, as is easily perceiued; but it may well continue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. for now God calleth labourers into his haruest by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not by himselfe; Pastors take charge of those Churches that are already planted, they seeke not places where to plant new Churches. The Scriptures once written serue all ages for instruction of faith; and the myracles then wrought witnesse the power and trueth of the Gospell vnto the worldes ende. Wherefore those thinges had their necessary force and vse to lay the first foundations of the gospel before Christ was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; but the wisedome of God will not haue his Church still depend on those miraculous meanes, which serue rather to conquere incredulitie then to edifie the faithfull; <note n="1" place="margin">1. Corinth. 14 verse 22.</note> 
               <hi>signes being</hi> (as the Apostle saith) <hi>not for such as beleeue, but for such as doe not beleeue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other foure points of the Apostolike delegation, which must haue their permanence and perpetuitie in the Church of Christ, are the <hi>Dispencing the word, Administring the sacraments, Imposing of hands,</hi> and <hi>Guiding the keys</hi> to shut or open the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. The first two, by reason they be the ordinary meanes and instruments by which the spirite of God worketh
<pb facs="tcp:2102:8"/>
ech mans saluation, must be general to al Pastors and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of Christs Church: the other two, by which meete men are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the ministerie of the word, and obstinate persons not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repelled from the societie of the saints, but also from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and hope of eternall life, respect rather the cleansing and gouerning of Christes Church, and therefore no cause they should be committed to the power of euery <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as the word and sacraments are. for as there can be no order, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in a common wealth where euery man ruleth, so woulde there be no peace, but a pestilent perturbation of all thinges in the Church of Christ, if euery <hi>Preshyter</hi> might impose handes, and vse the keyes at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>How the Apostles imposed hands, and deliuered vnto Satan, and who ioyned with them in those actions I haue handled in places appointed for that purpose; whereby we shal perceiue, that though the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of eache Church had charge of the worde and Sacraments euen in the Apostles times; yet might they not impose handes, nor vse the keys, without the Apostles, or such as the Apostles departing or dying left to be their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes and successors in the Churches which they had planted. At <hi>Samaria Philip</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="margin">Act. 8. verse 5. &amp; 12.</note> 
               <hi>preached</hi> and <hi>baptized;</hi> and albeit he dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the word and sacraments, yet could hee not impose handes on them, but <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> came from Ierusalem, and <note n="2" place="margin">Act. 8. ver. 17.</note> 
               <hi>laide their hands on them, and (so) they receiued the holie Ghost.</hi> The Churches of <note n="3" place="margin">Act. 14. ver. 21</note> 
               <hi>Lystra, Iconium</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> were planted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> at their returne forced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the number of <hi>Presbyters</hi> in each of those places by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of their handes: for so the worde <note n="4" place="margin">Act. 14. ve. 23</note>

            <p>I knowe some late Writers vehemently spurne at this; and hardly endure any difference betwixt Bishops and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> vnlesse it be by custome and consent of men, but in no case by any order or institution of the Apostles; whose opinions toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the authorities on which they builde, I haue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my small skill examined, and find them no way able to rebate the full and sound euidence that is for the contrarie. for what more pregnant probation can be required, then that the same power and precepts, which <hi>Paul</hi> gaue to <hi>Timothie,</hi> when hee had the charge of Ephesus, remained in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches throughout the worlde, to certaine speciall and tried persons authorized by the Apostles themselues, and from them deriued to their after-commers by a generall and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall succession in euery church and citie without conference to enlarge it, or Councill to decree it; the continuing where of for three discents the Apostles saw with their eyes, confirmed with their handes, and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> amongst others witnessed with his pen, as an order of ruling the Church approoued by the expresse voyce of the Sonne of God. When the originall proceeded from the Apostles mouth, and was obserued in all the famous places and Churches of Christendome, where the Apostles taught, and whiles they liued; can any man doubt whether that course of gouerning the Church were Apostolike? for my part, I confesse I am neither so wise, as to ouer-reach it with policie; nor so wayward as to withstand it with obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie.</p>

They are the conceits of some late Writers, that as touching the office and function of Bishops would faine finde a difference betwixt the Apostles times, and the next ages ensuing, lest they should be conuinced to haue reiected the vniuersal order of the ancient and Primitiue Church of Christ, without any good and sufficient warrant. The consent of all ages and Churches is so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g against them, that they are hard driuen to hunt after euerie syllable that soundeth any thing that way, &amp; yet can they light on no sure ground to builde their late deuises on, or to weaken the generall and perpetuall course which the Church of Christ hath in all places kept inuiolable euen from the Apostles times.</p>
            <p>A few wordes of <hi>Ambrose</hi> are set downe to beare all this burden: but they are so insufficient and impertinent to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that they bewray the weakenesse of their newe frame. for <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh not one word either of <hi>going by course,</hi> or of <hi>changing after a time;</hi> only he saith, Bishops at first were placed by order, and not by election, that is, the eldest or worthiest had the place whiles he liued; and after him the next in order with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further choice. for that order which he speaketh of, (if any such were,) proceeded from the first planters of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and went either by senioritie of time, or prioritie of place allotted euerie man according to the gifts and graces which he had receiued of the holie Ghost. This wee may freely grant without any repugnance, or annoyance to the vocation or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Bishops; let the Disciplinists confesse there was a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and distinct charge of the President or chiefe from the rest of the Presbyters, as well in guiding the keyes as imposing hands; and whether they were taken to the office by election or by order, to vs it is all one; I hope the placing of the Presbyters in order according to their gifts in the Churches where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles preached, could not be without the Apostles ouersight
<pb facs="tcp:2102:11"/>
and direction. and so long, whether they set such in order as were fittest for the place; or whether they left it to the discretion and election of the rest, we greatly force not. Howbeit the wordes of <hi>Ierome</hi> are so expresse that Bishops were made by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection euen in the Apostles times, that I see not howe they should be reconciled with their collection out of <hi>Ambrose.</hi>

            <p>For the manner of their succeeding whether by order or by choice, I make not so great account, as for their continuance. The Patrones of the late Discipline would make vs beleeue, that in the Apostles times the Episcopall dignitie or regiment of the Presbyterie went round by course to all the Presbyters, and dured a weeke or some such time, (for ghesses must serue them when other proofes faile them;) which assertion of theirs I knowe not whether I should thinke it proceeded of too much ignorance, or too little conscience. If the men were not well learned, I should suspect ignorance; if the case were not more then cleere, I woulde not chalenge their conscience. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they are, and the case so cleere, that in my simple rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I neuer sawe cleerer, nor plainer, (excepting alwayes the certaintie of the sacred Scriptures) let the Christian Reader iudge, for I dare not pronounce, with what intent a manifest trueth is not onely dissembled, but stoutly contradicted, and an euident falshoode auouched and aduanced to the height of an Apostolike and diuine ordinance, by the chiefest pillars of these newe found Consistories.</p>
            <p>It is lately deliuered as an Oracle, that vnder the Apostles there were no Gouernors of the Presbyteries, (whom they and we call Bishops) but such as <hi>dured for a short time,</hi> and <hi>changed round by course;</hi> and this is called <hi>the Apostolike and diuine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</hi>

            <p>They will easily grant fatherly moderation and Pastorall power vnto Bishops ouer the people, but not ouer the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; on this they set vp their rest, that no Pastour shoulde haue power ouer others of the same calling, and hope assuredly to haue the victorie. But they must first reconcile their owne contrarieties, they will triumph else before the conquest for ech Presbyterie, as themselues confesse, must haue a President by Gods essentiall and perpetuall ordinance. I aske now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God giue any man a bare title without any trueth, and a Regiment without all authoritie; or whether in Gods Lawe deedes and wordes concurre, and he be called <gap reason="foreign">

If then by Gods Law there must be Presidents ouer Presbyteries, ineuitably there must be Gouernours and Superiours ouer them.

Touching Synodall decrees, and Princes Lawes for Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes, since they must of force be committed to the care and conscience of some that shall execute them; I haue examined who are the meetest men to be put in trust with those matters; in whom there can be iustly no suspition nor occasion of tyrannicall dealing so long as Dioecesanes and Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes are limited by written Lawes in eche case what they shall do, and euery man that findeth himselfe grieued, permitted to appeale from them to Synodes or Princes; one of the which must needes take place, howsoeuer the Church be either in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution or peace.

            <p>My purpose was and is, the peace of Gods Church, so farre as it may stand with the trueth of his worde, and fellowship of his Saints, that haue gone before vs with wonderfull graces of his spirite, as well for the greatnes of their learning as holinesse of their liues; and to that ende haue I so tempered and delayed my stile, that I might not iustly offend such as are otherwise

            <p>Neither may we thinke that order and discipline is needfull for the people in Gods Church, and needelesse for the Pastours; that were to gard the feete, and leaue the head open to a more deadlie wound: but rather as the more principall the part, the more perilous the disease, so the more disordered the Pastours, the likelier the people to perish by their dissentions. The house cannot stand, which the builders subuert. The haruest is lost, where the labourers doe rather skatter, then gather.

the true worship of God agreeable to his will reuealed to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The <hi>right</hi> and <hi>power</hi> the father had ouer his children and houshold before the Lawe is expressed in these wordes: <note n="1" place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> 
               <hi>I know</hi> (saieth God) <hi>that (Abraham) will command his sonnes and his house after him to keepe the way of the Lord;</hi> which no doubt all the Patriarkes that were faithfull euen from <hi>Adam</hi> carefullie performed, and the children that were religious, reuerently obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the blessing of God passing by the fathers mouth vnto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in reward of their submission, or curse in reuenge of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. So <hi>Noah</hi> 
               <note n="2" place="margin">Gen. 9.</note> blessed <hi>Sem</hi> for couering his nakednesse; and by that blessing made him heire of the promise; and cursed <hi>Cham</hi> for deriding the shame of his father and insulting at it. So like wise <note n="3" place="margin">Gen. 27.</note>

            <p>As the Patriarkes were Prophets to declare to their children the promises and menaces of God; so were they magistrates to rule their families with fatherly coercion, such as God best allowed in the first world to gouerne his Saints. And for that cause did God comprehend Princes vnder the name of Parents in the Decalog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were the Patriarkes onely Princes within their tentes and dwellings; but also Princes in the Church of God, God alwayes reseruing the eldest and chiefest in those generations to serue him with sacrifice and thanksgiuing. To which end God did consecrate the first borne of their familie as holy to himselfe, to be Priests in his Church; and encreased their dignitie with this princely prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, that they should be Lords ouer their brethren, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their mothers children; as succeeding their fathers in the gouernment and Priesthood, vnlesse they were repelled from that honour by Gods secrete counsels or manifest iudgements; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers named by God himselfe to sustaine that charge. <note n="6" place="margin">Gen. 21.</note>

Thirdly, in his person was the prerogatiue of the first borne to bee chiefe ouer his brethren as well in religion as in ciuill regiment, and consequently to be king and priest in the house of God. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, by the length of his life he wel resembled the true <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> who by his birthright is king and priest for euer ouer the sonnes of God: for he came out of the Arke, as from an other world, no man liuing that knew his beginning; &amp; he dured more then <hi>500.</hi> yeeres, euen twelue descents after the flood; and so neither the beginning nor end of his dayes were knowen to the heires of promise. Lastly, successour on earth he left none, by reason <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom God called from his <note n="1" place="margin">Gen. 12.</note> 
               <hi>countrie, kinred, and fathers house,</hi> to inherite the promise and blessing next after <hi>Sem,</hi> and likewise <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> heires of the same promise with him, soiourned as strangers and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrines first in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (where <hi>Sem</hi> yet liued, and by force of his birthright and blessing continued a king and priest in his fathers house and citie, which was then the Church of God) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the land of Egypt, vntill the departure of <hi>Iacobs</hi> posteritie thence: amongst whose sonnes God diuided the honours and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of <hi>Sem,</hi> appointing the scepter and seed to <hi>Iudah,</hi> the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to <hi>Leui,</hi> the <note n="2" place="margin">1.

            <p>Whosoeuer <hi>Melchizedec</hi> was, this was the gouernement of the Church so long as <hi>Sem</hi> liued, which appeared in the person of <hi>Melchizedec:</hi> to wit, the father was ruler ouer his children, and the first borne ouer his brethren, as well in pietie as in policie; and this priuiledge of the eldest brethren to be kings and Priests in their fathers house, represented the choice that God made of his Saints in Christ his sonne, to be <note n="3" place="margin">1.

For the Church being enlarged and spred ouer the whole nation; the domesticall discipline that was before the lawe, could not so well fit the gouernment of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as of an household; and therefore out of twelue Tribes God chose one to retaine the priesthood and haue the ouersight of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and execution of all sacred seruice.

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2102:22"/>
The first and chiefest dignitie belonged to the high Priest, who by Gods appointment was <note n="1" place="margin">Num. 3. v. 32.</note>

               <hi>in all matters of the Lord.</hi> The which soueraigntie was not giuen him in respect he was a figure of Christ; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son God approoued superiour and inferiour callings in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth as the best way to gouerne his Church. <hi>Aarons</hi> priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in approching neerest vnto God, and in entering the second Tabernacle within the vaile, whither none might come saue the high priest alone, figured and shadowed the person of Christ; but by no meanes <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor none of his order did represent the roiall and iudiciall power of Christ. For then should Christ haue bene a priest after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> as well as of <hi>Melchizedec; if Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> had resembled both his kingdom and priesthood, as <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi> did. But without all question the scepter was seuered from the Tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> and giuen to <hi>Iudah;</hi> wherefore the high priest by his iudiciall dignitie could not foreshew the kingly seate and throne of Christ, and that is manifest by the different execution of his office. The high priest had the <hi>70.</hi> Elders as coassessours with him in the same Councell, Christ hath none: He with the <hi>70.</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hard and doubtfull matters by way of Appeale from inferiour Iudges; all matters without exception pertaine to Christes tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall originally, and not by way of deuolution: the high priest had a superiour to controle him and ouer rule him, euen the lawe giuer of <hi>Iudah</hi> that held the scepter; but Christ is farre from any such subiection. Wherefore the high priests superioritie to direct and determine in Councel such doubts as were brought vnto him, was no figure of the soueraigne and princely power that Christ hath in his Church, and shall execute at the last day; but rather it was the regiment and external discipline which God then embraced in gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Church of Israel.

            <p>From these superiour &amp; inferiour degrees amongst the priests and Leuites vnder <hi>Moses</hi> happily may no necessarie consequent be drawen to force the same to bee obserued in the Church of Christ. First, for that the tribe of <hi>Leui</hi> might not be vnguided without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest confusion, and was not subiected to the regiment of any other Tribe; but had the same maner of gouernment, by her Prince, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Iudges and Officers ouer <hi>1000. 100. 50.</hi> and <hi>10.</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tribes had in that common wealth.

For the Gospell doeth not expresse the maner and fourine of ciuill regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and positiue lawes, as the bookes of <hi>Moses</hi> doe; but leaueth such things to the care and conscience of the Magistrate, so long as their policie doeth not crosse the rules of pietie and charitie prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the Gospell: and therefore the Pastours and preachers of the new Testament must not chalenge to sit Iudges in those cases, which the Priests and Leuites vnder <hi>Moses</hi> did and might heare and determine.

               <hi>affection</hi> without iust cause. Lastly, the seruices about the Sanctuarie and Sacrifices (which none might doe but Leuites) were of diuers sortes, and therefore not without great regard were there diuers degrees e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished amongst them; though to serue God euen in the least of them, was honourable. Now in the Church of Christ, the word and Sacraments committed to the Pastours and Ministers, haue no different seruices, and so require for the discharge thereof no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant offices.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, for the better ordering, ouerseeing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining such in their dueties as be called to be the guiders and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gods people, that they may walke worthie their vocation without reproch of life, and be sound in faith without all leauen of false doctrine; the wisedome of God in appointing some amongst the priests and Leuites to guide and gouerne the rest of their Tribe as well in the ceremoniall as iudiciall part of <hi>Moses</hi> lawe, is not hastilie to be refused, nor lightly to bee neglected. For if gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be needfull amongst them that will liue in any societie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd disorder, whereof God is no way author; we cannot get, nor need not seeke a fitter or better paterne to follow (as farre as the difference of states and persons will permit) then that which God himselfe allowed and confirmed in the Church and common welth of Israel. And though the certaine forme of their ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment be neither exactly knowen in euery point, nor preciselie to be vrged in the Church of Christ by reason of many dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes betwixt vs and them; yet this is euident, that God appointed the Church of Israel to be guided, not by a generall equalitie of the priests and Leuites, but by certaine superiorities among them in euery calling; and that as wel in their conuersation as administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and their <hi>70.</hi> Elders &amp; supreme Council called their <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>To the true kingdom of Christ belong the manifold wisedome, might and mercies of God shewed on vs for our saluation; I meane all the <hi>Power, Grace</hi> and <hi>Glorie</hi> that God vouchsafeth to bestowe on his Saints in this life, and keepeth in store for them vntill the next; so that whatsoeuer effects of his trueth, gifts of his spirit, and feeling of his promise we presently possesse, or hope to haue at the handes of God through Christ our Lord, it proceedeth from the strength and fauour of this king.</p>
            <p>By the mightinesse of his power, though he sit in heauen, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that continuall protection, helpe and deliuerance, which we find in all our troubles and aduersities.

            <p>From the riches of his grace come all those heauenly giftes, fruits and blessings of his spirite where with the Church and euery member thereof is furnished and adorned, as namely the lightning of our mindes, softning of our hearts, quenching of our lustes; the grounding vs in faith, moring vs in hope, and rooting vs in charitie by the loue of his trueth, obedience of his will, and resemblance of his vertues, that hath called vs out of darknesse into his marueilous light.

            <p>I stand some what the longer in separating the true kingdom of Christ from the externall order and discipline of the Church; for that in our times some more zealous then wise, and too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to their owne fansies, haue promoted their Eldership and <hi>Presbyterie</hi> to the heigth of Christes scepter: and make grieuous outcries, as if the sonne of God were spoiled of halfe his kingdome, because their Laie-elders are not suffered to sit Iudges in euery parish together with the Pastour and Teacher of the place. I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute not as yet whether euer there were any such Elders (as they talke of) in the Church of Christ from the preaching of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to this present age; I reserue that to a further inquirie: but though there were such suffered or setled by the Apostles in the Primitiue Church, yet were they no part of Christes kingdome, which is proper to his person and by many degrees excelleth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gouernments, for the diuine force and grace that are eminent in the spirituall fruits and effects of his kingdom.</p>
            <p>I doe not denie but God hath ordained and established on earth many kinds of externall gouernments; as in spirituall causes, the Minister; in domesticall; the master of the familie; and superior to them both the Magistrate; &amp; what is prescribed or exacted by any of those that God hath set ouer vs for a quiet, honest, and Christian course of life in this world, according to his word and their charge, he doeth ratifie and confirme in heauen; accepting the submission, and punishing the rebellion of all that disobey in each degree: but neither Prince, Pastour, nor Parent can search or change the heart: much lesse can they endue it with any heauenly grace and vertue; or settle it with expertance of life to come. They mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and direct the outward actions which may bee soone dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;

further they neither see, nor iudge: they haue not to doe with the secrete affections of the heart, with the sacred giftes of the spirite, the stedfast trust of future glory; these alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the kingdom of Christ and of God, which <note n="1" place="margin">Eph. 1.</note>

And if hee will not vouch safe to heare them, tell it vnto the Church: if hee refuse to heare the Church, let him bee to thee as an Ethnike and Publicane.</hi> Hence they collect; first, that our Sauiour spake to the Iewes, by reason hee sayd, <hi>let him be to thee as an Ethnike and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane,</hi> whom the Iewes and no people els abhorted and shunned: next, that he preseribed no new, nor vnknowen forme of Iudiciall proceeding, but referred them rather to the vsuall and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus fame they seeme to haue some ground to support their opinion: but that our Sauiour appointed the like order to take place for euer in his Church, I see neither mention of it, nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it in the Scriptures, and assure my selfe it can neuer bee prooued. For if our Sauiour meant to transferre any kind of regiment from the Church of the Iewes to his owne; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine he would not choose out the corruptions of time, nor inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men; but ascend to the originall ordinance of God, and thence deriue his platforme.

If thou neglect, thou art woorse then he, he doth wrong, and by doing it grieuously woundeth himselfe; thou regardest not the wound of thy brother, thou feest him perish, and carest not for it.</hi> Our Sauiour then in this place speaketh of priuate offences and greeuances, which hee only that is oppressed, and no man else may reproue and forgiue: of publike sinnes he speaketh not; the doers whereof must not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued in secrete; nor twise admonished, before they be censured by the Church. The incestuous Corinthian had neither priuate, nor double warning giuen him, before hee was deliuered to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan by <hi>Paul,</hi> and wee must not thinke the Apostle would so soone forget, or so flatly crosse his masters meaning, if Christ had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this of open wickednes hatefull to God, and heinous in the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>or wife that is in thy bosome, or friend which is as thine owne soule, intice thee secretly, saying; Let vs go &amp; serue other gods: thou shalt not consent vnto him, nor heare him, thine eie shal not pitie him, nor shew mercy, nor keepe him secret; thine hand shall be first vpon him to put him to death, and then the hands of all the people.</hi> And so for all enormous sinnes against God and our neighbour, a concealer is a consenter and partaker of the wickednes committed. It is no pietie, it is no charitie, to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to malefactors and keepe their counsell, when they dishonour God, or damnifie their brethren, although repentance followe. That may saue the soule, if it be vnfained; but that may not stay the iust execution of Gods or mans Lawes. Agame, what power haue we to remit the wrongs that are offered to others? Our owne iniuries, if withall they be not publike crimes against the Lawes of God, and the land where wee liue, wee may forgiue; other mens harmes wee may neither suffer, nor smoother. Since then Christ speaketh of such trespasses as eche man must remit vnto his brother vpon repentance; it is euident hee speaketh not of sinnes against God and our neighbours, hidde from the multitude, and knowen to a few; but of such iniuries, as he that feeleth, best kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth; and may release, because they touch him alone, and no man else. When we desire of God to be forgiuen our debts, as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue our debters; meane we the sins against others that we be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy to; or the sins against our selues that we be parties vnto? Is it silence that God requireth of vs in this prayer, or patience? secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or mercie? In secret sinnes we are but witnesses, in which case it is a sinne to be silent: in priuate wrongs we be sufferers; vnder which burden it is a vertue to be patient. Lastly, this exposition ouerthroweth it selfe. For if thy brother <hi>trespasse against thee</hi> in that sort, which they interprete; that is, if his sin be <hi>knowen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thee,</hi> and do not repent, howe caust thou tell it the Church? without proofe the church must not beleeue nor regard thy speach; and proofe thou hast none. One and the same person can not be both accusant &amp; deponent; and at the mouth of one witnesse though his testimonie were receiued, yet may no man be condemned. So that if the sinne be secret to thee, how can it be tolde and iustified to the Church? If it may be prooued to the Church, how is it secrete
<pb facs="tcp:2102:32"/>
to thee alone: Our Sauiour then had no such meaning that eche man should conceale and forgiue the sinnes that are done against God and his neighbour, so long as they be not notorious and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, but knowen onely to some priuate persons; hee rather enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all men to remeate the same measure vnto others, that God meateth vnto them; and to forgiue smaller iniuries offered against them, as they are forgiuen greater committed against God. For that is thankes-worthie with God, not to be liberall in remitting other mens wrongs, nor to keepe counsell with malefactors, but to pardon our brother that offendeth vs; as we are pardoned when we offend our heauenly Father. This is it that Christ prescribeth in this place, that the Scriptures so often iterate; and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with one consent subscribe vnto.</p>
            <p>But <note n="1" place="margin">1. Pet. 4.</note>

First, this was a direction to the Iewes seruing them for their present state and time; &amp; then had Christ no Church in Iewrie to which they might complaine for he <note n="3" place="margin">Iohn 18.</note> 
               <hi>euer preached in their Synagogues and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> whither al that would resorted, <hi>and in secret said he nothing;</hi> much lesse did hee gather and assemble Churches apart from the rest of the Iewes to receiue and consider the complaintes of their brethren. Next, the matters of which they must complaine, were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2102:32"/>
such; as the Church of Christ might not chalenge to heare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. Priuat wrongs and offences betwixt man and man must be directed by lawes &amp; reformed by iudgements; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to the Magistrate; the Church of Christ hath no warrant to make lawes or giue iudgement in ciuil and priuate trespasses.

Thirdly, that Church is heere spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, which abhorred Ethnikes as vncleane persons; and shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned al society with Publicanes: but neither Christ, nor his Church did euer so; wherefore the Church of Christ, is not expressed by these words; <hi>Let him be to thee as an Ethnike and Publicane;</hi> for they neuer refused nor declined to conuerse with either.</p>

               <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans shal go into the kingdome of heauen before (the Scribes and Elders that despised them.)</hi> The Publicanes then were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christes Church and inheritours of his kingdome; and therefore by flying and forsaking the felowship of Publicanes, the Church of Christ could not be described.</p>
            <p>The Iewes, you will say, to whome Christ spake, made that account of them; and as they were cast out of the Iewes Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogues, so doeth Christ will disobedient and impenitent sinners to be vsed in his Church; that is, to be separated and excluded from the number of the faithfull. What account soeuer the perfidious and presumptuous Pharisees made of them, Christ and his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which were also Iewes, had as great regarde of them as of the rest; yea so farre was hee from allowing it in the Iewes and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2102:33"/>
proposing it to his Church, that by his life and doctrine, as I haue shewed, he openly disliked and dissuaded the contempt which the Priests and people had of the Publicanes.</p>
            <p>As for Ethnikes and Gentiles, though they were strangers to the common wealth of Israel, when as yet they knew no God; yet neuer were they persons excommunicate; and since the appearing of our Sauiour in flesh, through his mercy vouchsafed to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his promises, &amp; the true members of his Catholike church. So that this can be no rule for Christs Church to measure persons excommunicate by Gentiles and Publicanes; since amongst the Iewes, Publicans beleeued and entred the kingdome of God, and after the reiection of that Nation, the Church of Christ consisted chiefly, if not wholy, of Gentiles and Ethnikes. This then can not be the true intent and purpose of our Sauiour in that place, to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize his Church vpon priuate quarrels betweene man and man to excommunicate, if her verdict be not obeyed. Where there is a Christian Magistrate, the Church may not claime or presume to decide such matters, by publike audience and sentence, without encroching on the Princes sword and scepter, whose right and charge it is <hi>to</hi>

               <hi>going to law vnder the vniust (Magistrates) and not rather vnder the Saints (though priuate persons?) Paul</hi> did not debarre the Magistrates that were Infidels, of their iurisdiction; nor create new Iudges for ciuil of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences in the Church; it was beyond his calling and commission to doe either of them: but perceiuing that Christians pursued eche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for priuate quarrels before vnbeleeuers to the shame of the Church and slander of the Gospel; he saith they were better suffer wrong &amp; losse in earthly things, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> expose the doctrine of Christ to be derided of his &amp; their enemies. And to appease their brabbles &amp; end their strifes if they were so contentious, hee willeth them to choose, if not the wisest, yet the woorst and least esteemed in the Church to arbitrate their causes, rather then to lay themselues &amp; their whole profession open to the mockes and taunts of heathen and profane Iudges. To preserue peace &amp; loue in the Church, the godly might then, and may now mediate betweene brethren, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2102:33"/>
friends and welwillers to both parties; and likewise debate and conclude their cases, as Arbiters chosen by consent of either side: but they may not interpose themselues as Iudges authorized by Christ to excommunicate all that will <hi>not heare them</hi> in priuate griefes and ciuil suites: that were, to take the sword, which is not giuen them, and to thrust themselues by this pretence into Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces places; which neither Christ prescribed, nor <hi>Paul</hi> imagined, nor the Church assumed.</p>
            <p>And yet was here giuen vnto <hi>Paul</hi> a iust occasion to repeate and renew that order, if Christ had ordained any such in his Church. For the Christians trespassed one an other; and <hi>Paul</hi> by no meanes permitted them to pursue their brethren at the Tribunals of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels. What sayeth he then: doeth he wil them <hi>to tel the Church; and if</hi> the wrong doer <hi>heare not the Church,</hi> to account him <hi>as an Ethnike and Publicane?</hi> If Christ prouided this as a reoresse for priuate wrongs and offences in his Church; shal we thinke the Apostle durst alter his masters order, and abrogate the course, that Christ layd down to pacifie contentions in his Church. No doubt he would rather haue recalled them toit, then auerted them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. What doeth he now: <note n="1" place="margin">1. Corinth. 6.</note>

We must first conceiue that in the time of our Sauiour and a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before his birth, the Romanes had taken the Scepter and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie from the Iewes, as <hi>Iacob</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="margin">Genes. 49.</note> prophecied shoulde come to passe in the dayes of the Messias; leauing them in priuate suites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man, and in smaller cases of correction, that kind of regiment and forme of Lawes which God by <hi>Moses</hi> ordained; and excepting from their Lawes and Tribunals al strangers, that were amongst them, or had any thing to do with them, (whom the Iewes called Ethnikes and abhorred as prophane persons;) and like wise Publicanes, that is, such of the Iewes, as did any seruice to the Romanes in collecting and answering the tributes, taxes and toles due to the Romane Empire, whome the Iewes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued with greater dislike and despite then they did strangers, for keeping companie with the heathen, and seruing their turnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their owne Nation. Both these sortes of men, as well Publicanes as strangers, for the detestation and hatred the Iewes had of them, were exempted from the Lawes and Iudgements of the Iewes; and if any man had ought against them, hee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent them before the Romane President, and not in any Court of the Iewes, nor before any Magistrate of the Iewish profession. The like libertie was left to any Iew that woulde appeale to the Romane Gouernour or impeach and molest his brother in anie of the Roman Consistories. For though the Iews in many things were left to their Countrie Lawes: yet were the Romane Courts amongst them so priuiledged, that who would, might haue recourse thither, and there recouer his right, or redresse the wrong offered him.</p>
            <p>In this confusion of the Iewes estate lately begunne and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day increasing, our Lorde and Master liuing, directeth the people what way they shall take, neither to breake the law of God which <hi>Moses</hi> gaue them, nor to impugne the Romane Empire which then gouerned them.

Our Sauiour then meaneth, that if charitable and brotherly admonitions be neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; they should seeke their remedie from the Iudges and Elders of their Cities, as by Gods law the Iewes were directed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tell it vnto the Church</hi> then, is as much as tel it, (not vnto the Church of Christ, which as yet was not seuered from the Iewes, nor assembled together; and therefore had then neither places nor persons specified or authorized for that purpose) but vnto that Councel of Magistrates, which God by <hi>Moses</hi> commanded to haue the hearing and ending of those causes. For Christ by this precept doth not establish new Iudges, nor erect new Consistories; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the people to Gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce expressed in the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and already receiued and vsed in that common wealth: thereby meaning, that if the doers of wrong to their brethren would not be reformed by priuat and friendly admonition &amp; intercession, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties grieued might with good conscience aske the aid and assistance of those Magistrates, whom God had appointed ouer them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and force the trespassers to surcease their iniurious dealings.</p>

               <hi>Wee must note, they are fouly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, which would conclude out of this place, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of al matters must be referred to the assembly of the whole multitude. The name of the Church say they, is neuer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vsed; which euen out of this place is proued to be false. For surely it appeareth, that this is spoken as it were of the Iewes, by that which is added, Let him be to thee as an Ethnicke and Publicane. Now, that iudgements amongst the Iewes were exercised by the Elders, and that their manner was not euer to assemble the whole multitude, all the writers of those matters do witnes. And truely vnlesse Christ had fitted all this speach vnto the vse that was in his time, who coulde haue vnderstoode him what hee saide? It is lastly to bee obserued, that in this one place of all the new Testament the name of the Church is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Iewes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words which followe, <hi>if he heare not the Church, let him be to thee as an Ethnike and Publicane;</hi> must import either the punishing his obstinacie which obeyed not the Iudgement of the Rulers and Magistrates that were of the Iewes; or a further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing him before others y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> had more power to represse such insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. If they expresse any punishment for his wilfulnes; that must proceed either publikely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iudges, or priuately fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife. The punishment of him y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> disobeied the Magistrate, by Gods Law was <note n="3" place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> 
               <hi>death:</hi> that Christ would not alter. For he came not to change the ciuil gouernement, or qualifie the iudicall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Moses</hi> Law; but to leade them the way to the celestiall and eternall kingdome of God. The chiefe Rulers and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Iewes, being his capitall aduersaries, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his authoritie, would neuer respect his counsell nor commandement. The wordes themselues haue reference to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person, <hi>Let him be to thee as an Ethnike and Publicane.</hi> Christ therefore in these words decreed no publike punishment.</p>
            <p>As for priuate reuenge, he was farre from liking it, and further from teaching it. <note n="4" place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> 
               <hi>False Prophets</hi> we must <hi>beware;</hi> and with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious wicked persons we must not keepe companie: but priuate iniuries we must rather suffer with patience, then resist with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2102:35"/>
or requite with disdaine. <note n="1" place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Resist not euill</hi> saieth Christ to all his disciples; <hi>but whosoeeer shall smite thee on the right cheeke, turne to him the other also; and if any will sue thee at the law to take away thy coate, let him haue thy cloake also.</hi> Then may wee not reiect &amp; detest our brother that doth vs wrong, as the Iewes did an Ethnike and Publicane. The mind that must quietly beare wrong once, twise, and oftner, if neede be; must not abhorre and shunne the person of his brother that wrongeth him, as prophane. It resteth then, that our Sauior in these words did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the partie oppressed, to seeke further remedie, when neither charitie nor equitie could preuaile with the oppressour; And that was to doe as they did to strangers and Publicanes; which was to conuent him before y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Roman Magistrate, who had power to force him that did wrong, to abide the iudgement that shoulde be giuen. And so I suppose y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words may be taken, <hi>Let him be to thee as an Ethnike and Publicane,</hi> that is, pursue him in those Courts where thou wouldest a Pagan and Publicane that should do thee wrong.</p>
            <p>If any man like not to vnderstand those words of a further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sute before the Magistrate; he may referre them to a priuate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of all companie with the wrong-doer vntill he reforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. <hi>Let him be to thee as an Ethnicke and Publicane,</hi> that is, shunne such wilfull oppressours as much as thou <hi>doest Pagans and Publicanes;</hi> but without bitternes of minde or breach of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

               <hi>that is, account him no longer in the number of thy brethren, &amp; yet neglect not his saluation. So the Lord warneth, when he by and by addeth, Verely I say vnto you, whatsoeuer you binde on earth, shall be bound in heauen. Thou beginnest to account thy brother as a Publicane, thou doest binde him on earth. When thou doest correct and make agreement with thy brother, thou hast loosed him on earth; and when thou loosest him on earth, hee shall be loosed in heauen.</hi> Which of these twaine be preferred I force not, so the first be not impugned as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing from the Text.</p>
            <p>Some thinke our Sauior would not prescribe how the Iewes should proceede in their priuat suits and quarels; that care belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather to Counsellers at the law, then to Preachers of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word.</p>

With trueth and sobrietie I may affirme this, that the first Christian Princes and Emperours, to cause religion the more to flourish, did what they coulde to make the people honour and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their Bishops; permitting them to heare and determine all quarrels and strifes betweene man and man, for debts, goodes, or lands; and confirming the iudgements of the Bishops euen in such cases by publike Lawes; and by their owne example teaching all men to submit their heads vnder the Bishops hands. <note n="1" place="margin">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2102:49"/>
our dayes some wayward spirites thinke it a great point of pietie by despising and reproching their state and calling, as vnchristian and vngodly, to make them contemptible &amp; odious to the meanest of the multitude.

            <p>The summe of all is; first, that our Sauiour interdicted his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and consequently the Pastours of his Church by vertue of their Ministerie to claime any ciuill dominion to commaund and compell; which is the power that Princes and Lordes vse ouer their subiects and seruants. Next, they must neither desire nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light any titles of honor and praise from men, but expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Arch-pastour, when euery one shall haue praise from God. Thirdly, howe great soeuer they be, they must serue the

lowest of their brethren to doe them good, and watch ouer them for the sauing of their soules; yet this nothing hindereth the rule and gouernement that pastours haue ouer their flocks by the word of God, neither doth it barre them or depriue them of that honour and obedience which in heart, word and deed is due to <hi>the</hi>

            <p>In the choice of <hi>Matthias</hi> it is not expressed that the Church intermedled. <hi>Peter</hi> acquainted all the Disciples, that one must supplie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> roume of <hi>Iudas;</hi> but who named those two that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, whether the Apostles, or all the Disciples, it is not deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Text; the force and coherence of the words conuince nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Marke how Peter doth al things by the common consent of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nothing by his owne authoritie, nothing by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> He saith so in deed, but the Text saith not so; only the verbe is the plural number, which may be referred to the Apostles aswel as to the rest of the Disciples: yet the reason why <hi>Peter</hi> did it not, was not for that it was not lawfull for him without the multitude to doe it, but as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> noteth, lest he should seeme to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the one, and not the other, as also that, as yet, he had not receiued the holie Ghost. <note n="2" place="margin">Ibidem.</note>

            <p>The choice of the seauen Deacons was referred to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the approbation of them reserued to the twelue, and that not without cause. For by this choice, the Deacons (as they say) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued not charge of the word and sacraments, but a care to see the Saints prouided for, and the collections and contributions of the faithfull sincerely and vprightly employed, according to the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the persons. Now that the people shoulde very well like, and fully trust such as shoulde bee Stewards of their goodes, and dispensers of their substance, had euident reason; and the Apostles in so doing staied the murmuring of the Disciples, and freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from al suspition of neglecting their widowes, (which was the cause of their dislike) by praying them to choose out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues such as they best trusted, to care for their tables &amp; distribute their store.

And hence arose the grudging of the Grecians, that their widows were neglected. The Apostles then excused themselues, for that they might not leaue the preaching of the word, and attend for tables, to see their widowes indifferently vsed, and willed <hi>the</hi>

               <hi>Ierome,</hi> and others we take these seuen for Deacons, such as serued in the Church, and attended on the Lords table when the mysteries of Christ were dispenced; yet the Apostles made this no perpetuall rule for all elections; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any other Apostle could haue imposed hands but on such as the people named and elected, which is euidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Scriptures, as in place conuenient shall appeare. Againe, this singular example concludeth no more for electing by voyces, then the choice of <hi>Matthias</hi> doth for retaining of lots. For since two sortes of elections were vsed by the Apostles presently the one vpon the other; who can determine which of those twaine was prescribed to the Church as of necessity to be continued: Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, examples are noprecepts; and the reasons that mooued the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles to referre the choice of those seven to the liking of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, admit infinite varieties &amp; circumstances, which being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, the effect must needes alter according to the cause.

For first, if that were the right Etymologie of the word; yet as most words in Greeke &amp; Hebrew, besides the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall action and circumstance, which they first importe, do signifie the effects and consequents depending on that action and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and are by translation generally and vsually applied to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things: so this worde doeth signifie to elect and appoint, though no handes bee helde vp; because electing and appointing was the effect and consequent of lifting vp the handes. To prooue this, wee neede go no further then the tenth chapter of this verie Booke; where Saint <hi>Luke</hi> without all contradiction vseth the word in such sorte and sense, as I mention. <note n="1" place="margin">Act. 10.</note>

            <p>If seposing a litle the names of men, wee eramine the grounds of both interpretations, or remember but your owne positions, we shall soone perceiue, which is the likelier. That the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Paul</hi> in laying handes on <hi>Timothie,</hi> no reason euicteth; onely the ambiguitie of the word, which hath those two significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leadeth some writers to that surmise on the other side, that <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe laid hands on <hi>Timothie</hi> without others to conioine with him; besides the wordes of <hi>Paul,</hi> which are plaine enough for that purpose, the excellencie of <hi>Timothies</hi> functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, were he Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist or Bishop, and sufficiencie of <hi>Pauls</hi> hands do strongly enduce.

               <hi>The spirite spake to Philip,</hi> to ioyne himselfe to the Eunuches charet; and <note n="4" place="margin">Act. 11. v. 12.</note>

meete for the calling of Pastours and Prophets, whereto hee had chosen them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatsoeuer the Apostles did, that had a most plentifull measure of Gods spirite farre aboue Pastours, Prophets and Euangelists: yet their followers, for example, Timothie and Tite, were not to impose hands without the people and Presbyterie concurring with them.]</hi> I haue heard this often and earnestly asserted, but I could neuer yet see it prooued. The greatest ground of this presumption is, for that the Apostles themselues did so; from whose example their scholers would not rashlie depart. But as we finde by better view, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did not so. by lots and by Prophets, directed not by mens wils, but by Gods spirit, the Apostles choose Elders; or rather by laying on their hands, as the holie Ghost guided them, they did fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish such as before were neither meete nor able to sustaine that charge with the gifts of the spirit fit for that calling: by the voyces and liking of the people, they made no Pastors nor Prophets, that I read; and therfore I must haue leaue to thinke that <hi>Tite</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> vsed rather the helpe of <hi>Prophesie</hi> to finde whom the spirit would name, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the consents or suffrages of the people. for in their times the gifts of the spirite were not quenched, yea the Prophets that were vnder the Apostles, continued vnder them; and these two gifts, <hi>the</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 25.</note> 
               <hi>reuealing of secrets,</hi> and <note n="2" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 10.</note> 
               <hi>discerning of spirites,</hi> which the Prophets and Euangelists had, (though in lesse measure then the Apostles) serued chiefly to distinguish who were fit or vnfit for the seruice of Christes Church. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prophets failed, the Church was forced to come to voices; but so long as the spirite declared by the mouthes of the Prophets whom hee had chosen, the consent of the people or <hi>Presbyterie</hi> might not be required.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apostle giueth rules to Timothie and Tite, what maner of men must be chosen, &amp; how they must be qualified before they be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.] Paul</hi> doeth not teach the people whom they should elect, but appointeth <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> whom they should admit. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent ambition and emulation in the competitors, affection and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention in the electors, lots were first liked by the Apostles, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a long time after by S. <hi>Iohn;</hi> and to disappoint seducing and lying spirites then crept into the world, and into the Church, these rules were prescribed as a touchstone for <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> to discern the spirit of trueth speaking sincerely, from the spirit
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2102:61"/>
of errour, flattring and admiring the persons of men for aduantage sake. for as God gaue the power &amp; grace of his spirite to his Church in great abundance to illustrate the glorie &amp; enlarge the kingdome of his sonne: so the deuill ceased not to intermixe whole swarmes of false and deceitfull workemen to obscure the brightnes and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the increase of Christes Church; and therefore the Apostle set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe what manner of men <hi>Tite</hi> and <hi>Timothie</hi> shall lay hands on, &amp; whom they shall refuse, left they be partakers of their sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul could not feare lest the holy Ghost speaking by the Prophets would name men vnworthie the place.] Paul</hi> saw the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of false Prophets already risen, and euery day likely to rise, and foresaw the poyson and danger of their deceits and pretences; and for that cause setteth down a perpetuall canon to the Church for euer, what vices must be shumed, and vertues required in a Pastour and Preacher. Such did the holie Ghost name whiles hee ruled the mouthes of the Prophets; and such for euer should be called euen when the gift of prophesie was decayed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Primitiue Church vsed alwayes to elect her Pastors by the suffrages of the people; and Cyprian saieth, it is none other then a diuine tradition, and Apostolike obseruation.]</hi> I shall haue place and time anone to speake of the custome of the Church and opinion of the fathers; till then I reserue the handling of both. I am now searching the Scriptures and viewing the word of God, whether it can thence be prooued, that Pastours and Elders were or ought to be chosen by the consent of the people; and for my part I professe I finde none. I see some men men zealously bent to authorize it by the will and commandement of God: I dare not professe to bee sopriuie to his will without his word.

he was not capable of the Apostleship; and yet afterward at <note n="1" place="margin">Act. 13.</note> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch he receiued it the second time. In the Primitiue Church, they were first Deacons; and vpon triall, when they had mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred well, and were found blamelesse, they were admitted to be Elders or Priestes; and after that, if their giftes and paines so deserued, they were called to an higher degree; and in euery of these they receiued imposition of handes. So that euery one by the ancient discipline of Christes Church before he could come from ministring to gouerning in the Church of God, receiued thrise, or at the least twise imposition of handes. The like, if any man list, hee may imagine of <hi>Timothie,</hi> that the <note n="2" place="margin">Act 16. v. 2.</note>

               <hi>woulde</hi> that <hi>Timothie shoulde go foorth with him;</hi> grew vpon triall of his faithfull and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruice in a former and lower vocation, for which hee had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of handes; and that mooued <hi>Paul</hi> to take him along with him; and when hee sawe his time, to impose handes on him for a greater calling. For it is not credible, that <hi>Paul</hi> would impose hands on him at the first steppe to place him in one of the highest degrees, being so yoong as hee was, without good experience of his sober and wise behauiour in some other and formet func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Lastly, if it should be granted, that others ioyned with <hi>Paul</hi> in laying hands on <hi>Timothie,</hi> we must not conclude it was of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, as if <hi>Paules</hi> handes had not beene sufficient without them to giue the holie Ghost; or that he had not power in himselfe to choose who <note n="4" place="margin">Act. 16.</note> 
               <hi>should goe foorth with him,</hi> and <note n="5" place="margin">Act. 19.</note> minister <hi>vnto him:</hi> we must shunne both these as sensible absurdities: but because <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> was very yong, lest <hi>Paul</hi> should seeme to be ledde with any light respect in taking him vnto his companie, he might happily be content to heare the iudgements of the Prophets then present, and guided by the same spirite that he was, and suffer their handes as wel as their mouths to concurre with his in prophesying and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer <hi>Timothie;</hi> that all the Church might know, the spirite of God had pronounced him worthie the place, and not <hi>Paules</hi> affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aduanced him vnworthie. In that respect, I say, <hi>Paul</hi> might be willing the Prophets shoulde expresse to the whole assemblie what the holie Ghost spake in them touching <hi>Timothie;</hi> and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2102:63"/>
permit them with prayers and handes, as their maner was, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the same; otherwise <hi>Paul</hi> alone had power enough both to impose handes on Pastours and Prophets, as he did at Ephesus; and to make choice of his companie, as he did not long before when he vtterly refused <hi>Marke,</hi> and retained <hi>Silas</hi> to trauaile with him.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nother point in shewe diminishing Apostolike authoritie is; that the <note n="1" place="margin">Act. 15.</note> Elders assembled in the Councel of Ierusalem together with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to discusse the matter in question betwene <hi>Paul</hi> and others; and the letters deciding the controuersie, were written to the Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade as well in their names, as in the Apostles. This case wil soone be answered by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe. <hi>Paul</hi> stoode not in doubt of his preaching, neither needed hee the consent of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles or Elders to confirme that doctrine, which the spirit of Christ had deliuered vnto him: we must remember his earnest protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <note n="2" place="margin">Galat. 1.</note>

               <hi>For I certifie you brethren, that the Gospell which I preached, was not of man; neither receiued I it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iesus Christ.</hi> What ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was right well assured Christ had deliuered vnto him; to submit that to the correcting or censuring of men, yea of the Apostles themselues, had not beene in him moderation or sobrietie but distrust and infidelitie. And for that cause, when God reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his sonne vnto him; he did not first <note n="4" place="margin">Galat. 1. 16.</note> 
               <hi>conferre with flesh and blood,</hi> neither <hi>went hee to Ierusalem vnto those that were Apostles before him;</hi> least hee shoulde seeme to derogate from the voyce and trueth of Christ; but straightwaie preached

the Gospell, which he learned by reuelation, and stoode alwayes resolued, that what the sonne of God had taught him, the sonnes of men ought not to reuoke, and could not amend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why then repaired he at length to Ierusalem to the Apostles and Elders, to haue his doctrine examined, &amp; confirmed vnto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by their letters?]</hi> Many false brethren came from Ierusalem; and pretending the Apostles names, impugned both the credite and doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> and taught that except the Gentiles were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, they could not be saued; and by enforming the brethren, that this course was obserued at Ierusalem, (for they counted <hi>Paul</hi> fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To stop the mouthes of these seducers, and to retaine the Churches in their stedfastnes, and remooue this stumbling blocke from before the simple, that <hi>Paul</hi> taught contrarie to the rest of the Apostles; the holie Ghost <note n="1" place="margin">Gal. 2. v. 2.</note> 
               <hi>willed him</hi> by reuelation to goe vp to Ierusalem and declare to the rest the Gospell which hee preached; that by their generall confession and letters, the doctrine which he preached, might be acknowledged vnto the Gentiles to be sound and sincere. This was the intent of <hi>Paules</hi> iourney thither: Not to haue his doctrine reuised and approoued by their authorities, but to haue it heard and acknowledged by their confessions, that the false report of their discording euery where spread by those decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, might no longer trouble the mindes of the Gentiles.</p>

               <hi>What needed the presence of the Elders at this meeting?]</hi> Some of them had come from Iewrie to Antioch, as sent from the church at Ierusalem, and troubled the minds of the Gentiles with vrging circumcision. Wherefore to knowe the reason of their so doing, and to preuent the like in time to come; the Apostles woulde not haue the matter priuatly handled, but in the audience and presence of the <note n="1" place="margin">Act. 15. v. 22.</note> 
               <hi>whole Church,</hi> and with a generall consent, letters were written in all their names, as well <hi>to disclaime the sending of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such; as also to confirme the Gentiles in the course</hi> which they had begunne. For these two points their letters importe. <note n="2" place="margin">Act. 15. v. 23.</note> 
               <hi>The Apostles, Elders and brethren,</hi> which in the verse before are called <hi>the whole Church, to the Brethren of the Gentiles at Antioch, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="3" place="margin">Verse 24.</note> 
               <hi>Because we haue heard, that certaine comming from vs haue troubled you with words &amp; enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled your minds, saying you must be circumcised, to whom we gaue no such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <note n="4" place="margin">Verse 25.</note> 
               <hi>it seemed therfore good vnto vs, when we were together with one accord to send chosen men vnto you with our beloued Paul and Barnabas,</hi>

               <hi>which shall tell the same by word of mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostles wanted neither authoritie nor sufficiencie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the matter. How many doubts doth <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe resolue to the Romans, to the Corinthians, to others without a Councell? This very question, when after this meeting it troubled the church of Galatia, did <hi>Paul</hi> alleage the Apostles letters vnto them; or the decision made at Ierusalem: No, he resteth on his owne Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and saith, <note n="6" place="margin">Galat. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Beholde, I Paul say vnto you, that if you be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, Christ shal profit you nothing. For I testifie vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man which is circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cised, that he is bound to keep the whole Lawe. ye are abolished from Christ: whosoeuer are iustified by the Law, ye are fallen from grace.</hi> The Councell at Ierusalem decreed it was not needefull for the Gentiles to be circumcised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could be saued. It seemed good to the holie Ghost and to them not to lay that burden on their neckes. But <hi>Paul</hi> goeth a degree furder and telleth them, they are <hi>cut off from Christ,</hi> and <hi>fallen from grace,</hi> if they seeke or admit circumcision. Hee is so farre from standing on the credite of that assemblie; that hee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denieth, they added any thing to him; and auoucheth hee withstoode and reprooued <hi>Peter</hi> to his face for the same cause at
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2102:65"/>
Antioch. Yea in that Councell, who decided the controuersie but <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Iames?</hi> yet because it touched the whole Church of Iurie; and for that many of the Elders then present were after to preach vnto the Gentiles, and to liue amongst them &amp; with them; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, no doubt, directed by Gods spirit brought y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discussed in the open hearing of the whole Church, thereby to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie &amp; quiet the consciences of those Iews that were <note n="1" place="margin">Act. 21. ve. 20.</note> 
               <hi>zealous of the Lawe,</hi> though they beleeued; and wholy to quench, if it were possible, the heart-burning and detestation the beleeuing Iewes had of the Gentiles, which well appeared by their <note n="2" place="margin">Act. 11.</note> 
               <hi>striuing with Peter</hi> for <hi>entring into the Gentiles and eating with them;</hi> and by their owne <note n="3" place="margin">Act. 21.</note> 
               <hi>report</hi> made to <hi>Paul</hi> long after this Councell was ended.</p>
            <p>The last thing wherein the people or <hi>Presbyterie</hi> seeme to ioyne with the Apostles authoritie, is the putting the wicked from among the faithfull, and deliuering them ouer to Satan, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to reduce them to repentance, or by their example to feare o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the like offences. Of the incestuous Corinthian Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writeth thus. <note n="4" place="margin">1. Corinth. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I verely as absent in bodie, but present in Spirite, haue already decreed, as if I were present; that he which hath doone this, when you are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my Spirite in the name of our Lorde Iesus Christ, by the power of our Lorde Iesus Christ to deliuer such a one vnto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the Spirite may bee saued in the day of the Lorde Iesus. Put away therefore from among your selues that wicked man.</hi> By this it is collected that the Apostle alone could not excommunicate, nor deliuer vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; but the Church must ioyne with him; and then for not hearing the Church, the offendor might be taken for an Ethnike and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane.</p>
            <p>This place breedeth two great doubts; first, what it is to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto Satan; next, by whome this incestuous person was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered vnto Satan, whether by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or by the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And because the latter point is of more importance to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we haue in hand, let that first be examined: then after, what is meant by deliuering vnto Satan.</p>
            <p>The least we can imagine of these words is, that <hi>Paul</hi> being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent requireth them to put the malefactor out of their societie, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2102:65"/>
to keepe no company with him. For that rule he giueth touching all notorious offendours in the same Chapter. <note n="1" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> 
               <hi>If any man that is called a brother, be a fornicatour, or couetous person, or an Idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such a one eate not.</hi> As else-where he charged the faithfull to <note n="2" place="margin">2. Thess. 3.</note> 
               <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe themselues from euery brother that walked disorderly, and not after the instruction</hi> which he gaue them. And <hi>if any man</hi> (saith he) <hi>obey not our wordes, keepe no company with him, that he may be ashamed.</hi> If the Apostle did but this; that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them (because he was not present) to remooue that incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person from their fellowship; this sheweth he had authoritie ouer them, after that sort in Christes name to command them; but the wordes, which he vseth, are farre more forcible.</p>
            <p>Reproouing their negligence for not doing, what in them lay, to put that offendour from among them, he addeth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <note n="3" place="margin">1. Corinth. 5.</note> 
               <hi>I haue already decreed (or determined) as if I were present, by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of our Lord Iesus Christ to deliuer this wicked one to Satan.</hi> He asketh not their consents; he prayeth not their ayde; he refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the matter to their liking; he sayeth, <hi>I haue already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed;</hi> afore he wrote, and afore they read, that part of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. What to doe? To ioyne with them in deliuering the Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passour to Satan? No, <hi>I haue already decreed to deliuer this sinner vnto Satan.</hi> By what meanes? By the power of our Lorde Iesus Christ. Then for ought that wee yet finde in this place, the Apostle though absent, decreed as present <hi>to do the deed himselfe,</hi> and that by the power &amp; <hi>might of our Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> not by the consent or helpe of the Corinthians.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But their assembling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues was required withall. For he saith; When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Iesus and my spirit with you.]</hi> The Apostle would then doe it, when the whole Church might beholde it; and be afraide of the like. And though hee were <hi>absent in bodie,</hi> yet shoulde they finde the force of his Spirite present; euen the <hi>might and power</hi> of the Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, to deliuer that hainous sinner vnto Satan. Nowe howe should the power &amp; might of Christ, be shewed in excluding a man from the word and sacraments: Pronouncing a few words is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for that matter. Which maketh me to be of <hi>Chrysostomes</hi>

the Apostles and others did great workes; and had euen the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels in subiection vnto them. That which he woulde doe, should be this: <hi>to deliuer him vnto Satan</hi> in the presence of them all <hi>for the destruction of the flesh;</hi> to the ende the affliction of his flesh might bring him to repentance, and so saue his soule in the day of Christ. To deliuer vnto Satan, is more then to excommunicate. Many are secluded from the companie of the godly for a time, that are not yeelded vnto Satan; yea many were deliuered vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan without excommunication, as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Elymas.</hi> The end of this action was the affliction or destruction of the flesh; which in excommunication hath no sense, except it be Metaphoricall. For excommunication endangereth the Spirite, and toucheth not the flesh. And the lustes of the flesh are not destroyed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, but by repentance, which of it selfe is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to the other; (for many are excommunicated, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer repent;) but affliction and feare of destruction cause repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce; and thereby the soule is saued.

consents of the greater part concurring with them before any thing could be done, but by their precepts and rules deliuered by speach, or expressed by writing, which the faithfull in euery place as well Pastors as people with all readinesse obeyed: And that in appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ordeyning Pastors and Elders; as likewise in reteyning sinnes, and binding offenders by deliuering them vnto Satan; or reiecting them from the felowship of Saints, they needed not the helpe or agreement of the people or <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> but had power suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient with imposing their handes as the Spirite directed, to make Prophets and Pastors, by giuing them the gifts of the holy Ghost needefull for their seuerall callings; and by the same power, coulde yeeld the bodies of such as sinned and repented not, to be punished and afflicted by Satan, or remooue them from the Communion of Christes Church, and exclude them from the kingdome of heauen, as their wickednes or wilfulnes deserued. This superioritie they reteined whiles they liued; so moderating their power, that they sought rather to winne the euill disposed with lenitie, then represse them with authoritie, saue when the wicked might no longer be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, lest others should be iufected; and vsing such meekenes and mildnes towards al, that no schisme disordered the Church by their rigour, nor soule perished by their default; labouring more to profit many with their paines, then to preferre themselues before any by their priuiledge, and vtterly forgetting their owne dignitie, whiles they serued and aduanced Christes glory.

force the like to be receiued and established in the Church of Christ for all ages and places; since their office and function are long since ceased, and no like power reserued to their successours after them. I doe not denie but many things in the Apostles were personall, giuen them by Gods wisedome for the first spreading of the fayth, and planting of the Churches amongst Jewes and Gentiles, that all nations might be conuerted vnto Christ by the sight of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and directed by the trueth of their doctrine: yet that all their gifts ended with their liues, and no part of their charge and power remained to their after-commers; may neither be confessed by vs, nor affirnted by any, vnlesse we meane wholy to subuert the church of Christ. To be called by Christes owne mouth, and sent into all nations; to be furnished with the infallible assurance of his trueth, and visible assistance of his spirit; not onely to speake with tongues, cure diseases, worke miracles, know secretes, and vnderstand all wisedom, but to giue the holy Ghost to others that they might doe the like; these things, I say, were needfull at the first preaching of the Gospell, to conuert infidels that neuer heard of Christ before; to confirme the beleeuers compassed with diuers temptations; and to store the whole world then presently with meete Pastours and Teachers: but to maintaine the Church once setled, and faith once preached; there is no cause why either the immediate vocation or generall commission, or mightie operation, and sudden inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Apostles should alwayes endure. The Scriptures once written, suffice all ages for instruction: the miracles then done, are for euer a most euident confirmation of their doctrine; the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their first calling liueth yet in their succession; and time and trauell ioyned with Gods graces bring Pastours at this present to perfection; yet the Apostles charge to teach, baptize, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Lordes Supper, to bind and loose sinnes in heauen and in earth; to impose hands for the ordaining of Pastours and Elders, these partes of the Apostolike function and charge, are not decaied, and cannot bee wanted in the Church of God.

            <p>The worde and Sacraments are not so much questioned, to whom they were bequeathed, as the power of the keyes, and right to impose hands, to whom they are reserued. To diuide the word and administer the Sacraments is the generall &amp; perpetual charge of all those that feede the flocke of Christ, and are set ouer his hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde to giue them meate in season. <note n="3" place="margin">1.

            <p>The power of the keyes, and right to impose handes, I meane to ordaine Ministers, &amp; excommunicate sinners, (for so I alwaies interprete those two speeches) are more controuersied then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two; by reason that diuers men haue diuers conceits of them. Some fasten them to the liking of the multitude; which they call

the Church; others commit them to the iudgement of certaine cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen persons as well of the Laitie, as of the Clergie, whome they name the <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> some attribute them onely, but equally to all Pastours and Preachers; and some specially reserue them to men of the greatest gifts, ripest yeeres, and highest calling amongst the Clergie; which of these best agreeth with the trueth of the Scriptures, and vse of the primitiue Church, in place conuenient will soone appeare. It shall now suffice in few wordes to obserue, how neere imposing handes and binding sinnes doe ioyne with the dispensation of the word and Sacraments: that thereby wee may resolue whether laie men may entermeddle with these ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call actions or no.</p>
            <p>To create ministers by imposing hands, is to giue them, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power and leaue to preach the word, and dispence the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but also the grace of the holy Ghost to make them able to execute both parts of their function. This can none giue, but they that first receiued the same. They must haue this power and grace themselues, that will bestow it on others. Laie men which haue it not, can by no meanes giue it; and consequently not impose hands, which is the signe and seale of both. Yea what if to giue power to preach and baptize, bee more then to preach and baptize? euen as lawfully to authorize an other to doe any thing, is more then to doe it our selues? <note n="1" place="margin">

            <p>To excommunicate, is to remooue the wicked and irrepentant from the participation of the Lordes Supper; least by sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous presuming to violate that table, the vngodly should condemne themselues, and defile others. Whose calling it is to deliuer the bread and cup of the Lord to the due receiuers, is out of question; they are for that cause named the ministers of the worde and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Nowe to whom it pertaineth to admit the woorthie, to them it belongeth to reiect the vnwoorthie. they that are placed by God to deliuer the mysteries to the faithfull and penitent; are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him to denie them to the faithlesse and impenitent. The charge to deliuer the Sacraments is theirs, the care not to deliuer them, (but where they be willed by God so to doe) must needes bee theirs; you must free them from both, or leaue both vnto them. If it shall be required at their hands, they may not be forced by others; if none can excuse them, none may compell them. We may plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceiue, as well by their calling, which they haue from God; as by the account they shall yeeld vnto God, that the deliuering or with-holding the Sacraments is in the Pastours power and charge, and not in theirs, which haue neither vocation nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to meddle with the word or Sacraments. <note n="2" place="margin">

            <p>Againe, it cannot be doubted, but the moderation of the keies, and imposition of hands were at first setled in the Apostles, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by them, as I haue already made proofe by the Scriptures; and neither the people nor laie-Elders succeed the Apostles, but onely the Pastours and ministers of the worde and Sacraments. They can haue no part of the Apostolike commission, that haue no shew of Apostolike succession. They must looke not onely what they chalenge, but also from whom they deriue it; if from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, then are they their successours; if from Christ, as Colleagues ioyned with the Apostles, wee must finde that consociation in the Gospell, before wee cleare them from intrusion. <note n="1" place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> 
               <hi>No man (should) take this honour vnto himselfe, but he that is called of God,</hi> as the Apostles were. If they be called by Christ, read their assignation from Christ; if they bee not, surcease that presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But in deede how should they bee called to denie the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, that are not licenced to deuide the Sacramentes? or what right haue they to staie the seale, that haue no power to affixe the seale? The worde of God is sealed by his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes; and whom he hath sent to denounce the one, those hath hee chosen to annexe the other. If in preaching the word, laie-men were no publique parteners with the Apostles; in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Sacraments, which are the seales of the Gospell, they could not bee linked with the Apostles. They must be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with both, or with neither. And so are Pastours, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by succession the power and charge both of the word and Sacramentes, from and in the first Apostles and messengers of Christ. <note n="2" place="margin">1.

               <hi>With imposing of hands, it may be the people had nothing to doe: but the electing of Pastours, when they came once to bee chosen, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained chieflie &amp; wholie to them as the storie of the primitiue Church declareth. and so the retaining and remitting of sinnes, the multitude might not chalenge: but with casting notorious and scandalous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders out of their company, the whole Church did intermeddle, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by Pauls wordes written to the Church, and not to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours or Elders of Corinth.]</hi> I come not yet to the maner of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pastours, vsed in the primitiue Church, when prophesie fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the miraculous gifts of the spirite ceased; I reserue it, as time and order lead me, to the next age after the Apostles: but with the Apostles, as there was no cause the people should, so is there no proofe they did concurre in choosing their Pastours. for the people might not appoint on whom the holy Ghost should bestow his gifts; that were to tie Gods graces to their pleasures; but if they were to choose, they must elect such as were meete and able, which then were none, vntill by the Apostles handes they had receiued the wonderfull and extraordinarie giftes of the spirite to prepare and fit them for the care and charge of the Churches where the holie Ghost would make them ouerseers. Against this, if any thing can be obiected out of the Scriptures, I would gladly heare it; as yet I finde there neither example of it, nor reason for it. The election of the seuen Deacons, is the onely precedent that can bee found in the word, and that conuinceth vtterly nothing for the choice of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours. With money matters not onely at Ierusalem, but in all places the Apostles refused to meddle; auoiding thereby all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinister reports and suspicion, that they did any way increase or regard their priuate gaine; and for that cause <hi>Paul</hi> would not so much as carrie the beneuolence of the Gentiles to the poore saints at Ierusalem, without some specially trusted and <note n="1" place="margin">2.

Now for choosing of Pastours, or rather making them fit to be Pastours, which before were not fitte; the people had litle to say, and lesse to doe; but the holy Ghost directed the Apostles by prophesie, or otherwise on whom hee would bestow his giftes, and they should lay their handes; in which case I cannot so much as imagine, how, or why the people should ioyne with the spirite of God, to powre his heauenly giftes on such as hee furnished for the seruice of his Church; or limite the Apostles on whom they should laie their handes; si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

knowen to euery particular person, and house that was ignorant of him. And to this end they needed more aide then otherwise to guide and direct the Church at such times as the Saints mette together. Neither ceased this necessitie with the Apostles; it dured manie hundred yeers after them; which was the cause that in euery great citie the Pastors and Bishops had many Ministers &amp; helpers ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them, to labour the conuersion of miscreants, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and encourage the Martyrs and Confessours that suffered by thousands for the name of Christ, to visite the sicke and comfort them in their extremities, to cate chise the Nouices, to attend the seruice and Sacraments of the Church, to examine the faith, and suruey the behauiour of all that repaired to the Lordes Table, and to performe a number of such sacred duties, which for one Pastor or Bishop alone to do in so populous cities and assemblies, as they had, was vtterly impossible.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Presbyterie</hi> then of Prophets, Pastors and Teachers, the Apostles in their times had and vsed in euery Citie, where they planted the Faith and setled the Church: but that lay Gouernours or Elders were part of that <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> &amp; concurred ioyntly with the Pastors &amp; Prophets in imposing hands, &amp; exercising the power of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> keys, &amp; censuring both doctrine &amp; maners; I find no such thing comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded or warranted by the Scriptures; the patrons of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Lay <hi>Presbyterie</hi> must vndertake the burden to proue their assertion.</p>
            <p>The very foundation of the Lay <hi>Presbytery</hi> so strongly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; eagerly pursued by men in our dayes, is the place of S. <hi>Paul 1. Tim. 5.</hi>

               <hi>Hee that ruleth (let him do it) with diligence.</hi> It is a matter of nosmal weight to giue Lay men power in euery parish to impose handes and vse the keyes, yea to haue the full and whole gouernement of the Church, aboue and against the Pastours by number of voyces, if they differ in iudgement; and therefore the ground that shall beare the frame of the Lay <hi>Presbyterie</hi> had neede be sure, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is vrged as a part of Christs spiritual kingdom, without

the which no Church can be Christes, no more then it may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the trueth of his doctrine. But whether the wordes of Saint <hi>Paul 1.

Some learned and late writers do so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of that place; for my parte, I see so many iust and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against their supposall, that I can not yeelde to their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The first reason I haue of the weakenes of this place to vpholde the Lay <hi>Presbyterie</hi> is, that many learned and ancient Fathers haue debated and sifted the force of these wordes, and not one of them euer so much as surmised any such thing to be contained in this Text. <hi>Chrysostome, Ierome, Ambrose, Theodoret, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masius, Oecumenius, Theophilact</hi> and diuers others haue consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and expounded these wordes, and neuer dreamed of anie Lay <hi>Presbyterie</hi> to be mentioned in them. If then the wordes of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> stand faire and cleere without this late deuise, as in the iudgement of these learned and ancient Writers they doe; What reason after fifteene hundred yeeres, to entertaine a newe platforme of gouerning the Church by Lay men, vpon a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> may sound to that effect as some imagine?</p>
            <p>The second reason of my dissenting is; for that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> but once in al his Epistles, excludeth al Lay Elders from that <hi>Presbyterie.</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="margin">1. Timoth. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Neglect not the grace which is in thee, which was giuen thee by Prophesie, with the impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands of the Presbyterie.</hi> This is the onely place in all the Scriptures, where the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> is namely mentioned; and Lay Elders are most plainely remooued hence as no parte of this <hi>Presbyterie.</hi> For this Christian <hi>Presbyterie</hi> gaue imposition of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to ordaine Ministers: but Lay-Elders had no right to impose hands to that purpose; <hi>Ergo.</hi> Lay men were no part of this <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie.</hi> That imposition of hands to make Ministers is a kinde <hi>of Sacrament,</hi> and reserued <hi>solely to Pastours;</hi> if Saint Austens authoritie were not sufficient, <hi>Caluins</hi> confession is very euid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This Lay Elders in the Apostles times neither did, nor might do; they were therefore no part of that <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of in his writings. Must we take the worde not for the Colledge of Elders, but for the degree and office which <hi>Timothie</hi> receiued? Neither so is the force of my reason auoided. For choose which you wil to be the signification of the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, either collectiue for the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of Elders, or distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue for the degree &amp; office of euery Elder: if collectiue, none could be of that Colledge that might not giue imposition of hands; if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributiue none might take that function and calling on him, but must receiue imposition of handes, as <hi>Timothie</hi> did. Then Lay men which neither did giue nor receiue impositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hands, are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both from the degree, and from the societie of <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> which was in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time.</p>

               <hi>id est, ordinis Presbyterorum; quo nomine coetus ille omnis significatur, qui in verbo laborabant in ea ecclesia, vbi hoc factum est. The Presbyterie; that is, the order or company of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; by which name the whole company is signified, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in the word in that Church, where this was done.</hi> Then the whole Eldership or company of Elders in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the word. Where now were the Lay Elders that laboured not in the worde: What <hi>Presbyterie</hi> were they of: Had euerie Church two <hi>Presbyteries?</hi> I trust not. This whole <hi>Presbyterie</hi> consisted of Pastours and Teachers; An other Colledge of Lay Elders and no Pastours will neuer be found.</p>
            <p>My third reason is, for that the Text it selfe doth clearely refuse the sense which they inforce. For as they conclude, there were <hi>ergo</hi> some Elders that did not labour in the word and doctrine, and yet gouerned well; so the wordes are more euident, that they all were worthie of double honour, whether they laboured or gouerned. Which by Saint <hi>Paules</hi> proofes presently following, and by the consent of all old and new Writers is meant of their maintenance at the charges of the Church. <note n="2" place="margin">

            <p>Now that Lay Iudges and Censors of maners were in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time found at the expenses of the Church, or by Gods Law ought to haue their maintenance at the peoples hands; is a thing to me so strange and vnheard of, that vntil I see it iustly proued, I can not possibly beleeue <hi>it.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath laied downe this rule; <note n="6" place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> 
               <hi>They that serue at the Altar, should be partakers of the Altar; and by Gods ordinance, they that preach the Gospell, must liue of the Gospell.</hi> Where shall we finde the like for the Lay Iudges that laboured not in the worde? They were, (if any such were;) as the sagest, so euery way the sufficientest men that were amongest the people; for feare of faction, contempt and corruption, which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily grow when the weaker and baser rule ouer the richer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort. If the Apostle will not haue the poore widowes, so long as they might otherwise be succoured or employed, grieue the Church; would he then put the burden of the Lay Iudges and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in number many, in state able to relieue others, on the necks of the meaner and poorer brethren? there is neither cause, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in the word so to charge the Churches of Christ with maintaining the Lay Senate, which yet must be done before this construction can be admitted.</p>
            <p>The fourth reason that holdeth me from receiuing this constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is, that I find diuers and sundrie interpretations more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Text, and more answerable to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, then this; which is lately so much liked &amp; obtruded to the whole Church as the expresse voice of Gods spirit.</p>
            <p>I deriue my first exposition from the Apostles purpose, which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2102:81"/>
heere is so plaine, that it can not bee doubted. For letting <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie</hi> vnderstand with whome the Church of necessity must bee charged, and what degrees must bee obserued in their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; hee beginneth with widowes, and sheweth which of them are fitte to bee relieued by the Church, and which to bee left to their friendes and kinsfolkes, that <note n="1" place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> 
               <hi>the Church be not burdened, but may suffice for those that are widowes indeede.</hi> From widowes hee commeth vnto Elders; that is, from the women to the men amongst them that must be found foode and apparell for them and theirs at the charges of the Church, and of them hee saieth, <note n="2" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
               <hi>The Elders that rule well,</hi> to wit, which guide well the things committed to their charge, <hi>let them be counted woorthie of double honour;</hi> hee meaneth eyther of larger allowance then the widowes, because their calling was higher, and pains greater; or else maintenance for themselues and their families; which the widowes might not expect. For since they were to relinguish their former trades of life, whereby they succoured their families, and wholy to addict themselues to the seruice of the Church; the wisedome of God prouided for them, as vnder <hi>Moses</hi> for the Priestes and Leuites, that they which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the Altar, shoulde liue of the Altar, both they and theirs. These Elders were of two sorts; some laboured in the word, some cared and attended for the poore. Both were worthie of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if they discharged their dueties well, but <note n="3" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
               <hi>specially they that laboured in the worde and doctrine.</hi> The Church that was to beare the charge; the party to whom he wrate, were acquainted with it before this time, and accustomed to it. <hi>Paul</hi> requireth the people to doe it willingly and liberally, and warneth <hi>Timothie</hi> to see it doone. For such as serue the Church are woorthie of it, chiefly the Ministers. There were then, you will say, other El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church that were not Ministers of the worde. There were, and those were the Deacons, whom you must either exclude from maintenance, and that you may not; or else comprise in this place vnder the name of Elders.</p>
            <p>Happely you thinke this an euasion and no exposition. It stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more clerely with the intent of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> then Lay Elders, and as cleare with the wordes. When the Church at Ierusalem was diuided by Saint <hi>Luke</hi> &amp; their owne letters, into <note n="4" place="margin">Act. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Apostles,</hi>

               <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren;</hi> in which of these three are the Deacons contained? Not in Elders? When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>

               <hi>ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Elders in euerie Church</hi> as they passed, left they the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches without Deacons, or neglected they the care of the poore? The next wordes to these, <note n="2" place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Receiue not an accusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Elder, but vnder two or three witnesses;</hi> doe they exclude the Deacons, or include them in this rule? If the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> an Elder, bee a name of age; why shall the Deacons bee barred that name, when as they were chosen for their age, grauitie and wisedome, as well as the Ministers? If it bee a name of office; that the Deacons <note n="3" place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> 
               <hi>by well ministring gette themselues a good degree,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth: that Laie men had anie office in the Church as heere is imagined, what Text prooueth? This onelie place of all the Newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is produced; and by this, the doubt is rather encreased, then decided.</p>
            <p>Besides, that the wordes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> bee often so largely taken, that they comprise all Ecclesiasticall functions, might soone be prooued, <hi>if it</hi> were not confessed by such learned men as very much fauour this late found construction. <note n="4" place="margin">

               <hi>The name of Elder is generall comprehending all those, that haue any ecclesiasticall function.</hi> Then is our first exposition neyther false nor forced, but matcheth as rightly with the wordes of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> as theirs doeth, and farre righter with the sense.</p>
            <p>A second interpretation of the wordes is that which <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> and other Greeke writers embrace; that where in a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the word, good life, good gouernement, and good doctrine are required: the two first are commended; but painefulnesse in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> word, is chiefly to be preferred in men of their calling. And so not two sorts of Elders, but two parts of the Pastoral charge &amp; func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are implyed in these wordes. Speake I more then you your selues confesse? Is it not your own distinction, that some are Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which labor in the word, but haue no cure of souls; some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, which besides their publike paines in the word, haue a special charge &amp; watch ouer euerie mans soule, where they liue?

If the functions of ruling and teaching be two distinct offices, then may none intrude on both; if they be coincident, what neede two sortes of Elders, to execute one charge: Set this place aside, in which I see vtterly nothing for Lay Elders; and where else in the new Testament shall we finde, I say, not a sentence but a syllable sounding for them:</p>

               <hi>As in one bodie,</hi> saieth he, <hi>we may haue many members; and all the members haue not the same action; so we being many, are one body in Christ, and euery one an others members.</hi> I aske now whether onely the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Church, or the whole multitude of beleeuers bee the the body of Christ: The whole no doubt is the body, and not this or that part, though excelling the rest.

This is therefore a principall gift of the holy Ghost; but not a different office from those that goe before. The Apostles, Prophets, &amp; Teachers in the Church, had they not power to doe miracles, to cure the sicke, to speake with tongues: if these three be no diuers offices, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all three found in euery Apostle, in many Prophetes and Teachers; why should not <hi>gouernement,</hi> being reckoned in the midst of them, be a gift likewise of the holy Ghost, bestowed on such Prophets, Pastours and Teachers, as pleased the spirit of trueth and grace to vouchsafe that honour:</p>

as being rather standing offices in the Church, then miraculous gifts. Many Pastours and Doctors were furnished with many of them; the Apostles had them all, and that in greater measure then any other; which in offices could not be, in gift might bee. These were therefore neither vsuall nor perpetuall functions in the Church, as Pastours and Deacons must bee; but miraculous and extraordinarie gifts and graces during onely for a time, and giuen in what measure and to what persons it best liked the holy Ghost, for the ouerthrowing of Satans kingdome, and gathering of the Saints together, at the first planting of the Church.</p>

               <hi>What were Gouernours then in the Primitiue Church?]</hi> for my part I am not ashamed to say, I could easilie presume, I can not easilie prooue what they were. The maner and order of those wonderfull giftes of Gods spirite, after so many hundreds may be coniectured, cannot be demonstrated. <hi>Why should they not bee laie-Elders, or Iudges of maners?]</hi> Because I finde no such any where els mentioned, and here none prooued. Gouernours there were, or rather Gouernements, (for so the Apostle speaketh) that is, giftes of wisedome, discretion and iudgement to direct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the whole Church and euery particular member thereof in the manifold dangers and distresses, which those dayes did not want. Gouernours also they might bee called, that were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in euery congregation to heare and appease the priuate strifes and quarels that grew betwixt man and man; least the Christians to the shame of themselues, and slaunder of the Gospell, should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue each other for things of this life before the Magistrates, who then were infidels. Of these S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, <hi>1. Cor. 6.</hi>

Besides, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian common wealthes where there can bee no doubt of despising or scorning the Gospel for going to lawe, those iudges must cease; since there is no cause to decline the Tribunals of beleeuing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to whom the preseruing of all mens rights, and punishing of all mens iniuries and enormities doeth by Gods lawe generally and wholy appertaine.

They medled with no matters, but with so notorious, that they scandalized the Church, and infamed the doctrine of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour with Infidels; and in those cases, where euery man could speake, the proofe was soone made. Againe, the Prophets and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors in those daies had the gifts of <hi>discerning spirits,</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> secrets; so that malefactors were soone discouered and conuinced,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2102:88"/>
if the case were doubtfull. S. <hi>Paul</hi> is a witnesse, that to know se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets was then incident to the gift of prophesie. <note n="1" place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> 
               <hi>If you all prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and there come in one that beleeueth not, hee is rebuked of all men, and iudged of all men; and so are the secretes of his heart made manifest; and hee will fall downe on his face and worship God, and say plainly, that God is in you in deed.</hi> A li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before he ioineth them both together. <note n="2" place="margin">1.

Thirdly, the Apostle hath plainely committed, <note n="3" place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> 
               <hi>the receiuing of accusations euen against Elders,</hi> and <note n="3" place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> 
               <hi>open rebuking of such as sinned,</hi> vnto <hi>Timothie;</hi> and he in sight was no laie man.

That Pastours must iudicially examine and rebuke such as sinne; we prooue by the euident wordes of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> shew you the like for laie Elders, and wee will quietly resigne you the cause. Lastly, since the power of the keyes, and ouersight of the Sacraments, did, and doe clearely belong to Pastours, and not is laie Elders; I see not how laie men that are no magistrates, may chalenge to intermeddle with the Pastours function, or ouer-rule them in their owne charge, without manifest and violent intrusion on other mens callings against the word and will of Christ, who gaue his Apostles the holy Ghost, <note n="4" place="margin">Iohn 20.</note>

Lastly, if the people did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point certaine wise and sufficient men from amongst themselues, to looke into the trueth of euery crime, before they would beleeue the accuser, or reiect the accused from their company; then must your laie Elders claime, not from Christ as authorized by him to vse the keyes, and dispose of the Sacraments, but from the people, as their committies, to heare and report what they found detected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in euery such offence as deserued separation from all Christian societie: and their delegation from the people must vtterly cease, where he that beareth the sword, embraceth the faith. For though by the lawes of God and nature, where there is no magistrate, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry multitude may both order and gouerne themselues, as they see cause with their generall consent, so they crosse not superiour lawes and powers; yet we must beware when God hath placed Christian Princes to defend and preserue Iustice and Iudgement amongst men, that we not erect vnder a shew of discipline, certaine petit magistrates in euery parish by commission from Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in crimes and causes ecclesiastical, iudicially to proceed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out depending on the princes power.</p>

If in these things they be ioint-Agents with Pastours, then are they no laie Elders, but Pastours. You must giue them one name, if you giue them one office; the same deedes require alwayes the same wordes. If you ioyne not laie Elders in those Sacerdotall and sacred actions with Pastours, but make them ouerseers and moderators of those things which Pastours doe; this power belongeth exactly to Christian magistrates to see that Pastours doe their dueties according to Christes will; and not abuse their power to annoy his Church, or the members thereof. Neither is the case like betwixt Pastours and laie Elders. Pastors haue their power and function distinguished from Princes by God himselfe; in so much that it were more then presumption for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to execute those actions by themselues or their substitutes. To preach, baptize, retaine sinnes and impose hands, Princes haue no power; the Prince of Princes, euen the sonne of God, hath seuered it from their callings, and committed it to his Apostles; and they by imposition of hands deriued it to their successors: but to cause these actions to be orderly done according to Christes commaundement, and to preuent and represse abuses in the doers, this is all that is left for laie Elders; and this is it that we reserue to the Christian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</p>

The sword without iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is force and furie; with iudgement, it is iustice and equitie. You cannot yeeld the sword to the magistrate, and reserue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in these cases to the laie Elders: you then binde the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to maintaine what your laie Iudges shall determine; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A most wretched State of the Church it must needes bee, that shall depend on such sillie Gouernours. I omit how farre gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and landlords can preuaile in euery parish with their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and tenants, both to rule them and ouer-rule them at their pleasures. Uiew the villages in England, and tell me how farre you shall seeke, before you shall finde laie Elders, that in any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ought to be trusted with the gouernement of the Church. I will not aduauntage my selfe by the rudenesse and ignorance of most part; I hope for very shame you will admit, that Princes are farre fitter in their owne persons, if they would take the paynes to determine ecclesiasticall matters, then husbandmen and Artisants. And if they want direction, or will giue Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to that purpose, they neede not descend to the plough and carte for helpe or aduise. The world will greatly doubt of your discretion, and suspect, you sauour of popular faction and ambition, if by Gods lawe you presse Princes against their wils to accept such counsellers and substitutes in ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement. If they bee at libertie to make their choice, they haue store of learned and able men of all sortes within their Realmes, whom they may trust with the censuring and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing of Clergie mens actions; so as to preferre Ploughmen and Craftesmen to vndertake that weightie charge for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes, were ridiculous, if not infamous follie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laie <hi>Presbyterie</hi> must either claime to haue their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authoritie from Christ without the Prince, and before the Prince; which is somewhat dangerous, if not derogatorie to the Princes right; or els they must staie till the Magistrate giue them power in euery place to gouerne the causes of the

For since they will needes concurre with the Prince in the same charge and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersight of Ecclesiasticall crimes and causes; they must deriue their warrant, either from the Prince, as his delegates, or from the Princes superiour.</p>

            <p>Then neither doe the Scriptures any where mention Lay <hi>Presbyters;</hi> nor the Fathers expounding the places that are brought for them, did euer giue so much as an inkeling of any such persons. The words of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> be not only cleared from them by diuers sound interpretations, but produced against them.

Lay men had Christian gouernements; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their families; ouer the Church and house of God, none had,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2102:93"/>
in the Apostles daies that wee reade, saue Pastors and Teachers, I meane, such as did feede and watch the flocke committed to their charge.</p>
            <p>And yet if wee shoulde graunt, that in the Apostles time, for want of a Magistrate to vpholde the discipline of the Church, and punish the disorders and offences of loose brethren; there were certaine graue and wise Elders ioyned with the Prophets and Pastours to admonish the vnrulie, examine the guiltie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude infamous and scandalous persons from the common societie of Christians; Is it anie consequent, the like must bee vsed with vs in a Christian kingdome vnder a beleeuing Prince: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike Churches were planted in populous Cities where they coulde not lacke meete men to sustaine that charge: ours are dispersed in rurall Hamlets; where there can bee no hope to finde so many fitte Gouernours, as shall bee requisite. To the first Churches came none but such as were willing and zealous, without all compulsion: to ours come all forces, Atheistes, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and howe manie rather forced by Lawe, then ledde with deuotion; yea, woulde God it did not often so fall out that in manie places the richer and wealthier men eyther regarde no Religion, or secretely leane to the woorst. Euerie Church with them had manie Prophetes, Pastours and Teachers, the number, and neede of the people, and tyme so requiring; so that their <hi>Presbyteries</hi> might bee indifferently weighed without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbearing either side; Wee haue but one in eche Parish, and to exact maintenaunce for moe at the peoples handes, in euerie Uillage; woulde breede that sore which no playster would heale. To giue that one a negatiue voyce in all thinges against the Laie Elders; were to fill the whole Realme with infinite contentions and questions. To giue him no voyce, but as one amongest the rest; is to shake the Church in sunder with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie faction and fansie of the multitude. Lastly, those Churches vnder persecution had none that coulde iustly chalenge to rule the rest; ours hath a lawfull Monarch professing the faith; to whome by Gods Lawe the gouernement of all crimes and causes Ecclesiasticall doeth rightly belong; and therefore the priuate and popular regiment of the afflicted Churches must cease, since
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2102:94"/>
God hath blessed this realme with a publike, peaceable and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gouernement. The greater and stronger power doeth alwayes determine and frustrate the lesser and weaker in the same kinde. What neede we priuate men to punish vices, when we haue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to doe it? What neede wee Suffrages of Lay Elders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme disorders and abuses in Pastors, when wee haue open and knowen lawes to worke the same effect with more force and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter speede? In popular states, and persecuted Churches some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence may be made for that kinde of discipline; In christian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, I see neither neede nor vse of Lay Elders.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, for my part, I doe not beleeue that Lay Elders were vsed in the Apostls times to gouerne the Church. With imposition of hands, remission of sinnes, distribution of Sacraments, I am right assured, no iust proofe can be made they did or should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle; yea the ouersight of those things could not belong, whiles the Apostles liued, to Lay men; and after their deaths, the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches planted by them, and ages succeeding them, neuer vsed nor acknowledged any Lay Elders. Which is to me an inuincible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that the Apostles left them none. For would all the Churches in the worlde with one consent immediatly vpon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles deaths, reiect that fourme of gouerning the Church by Lay Elders, which was setled and approoued by the Apostles, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a new and strange kinde of gouernement without precept or precedent for their so doing? Howe others can perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that the whole Church of Christ felt so generally and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to a wilfull Apostacie, I knowe not; for myselfe I confesse I had rather forsake the deuise and conceit of some late Writers, were they in number moe then they are, before I will proclaime so many Apostolike men, and ancient and learned fathers to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest despisers of the Apostolike discipline, and voluntarie suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if not inuentors, of Antichrists pride and tyrannie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they shew me Lay Elders vniuersally receiued for gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in the Churches and ages next folowing the Apostles, I wil agnise they came from the Apostles; if there were no such after the Apostles, I cannot beleeue they were in the Apostles times.</p>

in any father to inferre they were Laie. The names of <hi>Presbyteri</hi> and <hi>Seniores,</hi> which in English are Elders or Priests, you shewe, whereof we neuer doubted; but those names when they imply age, are common to all men that are striken in yeeres: when they note an office, they are proper to Clergie men. More then the doubtfull signification of the word Elders; I professe before him that seeth the secretes of all mens hearts, I see no inforcement in any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet produced. On the contrarie, though it might suffise me to stand on the Negatiue, that no laie Elders can bee prooued; yet because I seeke not to distinguish wordes, but to searchout the trueth, I haue prooued by other places out of the same writers, that they had no such intent, as you pretend; vse your eies and not your fansies, I am well content your selues shall be Iudges.</p>

               <hi>Agelius</hi> a Nouatian Bishop, <hi>readie to die, imposed hands on Sisinnius to be Bishop in his place, being one of the Presbyters that were vnder him. The people of the Nouatians (misliking or) complaining of the fact, for that he rather laied not handes on one Marcian, by whose meanes the Nouatians in the time of Valens, enioyed quietnesse, Agelius willing to ease the peoples griefe, laied hands also on Marcian. And when he was a litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, he entred into the Church, and in his owne person said; You haue Marcian to succeed mee, and after Marcian Sisinnius.</hi> This is the true report of <hi>Socrates</hi> words; and in these, what one letter for laie Elders? <hi>Sisinnius</hi> was no laie man; hee was a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie man long before this, as <note n="2" place="margin">

               <hi>Socrates</hi> himselfe recordeth. As for the name of Elders or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> besides that in all the Church stories it noteth an ecclesiasticall function; and laie men by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons could not be made Bishops, except they were first in orders; this very chapter is a manifest testimonie, that none were promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to beare that name, or haue that place but by imposition of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2102:102"/>
hands. I had occasion before to alleage the words of <hi>Marcian,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting that euer he laied his handes on <hi>Sabbatius</hi> and others, to make them priests, I will not now repeate them.</p>
            <p>But the peoples dislike made <hi>Agelius</hi> recall his fact? Of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, this is one of the weakest and worst. The Nouatians were Schismatikes from the Church of Christ, and no members of it; it skilleth not therefore whatsoeuer they or their Bishop did. Next, it was but a point of policie in <hi>Agelius,</hi> to retaine the liking of his folowers; for as they departed from the Catholike Church vpon a conceit; so were they as like vpon a Spleene, to returne thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and forsake the Nouatian Bishops. Thirdly, he might iustly feare, and so preuent a Schisme amongst his owne, least some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to <hi>Sisinnius,</hi> and some to <hi>Marcian,</hi> his Congregation should bee diuided, which was no rare thing in the elections of Bishops. Lastly, if this example were woorth the standing on; it is certaine, that <hi>Agelius</hi> lying sicke in his bedde, made first <hi>Sisinnius</hi> Bishop without the peoples consent; and meaning to please the multitude, he did as much for <hi>Marcian;</hi> and when he came to the Church vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his recouerie, hee asked no consents for <hi>Sisinnius;</hi> but tolde the people, that according to their desire <hi>Marcian</hi> should bee next, and <hi>Sisinnius</hi> should expect till <hi>Marcian</hi> was dead. In all this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, there is no one part answerable to the Canons of the Church, and as for laie Elders, not so much as any suspicion of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The people had alwayes an interest in the choice of their Bishop and Elders, as appeareth in Possidonius by their preferring S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten to be an Elder.]</hi> I doe not denie, but after the Apostles and their followers were dead, in whose dayes the holy Ghost named the most of the Pastours and Teachers; the good will and liking of the people was greatly respected in the choice of their Bishops; and when there wanted <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Deacons needfull for the Church, the Bishop of the place vsed to admonish and exhort the people, if they found any men amongst themselues meete for their good behauiour and to wardnesse to serue in the Church of Christ, to bring them foorth or name them, that he might accordingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of them, whether by the Canons they were capable of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And when himselfe would preferre such as he knew to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for their learning, he proposed their names to the people, that their liues and conuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And why: he was vehemently impugned from his first ingresse to the bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, all occasions were sought to drawe the people from him; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aduantages by reason of his absence from the place in time of persecution, were taken against him, to disgrace him and crosse him in all his doings. To strengthen himselfe, and retaine the Ioue of his Clergie, and people towards him; what better way could hee take, then in all his enterprises to depend on the counsel of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, &amp; consent of the Laitie. for by that means he stood assured, that neither Schisme could arise, nor faction preuaile against him.</p>

The like he did for <hi>Optatus, Saturus, Caelerinus and Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> as your owne authorities doe witnesse. for as by them you prooue <hi>Cyprian</hi> was woont to take the good report and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the people concerning such as should bee admitted to the Clergie, and with common aduise to examine their woorthinesse; so by the selfe same places I she we, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> brake that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, when hee sawe time and cause require; and without the consent of his people or Clergie, ordered such as hee found to be meete for that calling. Whereby wee collect that the consent of the people and Clergie is no essentiall point in ordering Ministers, without the which they may not bee called; but a very Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and commendable course to keepe off all notorious and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous persons from that function; and the surest way to saue the Bishop from communicating with other mens sinnes, whiles hee trusted not his owne iudgement or knowledge; but vsed the eyes, eares, and consciences of the whole Church, for the better view, search, and triall of their integritie, grauitie and industrie, to whome the flocke of Christ was to bee committed.

               <hi>so honoured with the excellencie of his heauenly glory.</hi> He and <hi>Aurelius were appointed for a time to be Readers; but now know you that we haue assigned vnto them the honour of the Presbyterie, &amp; to haue the same allowance with the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; to sit with vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to ripe &amp; perfect yeeres.</hi> Of <hi>Numidicus</hi> we spake <note n="1" place="margin">Pag. 176.</note> before, why he <hi>was taken</hi> by <hi>Cyprian into the number of the Presbyters of Carthage;</hi> and that without the consent or knowledge of the people or Clergie. I suppose it to be cleare by these examples (which are your owne) that as <hi>Cyprian</hi> for his discharge did take the liking and aduise of the Clergie and people, for the better examining of their liues and behauiours, that were to serue in the Church of Christ; so when he found such as in his conscience he knew to bee fit and woorthie, hee and other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops his Colleagues imposed hands on them, without expecting the assent or agreement of the people or <hi>Presbyters</hi> of Carthage, where he was bishop.</p>
            <p>These be the Fathers which your selues picked out to muster before her Maiesties presence, as pregnant witnesses for the Laie <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> and these, if you suffer them to tell on their tales, most clearelie refute your Laie Elders. Other places I know are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged, or rather abused, to the same purpose; but the mistaking of them is so palpable, that children will not be deceiued with them. for what if the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> in Greeke signifie an aged man, as well as a Priest; hath it any sound or shew of reason, where the Councils and Fathers vse the word <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> you should straight enforce they were laie Elders? To innouate the discipline recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and established euer since the Apostles times, you should haue better grounds then these; you will otherwise hardly discharge your credites before men, howsoeuer you will your consciences before God. For my part, though I compare not with their giftes which first began, and now maintaine this deuise; yet by perusing their proofes, I finde that the preiudice of their owne opinion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enclineth them to this conceite, then the weight either of Scriptures or Fathers. For were they not ouer willing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this fansie, where there is one place for them to stumble at the ambiguitie of the worde, there are an hundred faire and plaine testimonies to recall them, and direct them to the ancient and true discipline of Christes Church. So that in this question (whether
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2102:107"/>
there were any Laie Elders to gouerne the Primitiue Church) no diligent or indifferent examiner of the Fathers, can long erre; the case is so cleare, that vnlesse we affect rather our wils then the trueth, we cannot be led away.</p>
            <p>The summe of all that is sayd touching Laie Elders, resteth in three pointes; which I wish the learned aduisedlie to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, and the rest carefully to remember. First, it cannot bee prooued either by Scriptures or Fathers, that in the Apostles times or after, any laie Elders were part of the <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> or that any such were authorized or acknowledged to bee Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in the Church of Christ. Secondlie, if there were such Censors of maners appointed by the whole Church to remooue the vnrulie, and banish them from the fellowship and companie of the faythfull, least their offensiue behauiour should be a shame and slaunder to the Gospell; yet no Text nor title can be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture, Councill or Father, that they gouerned the power of the keyes, imposition of handes, or any other ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall duetie, which concerned the dispensation of the worde and Sacramentes. In those things they were to obey, and not to rule their Pastours. Thirdlie, though the ouersight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of euill disposed and disordered Pastours were then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to such Elders, for want of beleeuing Magistrates to take care thereof; yet since by the lawe of God, the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such causes, as well as of ciuill affaires belongeth to Christian Princes, and they haue straighter charge, higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and better meanes to represse such disorders, and refourme such abuses in Pastours and others; whatsoeuer pretence may bee made for Laie Elders and Gouernours in time of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they must vtterlie cease and giue place, where the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate receiueth the fayth, and vpholdeth the Church. His pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not onely includeth, but excludeth theirs; since they bee Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours by consent of priuate men: and the Magistrate hath his power and sword deliuered him immediatelie from God; to which all men, Pastours, Laie Elders, and whosoeuer must be subiect not onely for feare of vengeance, but for regard of Gods ordinance. As for the Iewish <hi>Synedrion,</hi> to which some men flie for helpe, it cannot bee (as I haue touched before) eyther Rule or Refuge for the Laie <hi>Presbyterie.</hi> God erected that as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2102:107"/>
the plot-forme of the Iewes common wealth, and made their Elders ciuill Magistrates to execute the Iudiciall part of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lawe, as well without, as vnder the king. And therefore as they might not alter it, so wee must not vrge it in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an kingdomes; it contradicteth the trueth and freedome of the Gospell, to tye all Christian common wealthes to the paterne of Moses pollicie; yea, that position, if it bee stiffelie stood too, maymeth all Monarchies, and reduceth them to popular, or at least to <hi>Synedricall</hi> Regimentes; the consequents whereof are so desperate and dangerous to all Christendome, that I trust of your selues you will forbeare, and if need bee, disclayme that assertion.</p>

            <p>If it seeme strange to any, that the ancient Councels shoulde endure the name &amp; title of a Bishop, to be giuen; to whome the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and office of a bishop was not giuen, he must consider for what causes they first permitted rurall Bishops to be made. The one was, to supplie the wants that often happen in the absence or sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Bishop. In which cases being but vicegerents in some things, there was no reason they should haue the same power and prerogatiue the right Bishops had, without their leaue or liking. For that had beene to erect another Bishop in the same Diocese besides, and against the true Bishop; and not to place a substitute vnder him. The next cause was, to content such as were Bishops

amongest Schismatikes, who woulde rather persist in their fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then returne to the catholike church with the losse of that honour and calling they had before.

            <p>Besides this, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were tied to many rules, to which no Lay man was tied.

               <hi>You prooue that Lay Elders were not called by the name of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in the Primitiue Church, but that no such were admitted to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church, you doe not prooue.]</hi> Giue me leaue to tell you what I prooue, repell it if you can.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2102:116"/>
the Church. for it is apparant by their writings they had no <hi>Presbyters</hi> but Clergie men, and of such their <hi>Presbyteries</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, and not of any Laie men, whom they particularly and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exclude not onely from the name, but also from the order, office, seates, power and honour of <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though they were not knowen by that name, yet were they called Seniores, the Elders of the Church, as Tertullian, Ierome, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Austen and Gregorie doe witnesse; yea, though wee should graunt the Church had no such laie Elders in Ieroms and Ambroses dayes, yet they both confesse there were such in the first Age of the Church, and that the Church should be gouerned by their aduise and counsell. Their wordes are so plaine, they cannot be shifted. And thence I make this demonstration. Laie Elders in Ambroses time were out of vse, as himselfe affirmeth, through the slouth, or rather pride of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; but Clergie Presbyters were not out of vse in Ambroses time; there were therefore laie Elders in the first Churches, without whose aduise nothing was done, besides the Presbyters that continued in Ambroses dayes. this Argument is insoluble.]</hi> You are vsed to make fewe good Arguments, that take this to bee so strong. The force of these places I haue examined before; and there shewed that they were wrested cleane against the intent of the writers; but because I am to end the discourse of laie Elders, and so to relinquish them to their inuenters, I will not bee grieued to recapitulate the strength of your authorities, and search out the surenesse of this last syllogisme.</p>
            <p>The first thing that I obserue in your authorities, is this; that with your owne proofes, you ouerthrow your owne purpose. To conuince that laie Elders dured in the Church til <hi>Gregories</hi> time, which was <hi>600.</hi> yeeres after Christ, you produce amongst others S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who saieth that in his time <hi>230.</hi> yeeres before, such Elders <hi>were out of vse.</hi> If there were no such Elders in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broses</hi> age, how could they dure till <hi>Gregories</hi> dayes, that liued more then <hi>200.</hi> yeeres after him: This knot is more insoluble then your syllogisme.</p>
            <p>Another of your witnesses, I meane, S. <hi>Ierome,</hi> in the verie same place that you cite, laieth the whole plot of your laie Elders in the dust. for both touching the persons that ruled the Church, and the time which they continued, be crosseth all your assertions. The

persons by whose common aduise the Church at first was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, were <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and those by your owne confession were no laie men. Or if you make any bones to confesse so much, S. <hi>Ierome</hi> will auouch nolesse. I must alleage his wordes once againe, and some of them in Latin, because you shall the more sensiblie see your errour, and the rest not distrust my translation. <note n="1" place="margin">Hiero. in 1. ca. epist, ad Titum.</note>

Before there were factions in religion, and the people began to say, I hold of Paul, I of Apollo, and I of Cephas; the Churches were gouerned by the common aduise of the Presbyters. But when euery man thought those, whom he had baptized, to be his owne, and not Christes; it was decreed in the whole world, that one chosen out of the Presbyters should be set aboue the rest, to whom all the care of the Church should appertaine, and the seedes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision rooted out.</hi> These wordes are so plaine, they neede no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration to helpe them. Before Schismes grew in religion, the Churches were gouerned by the common aduise of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> but when the baptizers drewe the people into factions, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were throughout the world elected, and aduaunced aboue <hi>Presbyters</hi> to take the whole care of the Church. They were both <hi>Presbyters</hi> and baptizers that gouerned the Church, before Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were decreed; <hi>ergo,</hi> they were no laie Elders. This were enough: but <hi>Ierome</hi> to shew what <hi>Presbyters</hi> they were, alleageth foure places of the Scripture, and thereby prooueth they were Teachers and Pastours. I must set downe his words; but as short as I can, that men may be perswaded, or ashamed of their errour in this part committed.</p>

               <hi>The Presbyters that are amongst you I beseech, my selfe being your fellow Presbyter, feede yee the Lordes flocke that is with you. These things I bring to shewe, that anciently Presbyters were all one with Bishops, and that in tract of time, to plucke vp the rootes of dissention, all the charge (of the Church) was committed to one.</hi> The <hi>Presbyters</hi> that gouerned the Church in the Apostles times, did <hi>ATTEND</hi> and <hi>FEED</hi> the flocke, and <hi>WATCH OVER SOVLES,</hi> as those that should giue account for them, and had all those qualities that the Apostle required in Bishops. The same charge, and the same grace conclude the same function. And therefore, if any were Clergie men in the Apostles times, these <hi>Presbyters</hi> were not Laie men.

What the things are which must abide for euer in the Church, I shewed <note n="¶" place="margin">Cap. 9. fol. 107.</note> before; it shall suffise now to rehearse them; namelie, <hi>power to preach the word and administer the Sacraments, the right vse of the keies, and imposition of hands,</hi> for the placing of fit men to vndertake the cure of soules, and remoouing of vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnfit men from infecting and offending the Church. These must not faile in the Church, so long as there is a Church: for the want of any one of them, is the confusion, if not subuersion of the Church.

What I say of the people, I say likewise of laie Elders, for so much as they are but a part of the people; and looke what the whole is prohibited, euery part is interdicted. If Laie men may intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with ecclesiasticall functions, why not the people? If the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not, why should the Elders, since both are Laie? If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the execution, and chalenge the superuision of ecclesiasticall dueties; they flie from one Rocke, and fall on another; they cleare themselues from the worde, and entangle themselues with the sword. Gouernours of the Church that bee neither ministers nor Magistrates, I yet conceiue none; if any mans skill bee so good, that hee can describe vs a gouernement betwixt both, that shall wrong neither, I would gladly giue him audience. Howbeit wee need not trouble our heads with the maner of gouernement that laie Elders must haue distinct from the Priestes and Princes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, before we haue better proofe for the persons, that shall enioy this priuiledge. When you make it appeare there were such offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Church of Christ, wee will then intreat you to bound out their office by the word of God, or writings of the auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; till then wee stand resolued there were neuer such Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours nor gouernement established by the Apostles, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by their after-commers in Christes Church. The places pretended both in Scriptures and Fathers for such Elders, wee haue leasurablie perused and examined, and wee finde not so much as the footesteps of any Laie Elders. <hi>Presbyters</hi> we find and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; but no reason to leade, they were laie <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Rulers. Against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we find all the Christian &amp; ancient Councils, lawes and fathers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer mentioned any <hi>Presbyters.</hi> If I shuffle any writers wordes, or dazel the Readers eies, shew me the place, I will yeeld to mine errour.

            <p>Two sortes are left, (for I still professe that laie Elders were neuer admitted to meddle with any such matters) to whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike power and charge, which must alwayes remaine in the Church, may be communicated and imparted; and those are <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> and Bishops.

               </gap> Elders I ouerskip as meere strangers to all antiquitie. So that when I speake of <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> I vnderstand thereby the assemblies of such <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as were Clergie men, and in euery Citie assisted the Bishop in the seruice of God, and aduised the Bishop in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affaires of the Church. Thus much I premonish, least the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vse of the word <hi>Presbyter</hi> in this chapter should either perplexe or vnsettle the Reader.</p>
            <p>The times must like wise be remembred. The Apostles both in teaching and gouerning the Churches, when they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, had helpers; when they were absent, had substitutes; after their finall departures or deathes, left successours. So that the <hi>things</hi> originally descending from the Apostles, and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie remayning in the Church, are the charge of the worde and Sacraments, and the power of keyes and handes: the <hi>persons</hi> to whom they were committed, either <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Bishops: the <hi>times</hi> when, the presence, absence, departure or death of the Apostles. If wee neglect or confound these partes, wee shall but roaue in the aire, at the right gouernement of the Church; if wee obserue them, wee shall force the Question to an Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue that will not deceiue vs. And first for the worde and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            <p>It may not bee deuied, but as the worde and Sacraments are the most essentiall seedes of the Church, so the handling and sowing thereof in the Lordes ground must bee the generall and principall charge of all Pastours and <hi>Presbyters;</hi> that eyther feede or rule the flocke of Christ. for whether they be <hi>Apostles, Euangelists, Prophets, Pastours</hi> or <hi>Teachers,</hi> I meane such as <note n="1" place="margin">Eph. 4.</note>

               <hi>Christ sent mee not to baptize, but to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell;</hi> not that hee might not or did not vse both, but the latter was the chiefer. So <hi>Iohn</hi>

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee that hath charge from God to preach the one, hath also leaue to performe the other.

            <p>A newe distinction is lately deuised, that Pastours in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were such as had not onely the word and Sacraments, but also the Church and charge of soules committed vnto them; and Teachers those that laboured in doctrine, but receiued no charge neither of Sacramentes, nor soules. In deede <hi>Ambrose</hi> taketh them for <note n="6" place="margin">Ambros. in 4. ca. ad Ephes.</note> Catechizers of Infants; and at Alexandria there were <note n="7" place="margin">Euseb. li. 5. ca. 10</note> moderators of Schooles resembling our Uniuersities, for the training and instructing of such as in time were likely to profit the Church of God; but these were not ecclesiasticall functions in the Church; they were profitable members of a common wealth that so did, but no necessarie workemen in the ministerie. And though there were such for a season at Alexandria, yet all other Cities and Churches had not the like; and they that gouerned those Schooles and taught the Catechumes there as <hi>Pantenus, Clemens</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen,</hi> were Laie men, and neuer vsed at Alexandria to teach the people in the Church, as appeareth by <hi>Demetrius</hi> wordes then Bishop of Alexandria, finding great fault with the Bishops of Ierusal in and Cesaria, for suffering <hi>Origen</hi> after hee had bene Catechist at Alexandria, to expound the Scriptures before the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:2102:122"/>
people in the Church. His wordes are these; <note n="1" place="margin">Euseb, li. 6. ca. 10</note> 
               <hi>It was neuer heard, nor euer suffered, that Laie men should teach in the Church in the presence of Bishops.</hi> With no face could the Bishop of Aler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria haue disliked <hi>Origens</hi> fact, if it had bene vsuall in his owne Church: and the Bishops that wrate in defence of the matter, doe not auouch it was a generall or perpetuall rule in the Church of Christ for a Catechizer to teach in the Church; but alleage three instances where they sawe the like vsed, and confesse they knew no more. Wherefore, vnlesse their examples and reasons were stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and surer, I preferre the iudgement of <hi>Ierome, Augustine, Chrysostome, Theodorete</hi> and others before this late conceite, who thinke the Apostle expressed one office by two names, to shew what things belonged to the Pastorall charge. <hi>Austen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But grant Pastours and Doctours were distinct offices in the Church, as you imagine, what gaine you by it? You may thereby prooue an inequalitie of ecclesiasticall functions, you prooue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els. <note n="7" place="margin">Hebr. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Obey your Ouerseers,</hi> saieth <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>bee subiect to them. they watch ouer your soules to giue account (for them.)</hi> Obedience and subiection to the Pastour is due from the whole flocke, and all degrees thereof which are no Pastours; but Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as you say, were no Pastors; they were therfore inferiour to Pastors, and subiect to their ouersight. Now take your choice; if Pastors were all one with Doctors, you haue lost one of those of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which you affirme to bee perpetuall in the Church: if they
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2102:122"/>
were distinct from them, they were superiours vnto them; and so betwixt ministers of the word, (for such were Teachers by Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule) you establish a difference of degrees.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the worde and Sacraments; the dispensing whereof no doubt was common to all Apostles, Euangelists, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Pastours, and Teachers; and so to <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Bishops, not withstanding the moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ouersight of those things were still reserued to the Apostles, as well absent as present, euen when the power and charge thereof was imparted to others.</p>
            <p>The discipline and gouernement of the Church, I meane the power of the keies, and imposing hands, are two other partes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike authoritie which must remaine in the Church for euer. These keyes are double; the keie of knowledge annexed to the word; the keie of power referred to the Sacraments. Some late writers by vrging the one, abolish the other; howbeit I see no sufficient reason to counteruaile the Scriptures and Fathers that defend and retaine both. The <hi>keie of knowledge</hi> must not bee doubted of, our Sauiour in expresse wordes, nameth it. <note n="1" place="margin">Luke 11.</note>

            <p>To returne to the ancient Fathers, and sincerely to views their reportes without shortening or lengthening them for either side, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> speech is in partcleere, in part obscure. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue three points in him that appeare to be true, and accord with the iudgement of the rest of the Fathers. The first is, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles coulde not at the newe planting of the Churches settle and dispose all thinges in such perfection, as in time they did. So saieth <hi>Ambrose,</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="margin">Ambrosin E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes. ca. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Postquam omnibus locis Ecclesiae sunt consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutae &amp; officia ordinata, aliter composita res est, quàm coeperat: After that Churches were established in all places; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:2102:125"/>
               <hi>(distinguished or) digested, they tooke an other order then at beginning.</hi> And why: The first regarde the Apostles had, was to gaine vnbeleeuers to Christ; the second, to gouerne such as were gained. And these two respects might best be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed by two contrarie courses. To <hi>encrease the Church,</hi> the more workemen, the better. For when <hi>the Haruest is great, if</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="margin">Luc. 10.</note> 
               <hi>the Labourers bee fewe,</hi> the roumes can not be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. To <hi>guide the Church,</hi> the fewer, the better; except it bee with counsell to aduise. For diuerse men haue diuers minds, and diuers meanings, and in a multitude of Gouernours, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and dissention are no rare springs. Wherefore no maruell though the Apostles tooke besides themselues as many helpers as they coulde to conuert the worlde vnto Christ; and yet tooke not vnto themselues as many Rulers as they coulde in euerie place to gouerne the beleeuers. By order of nature men must bee gotten together, afore they neede bee gouerned; and so in the building of the Church the number of Preachers at the first was more requisite then the choice of Gouernours. And for that cause <hi>Epiphanius</hi> second position is verie true, That <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and Deacons (the one to labour in the worde and dispence the Sacraments, the other to releeue the poore and attend to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Seruice) were euerie where appointed by the Apostles. These were sufficient to beginne the Churches, and these were fittest to increase the Church. And therefore in many places, the Apostles left none other but these. If you aske, who then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the Churches in those beginnings, I answere, the flocke was both augmented and directed by the <hi>Presbyters</hi> that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in the worde. The chiefe gouernement <hi>to impose handes</hi> and <hi>deliuer vnto Satan</hi> rested yet in the Apostles, who often <note n="2" place="margin">Act. 15. &amp; 14.</note> 
               <hi>visited</hi> the Churches which they planted, and <hi>ordained Presbyters</hi> (as they passed) to supplie the wantes of euerie Church. The third point in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reporte is this; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not extant in the Apostles writings, that in euerie place where they came at first they left Bishops; yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do witnesse that <hi>Paul</hi> furnished some places with Bishops, as Ephesus and Creete with <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Tite.</hi> Thus farre I see not what you can refell in <hi>Epiphanius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:2102:126"/>
Perchance you will deride <hi>Epiphanius</hi> simplicitie, that coulde not discerne betwixt an Euangelist and a Bishop; for (as you maintaine) <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Tite</hi> were Euangelists and not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and had an extraordinarie and no ordinarie calling. You can not charge <hi>Epiphanius</hi> with ignoraunce in this behalfe, but you must doe the like to the eldest and best learned Fathers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, namely, <hi>Eusebius, Ambrose, Chrysostome, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Oecumenius, Primasius</hi> and others; which affirme as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi> doth, that <hi>Timothie</hi> was a Bishop ordeined by <hi>S. Paul.</hi> but thereof anon; as also whether an Euangelist might bee a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop or no; which conclusions of yours, though they be most feeble and vnsure, yet they be lately taken up for Oracles.</p>
            <p>That which may be doubted in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> is this. The cause why Bishops wanted in some places was, saith he, the lacke of fit men to beare the office. It may be some will thinke it strange, that amongest so many Prophets, Pastours and Teachers as were in most of those Churches which <hi>Paul</hi> planted, not a fit man could be found for the Episcopal function, and yet afterward meete men were found for all the Churches in the worlde: but as that which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> saith, might be some cause of wanting Bishops at the first; so, if I be not deceiued, there were other causes that mooued the Apostles not straight wayes to place Bishops in euerie Church where they preached, which I will specifie, when the testimonies of <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> be throughly perused.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ambrose</hi> at first sight seemeth somewhat to dissent from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius,</hi> in that he thinketh the Churches had both <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Bishops left them by the Apostles; and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were placed in an order, according to the deserts and worthines of eche man, by the Apostles and others that founded the Churches; and this rule deliuered, that as the first and chiefest <hi>Presbyter</hi> (who was Bishop in name, and superiour in calling to the rest) failed, so the next should succeede in his roume, and enioy the Episcopall chaire and power after his departure. And when some <hi>Presbyters</hi> did not answere the expectation which was had of them, but scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized the Church, <hi>that course</hi> of standing in <hi>order to succeede</hi> was changed, and Bishops were chosen by the iudgement and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of many Priests, to cut off vnworthie and offensiue men from the place. I could admit this report of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> but that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:2102:126"/>
not when, and by whome this change beganne, he saieth, <hi>Prospiciente Concilio, A Council (fore seeing or) prouiding, that not order, but merite should create a Bishop;</hi> but what Council: If he meant a Councill of the Apostles, which is not expressed, but may well bee intended; (for the wordes stand indifferent to any Councill,) no testimonie can be weightier for Bishops then this of <hi>Ambrose;</hi> which is brought against them. If he meant others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apostles deaths, what authoritie had they to change the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike gouernment; or by their decree to bind the whole world: But this I reserue till <hi>Ieromes</hi> witnesse bee repeated and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

                  <hi>pag.</hi> 215.</note> before cited auoucheth three special things. first, that til dissentions sprang in the Church, <hi>Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were all one, and the Churches were gouerned by the common aduise of Presbyters, amongst (whom) the care of the Church was equally diuided.</hi> Next, that to roote out schismes rising verie fast through the Preachers and <hi>Presbyters</hi> factions, <hi>by a decree throughout the whole worlde, one of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was chosen</hi> in euery Church, <hi>and set ouer the rest,</hi> and to him <hi>the whole care of the Church did</hi> euer after <hi>appertaine.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this <hi>subiection of the Presbyters</hi> vnder the Bishop, and <hi>maioritie of Bishops</hi> aboue <hi>Presbyters</hi> grewe <hi>rather by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Church, then by the trueth of the Lords dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> for they <hi>should rule the Church in common.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These wordes of <hi>Ierome</hi> may be either verie true according to the time that they be referred vnto, or verie false. If you so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Ierome,</hi> that all the while the Apostles liued, Bishops were al one with <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and had no more charge nor power in the Church then <hi>Presbyters;</hi> you make <hi>Ierome</hi> contradict the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, himselfe, &amp; the whole aray of all the ancient Fathers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike Churches, that euerwere since Christs time; for all these affirme and proue the contrarie. But if you so expound <hi>Ierom</hi> that the Apostles for a time suffred the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to haue equall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and care in guiding the Church (themselues alwayes sitting at the sterne, and holding the helue whiles they were present in those parts of the worlde) till by the factions and diuisions of so manie gouernors the Churches were almost rent in peeces; and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apostles forced, did set an other order in the Church then

was at first, and with the good liking of all the Churches, (either troubled with contentions, or iustly fearing the like euents in time to come) did commit eche place to one Pastour, leauing the rest to consult and aduise with him for the health and peace of the people, and by this example taught the whole Church what perpetuall rule to obserue after their deaths; <hi>Ierome</hi> saieth as much as I can, or doe desire.

            <p>
               <hi>There were then at Ephesus, and amongst the dispersed Iewes no Bishops, but such as were Presbyters; and they many, not one.]</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the times, and the Scriptures will agree. There was a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2102:127"/>
time, <hi>(as Ierome</hi> telleth you) when the <hi>Churches were gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the common aduise of the Presbyters.</hi> In this time spake <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of Ephesus, in this time wrate <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> amongst the Iewes. After this the factions of the Teachers caused the Apostles to establish an other kinde of gouernement, and to commit the chiefe care of eche Church, which they had planted, to some chosen person that should ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see the flocke as Pastour of the place, the rest being his helpers to disperse the word, and aduisers to gouerne the Church. <hi>If you prooue that, you say somewhat to the matter.]</hi> If I prooue it not better then you doe your Laie Elders, I am content to renounce the one, as I doe the other. <hi>Will you prooue it by the Scripture?]</hi> I will so prooue it, as you shall not refuse it, vnlesse you reiect both the Booke and Church of God. <hi>What will you prooue?]</hi> That the Apostles in their life time did institute one Pastour to take the chiefe care of one Church; and consequentlie the change which <hi>Ierome</hi> speaketh of, from the common and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall regiment of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> to the particular and preeminent moderation of the Churches in eche place by Bishoppes, was not made after the Apostles were dead, but whiles they liued; and then of force by their decree. for during their times none might interpose themselues to change and alter the fourme of the Church Discipline setled by them, without their leaue and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it were euer decreed by them, it would bee founde in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; and that it can not. Besides, had it beene their doing, it might iustly be called Gods disposition and ordinance, which Ierome saieth it may not.]</hi> Their doctrine in deede doeth plainelie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their writings; their successours doe not. For howe should the Apostles declare by their pennes, who succeeded them after their deaths: Is not the whole Church of Christ a lawful and sufficient witnesse in that case: If wee beleeue not the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that were directed and ordered by the Apostles preaching and presence, nor their Schollers that liued with them, and next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their rouines; who that wise is, wil beleeue our bare sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises &amp; seelie coniectures, of things done <hi>1500.</hi> yeeres before we were borne: Yet if the Scriptures do not signifie so much, we wil
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2102:128"/>
loose it. But before I enter to proue it, I wil search out the right cause why the Apostles did not not in euery place where they came presently erect Bishops to gouerne the Churches which they planted.</p>
            <p>The reasons why the Apostles did not at the first preaching of the Gospell commit the Churches to the regiment of Bishops, I finde were these three. First; they reserued the chiefe power of imposing hands, and punishing notorious offendors to themselues, whom Christ made bishops &amp; ouerseers of his Church. For though to feede, leade, and attend the flocke, they tooke the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to be their helpers; yet the weightiest matters of the church, as giuing the graces of Gods spirite, and deliuering vnto Satan, they retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their owne handes, so long as they were in those places or parts of the worlde. The second is that which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that although there were many endued with excellent gifts to preach the word, yet the Apostles would trust none with the chiefe charge of the Churches, till they had fully seene, and perfectly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as wel the soundnes of their mindes, as greatnes of their gifts. Thirdly, lest they should seeme to seeke the aduancing of their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, more then the conuerting of vnbeleeuers; they suffered the Churches to take a triall what equalitie of many Gouernours would doe; and when the fruites thereof prooued to be dissention and confusion, the Apostles were forced to commit the Churches at their departures to certaine tried &amp; approoued men to be chiefe Pastours of the seuerall places; and the Churches were all as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receiue them, finding by experience what continuall schismes and heresies grew by the peruersnesse of Teachers, and could not be repressed by the confused gouernment of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> which were many in number, and equall in power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>None of these things are expressed in the Scriptures.]</hi> If the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alone did witnesse them, say we not much more for Bishops, then you do for Lay Elders? but you shall see the grounds of their reports testified euen in the Scriptures. That the Apostles at the first planting of the Churches, kept to themselues the power of imposing hands and deliuering vnto Satan, which the Fathers call Episcopall power, is no newes in the Scriptures; they could not loose that, vnlesse they lost their Apostleship withall: you must shew by the Scriptures where they committed this power to the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2102:128"/>
               <hi>Presbyters</hi> of euery place; or else our assertion standeth good that they retained it to themselues. For of their hauing it, there is no doubt; of their committing it to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of euery Church, there is no proofe. And therefore the Fathers doe vtterlie denie, that the Apostles deliuered that power to any but to Bishops. Their proofes be stronger then you take them for, howsoeuer you will shift them.</p>
            <p>There were <hi>Presbyters</hi> at Ephesus, besides <hi>Timothie,</hi> and in Creete, besides <hi>Tite;</hi> and yet <hi>Paul</hi> left the one at Ephesus to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose handes,</hi> and the other in Creete to <hi>ordaine Presbyters</hi> in euerie Citie. If without them the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of either place might haue doone it; superfluous was both <hi>Paules</hi> charge they should do it, and direction how they should do it. But his commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that power and care to them, prooueth in the iudgement of the ancient Fathers, that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> without them coulde not doe it. Euangelists you say they were; and not Bishops. Admit they were. Then as yet neither Ephesus, nor Creete had anie that might impose hands, and yet had they <hi>Presbyters;</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently this power to impose handes was at that time reserued from the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to the Apostles and their deputies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saint Paul saieth most apparantly the Presbyterie might impose hands. for Timothie receiued from them imposition of handes.]</hi> I haue tolde you alreadie, that take the worde how you will, you can prooue no such thing thence. If it signifie there the degree of a <hi>Presbyter</hi> which <hi>Timothie</hi> then receiued, as <hi>Ierome</hi> expoundeth the place; it commeth nothing neere your purpose. If you take it for the assemblie then gathered, when <hi>Timothie</hi> was ordained, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> telleth you, they were more then <hi>Presbyters;</hi> for otherwise they could not lay hands on <hi>Timothie</hi> to make him a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> you thinke, erred in not expounding the place as you doe. Then giue Saint <hi>Paul</hi> leaue to tell you that hee was present in the <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> when <hi>Timothie</hi> was ordained, and that he <hi>imposed hands on Timothie.</hi> But this I haue handled before, to which I referre you; I onely nowe put you in minde, that place will be are no such conclusion.</p>
            <p>And as the Apostles reserued imposition of handes from the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to themselues, so did they keepe the deliuering of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendours vnto Satan in their owne power. <note n="1" place="margin">2. Thess. 3.</note>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apostles hauing of this power doth not exclude the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from hauing the same; for at Corinth Paul not onely willeth the Church to excommunicate that incestuous sinner, but rebuketh them for not doing it before he wrate.] Paul</hi> doth not reprooue them for not <note n="3" place="margin">1. Corinth. 5</note> deliuering that sinner vnto Satan, but for <hi>not sorrowing</hi> that he might haue beene put from among them. Had they written of this notorious offence when they wrate of other things to the Apostle, that he might haue considered of the offendours punishe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they had doone their dueties. they could maintaine factions, and swell one against another through pride of their gifts; but they did not sorrow, to see so grieuous a crime committed and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the eyes both of beleeuers and Infidels, nor so much as sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the same by their letters, as desiring to haue such a one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from their Christian fellowship.

And therefore the Apostles were Bishops, and more then Bishops, euen as <hi>Iohn</hi> was <note n="5" place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> 
               <hi>more then a Prophet,</hi> and yet <note n="6" place="margin">Matth. 21. Luc. 1. ver. 76.</note> 
               <hi>a Prophet. Confound you their offices?]</hi> I keepe them distinct, in that I say, euerie Apostle was a Prophet, a Bishop, and a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> but not euerie <hi>Presbyter,</hi> Bishop, or Prophet, was an Apostle. They were all <note n="7" place="margin">1. Corinth. 4</note> 
               <hi>the Ministers of Christ, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his flocke, and stewardes of his mysteries;</hi> but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in a greater measure of grace, higher manner of calling, and mightier force of Gods Spirite then the rest. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer becommeth of the names, it can not be denyed, but the Apostles had that power of imposing handes, and deliuering vnto Sathan, which they after imparted vnto Bishops. And therefore whiles they remayned in or neere the places, where they planted Churches, there was no such need of Bishops; the Apostles alwayes supplying the wantes of those Churches with their presence, Letters or Messengers, as the cause requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But when they were finally to forgoe those parts, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan they to prouide for the necessitie and securitie of the Churches,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2102:130"/>
and left such fitte men as they had, with Episcopall power, as their substitutes to guide the Churches which they had foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>The second cause, why Bishops were not euery where trusted with the Churches at the first erecting thereof, is that which <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> remembreth, and <hi>Paul</hi> toucheth in many places. <note n="1" place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> 
               <hi>I trust to send Timotheus shortly vnto you. I haue no man like min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who will faithfully care for your matters. For all seeke their owne, and not that which is Iesus Christes.</hi> And to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie;</hi>

               <hi>At my first answering no man assisted mee, but all forsooke mee. Demas hath forsaken mee and embraced this present worlde.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Epiphanius</hi> surmise, that the scarcitie of tried and approoued men, was some cause why euerie place was not furnished at the first with a Bishop; is neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelie nor vnpertaining to the purpose.</p>
            <p>The third reason I take to be this; that as <hi>Presbyters</hi> to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the word and augment the Church were presently neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the haruest being no lesse then the whole world; and Bishops to moderate the number of Teachers, and to ouersee as well the feeders as the flocke were not so requisit whiles the Apostles (who tooke care of those things themselues (preached in or neere the places; so the wisedome of God woulde not impose that fourme of gouernement on the Church, but after long triall and good experience, what neede the Churches should haue of it. This course he obserued with the people of Israel, not straightway to associate the seuentie Elders vnto <hi>Moses;</hi> but to let them alone vntill <hi>Moses</hi> was wearied with the burden, and the multitude grieued for want of dispatch, and <hi>Iethro</hi> seeing the Iudge afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with paines and the people discontented with delayes, adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed an other way; which the whole assemblie liked, God confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and <hi>Moses</hi> executed. In like manner Christ suffered his Church to trie, whiles his Apostles yet liued, what equalitie and plentie of Gouernours would worke in euerie place; and when it fell out in proofe, vpon the Apostles absence, that so many leaders, so many followers, so many Rulers, so many factions out euerie Church in sunder; the Apostles were forced <hi>(the world,</hi> as <hi>Ierom</hi> faith <hi>decreing it,</hi> that is, the faithful <hi>throughout the world</hi> being

therewith contented and thereof desirous) to commit their places and Churches not to <hi>Presbyters</hi> in common and equall authoritie, but to their Disciples and followers (whome afterward they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bishops) in a superioritie, leauing vnto them as vnto their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors the chiefest honor and power of imposing handes and vsing the keyes, and resting specially on their care and paines to ouersee both Teachers and beleeuers, though the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from helping and assisting them to feed and guide the flocke of Christ.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>These examples make nothing to your purpose. for first they did none of these things, but with the aduise and consent of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie; which Bishops do not. Next, they were Euangelists and no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and in that respect might haue this speciall deputation from the Apostle.]</hi> It may bee your learning will serue you to say, that <hi>Paul</hi> left both these to rule the Church in Creete and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:2102:132"/>
at Ephesus for a weeke, and in their order, as the rest of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> did; but such tests if you dare aduenture them will cracke both your cause and your credite. <hi>Paul</hi> belike prayed <hi>Timothie</hi> to stay at Ephesus to call the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> together and to aske voyces, and to doe iust what pleased the rest to decree; but if you elude and frustrate the wordes of the Apostle with such addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not onelie besides, but against the Text, you can deceiue none saue such, as will not beleeue Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe if hee shoulde speake against the Lay <hi>Presbyterie.</hi> For our partes wee take the wordes as they stand, and so did the Catholike Fathers before vs; being persuaded that <hi>Paul</hi> had witte enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerue to whome hee shoulde write for the performaunce of these things, and not to mistake <hi>Timothie,</hi> for the <hi>Presbyterie.</hi> If <hi>Timothie</hi> had nothing else to do, but to consult what pleased the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to determine in euerie of these pointes; howe childish an ouersight was it for <hi>Paul</hi> to skip the whole bench of them; and to charge and adiure him to see these preceptes inuiolably kept without sparing or fearing anie man:</p>
            <p>For thus you must expound, or rather imprison and fetter euerie worde that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh in those three Epistles. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde</hi> with all authoritie; <hi>receiue</hi> not an accusation against a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but vnder two or three witnesses; <hi>rebuke</hi> them that sinne; <hi>reiect</hi> heretikes after two warnings; <hi>refuse</hi> yoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger widowes; <hi>staie</hi> vaine contentions and vnprofitable questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>ordaine</hi> Elders in euerie Citie; <hi>impose handes</hi> hastily on no man; that is as you interprete, call the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>aske</hi> them whether they be contented it shall be so or no. And so, <hi>I adiure and charge thee before God and Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou obserue these precepts</hi> inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnblameable, that is, obserue them if the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> will consent and agree vnto thee, else not. But I thinke you dare not stand to these mockeries of the Scriptures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will rather flie to the second part of your answere, that they were authorized to do these things, as Euangelists, and not as Bishops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We expressed so much, that they were Euangelists, and no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.]</hi> Euangelists you should say and Bishops. for when they left following the Apostles and were affixed to certaine places
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:2102:132"/>
with this power and authoritie which I haue mentioned, what els could they bee but Bishops? They assisted the Apostles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and supplied their absence, and did continue the Churches in that state in which the Apostles left them. Nowe if the Apostles in respect of this power and care, were Bishops when they staied in any place; much more the Euangelists. If the same <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idelitie and authoritie be still needful, and therefore perpetuall in the Church of God; they did these things not by their Euangelisticall calling, which is long since ceased, but by their Episcopall, which yet doeth and must remaine. for if this power and preheminence descended from them to their successours; it is euident this commission and charge was Episcopal, since no part of their Euangelship was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued to their after-commers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We cannot endure to haue them called or counted Bishops.]</hi> In deed if succession of Episcopall power came from the Apostles to them, and so to their successours; we shall soone conclude that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops came from the Apostles, and therefore you doe wisely to resist it: but by your patience you must endure it, the best Stories and Writers of the Primitiue Church, doe make them Bishops, and likewise <hi>Pauls</hi> precepts to them, the very paternes of Episcopall charge and duetie. <note n="1" place="margin">

If this (change to there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Bishops) proceeded from the Apostles, I woulde not doubt throughly to ascribe it to diuine disposition, as I doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinances of the Apostles;</hi> but <hi>Ierome</hi> expressely confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it was an Apostolike ordinance; <hi>ergo,</hi> without any stagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or doubting, it must be acknowledged by you, that it was Gods disposition. Thus much for <hi>Ierome.</hi> Nowe for <hi>Ambrose</hi> (before wee goe to further proofe;) because some strange fansies of this fresh Discipline are fastned on him; let vs likewise examine what he saith for either side.</p>
            <p>There is one thing in <hi>Ambrose</hi> barely surmised, but no way prooued, and that is eagerly caught vp by the Disciplinarians,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2102:135"/>
and made a shipmans hose for their newe deuises: there are foure other points in the same places, that haue surer ground and more agreement with the rest of the Fathers; and those are positiuelie repelled as friuolous and false by the principles of this pretended Discipline. <hi>Ambrose</hi> imagineth, (for no proofe can bee made thereof, either by Scripture or Storie) that the first Bishops were for a while made by order as they sate in the Church, so as the place falling voyde by the death or departure of the first, the next succeeded in his roume. This course was afterward chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into elections; but when, or by whome, hee neither doth, nor can tell. from this supposall these three conclusions are drawen, but all three farre from <hi>Ambroses</hi> speach or meaning. First, that this prioritie of place <hi>went rounde</hi> the <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> euery man taking it in order for a season, when his course came. Next, that the Priour or President for the time, which they call a Bishop, or Superuisour for his weeke, differed not in degree from the rest, but onelie in this honour to haue the chiefe place. Thirdly, that his office was to call the rest together, and to guide their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings that they shoulde bee orderlie; and to propounde matters for the whole <hi>Presbyterie</hi> to consult and conclude with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the greater number; himselfe hauing but a voyce as one of the rest, neither negatiue nor affirmatiue in any thing, but as the most part did resolue. This is the Bishop which they haue framed vs out of Saint <hi>Ambroses</hi> wordes; and this Bishop they are content shall be perpetuall in the Church of Christ, and an essentiall part of Gods ordinaunce. This is the right description of the Maior and Aldermen of a Citie, or Bailiffe and Burges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of a lesser Towne with vs in England; but this is no descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Bishop in the Church of Christ. For howe long will it bee before ye be able to prooue, I say not all, but any one of these assertions? What Scripture euer mentioned, what Father euer imagined any such Bishop?</p>
            <p>The fathers you will say, were all infected with humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and Gods institution hath euer since the Apostles time beene neglected in all the Churches, and of all the persons in the world, till of late.

            <p>
               <hi>Ambrose</hi> you say, leadeth you so to thinke; for he affirmeth that euery <hi>Presbyter</hi> was a Bishop when it came to his course, and their courses went round by order. <hi>Ambrose</hi> contradicteth it as plainely as hee can speake; and saieth, that <note n="1" place="margin">

Now if you could shew any such thing, which I am assured you cannot; yet this change from order to choice is the manifest commaundement of Gods spirite, witnessed by <hi>Paul</hi> both to <hi>Tite</hi> and <hi>Timothie.</hi> and therefore your kinde of going in order to make Bishops, was, and is repugnant to the Apostles generall and Canonicall rule of choosing the fittest men to be Bishops, which euer since hath dured in the Church of Christ as a special and expresse part of Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance confirmed by the Scriptures.</p>

               <hi>Paul made Timothie</hi> the Euangelist, both a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> and a <hi>Bishop,</hi> neither of which your discipline can abide, that either Euangelistes should bee Bishops, or that <hi>Paul</hi> should at any time consecrate Bishops. The <hi>THIRD;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is a certaine rule to distinguish Bishops from <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi> the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were many in euery Church, of whom the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> consisted. Bishops were alwayes singular; that is, one in a Citie and no moe, except an other intruded, (which the Church of Christ counted a Schisme, and would neuer communicate with any such) or else an helper were giuen in respect of extreame and feeble age; in which case, the power of the latter ceased in the presence of the former. And this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularitie of one Pastour in each place, descended from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and their Scholers in all the famous Churches of the world by a perpetuall chaire of succession, and doeth to this day continue, but where abomination or desolation, I meane heresie or violence interrupt it. Of this there is so perfect record in all the stories and Fathers of the Church, that I much muse with what face
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:2102:140"/>
men that haue any taste of learning, can denie the vocation of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops came from the Apostles. for if their succession be Apostolike, their function cannot choose, but be likewise Apostolike; and that they succeeded the Apostles and Euangelists in their Churches and chaires, may ineuitably bee prooued, if any Christian persons or Churches deserue to be credited.</p>
            <p>The second assured signe of Episcopall power, is imposition of handes to ordaine <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Bishops. for as Pastours were to haue some to assist them in their charge, which were <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters;</hi> so were they to haue others to succeed them in their places which were Bishops. And this right by imposing hands to ordaine <hi>Presbyters</hi> &amp; Bishops in the Church of Christ, was at first deriued from the Apostles vnto Bishops, and not vnto <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and hath for these fifteene hundred yeeres without example or instance to the contrarie, till this our age, remained in Bishops and not in <hi>Presbyters.

               <hi>they may discharge all Ecclesiasticall dueties in the Church. for Bishops let them care that like them.]</hi> The Councill of Carthage doeth not tell you, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> might ordaine <hi>Presbyters</hi> without a bishop; looke better to the wordes; such <hi>Presbyters</hi> as were present must holde their handes on the parties head, neere the bishops hand; but without the bishop they had no power of themselues to impose handes. Nowe to what ende they imposed handes; whether to ordaine and consecrate as well as the bishop; or because the Action was sacred and publike, to consent and blesse together, with the bishop, this is all the doubt. If they had power to ordaine as well as the bishop, and without the bishop, all the Fathers which I before cited, were vtterly deceiued. For they say no. Yea, <hi>Ierome,</hi> that neither coulde forget nor woulde suppresse (being one himselfe) anie part of their power, knewe not so much. For hee confesseth that bishops might ordaine by imposing handes, <hi>Presbyters</hi> might not. And therefore though they held their handes neere the bishops hand, yet did they not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, as the bishop did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Howe knowe you to what ende they ioyned with the Bishop in imposing handes?

            <p>
               <hi>Many things were interdicted Presbyters by the Canons, which were not by the Scriptures; but you must shew vs that Presbyters and Bishops differ by the word of God, afore we can yeeld them to be diuers degrees.]</hi> If <hi>Presbyters</hi> by the worde of God may ordaine with imposing handes as well as Bishops, howsoeuer by the custome of the Church they bee restrained or subiected vnder Bishops, they bee all one in degree with Bishops, though not in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for all other things as <hi>Ierome</hi> auoucheth are common vnto

them: but if that power be graunted by Gods Lawe to Bishops, and denied to <hi>Presbyters;</hi> then struggle whiles you will, you shall finde them in the ende to be distinct and diuers degrees.

But Colluthus himselfe died in the degree of a Presbyter, and all his imposition of handes was reuersed, &amp; such as were made by him were cast backe into the order of Laymen, and admitted to the Communion as Laymen, which is so cleere that no man euer doubted of it.</hi> They conclude that <hi>Ischyras,</hi> if he were made by <hi>Coluthus,</hi> could be no <hi>Presbyter,</hi> for so much as <hi>Coluthus</hi> was a <hi>Presbyter</hi> and no Bishop; and all his impesition of handes frustrated, and all the persons ordained by him, neither accounted nor admitted into the Church but vnder the name of Laymen. And this reuersing of <hi>Coluthus</hi> orders, and agnising none that hee ordained but for Laymen, was so cleere a case, and vncontrolled with all men, that no man euer made anie scruple of it.

By this I trust you see it pertained onely to Bishops to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine by imposition of hands, and not to <hi>Presbyters;</hi> you haue the cleere decision of the Primitiue Church, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> might not ordain <hi>Presbyters,</hi> much lesse might they lay hands on bishops.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their meaning is, that Presbyters without a Bishop coulde not impose hands; but with the Bishop they might, and did, as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Carthage which wee brought you, confirmeth.

            <p>
               <hi>They both concurre in ordaining; and neither may impose hands without the other.]</hi> You must for sake this fort, as well as you did the former. for in that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cil of Carthage, which you cite, neither is there any nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of <hi>Presbyters</hi> prefired, nor their presence requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; only this is prescribed, if any be present, they shall approue the bishops doings with laying their hands next his.

               <hi>Posthumianus a Bishop</hi> demaunded. <hi>What if a Bishop haue but one only Presbyter, must that one be taken from him? Aurelius (the Bishop of Carthage) answered. One Bishop may ordaine many Presbyters, but a Presbyter fit for a Bishopricke is hardly found. Wherefore if a man haue but one onely Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and fit for the roume of a Bishop, he ought to yeelde that one to be ordained. Posthumianus replied. Then if an other Bishop haue a number of Clearks, anothers store should relieue me. Aurelius</hi> concluded. <hi>Surely as you helped an other church, so he that hath many Clearks shal be driuen to spare you one of them to be ordained by you.</hi> Three things are euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this speech; first, that some bishops had oftentimes but one <hi>Presbyter;</hi> and he might be taken from them. Next, that a Bishop hauing no <hi>Presbyter</hi> left, might make many when he would, if he had fit men of his owne for the place. Thirdly, that if hee wanted meet men, another Church should allow him, according to his losse, some to be ordained by him. A Bishop then hauing no <hi>Presbyter</hi> left to ioyne with him, might alone ordaine both such of his owne church as were meet, and such as were sent him from other places.</p>
            <p>Againe, when any thing was done in ordering of Ministers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lawes or Canons; not the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but onely the bishop was punished for imposing his hands, and transgressing the discipline of the Church. Nowe had the <hi>Presbyters</hi> bene Agents in ordaining, as well as the bishop; no reason to let them goe free that were parties to the contempt as well as the bishop. but for that his handes did ordaine and authorize, theirs did nothing but
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2102:144"/>
allow his fact, which by dissenting they could not hinder; therefore the Lawes and Canons, as they did charge the Bishop and not the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to see those rules obserued, that were required for the making of Ministers; so they did chalenge the Bishop and no man else for violating the same with imposition of his handes, if ought were otherwise then well. And for that cause both Laws and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons speake singularly to one, not plurally to many, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse disorders in creating <hi>Presbyters</hi> &amp; Deacons; to shew there was one chiefe and principall Actor amongst them in those cases, whose fact it was; the rest only following &amp; witnessing his doings.</p>

In the <hi>4. 5.</hi> and <hi>6.</hi> generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, which was kept <hi>676.</hi> yeeres after Christ; the Bishops that succeeded in the same seates, did like wise subscribe and so hath the succession of Bishops in many places of Christendome, continued from the Apostles times to this present age. In some countreys where Christianitie is decaied, their succession of Bishops is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; otherwise, throughout the Christian world; no example before our age can be shewed that euer the Church of Christ in any place or time, since the Apostles died, had any other form of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then by Bishops succeeding and ruling as well the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as the people that were under them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our answere is easie and readie to all that you haue brought; first, the Bishops of the Primitiue Church which succeeded one another in euery place, were all one with Presbyters as Ierome telleth you; and then we graunt without exception all that you haue alleaged out of these ancient Fathers and Writers. Next, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly, if you could prooue, that Bishops were aboue other Ministers of the worde and Sacraments; yet that superioritie was nothing els, but a power to call the rest together, to propose matters in doubt vnto them, and to aske their voyces and consents, by which the Bishops of those times were directed, and from which they might by no meanes diuert to their owne wils and pleasures.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know how easie &amp; readie a thing it is with you to say what you list, if you may be trusted without any further triall; but if it please you substantiallie to prooue these things which you afffirme, or but any one of them, you shal find it is a matter of greater difficultie and longer studie then you take it for. Did you pleade before the poorest Iurie that is, for earthly trifles, they would not credite your worde without some witnesse; and in matters of religion that touch the peace &amp; safetie of the whole Church of Christ, do you looke your vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie should bee receiued without all authoritie or testimonie to warrant it? if your follie be such as to expect so much at other mens hands, their simplicitie is not such as to yeeld it. In deed to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, the summe of your answer is very like the form of your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2102:151"/>
for neither of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath any proofe, possibilitie, nor cohere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie.</p>
            <p>Toprooue the Bishops calling to be different from the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> that yet helped in the word and Sacraments; I shew that Bishops ordained ministers, which <hi>Presbyters</hi> by the iudgement and assertion of the Primitiue Church might not doe; and that in euery Church there were or might be many <hi>Presbyters</hi> according to the necessitie of the place; but no more then one Bishop in euerie Church did or might succeed the Apostles in their chaires. Hence I conclude that Bishops euer since the Apostles times, were distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from those <hi>Presbyters</hi> that assisted the Pastour of each place in the word and Sacraments. You answere that either Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were all one with <hi>Presbyters;</hi> or if there were any difference betwixt them, <hi>Presbyters</hi> then were laie Elders. In which words you close not onely a monstrous falsitie, but a manifest contrarietie. For in effect you say, <hi>Presbyters</hi> were Bishops, and no Bishops; <hi>Presbyters</hi> were no Laie men, and yet Laie men. If <hi>Presbyters</hi> were Bishops, they were no Laie Elders; if they were Laie El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they were no Bishops. You must therefore choose the one, and refuse the other as false and repugnant to the former. Take which you will, the choise must be yours, what you will answere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Bishops which succeeded the Apostles were the Pastors and ministers of euery parish; the Presbyters were the Laie Elders, that together with the Bishop gouerned the Church in common.]</hi> Could you make any proofe for laie Elders, either in Scriptures or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; you had some shew to mistake <hi>Presbyters</hi> for laie Elders; but I haue alreadie perused the weakenesse of your ghesses; and withall made iust and fullproofe for the contrarie; that the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church of Christ had no <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but ministers of the worde and Sacramentes. If you bee loth to turne backe to the place, heare what the great Affrican Councill saieth, wherein sate besides S. <hi>Augustine, 216.</hi> Bishops. <note n="1" place="margin">

            <p>As for <hi>Presbyters</hi> that were Clergie men and ministers of the word, we shew you both by the Scriptures and stories, they were many in one Church, and yet was there in euery Church and Citie, but one of them that succeeded the Apostles, as Pastour of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> place, with power to impose handes for the ordaining of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Deacons.

After euery man began to take those, whom he baptized, to be his owne &amp; not Christs; it was decreed in the whole world, that one of the Presbyters should be chosen and set aboue the rest, to whom the whole (or chiefe) care of the Church should pertaine.</hi> There were many <hi>Presbyters</hi> in euery Church, and <hi>out of them one was chosen,</hi> and <hi>set aboue the rest (of the Presbyters)</hi> to represse schismes. He doeth not say, that euery place had one <hi>Presbyter</hi> and no moe, which was called a Bishop, but <hi>one chosen out of the Presbyters (which were many) was placed in</hi> euery Church <hi>throughout the world,</hi> not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the flocke only, but <hi>ouer the rest of the Presbyters</hi> also, which preached &amp; baptized as well as he, and consequently were ministers of the word and Sacraments, and no laie Elders as you dreame.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to tell vs, that the Bishops which succeeded the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in their chaires, were the <hi>Presbyters</hi> and ministers of euery parish, is a very iest.

And so much is affirmed both by S. Austen and S. Ierome in those very places which you alleage. for the Church as they say, and not Christ or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, placed Bishops in the seates and roumes of the Apostles.]</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. <hi>Austen</hi> and S. <hi>Ierome</hi> doe say that the Church <hi>createth</hi> and <hi>placeth Bishops in the Apostles seates;</hi> they do not meane as you misconster their wordes, that the Church hath altered the fourme of the Apostolike gouernement which she receiued, and of her selfe deuised an other kinde of regiment by Bishops; that were, to charge the Church of Christ with a voluntarie defection from the Apostles discipline, and an arrogant preferring of her owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention before Gods ordinaunce. With which though some in our times can bee content to chalenge the whole Church of Christ, and euen the Apostles Coadiutors and Scholers; yet <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Ierome</hi> were farre from that humour. Their meaning is, that albeit the Apostles bee departed this life, who were worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie accounted Fathers, because they were called immediatelie by Christ himselfe to conuert and congregate his Church; yet the Church is not destitute, for so much as shee hath power from Christ to create and appoint other of her children in their places, which are Bishops. <note n="1" place="margin">

needs be confused, which should be farre from the Church of God; and gouernement there can be none, where all are equall. When the shepeheardes leade into diuers pastures, whom shall the sheepe follow? when sundrie lords make sundrie lawes, which shall the subiect obey?

            <p>This you shall neuer auoyde, doe what you can. Eche Church in the Apostles times had many <hi>Presbyters</hi> that laboured in the word.

               <hi>ouer Presbyters, who shoulde bee all one with Presbyters, and subiect to the most voyces of the Presbyters; all which things wee say, are against the Scriptures.]</hi> You frame Churches to your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and then you straight way thinke the Scriptures doe answere your deuises. If we giue Bishops any thing, which the ancient and Catholike Church of Christ did not first giue them; in Gods name spare vs not, let the world knowe it: but if we preferre the vniuersall iudgement of the Primitiue Church in expounding the Scriptures touching the power and function of bishops, before your particular and late dreames; you must not blame vs. They were neerer the Apostles times and likelier to vnderstand the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles meanings then you, that come after fifteene hundred yeres with a new plot of Church gouernment neuer heard of before. All the churches of Christ throughout the world could not at one time ioyne in one and the selfe same kind of gouernment, had it not bene deliuered and setled by the Apostles and their Schollers that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the world. So many thousand Martyrs and Saints that liued with the Apostles would neuer consent to alter the Apostles discipline, which was once receiued in the Church, without the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles warrant. Wherefore we conster the Apostles writings by their doings; you measure the Scriptures after your owne humours. Whether of vs twayne is most likelie to hitte the trueth?</p>
            <p>As for your repining at the things which we giue to bishops; we greatly regard it not, so long as the Scriptures doe not contradict them; wee smile rather at your deuises, which say that a bishop should gouerne for a weeke, and then change, and giue place to the next <hi>Presbyter</hi> for an other weeke; and so round by course to all the <hi>Presbyters.</hi> What Scripture confirmeth that circular and weekely regiment of yours? By what authoritie do you giue it the name of a diuine institution, when it is a meere imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours without proofe or trueth? She we one example or authoritie for it in the newe Testament, and take the cause.</p>

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2102:159"/>
this slender and single similitude to make Gods ordinance what please you: If such reasons may serue, we can sooner conclude the perpetual function of bishops then you can the weekly. for not onely the high Priest kept his honour during his life, but likewise euery Priest that was chiefe of his order. Indeede their courses being ended, they departed home, but they lost not their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But what rouing is this in matters of weight: Will anie wise men be mooued with such ghesses: Make vs good proofe out of the Scriptures; or leaue tying Gods ordinance to your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.</p>

               <hi>Ambrose is the man that affirmeth it.]</hi> If you come once to Fathers, I hope we haue tenne to one, that affirme otherwise. If <hi>Ambrose</hi> did say so, wee coulde not beleeue him against all the rest of the Fathers, yea, and against the Scriptures themselues, election of Bishops being prescribed by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Tite,</hi> and not succession in order; but I denie that <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith anie such thing. <hi>He saieth the next in order succeeded.]</hi> He nameth neither change nor course.

Your <hi>Presbyteries</hi> must consist either of lay men aloue, or of clergy men only, or of both indifferently. If of Lay Elders only, who shall succeede the Pastour in the ruling thereof when his course is ended, for example as you say, when his weeke is out: His Presidentship must be perpetual which by your rules is against Gods ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vnles you will haue the lay Elders in course to do pastoral duties, &amp; rule pastor &amp; al, which is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surde and more against Gods Law then the former. Wil you mixe your <hi>Presbyteries</hi> of both: then yet by Gods law as your selues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, one Pastor must be chiefe of the rest of the Pastors, and if by the Scriptures his superioritie must be perpetuall; as after his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:2102:160"/>
election it must be; what differeth this chiefe Pastour for his life from a bishop? you would limit his gouernement to a weeke or a moneth; but where doth <hi>Paul</hi> so? shew vs that rule in Scripture or Father, and set vp your Lay <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> If not, you walke in the wildernesses of your own fansies, &amp; you would prescribe vs rules of your owne making in place of Gods ordinance; which is dangerous to your selues, and iniurious to others, if it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous against God.</p>

It is an essential and perpetual part of Gods ordinance, that one should be chiefe ouer the <hi>Presbyterie.</hi> But the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> of eche Church and City, (where the Apostles preached) consisted of Clergie men and Preachers. I hope then it is Gods ordinance to haue one chiefe ouer the Preachers and Labourers in ech Church. And if election be Gods commandement, as you also confesse, and consequently the Electee once lawfully placed must not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without iust and apparant defects; I trust the chiefe Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Preachers and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of eche Church, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue whiles he liueth and ruleth well. for as hee was chosen for his worthinesse, so may he not be depriued till he proue vnworthy. Now a chiefe Ruler or Pastour ouer the people and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of eche Citie, elected by Gods commaundement to continue that charge so long as hee doeth his duetie, commeth as neere to the bishops calling which we maintaine, as your head to that which is aboue your shoulders.</p>
            <p>If youthwart vs with Lay Elders; we haue this faire Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas for them. First prooue them, then place them where you will. If you talke of going round by course; it is the order of good fellowes at a feast; it was neuer the order of gouerning in the Church of Christ. The Priestes of the olde Lawe were after a time eased of their paines, but neuer changed their prerogatiues. If you say they differ not in degree, but in honour and dignitie
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:2102:160"/>
from the rest, I haue alreadie prooued that singularity in succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apostles, and necessitie in ordaining, distinguith them from <hi>Presbyters.</hi> If you quarrell with their iurisdiction and dioceses, the place now serueth to discusse those things, forsomuch as wee finde their function was deliuered them by the Apostles, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The shute Anker is, if all this were so; that the power of Bishops by Gods law should be nothing else but a right to call the Presbyters of eche place together, and to aske their voices, and performe what the most part decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But your pleasures, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you were more indifferent, are little regarded, the Church of Christ more then foureteene hundred yeeres before you were borne, hath considered of their power and charge; the Councils both prouinciall and generall are extant to decide the doubt. But if you will trie their right by the Scriptures, I am wel content, so you take to your <hi>Presbyteries</hi> no more then you can iustifie to be theirs; and leaue vnto Bishops that interest which wee prooue by the word to belong to their calling.</p>

            <p>The bishop then; or President of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> (for I stand not on names whiles I discusse their powers) is by Christs owne mouth proneunced to bee the Angell of the Church; that is, the chiefe Steward ouer Gods housholde, and ouerseer of his flocke; and the authoritie that hee hath in the Church is <hi>Pastorall</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:2102:163"/>
and <hi>Paternal,</hi> euen the same that hath continued in the church since the beginning of the world. This fatherly kinde of regiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the Patriarks, dured in the Priests and Prophets of <hi>Moses</hi> Lawe; was deriued to the Apostles, and so descended to the chiefe Pastours of Christs church to this day; who are to be honored and obeyed in the word and Sacraments as Fathers, of all their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. This power and honour I trust is so tolerable and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that you dare not spurne against it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If you did not giue it onely to them, and take it from all others, wee would not gaine say it, so much as we doe.]</hi> That which is common to euery Pastour in regard of those that are vnder them, cannot be denyed the chiefe, to whose ouersight and charge the whole church in euerie place is committed. If you thinke the name of Pastour cannot be common to many in one and the same Church, then the bishop must be Pastour alone: for he is the Angel of Gods Church. If the pastorall charge may be common to many, then must he haue it chiefly and aboue all, because he is Gods Angell and superior to all. You remember your owne positions; it is Gods essentiall and perpetuall ordinance that one shoulde be chiefe as well ouer <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> as people. He cannot be chiefe in the <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> but he must be chiefe in the Church; and consequently if the <hi>Presbyters</hi> be Pastours, he is chiefe Pastour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We giue him no power but to moderate the meetings, and execute the decrees of the Presbyters. That we are well content the Bishop shall enioy; but further we giue him none.]</hi> Blessed are your <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> that must haue their betters to execute their decrees: but I pray you sirs, for Gods decrees, who shall execute them? Must the <hi>Presbyters</hi> voyces be asked before Gods Lawes shalbe executed? Take heede not of tyrannicall, but of Satanicall pride, if Gods will shal not take place in your Churches, till the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> be assembled and agreed. You haue prouided a president to execute your owne pleasures; now let God haue one amongst you to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Execution in all things we reserue to him that is chiefe. for as to consult and decree a number is fittest; so to execute that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, one is the surest; lest if execution be committed to many, their excusing themselues one on another, or dissenting from eche other, do hinder the whole.]</hi> You beginne to be wise. The honour to

determine you keepe to your selues, the paines to execute you lay on your chiefe Ruler; to make him the gladder to be rid of his office, that another by course may succeede in his roume. And so where by Gods ordinance you must haue one chiefe, you take such order with him, that he shal neuer be willing to stay long in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wee doe it to preuent ambition in such as woulde seeke for the highest place.]</hi> You decrease the ambition of one that shoulde be highest, and increase the pride of an hundred that should be lowest. for where wee haue one bishop in a Diocese tied to the Lawes of God, the Church and the Prince; you woulde haue three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in a Diocese, in some more, all of equall power, and set at libertie to consult and determine of al matters at their pleasures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We subiect our Presbyteries to the Lawes of God, the Church, and the Realme, as well as you doe your Bishops; and giue them no leaue to resist or reuerse the decrees of any superiour powers.]</hi> You doe well; For when the God of heauen hath declared his will; or the Church by her prouinciall or generall Councils determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doubts, and made rules; or Christian Magistrates by their Lawes redressed and ordered things amisse; besides the lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se of your paines it were more then pride for your <hi>Presbyters</hi> in their assemblies to consult afresh, and bring the selfe same things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the question. What is decreed by superiours, must not by inferiours be debated, whether it shall take place or no; but be rather obeyed with readinesse. So that in all cases determined by the Lawes of God, the Church, or the Prince, consultation is both superfluous and presumptuous; execution is onely needefull; and that must be committed to some persons that may precisely be chalenged and punished for the contempt; if that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded be not performed. now whom appoint you to execute the decrees of God, the Church, and the prince? The whole <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie?</hi> Then vpon the not execution of Gods or mans Lawe by any one <hi>Prebyter,</hi> all must be punished, aswell innocent as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, diligent as negligent. The blame must lie on all, where the charge is in common. Were you but once or twise well follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for other mens faultes, you woulde soone ware weary of this generall and confused execution. And though you woulde not, yet neither the equity nor prudency of Gods or mans Lawes endure that wandering kinde of execution. they note and specifie the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2102:164"/>
persons that shall haue the charge and ouersight to execute their decrees; that vpon any neglect or defect the right offendours may be chalenged. And since to auoide confusion and preuent delayes you committe the execution of your owne decrees to the care and circumspection of your President; what cause can there be why the lawes of God, the Church and the Prince should not like wise be executed by the bishop or chiefe Pastour of eche place: There can be no doubt but the Canons of Councils and Lawes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian princes touching Church causes, from the Aposiles age to ours, haue bene committed to Episcopall audience and execution; the question is for Gods Law, who shoulde be trusted with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution thereof. And who rather say we, then hee that is authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by God to be the Angel of his Church and steward of his house; at whose mouth the rest should aske the Law, and be rather subiect vnto him, then perch ouer him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The execution of Gods Lawe by no meanes wee grant to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; for then wee yeelde him all; but in that case, though ech Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter be inferiour to him, yet the whole Presbyterie is aboue him, and may both ouer-rule him and censure him.]</hi> That is as much as if you had said; when the sheepe list to agree, I will not say, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, they must leade their sheepeheard; and when the children are wilfull, they must rule their father. Otherwise, if the bishop be Pastor and father to eche <hi>Presbyter,</hi> hee is the like to the whole <hi>Presbyterie;</hi> &amp; consequently they must heare &amp; obey him as Gods Angel, so long as he keepeth within the bounds of his message.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nay, euery Presbyter is a Pastour and Father as well as the Bishop and equall with him, neither hath hee by Gods Lawe any right ouer them, but onely by mans deuise.]</hi> Fie on this wauering. <hi>Sometimes</hi> the Bishop shall bee chiefe ouer the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> by Gods essentiall and perpetuall ordinance; <hi>Sometimes</hi> againe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie <hi>Presbyter</hi> shall bee equall and euen with him, and hee not chiefe ouer them; and <hi>when</hi> you are a little angrie, hee shall bee subiect vnto them and bee censured by them. This tapesing to and fro I impute rather to the rawnesse of your discipline not yet digested, then to the giddinesse of your heades. This it is to wander in the desert of your owne deuises without the line of Gods worde, or leuell of his Church to direct you. But can you shewe vs by what authoritie you claime this power of your
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:2102:164"/>
               <hi>Presbyteries</hi> aboue and against their Bishops? if by Scriptures, produce them; if by Fathers, then shrinke not from them, when they tell you on the other side what power the Bishop had, &amp; should haue ouer his <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wee haue both Scriptures and Fathers, but specially Scriptures. First, the Apostles Peter and Paul acknowledge the Presbyters to be Pastours, and giue them the feeding, ouerseeing and ruling the flock. Next, the Presbyterie did excommunicate the incestuous Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and imposed hands on Timothie. Thirdlie, they are the Church, which if a man heare not, he must bee taken for a Publicane and an Ethnike by Christes commandement. Fourthly, the common wealth of Israel had apparantly that kind of gouernment which Christ and his Apostles did not alter. Lastly, the fathers confesse the Churches at first were gouerned with the common counsell of the Presbyters, and without their aduise nothing was done in the Church.]</hi> These be the fortes of your late erected Consistorie; if these be taken from you, you haue no place left whither your maimed discipline may retreat: and these are most easilie razed to the ground in order as they stand.</p>
            <p>For <hi>FIRST,</hi> the same power which you claime by <hi>Peters</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> words, vnto <hi>Presbyters</hi> as Pastours in respect of the flocke committed to their trust; you must yeeld vnto Bishops as chiefe Pastors in comparison both of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and people; and so you prooue against your selues, for the Bishop is as well chiefe in the Church, where he is Gods Angel; as in the Consistorie, where hee gouerneth the <hi>Presbyterie. NEXT,</hi> you cannot conuince that the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> did either excommunicate the malefactor of Corinth, or lay hands on <hi>Timothie;</hi> I haue cleared the inferments of both places before. And if you could conclude any such thing, which you cannot; yet most apparantly the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> with his owne mouth <note n="1" place="margin">

            <p>All that wee can say for the power of Bishops aboue <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> out of the Scriptures, is this: That the holie Ghost by the mouth of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> hath giuen the Bishop of each place authoritie to <hi>ordaine</hi> such as be woorthie, to <hi>examine</hi> such as be faultie, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue</hi> and <hi>discharge</hi> such as be guiltie either of vnsound teaching, or offensiue liuing.

See you how easilie the very foundations of your Prelacie are shaken and ouer throwen.]</hi> If your replie be sound, you say somewhat to the purpose; but if it be false, absurd, repugnant to the very Text, and refuted by your own positions, then take you heed, what answere you will make to God for disturbing his Church, despising his ordinance, and deriding his messengers, that himselfe hath placed and authorized with his own mouth. And here I must pray the Christian Reader aduisedlie to marke what is said and answered on either side. This in deed is the maine erection of the Episcopal power and function, if our proofes stand; or subuersion, if your answere be good. For if this faile, wel may Bishops claime their authoritie by the custome of the Church; by any diuine precept expressed in the scriptures, they cannot. But if these rules be deltuered by the Apostle to Bishops, as we say, they are; and not to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Tite in respect of their</hi> Euangelship, as the <hi>Presbyterists</hi> affirme; then can there be no question but this new discipline is a very dreame; and the auncient and Primitiue Church of Christ held the right and Apostolicall fourme of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the house of God according to the prescript of his word. Out reioinder therefore is as foloweth.</p>
            <p>No power proper to Euangelists, is, or ought to be perpetual in the Church of Christ; their calling was both extraordinarie, and temporarie. but power to ordaine fit ministers, to conuent and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge vnfit, is, and ought to be perpetuall in the Church of Christ. This therefore was no power proper to Euangelists, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> in these places prescribed vnto <hi>Tite</hi> and <hi>Timothie.</hi> Againe, your <hi>Presbyters</hi> may not claime Euangelisticall power, since your <hi>Presbyters</hi> are no Euangelists; but your <hi>Presbyteries</hi> claime this power, which <hi>Paul</hi> here committeth to <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Tite,</hi> euen to ordaine, examine, censure and depriue Pastours and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; <hi>ergo,</hi> this power was not proper to Euangelists.

               <hi>Presbytericall</hi> power on a place, that hath so many sound and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient answeres as this hath. First, <hi>Ierome, Ambrose, Primasius</hi> and <hi>Caluine</hi> tell you the worde <hi>(Presbyterie)</hi> signifieth in that place the degree and function which <hi>Timothie</hi> receiued, not the Colledge and number of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Next, <hi>Chrysostome, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorete, Oecumenius,</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi> tell you, that <hi>Paul</hi> by the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> meant the Bishops (their names at first being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:) for that <hi>Presbyters</hi> might not laie handes on a Bishop, such as <hi>Timothie</hi> was. Thirdlie, the Scriptures tell you that the Apostles, Euangelists, Prophetes, and the seuentie disciples were of the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> in the first Church; and they might well impose hands on <hi>Timothie</hi> without any <hi>Presbyters.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth you, as <hi>Caluine</hi> well obserueth and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, that himselfe and none others laied handes on <hi>Timothie.</hi> Lastlie, your selues say <hi>Timothie</hi> was an Euangelist, which function and vocation the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> of no particular Church could giue him, but onely the Apostles. What power had the Church of Iconium or Ephesus to make Euangelists, I meane such as should accompanie the Apostles, and assist them in their trauailes? If you trust neither Scriptures nor Fathers; for shame trust your selues and your owne positions. Howe shall other men beleeue your assertions, when your selues doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them? If <hi>Timothie</hi> were an Euangelist, they must be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and no <hi>Presbyters</hi> that imposed handes on him. If the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie</hi> of any particular Church imposed hands on him, <hi>Timothie</hi> must be a Bishop, and haue a locall charge in some Church; which you impugne vnder pretence of his Euangelship. Choose which yyu will, so you choose some what, and stand to it whrn you haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen it. Were they <hi>Presbyters</hi> or no, that imposed hands on <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie?</hi> If they were, yet they did it iointlie with <hi>Paul;</hi> and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Apostle or his successor, <hi>Presbyters</hi> may not impose hands, and then must <hi>Timothie</hi> be a Bishop when <hi>Paul</hi> wrate vnto him; for <hi>Presbyters</hi> could not make him an Euangelist. Were they no <hi>Presbyters</hi> but Apostles, or others of higher calling? Then maketh this place nothing for the power of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> either to ordaine or depriue ministers of the word and Sacramentes; and setting this aside, what one iote finde you in the Scriptures concerning your <hi>Presbyteries?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:2102:168"/>
The conclusion is. We shew you substantiall and full proofe, that <hi>TIMOTHIE AND HIS SVCCESSOVRS</hi> are charged by <hi>Paul</hi> to obserue these precepts of the holy Ghost in the Church of Christ for euer; touching the admitting of fit ministers, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of vnfit. Thence we inferre, this power must be perpetuall in Bishops, for they succeed <hi>Timothie</hi> in the Church; the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> doe not. On the other side you claime this authoritie from Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to your <hi>Presbyteries;</hi> but you cannot prooue either their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession from <hi>Timothie,</hi> or ioint commission with <hi>Timothie,</hi> by any sentence or syllable in the Scriptures. That they should feede and watch the flocke; you vrge, and we graunt; in teaching and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they were ioyned with <hi>Timothie,</hi> by reason the labourers must of force be many, where the haruest was so great, as in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times: but in ordaining and gouerning the Teachers, as there was no need of many, so is there no precept for many, least by the multitude of Rulers, order should be rather confused then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. Wherefore as <hi>Timothie</hi> was placed at Ephesus, and <hi>Tite</hi> in Creete, to ordaine, moderate and rebuke, as well <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as people; so was <hi>Archippus</hi> at Colossus, so were the seuen Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours in the seuen Churches of Asia, to whom the sonne of God wrate by S. <hi>Iohns</hi> penne; so in all the Apostolike Churches, were Apostolike men throughout the Christian world left to guide and gouerne the Churches of Christ with like power, and to leaue the same to their successours for euer. And this our construction and exposition of of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words to <hi>Timothie,</hi> the learned and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers confirme with one consent, and the Catholike Church of Christ, hath continued and performed in all ages and places since the Apostles deaths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meane you that Bishops alone might doe what they would without the knowledge or consent of their Presbyters?]</hi> My meaning is soone understood. You establish one chiefe in your <hi>Presbyteries</hi> by Gods essentiall and perpetuall ordinaunce, to execute that which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; whom you call your President. How farre I ioyne with you, you shall quickly perceiue. To auoyd tumults and dissentions, God hath authorized one in each place, and Church able, to haue &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> who with Pastorall and fatherly moderation, should guide as well the <hi>Presbyters</hi> that assist him, as the people that are subiect to him according to the lawes of God and man; the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:2102:168"/>
execution whereof is chieflie committed to his charge, that is the Leader and ouersee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of all the rest; whom wee call a Bishop. His power I call a moderation and not a domination, because the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God hath likewise allowed and prouided Christian meanes as well to bridle him from wrongs, as to direct him in doubts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That is right the power which we giue to our Presbyteries.]</hi> Did you not put laie men instead of Pastours, to bee <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and make them controllers, where they should bee but aduisers; your <hi>Presbyteries</hi> might haue some vse in the Church of God, though farre lesse now, then when they first began: but your disdaining Bishops and taking from them that which the Apostle giueth them, and your ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I finde many vses of <hi>Presbyteries</hi> ordained in Cities by the Apostles, and after by them conioined in one Church with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; whereof some are extinguished by the alteration of times, others remaine in force to this day. The first was the conuersion of the world vnto Christ. In great Cities where none yet belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, how long would it be before one man should gain any great number vnto the faith; persecutions especiallie growing so hote, that none might publikely shew himselfe to bee a Christian with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of life?

might disperse it selfe not onely throughout their Cities, but into the Townes and countries that bordered neere them.</p>
            <p>The next vse of <hi>Presbyteries</hi> was to continue such as they had conuerted, by instructing, exhorting and encouraging the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers from house to house, and from man to man, to stand fast in the doctrine receiued, and neither to shrinke at the bloudie stormes of tyrants, nor to giue eare to the wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e charmes of Satan, nor fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the deceitfull baites of this world; but constantly, with trueth and holinesse to serue God, in spite of all aduersaries that exalted themselues against the knowledge of Christ. And as the people did encrease, so did the paines in each place, and consequently the number of <hi>Presbyters;</hi> one man being no more able to serue the necessities of a great Citie, then to beare the burden of the earth on his backe. Wherefore the spirite of wisedome so gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Church; that to procure the conuersion, and attend the saluation of men, there was euery where, (as occasion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) store of Pastours and Teachers; and yet to mainetaine vnitie, and keepe both Preachers and people in peace, there was in each Church and Citie, one chiefe amongst them, that as principall Pastour of the place, looked into all their doings, staied them from dissentions, rebuked the vnrulie, and with the helpe of the rest reiected the vntollerable: least many Teachers by chalenging vnto themselues such as they had conuertes, should rent the faithfull into as many Churches as there were <hi>Presbyters</hi> in euerie Citie, for which cause, each place, were it neuer so great, had but one Church, and one chiefe Pastour or Bishop elected to succeed in the Pastorall charge and chaire aboue the rest that were his brethren in office, children in honour, helpers in labour, and assessours in counsell and iudgement.</p>
            <p>The third vse, was the trapning vp and trying of men that were meete to haue the care of soules committed vnto them, and the regiment of the Church reposed on them. At first, the wonderfull power of the holy Ghost supplied all wantes and defectes of learning and knowledge, so that by the laying on of the Apostles handes, men afore vnfit were made meete mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the newe Testament: but because these giftes were not alwayes to continue, or not in so plentifull maner as at the Prime tide of the Gospell; the Apostles setled in euery Church
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:2102:170"/>
and Citie, needing their seruice, and able to giue them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, by reason of the populousnesse of the place, a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,</hi> that is, a conuenient number of Deacons to serue about diuine matters and mysteries, and of Pastours to intend for the word and Sacraments. from whence as from a fountaine, both the Cities themselues might at all times after haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men to furnish their owne turnes, and to helpe the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Townes and Uillages within their circuite, which for the slendernesse of their state, could neither maintaine <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> nor nourish vp meete men to supplie their neede vpon the death of the former Incumbents. This to vs that haue Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities for that purpose founded by the bounteousnes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes and other benefactours, may seeme superfluous; but the Church of Christ after her first supplie made by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles handes, had no meanes to continue the succession of fitte and able Pastours in each place, but onely her <hi>Presbyteries</hi> in greater Churches and Cities, that were her nurceries of learning, and Seminaries of sound religion and holy conuersation; which stored both the Cities where they were supported, and the countrey round about, that was vnder the charge and ouersight of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of each Citie.</p>
            <p>The fourth vse of <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> which you much grate on, but neuer rightlie hit, was the aduising and assisting the Bishop or Pastour of each Church and Citie in all doubts and dangers. At first there were no Councils to make Canons, nor Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to establish lawes for the good guiding and ordering of the Church; but each place was left to direct it selfe. Least there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bishops onely will should bee the rule of all things in the Church; the gouernement of the Church was at first so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, that neither the <hi>Presbyters</hi> should doe any thing without their Bishop; nor the Bishop dispose matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce without his <hi>Presbyterie.</hi> The <hi>Presbyters</hi> sate not with the Bishop as equall in power with him, much lesse as superiour aboue him, when the more part consented agaynst him; you would faine haue it so: but the Church of Christ, from the Apostles to this present, neuer vsed or endured any such presumption.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That disposition which hee calleth diuine, wee seeke torestore.]</hi> By pretence of those wordes, you proclaime your owne deuises vnder the title of Gods ordinance. Otherwise, the charge that <hi>Paul</hi> giueth <hi>Timothie,</hi> maketh stronglie for Bishops against your <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries;</hi> but that we interprete his wordes by the practise of the Church; and thereby conceiue, that though the chiefe power and care were committed to Bishops; yet their <hi>Presbyteries</hi> were not excluded. for as then Bishops had no meanes to bee directed or assisted, but onely their <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> Afterwards, when vpon the generall preuailing of the Gospell on the face of the earth, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes began to assemble; and the Pastors of diuers Churches v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by letters and meetings to conferre about such orders and rules as they thought needfull to bee obserued in all their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> of euery particular place had more leasure and leaue to play, by reason prouinciall Councils vndertooke the debating and resoluing of those doubts and difficulties that before troubled the <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> And as you tie your President to the execution of such things as your <hi>Presbyters</hi> shall decree; so the Primitiue Church of Christ had greater reason and better ground
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:2102:172"/>
to binde her Bishops to see those things perfourmed, which were concluded by generall assent of the Bishops and Pastours of any Prouince, Where you may see, vpon what occasion, the power of <hi>Presbyteries</hi> first decreased, not that Bishops wrongfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croched on their liberties, and violentlie ouer-mastered them; but what things were before handled and debated in the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> of each place, came nowe to be discussed and concluded in the Synodes and full assemblies of all the Bishops and Pastours of one kingdome or Countrey. So that Synodes in consultation and determination of all ecclesiastical griefes and causes, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the Primitiue Church of Christ, as Courtes of greater iudgement, higher power, better experience and more indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then <hi>Presbyteries;</hi> and if malice doe not blinde you, you will confesse the same.</p>
            <p>Was it possible to finde in any <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> so many graue, wise, learned, and sufficient men as in a Prouince: In <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> affections and factions mightilie preuaile, by reason men that liue together vpon liking or disliking, soone linke togither: In Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes where all were strangers to themselues and to the parties, no such thing could be feared. In <hi>Presbyteries</hi> it was easie for the Bishop to haue his forth, for that the rest were subiect vnto him, and might many wayes be displeased by him, if he would seek reuenge: In Synodes they were all his brethren and equals, no way in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him, and therefore the more likelie to bee sincere and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Iudges. And as for authoritie, I trust your selues doe not meane in euery Parish to erect a Pope and a Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, from whom there shall be no appeale, of whose wrongs there shall be no redresse, whose censures must stand indissoluble; that were of all tyrannies the most intollerable. In all Christian socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the whole of like power and calling is greater then any part; and a Prouince must bee respected before a Parish. Wherefore <hi>Presbyteries</hi> must yeeld to Synodes; and the Bishop of each place is more bound to regard and execute Synodal then <hi>Presbyterall</hi> decrees.</p>
            <p>This whiles you marke not, you imagine the whole Church of Christ conspired against <hi>Presbyters</hi> to suppresse them, &amp; to change the Apostolicall forme of regiment; where in deed the decrees of Councils and lawes of Christian princes moderating and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:2102:172"/>
all those doubts and questions which before were examined in <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> caused them to bee lesse needed and lesse regarded then before; and charged the Bishop with the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all lawes and Canons, without assembling or consulting his <hi>Presbyters;</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Courts not submitting their acts to the iudgement of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour officers. Wherefore, when you raile at Bishops as vsurpers and tyrants ouer their brethren, you forget that after so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeres, all things being setled and guided by lawes, which your <hi>Presbyteries</hi> neither may reuerse, nor can correct; your Elders were as good spare their paines, as loose their labours. More lawes we need not, better you cannot make; no man that hath his right wits will choose to liue vnder the discretion of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then vnder the prescript of written lawes. Frustrate them when you will to make worke for your Consistories, and you shall find greater difference betwixt the equitie and certaintie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and the affectionate and inconstant headinesse of your <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We would change no lawes, but such as are Popish; and where now the Bishop alone doeth all, we would ioyne the Presbyterie with him.]</hi> The lawes that vpheld the Popes superstition or vsurpation are alreadie abrogated, thanks be to God; the rest that agree with the Canons of the Primitiue Church, if you seeke to dissolue, I would wish you did publish the new, that men might see them before you did exauthorate the olde, least you make the people as lawlesse as your <hi>Presbyters.</hi> It is easier to euert or disturbe, then to plant or establish a Church or common wealth. If you take not the same lawes againe, I dare warrant your childrens children to the fourth generation, shall see neither order nor peace in your Churches. And as for ioyning <hi>Presbyters</hi> with the Bishop to execute lawes, that is the way to multiplie Bishops, and where we haue one, to make vs twentie; but that is not the way to haue lawes more spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie or sincerely executed. In a multitude, diuersitie of opinions breedeth delaies, &amp; hindereth execution; in one it cannot; and if each man be subiect to affections, I hope the more, the worse. But what reason we whether one or many shall execute the lawes, when it is not in our hands to limite the law-makers to our choice: They that haue power from God to make lawes, haue like wise authoritie &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to choose who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wil charge w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their lawes;
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2102:173"/>
and therefore in Gods name, let both Councils and Princes choose what persons they thinke meetest to see their Canons and Lawes obserued; so long as they transgresse not the rules of pietie and equitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our chiefest care is for the right execution of Gods law; which we would not haue committed to the Bishop without his Presbyters.]</hi> Giue the Bishop that right and authoritie which Gods law allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, and the ioine with him, whom you can. <hi>What right is that?]</hi> You heard before. he must haue Pastorall and Paternall power; either wholie, if by Gods lawe there may be but one Pastor in one Church; or chieflie, if there may bee more in the same place to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise and assist hun in gouerning the flock. More authoritie by Gods law we claime not for Bishops, then to be Pastours of the places which they gouerne. And Pastorall authoritie since you giue to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Rector in his Church, what reason haue you to denie it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Bishop in his Diocesse?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We giue no man Pastorall power ouer the Presbyteries; and as for Diocesses, wee say they are intrusions on other mens cures.]</hi> If by Gods lawe you assigne one Church to one man as Pastour of the same; then all the members of that Church, be they <hi>Presbyters</hi> or people, must be subiect to him as to their Pastour, and he must haue Pastorall authoritie ouer them, whatsoeuer they be. And therefore this shift of yours, that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> shall haue a President ouer them by Gods ordinance, but no Pastour, is a meere collusion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant as well to the worde as Church of God. for what doe the Scriptures call your President in respect of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> if not a Pastour: Shew vs either his name or his power in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; and if it be not equiualent with Pastorall, wee will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt your <hi>Presbyters</hi> from all subiection. The power that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> receiued, to restraine them from preaching false doctrine, and to conuent and rebuke such <hi>Presbyters</hi> as sinned, was it not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall? And that charge was to remaine by the Apostles words, to him and his successors till the comming of Christ. Your Pastours that you would erect in countrey parishes, shall they not haue Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall power ouer your laie <hi>Presbyters?</hi> shall your laie Elders be sheepe without ashepeheard? shal no man watch ouer their soules? If your laie <hi>Presbyteries</hi> must haue a Pastour ouer them in each countrey parish, how commeth it to passe that your <hi>Presbyteries</hi>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:2102:173"/>
in Cities may endure no Pastours aboue them? Are they not all of one and the same institution by your owne rules? Is there one order in the Scriptures for rusticall <hi>Presbyteries;</hi> and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ciuill? I thinke your selues ran hardly shewe any such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction. Wherefore when we giue bishops Pastorall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as well ouer their <hi>Presbyters</hi> as ouer their people, wee doe it by the warrant of Gods word, that maketh them chiefe Pastours ouer their Churches, which includeth both <hi>Presbyters</hi> and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and wee therein giue them no more then by your wils you would giue to the meanest Rectors of countrie parishes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pastours we are content they shalbe ouer their flockes, but not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their coequals and copartners.]</hi> Then no man may take or leade their flockes from them, so long as they teach and guide them right: and consequently your <hi>Presbyters</hi> may vse no Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power in any bishops charge without his liking. For he is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour of the flocke; and by Gods law they must heare and obey the voice of their shepeheard. And as for the rest of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> if you make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> copartners with him; that is, not helpers, but equals; you distract the flocke, and rent the Church into as many peeces as there be pastors. One flocke cannot haue many pastors, except they be subordinate one vnder another: but many pastors of equal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er must needs haue many flocks. Wherfore one Church must haue but one pastor, to whom therest, be they <hi>Presbyters</hi> or others, must by Gods Law be subiect and obedient, whiles he rightly directeth them, and woorthely rebuketh them; otherwise against God and his trueth, we must obey neither man nor Angell. Yet to temper the Pastourall power of bishops that it might be fatherly, as it hath beene alwaies in the house of God euen from the beginning; and not <hi>Princely,</hi> for feare of raigning ouer the Lords inheritance; the Church of Christ did in certaine cases of importance not suffer the bishop to attempt any thing without the consent of his <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> or a Synode.

True it is that the frequencie of Synodes, did first rebate the credite and decaie the vse of <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> For when the bishops of eche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, as by the generall Councils of Nice and Chalcedon they were bound, met twise euerie yeere, to heare and moderate Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall griefes and causes; <hi>Presbyters</hi> were lesse regarded, and lesse emploied then before, Synodes, as superiour Iudges entring into the examination and decision of those things, which were wont to be proposed in <hi>Presbyteries.</hi> And when priuat quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels &amp; questions increasing, Synodes began to be tired with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall sitting about such matters, and the bishops of most Churches to be detained from their cures and attend the debating &amp; deciding of griefs &amp; displeasures betwixt man and man, the burden grew so intollerable, that Synodes were forced to settle an appeale fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bishop to the Metropolitane; &amp; commit it to the care of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, what causes were fit for Synodall cognition.

               <hi>We decree that Presbyters, Deacons, and other inferiour Cleargie men, if in any matters they finde themselues agreeued with the iudgements of their own Bishops; the Bishops that are neerest shall giue them audience. And if they thinke good to appeale from them, they shall not appeale to the Tribunals beyond the Seas, but to the Primates of their owne Prouince, euen as wee haue often decreed of Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Canons did not establish but represse tyrannicall power in bishops, if any did assert it, and required the bishop before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against <hi>Presbyter</hi> or Deacon, to take vnto him assessours of the neerest bishops, such as the parties conuented should demand; and if they coulde not ende the cause with the liking of both sides, then the Primate to haue the hearing of it, and lastlie, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, if either parte woulde appeale from the Primate. Thus did the Bishops of the Primitiue Church order the hearing of causes within their prouinces, neither prowdly nor Antichristianly, but in my iudgement, soberly and wisely referred them from the Bishop to the Primate; thereby to ripen causes, and search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the trueth of eche complaint, with a great deale lesse trouble and no lesse indifferencie, then if it had bene immediatly brought to the Councill.</p>
            <p>And were you as moderate as you be resolute, you woulde perceiue what a tedious labour it is, and in our State superfluous for a Synode of Bishops to sit all a yeere long hearing priuate griefes, complaints and contentions, If you be so desirous of it, I would you were for a while fast tied to it, that you might learne to be wise; you would bee the willinger as long as you liued to let courts alone, and spend your time better then in examinations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and exceptions of witnesses. Howbeit in our realme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you change all your Ecclesiasticall lawes, I see not how Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes or <hi>Presbyteries</hi> should intermeddle with any such matters. for how shal your <hi>Presbyters</hi> iudge? by discretion, or by law?

            <p>
               <hi>Your Bishops are no such great Lawyers.]</hi> And therefore they haue the more neede of Chancellors and Registers that are better acquainted with the Lawes then themselues are, and as for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales, vnlesse you looke to treade gouernement vnder your feet, and ouer-rule all things by the meere motions of your owne wils, though they sometimes aduantage offendours, yet were they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to protect innocents, and are Christian remedies to do eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man right that thinketh he hath wrong. They doe not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Antichristian pride of bishops; there can bee none other, nor better waie to represse it, then by appeale to bring the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all their Courts and Officers to bee tried and examined by the princes power and delegates, which I trust you take to bee no tyrannie.

referred to the wisedome and consideration of the State;) you dislike that a Bishop should haue any Diocese at all or gouerne any Church besides that one wherein he teacheth and administreth the Sacraments. which nice conceit of yours not onely condemneth the whole primitiue Church of Christ that assigned Dioceses vnto bishops, but contradicteth the verie grounds and examples of that gouernement which the Apostles left behind them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Did the Apostles appoint Dioeceses for Bishops? that were newes indeede.]</hi> No such newes, but that your owne Principles wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the same. for what order say you did the Apostles leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them to gouerne the Church? Did they trust one Pastour or <hi>Presbyter</hi> alone in eche place to doe as hee thought good? Or else did they prouide direction and assistance in dangerous and doubtful cases to guide him and helpe him in the gouernement of the church? The power of one man in ech church to doe what he will be he Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour or <hi>Presbyter,</hi> your selues affirme is Antichristian and diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. And I thinke you say trueth, if he will haue neither associats to restraine him, nor superiours to ouerlooke him. That were to plant a Pope in euerie parish, with plenitude of power to do what pleaseth himselfe. What you detest in Bishops, I hope you will not endure in the <hi>Presbyter</hi> or Pastour of euery parish church in the Countrey; that hee shall take vpon him alone to guide his flocke as hee seeth cause, without consent or ouersight of anie man.</p>

Againe, had we store of men, which wee haue not, nor no age before vs had; from whome shall we haue maintenance for them and theirs? From the people? Halfe the realme of England em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to that vse will etten but serue. The people nowe yeelde a tenth part vnto God and their Minister, which proportion is so moderate, that where the parishes are small, the Pastour hath worke enough to liue thereon. then must they consequently giue fiue parts of ten, which is iust the halfe of allthey haue, before there can be any shew of a <hi>Presbyterie</hi> in euerie parish. I doe not aske you how wel the people, that are, God knoweth, poore enough in many places with these nine parts which they haue, will like to spare so much to the furthering of your fansies; or howe a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prince can bigest to haue all her subiects so disabled, and halfe the realme allotted to support your conceits. these blockes and a hundred such you neuer stumble at, whiles you runne your selues out of breath to pursue the perfection and profit of your discipline; but this I would know: did the Apostles, besides the reliefe of the poore, which indeede is a diuine precept, impose this charge on euerie parish by Gods commandement? or did euer any Christian kingdome or common wealth since Christes ascension abide this yoke: If they did, shew the instance, and claime your mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; if you can shewe no such thing, doe you not perceiue that your little fingers are heauier to Gods people then the Apostles loynes were: and that your discipline is farre greeuouser to the faithfull, then their doctrine: The best is, you may talke long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, before either Prince or people, rich or poore will admit or endure this chargeable frame of your needlesse and proofelesse go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement.</p>
            <p>To amend these flawes, which rend the very body of your discipline in sunder, (for hardly can so many Pastours in euery pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish be gotten, as you must haue; and more hardly maintained;) you are driuen to change the very substance of the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> that were in the Apostles times, and insteede of Ministers of the word and sacraments, who preaching the Gospell must liue of the Gospell, to returne vs a quest of Lay Elders, which you thought might be found in euerie place, and woulde not be so costly as the former; and to giue them power to <hi>impose handes, to bind and loose sinnes in heauen and earth, to censure doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>

in all men, euen in <hi>Pastours,</hi> by <hi>depriuation, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or howsoeuer; and rather then they should miscarry, to make them <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Watchmen, Pastours</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> in the church of God, contrarie to the whole church of Christ, to all the ancient and learned Fathers and Councils, and contrary no lesse to the Scriptures then to your owne positions. But Masters, you must either confound all, and make no difference betwixt Pastour and people, which nowe you are faire for; or, will you, nill you, you must exclude Lay Elders from these actions, which bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Pastours; and so haue no <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> but where meete men may be had, and in Christian manner honoured and succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for their paines. And consequently countrie parishes, which by no meanes can be prouided either of men or maintenance suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for such <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> as the worde of God alloweth, must haue their Pastours restrained by none, and subiected to none, but Pope-like, if not Lucifer-like, to be more then Princes; or if that be not tolerable, then must they be vnited and annexed to some citie that lieth neere them, and be gouerned by the bishop and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie</hi> of that place euen as the churches in the citie are, and so be part of his charge and diocefe.</p>

The reason of their doings, is as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident as their fact. for if Bishops were placed by the Apostles handes to ordaine <hi>Presbyters</hi> and containe them in their dueties, lest in so great a number emulation might breede confusion, which all the Fathers were fully resolued was the Apostles deede; they must needes bee of opinion, the Apostles meant to haue Countrey Townes and Uillages guided and assisted the very same way that they left for Cities; and the same men that gouerned the one, all things considered, were the fittest to be trusted with the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:2102:181"/>
If you obiect that the bishops of the Cities could imploy no pastorall care, but where they were present; I answere that all the Councils and Fathers of the Primitiue Church were not so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as not to vnderstand what Pastorall ouersight a bishop might yeelde to townes and Churches farre distant from him, though hee were not present to dispence the word and Sacraments amongest them. To see them alwayes stored with a sound and able Pastor, that should watch ouer their soules; to take care that they were rightly taught and soberly guided; to keepe both <hi>Presbyters</hi> and people from schismes, heresies and open impieties; to direct in dangers, and determine doubts without troubling the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince to meete vpon euerie particular occasion and contention; these be good parts of pastorall vigilancie, and very needefull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of episcopall regiment, which may be performed as well in a Diocese as in a Citie.</p>
            <p>In any mans haruest he that laboureth himselfe, and ouerseeth the rest, doth more good then any other. In eche mans house, the steward that well ordereth and guideth the familie is more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then any of his fellowes. In Gods house and haruest, shall the ouerlooking of others be counted either needelesse or fruitlesse? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe knewe not these curious positions when hee appointed <hi>Tite</hi> to take the charge and ouersight of the whole I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of Creete; and saw no cause why one man might not performe many Pastorall and Episcopall dueties to all that were in the same Countrie with him. But what seeke I more examples, when we haue the paterne from the Primitiue Church that first allotted Dioceses to bishops, and the liking and approbation of all prouinciall and generall Councils that ratified and confirmed as wel the partition as distinction of territories, and charged eche mans interest in euery diocese to be preserued without infringing any mans bounds, or encroching on anie mans right.</p>

               <hi>The need that you pretend of hauing Dioeceses, aswel for the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as furnishing of country parishes by the Bishops and Presbyteries of the cities, we easely auoyde for in euery parish with the Pastour we appoint lay Elders, by whose counsel as Ambrose witnesseth al things should be doone in the Church; and when the former Incumbent is dead, were serue the electing of a new to the people of the same parish to whom by Gods Law it appertaineth.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>he want of popular elections is one of the griefs you conceiue, and exceptions you take against the Bishops of this Realme; which quarell doeth not so much touch the office and function of Bishops, as it doeth the Princes prerogatiue. Did wee teach, it were not lawfull for the people to elect their Pastour, you might make some shew against vs; now, when we say no such thing, but you rather thinke, the Prince may not name her Bishops without the consent and election of the people; you impugne not vs, but directly call the Princes fact &amp; her lawes in question. I take not aduantage of mans lawe, thereby to decline the force of your reasons or authorities, but to put you in minde, that if there were any defect in the lawe, it must not be ascribed to Bishops, but imputed rather to the makers of the lawe. Howbeit, to tell you the trueth, I thinke there will be found better reason for the making and maintaining the law, then you will be able to bring for the repealing or altering the lawe for when superstition and blindnesse wholy possessed the peoples hearts, as in time of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; how could the Prince haue restored Religion, or reformed the Church, if the people through the Realme had still bene suffered to choose themselues Pastours after their owne desires: The first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the lawe being good and godly; what ground haue you to dislike the continuance thereof:</p>

               <hi>people chiefly hath power to choose worthie Priests, and refuse vnworthie. The which we see descended from the diuine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that the Priest should bee chosen in the presence of the people vnder all mens eyes, and be approued to be worthie and fit by publike iudgement and testimonie; as in Numbers God commandeth Moses, saying;</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="margin">Num. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Take Aaron thy brother, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazar his sonne, and thou shalt bring them to the mount before all the assemblie, and put off Aarons garments, and put them on Eleazar his sonne. Before all the multitude God willeth the Priest to bee made; that is, hee instructeth and sheweth that Priests should not be ordained but with the knowledge of the people standing by; that by the people present, the offences of the euill may bee detected, or the deserts of the good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; and that to be counted a lawfull and true ordination, which is examined with the voices and iudgement of all, which afterward according to Gods instruction was obserued in the Actes of the Apostles, when Peter spake to the people of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining a Bishop in Iudas place. Neither onely shall wee finde that the Apostles obserued this in the ordaining of Bishops and Priests, but also of Deacons. Which surely was therefore so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and warily done, the whole multitude being called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, lest any not woorthie shoulde by stealth get either the place of a Priest, or to serue at the Altar. Wherefore it must be duely retained and kept, as comming from the diuine tradition and Apostolike obseruation, which is vsed with vs and almost in all prouinces, that in rightly ordaining, the next Bishops of the same Prouince resort to the people for whom they ordayne a Ruler, and the Bishop to be chosen in the presence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which best knoweth the life of eche one, and hath viewed all the manner of his conuersation. It is a notable place, I was loath to leaue out any, though the wordes were somewhat long.]</hi> I would as soone haue beleeued your report of the wordes, had it bin true, as your repeating them; but you haue done well to put the matter out of doubt, and somewhat eased me by alleadging them. for nowe I shall not neede but to referre you to your owne alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>I haue much mused with my selfe, what shoulde leade you to make so great account of this place as you doe; I coulde neuer see

any such thing as you intend, either contained in the Scriptures, which <hi>Cyprian</hi> bringeth; nor expressed in the reason which hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for this kind of choise, nor enforced in the heat of those words by which he summeth his collection. The places of Scripture say nothing for your purpose; <hi>Eleazar</hi> was not chosen by the people, but expressie by God, and by him alone. Your selues I hope will discharge that quotation, as erroneous and mistaken. There are no such wordes in the text, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> citeth, there were no such deeds. God willed <hi>Moses to</hi>

               <hi>bring Aaron and Eleazar his sonne vp into Mount Hor,</hi> (whither the people neither did nor might ascend,) and there <hi>to put off Aarons garments,</hi> and <hi>to put them on Eleazar his sonne.</hi> And <note n="2" place="margin">verse 27.</note>

               <hi>Moses and Eleazar (Aaron dying in the top of the Mount) came downe from the Mount.</hi> Whereby <hi>all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation sawe that Aaron was dead, and they wept for him thirtie dayes.</hi> The Congregation did not intermeddle by worde or deed with this election; <hi>Eleazar</hi> as the eldest sonne was called for by God to succeed in his fathers place. Out of this you may gather that God aduaunced the eldest sonne to haue his fathers office; not that the people elected him: it was not in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to appoint, who should stand before the Arke to minister vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</p>
            <p>The choise of <hi>Matthias</hi> helpeth you as much, as the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling of <hi>Eleazar</hi> did. I haue often sayde, you may remember it, the people had no power to choose an Apostle, no more then they had to choose <hi>Eleazar.</hi> Hee must haue his calling from God and not from men; and so <hi>Matthias</hi> had. The faithfull did all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that hee was the partie whom God had chosen to take <hi>Iudas</hi> place, they did not elect him.

Popular election of Bishops I find afterward practised in the Primitiue Church, but not mentioned in the Scriptures; and therefore well may the peoples interest stand vpon the grounds of reason and nature, and bee deriued from the rules of Christian equitie and societie; but Gods lawe doeth not meddle with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie such matter, nor determine more then I haue tolde you; which is, that such Bishops as ordaine them shall answere for them with the perill of their owne soules, if they doe not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie looke into the abilitie and integritie of all that they au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize with imposition of handes to guide or teach the flocke of Christ.</p>
            <p>When I say the people can not chalenge by Gods lawe the right to choose their Bishop, I meane, no such thing is expressed and commaunded in the Scriptures; excluding thereby the false conceites of some fanaticall spirites in our dayes, which affirme our Bishops and Teachers to bee no true Pastours, because they are not chosen by the particular voyces and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Suffrages of the people; and by consequent, our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to bee no Sacramentes, and Church no Church; and so this whole Realme to bee drowned in confusion without assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of saluation; whose madnesse is rather to bee chastised by the Magistrate, then to be refused by doctrine; the authors being voyde not onely of learning which they despise, but of reason to weigh what is sayde against them. Otherwise, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge each Church and people, (that haue not by lawe, custome or consent restrained themselues) stand free by Gods lawe to admit, maintaine, and obey no man as their Pastour without their liking, and so the peoples election by themselues or their rulers, dependeth on the very first principles of humane fellowships &amp; assemblees. for which cause though bishops by Gods law haue power to examine &amp;
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:2102:187"/>
ordaine, before any may be placed to take charge of soules; yet haue they no power to impose a Pastour on any Church against their wils, nor to force them to yeelde him obedience or maintenaunce without their liking. How farre authoritie, custome and consent may preiudice and ouer-rule this libertie, which Gods lawe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vndiminished, shall anone be handed; when once we see what order the Primitiue Church obserued in her elections of Bishops and <hi>Presbyters.</hi>

               <hi>the Bishops of the same Prouince that were neerest to the place,</hi> by conference amongst themselues appointed a day to resort thither, and aduertised both people and <hi>Presbyters</hi> thereof. At which time the Clergie and Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie assembling in the Church, so many Bishops as conuenientlie might (but vnder three they could doe nothing) came thither; and there heard both whom the Clergie named, and whom the Citie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. If all, or the most of euery sort agreed, the partie was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced chosen, &amp; another day prefixed to ordaine him, the Bishops proposing his name, and the time on the Church doores, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring euerie man that could or would obiect any thing against him, to bee then and there readie with his proofes and witnesses. At their next repaire, the Bishops that came to giue imposition of handes, heard aduisedly what each man could charge him with; and if in their consciences the elect prooued to bee such as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle prescribed, they ordained him in the eies of all men Pastour of that Church, and burdened him with the due obseruation of Gods and mans lawes. If they found any iust impediment, they reiected him as vnfit, and proceeded to the like election of some other, on whom both <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Citizens could accord. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Seuerus</hi> the Romane Emperour, did commend and imitate the Christians maner in trying and examining their <hi>Presbyters</hi> and Bishops. <note n="2" place="margin">Aelius Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius in Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.

            <p>When the Cities had not store of Clergie men, or not such as they liked, they were forced to seeke a Bishop from another church; and then did they goe to the Bishop of the chiefe or mother Citie in the same Prouince, and of him desired to haue such a man for their Bishop; or els some other, whom the Metropolitane, that is, the Bishop of the mother Church or Citie should thinke fit for them.

            <p>And as to keepe the people from faction, &amp; the <hi>Presbyters</hi> from ambition, the Bishops of the same Prouince were appointed to be present at the choise, &amp; to see the election goe forward in Christian and decent maner, without corruption, canuasse or tumult: so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the Bishops that they should not disorder the action for hatred or fauour of any side, the whole order of their proceeding was to bee intimated to the Metropolitane, before they imposed handes; and if any iust complaint were made of their partialitie, the Metropolitane had power to staie them from going forward, and with a greater number of Bishops to discusse, and vpon cause to reuerse the Election.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no question, but the people may willingly forsake, and worthily loose the right which they had in the choice of their bishops, and the Prince either way bee lawfully possessed of the peoples interest. you must rather if you will needes be so inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, examine the causes that induced the lawe, whether they were iust or no; and so shall you see whether this manner of election be a wise and good preuention of such corrupt factions, and fearefull tumultes, as our desperate age woulde easely breede; or a rigorous encrochment on the peoples right without cause or consent; which you can not offer to thinke without euident wrong to the Prince and Realme.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but the Prince of right hath, and euer had as great interest in the choice of bishops, as the people. There can no reason be pretended for the multitude, but it concludeth more strongly for the Magistrate. If the people by Gods Lawe were to chuse their bishop; the king as the principall part and head of the people, by the same Lawe must be suffered to haue the chiefe place amongest them.

And euen in the Primitiue Church when leisure from greater affaires, and occasion of popular vproares put Christian Emperors in mind to vse their right, they were by Councils acknowledged to haue good interest in the elections of bishops, and by the whole Church suffered not onelie to haue a seuerall and soueraigne consent, but by their Lawes to moderate, restraine and punish the attempts and abuses as wel of bishops and clarks that were electors &amp; ordainers,

            <p>Neither had the Roman Emperors this authoritie to dash elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; appoint bishops onely at Rome and Constantinople; other places were in like subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them; &amp; though their care were not so great for the smaller cities, which were innumerable, as for the principal Sees, where themselues liued, &amp; whither they often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorted; yet their right was alone in greater &amp; lesser Churches. If the chiefest bishops might not be chosen without the Emperours consent, the meaner places had neither by the Canons, nor by the Scriptures any more freedome from the Princes power then the greater. So that what superioritie was then acknowledged and yeelded by the greatest and chiefest Churches as due to Christian Emperors in the elections of bishops; the same could by no means be denyed them ouer other Churches though the Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues sometimes neglected, and sometimes refused to be troubled with the choice of so many thousand Bishops, as were vnder their territories. And therefore <hi>Adrian</hi> Bishop of Rome was not the first that did grant and giue this right to the Empire, as some Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish stories would faine enforce; it was receiued in the Church of Christ many hundred yeeres before <hi>Adrian</hi> was borne, and vsed as well by other Christian kings in their realmes, as by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in his dominions.

Which course being hitherto religiously and wisely obserued in this City, when one Morellius a fanaticall spirite in fauor of the people presumed to reprehend, his writing was worthily condemned both in this church, and in many Synodes of France.</hi> The choise of the seuen in the Acts maketh no perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al nor essential rule for elections in the Church of God. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Laodicea did wel and wisely prohibite the people to haue the choise of such as should be called to the sacred ministery. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors elect, the magistrates consent, &amp; open report there of is made to the people; and if they haue any iust cause to alleage against the parties chosen, they must propose and prooue their exceptions; and when <hi>Morellius</hi> woulde haue challenged more interest then this for the people in the election of their Pastours, his opinion was condemned both by the censure of Geneua, and by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes of France. All this is confessed by Master <hi>Bezaes</hi> owne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie.</p>
            <p>Wee differ, you thinke, in some pointes from the manner of Geneua: wee haue great reason so to doe. They liue
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:2102:195"/>
in a popular state; we in a kingdome. The people there heare the chiefest rule; here the Prince: and yet there the people are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from electing their Pastors. If the multitude haue any cause to dislike, their allegation is heard and examined by the Pastours and Magistrates, but they haue no free power to frustrate the whole by dissenting, much lesse to elect whome they like. Nowe that our state hath farre better cause to exclude the multitude from electing their Bishops, then theirs hath, is soone perceiued. The people there maintaine their Pastours; our Bishops are not chargeable to the Commons, but endowed by the liberalitie of Princes, without any cost to the multitude. Their Pastours are chosen out of the same Citie, and their behauiour knowen to al the Inhabitants; our Bishops are taken from other places of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and not so much as by name knowen to the people, which they shall guide. With vs therefore there is no cause why the people should be parties, or priuie to the choosing of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; since they be neither troubled with the maintaining of them, nor haue any triall, or can giue anie testimonic of their liues and conuersations; which were the greatest reasons that inclined the Fathers of the Primitiue Church to yeelde so much vnto the people in the choyce of their Bishops. And lastly, if Princes were not heades of their people, and by Gods and mans law trusted with the direction and moderation of all externall and publike gouernement, as well in Religion as in policie, afore, and aboue al others, which are two most sufficient reasons to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force that they ought to be trusted with elections, if they please to vndertake that charge, whereof they must yeelde an account to God; yet the people of this realine at the making of the Law most apparantly submitted and transferred al their right and interest to the Princes Iudgement and wisedome; which lawefully they might, and wisely they did, rather then to endanger the whole common wealth with such tumulets and vproates as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church tasted of, and lay the gappe open againe to the factions and corruptions of the vnsettled and vnbrideled mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>

Their abundance, their magnificence, their conscience, are sureties for the freedome of their choice. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I see no reason to distrust their elections as likelier to be more corrupt, then the peoples. It is farre easier for ambition to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with the people then with the Prince. And as for the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of men in learning and life to supplie such places, Princes haue both larger scope to choose, and better meanes to knowe who are fit then their people. for since Bishops are not, and for the most part cannot be chosen out of the fame Church or Citie; what course can the people take to be assured of their abilitie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie, whom they neither liue with, nor whose doctrine or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners they are any whit acquainted with:</p>

            </p>
            <p>This lawe giueth two reasons for Patronages, which I take indeede were the very groundes of that interest they haue at this day; to wit, <hi>building the Church,</hi> &amp; <hi>maintaining</hi> the <hi>Ministers.</hi> Before the lawe for Tithes was made in Cities, the Clergie lined of the voluntarie Oblations and Donations of the faithfull; in countrey villages the lord of the Soile was left to his discretion to yeeld what allowance he thought good out of his land for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Minister; the rest of the inhabitants being but his husbandmen and seruants, had neither wealth to build Churches, nor right to giue any part of the fruites and profites of their lordes
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:2102:200"/>
land. So that either Churches must not at all haue bene built in countrie townes, or the lordes of each place were to be prouoked to the founding of Churches, and allowing conuenient proportions with the honour and preheminence to dispose their owne to their liking.</p>
            <p>Neither doe I see any thing in Gods lawe against it. for when you affirme the people should elect their Pastor, I trust you doe not include in that word children, seruants, beggers or bondmen; but such as are of discretion to choose, &amp; abilitie to maintaine their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. Put then the case, which was in the Primitiue Church when the villagers &amp; husbandmen of each place had no state nor interest in the lands which they tilled, but serued the lord of the Soile, &amp; had allowance for their paines out of the fruits of the earth at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; what assurance or maintenance could those men yeeld vnto their Pastors? Call to mind but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> conquest of this land, when there was neither free-holder, nor copie-holder, but all bond besides the lord; who could then elect a Clerke, but onely the lord of the place, since no man was free but he alone? Wherfore Patronages &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations are farre ancienter in this &amp; all other Christian realmes, then either the libertie or habilitie of husbandmen &amp; copie-holders; and when the lordes of villages hauing erected churches, &amp; allotted out portions for diuine seruice, made afterward some free, &amp; some bond tenants; did either Gods or mans lawe commaund or intend, that their latter grants shuld ouerthrow their former rights? That which hath so many hundreth yeres bene setled and receiued by the lawes of all nations, as the remembrance &amp; inheritance of the first Founders or Donours of euery Church, shall a few curious heads make the world now beleeue it is repugnant to the lawe of God? By your eager impugning of Patronages, without vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either the intent, or effect of them, wise men may soone see what soundnesse of iudgement the rest of your discipline is likelie to carrie.</p>
            <p>To close vp this question, if the allowance giuen at first to the ministers of each parish by the lord of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Soile, were matter enough in the iudgement of Christes Church, to establish the right of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones that they alone should present Clerkes, because they alone prouided for them; the Princes interest to conferre Bishoprikes hath far more sound and sufficient reason to warrant it. for besides
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:2102:200"/>
the maintenance which the kings of this land yeelded, when they first endowed bishoprikes with lands and possessions, to vnburden their people of the support and charges of their Bishops; &amp; in that respect haue as much right as any Patrones can haue: the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of the sworde whereby the Prince ruleth the people, the people rule not the Prince, is no small enforcement, that in electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as in other points of gouernment, the Prince may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie chalenge the soueraigntie aboue and without the people, Gods law prescribing no certaine rule for the choise of Bishops; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not chalenge the like without or against the Prince. And lastly, though the people in former ages, by the sufferance of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, had somewhat to doe with the elections of their Bishops; yet nowe for the auoiding of such tumults and vprores as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church was afflicted with, by the lawes of this Realme and their owne consents, the peoples interest and liking is wholie submitted and inclosed in the Princes choise, so that whome the Prince nameth, the people haue bound themselues to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and accept for their Pastour, no lesse then if hee had bene thosen by their owne suffrages. And had they not here unto agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as by Parliament they haue; I see no let by Gods lawe, but in Christian kingdomes when any difference groweth euen about the elections of Bishops, the Prince as head and Ruler of the people hath better right to name and elect, then all the rest of their people. If they concurre in iudgement, there can bee no variance; if they dissent, the Prince (if there were no expresse lawe for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as with vs there is) must beare it from the people; the people by Gods lawe must not looke to preuaile agaynst their Prince.</p>

If any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Councill affirme, that by Gods lawe the people haue right to elect their Bishop, the Prince hath not; the assertion is so false, that no man need regard it.

            <p>For answere then to your authorities, I say: First, <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the other two Councils might speake of those times, when as yet christian Princes had not reuoked elections of Bishops to their owne power, but by their publike lawes commanded their Clergie
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:2102:201"/>
and people to make choise of their Pastors. And in that case, he that contrary to the positiue lawes of any kingdome or common wealth made secret meanes or procured to be placed by the priuate letters of Princes against the open lawes of the Realme where hee liued, was an ambitious &amp; violent intruder, and not woorthie to beare the name of a Pastor &amp; Bishop in Christes Church. Next, <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the rest may speake not of election, but of examination &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which by Gods law is committed to Bishops, &amp; not to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and then their meaning is, It is not sufficient for a Bishop to haue the Princes consent &amp; decree; he must be also examined and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by such as the holy Ghost hath appointed to impose hands on him, which no man may omit though he be neuer so much allowed &amp; elected by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes, &amp; so both their words &amp; proofs seem to import.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVI. <hi>The meeting of Bishops in Synodes, and who did call and moderate those assemblies in the Primitiue Church.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He necessitie and authoritie of Synodes, is not so much in question betwixt vs, as the persons that should assemble and moderate those meetings. The disciplinarians themselues, if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, are farre from making their Pastours or <hi>Presbyteries</hi> in euery parish supreme Iudges of doctrine and maners without all exception or reuocation; and wee bee further. for what if the Pastours or <hi>Presbyters</hi> of any place maintaine heresie or offer iniurie, which are cases not rarelie inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but euery where occurrent eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in those that beare the names of Christians: shall impietie and iniustice so raigne and preuaile in the Church, that none may withstand it, or redresse it: That were to make the house of God worse then a den of theeues; for theeues feare the detecting, and flie the punishing of their offences; which many <hi>Presbyters</hi> would not, if there were no way to restraine and ouer rule their pestilent and wicked purposes. Wherefore, as in ciuill affaires there are Lawes and Powers to vphold iustice, and prohibite violence; without the which, humane societies could not consist: so in the Church of Christ, when it is without the helpe and assistance of a Christian magistrate, there must bee some externall and iudiciall meanes to discerne errour, and redresse wrong, in case any particular person or Church be infected or oppressed; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, there is no possibilitie for trueth and equitie to harbour long amongst the sonnes of men.</p>
            <p>The remedie which the Primitiue Church had, and vsed against heresie and iniurie, she deriued as well from the promise made by Christes owne wordes, as from the example of the Apostles in the like case. Christ willing such of his Disciples as were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by their brethren, after the first and second admonition, <hi>to toll it to the Church;</hi> addeth for the direction and confirmation of all religious assemblies and conferences; <note n="1" place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middest of</hi>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:2102:202"/>
               <hi>them; and whatsoeuer you shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heauen, and whatsoeuer you shall loose in earth, shall bee loosed in heauen.</hi> Whether the name of the Church in this place hee taken for the assemblie of Elders and Rulers vnder <hi>Moses</hi> lawe, or of Pastours and Teachers vnder the Gospell, to me it is indifferent; this is euidentlie the order, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour willeth to be obserued; from priuate admonition to goe to witnesses, and from witnesses to <hi>assemblies.</hi> So the worde <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doeth most plainelie signifie; and so the promise annexed doeth clearelie import; <hi>where two or three are assembled together in my name, I am in the midst of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither could any other course bee established in the Church. for since an ende of controuersies must bee had amongst men, least perpetuall contention bring finall confusion, and plucke vp the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie rootes of all charitie and equitie from amongst men, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuate perswasion, nor friendlie mediation can appease the parties contending; what other order could bee prescribed, but a Iudiciall hearing and determining of things in question: Nowe Iudges must needes bee either <hi>single</hi> or <hi>assembled;</hi> and <hi>single</hi> Iudges of force must either be <hi>Soueraigne</hi> and supreme Iudges, or els vnder superiours appointed by the same warrant. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome claimeth a single and sole commission to heare and conclude all causes, concerning either faith or right; and were his proofe as good, as his chalenge is proude, it were woorth the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing. but the more he claimeth, the more he sinneth, by reason he taketh vnto himselfe without commission, an infallible and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitable iudgement ouer all men and matters vpon the face of the earth, that any way touch the trueth or the Church. Princes are single and soueraigne Iudges of earthlie things, and when they beleeue, the defence and maintenance of the Church and fayth is by God himselfe committed to their power and care; but Christ did not settle the sword to bee the generall and perpetuall rule to gouerne his Church. for then without a Prince there could be no Church; and consequentlie, neither in the Apostles times, nor three hundred yeeres after, had Christ anie Church heere on earth, since none of the Romane Princes that were lordes of the world, publikelie maintained the Christian faith before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:2102:203"/>
Since we find no single nor supreme Iudges, on whome the Church of Christ must alwayes depend for the debating and ending of ecclesiasticall strifes and contentions; of necessitie there must either be none, which were the vtter subuersion of all peace and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amongst the faithfull, where there wanteth a Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; or els the Pastours and Stewards of Christes Church, to whome the care and charge thereof is committed, must assemble together, and with mutuall conference and consent, performe those dueties to the Church in generall, which otherwise they doe to each particular place and person. for though Pastours be affixed to their places and charges, yet that doeth not hinder the common care they should haue of all the members of Christes bodie; and therefore when need so requireth, they must as well imploy their trauell abroad, as bestowe paines at home, to direct or pacifie the household of faith. This brotherlie kind of succouring and assisting each other in troubles and dangers, is sometimes performed by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but neuer so throughly and effectually, as by meeting and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling together, when with deliberate and full aduise, they may heare and determine what they thinke meetest for the safetie and quietnesse of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Their warrant so to doe, is builded on the maine grounds of all diuine and humane societies, strengthned by the promise of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and assured vnto them by the example of the Apostles and perpetuall practise of the Church of Christ. By Gods lawe what obedience and reuerence the father may expect from his children, the same or greater must all beleeuers yeeld to the fathers of their faith. They are comprised in the same name, and in the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement with the fathers of our flesh, and consequently must haue the same honour. And if the fulnesse of each mans reward must be according to the excellencie of his labour; they that beget vs, nourish vs, and continue vs in Christ, deserue farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour, then they that bring vs into this worlde, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide onelie for the things of this life. Agayne, the Church is the bodie of Christ, and in that respect, as in our bodies, so in his, not onelie the members haue a common care for the whole, but the principall partes must direct and guide the rest; namelie, the eyes to see, the eares to heare, and the mouth to speake for the whole body. Such therefore as Christ hath placed
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:2102:203"/>
to be the <note n="1" place="margin">

Yea, the Lord so much tendereth the fatherly care, and brotherlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the Pastors of his Church, that he hath promised to be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the midst</hi> of their assemblies, and with his spirite to direct them, so they come together, not to accomplish their owne lusts and desires, but to sanctifie his name by detecting errour, resisting wolues, maintaining trueth, curing the sores and maladies that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and poison the members of his body.</p>

            <p>This hath in all Ages, as well before, as since the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Nice bene approoued and practised as the lawfullest and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest meanes to discerne trueth from falshoode, to decide doubtes, end strifes, and redresse wrongs in causes ecclesiastical; yea, when there were no beleeuing magistrates to assist the Church, this was the onely way to cleanse the house of God, as much as might be, from the lothsome vessels of dishonour; and after Christian Princes began to professe and protect the trueth, they neuer had, nor can haue any better or safer direction amongst men, then by the Synodes of wise and godly Pastours. A Synode at Antioch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three score yeeres before the Councill of Nice, condemned and deposed <hi>Paulus Samosatonus</hi> for heresie; and when he would not yeeld the Church, but kept it by violence; vpon complaint made to <hi>Aurelianus</hi> the Emperour, though he were an Ethnike, <hi>Samosatenus</hi>

            <p>The great Nicene Councill perceiued, and by their decree witnessed how needfull the vse of Synodes was, and would bee in the Church of Christ. <note n="1" place="margin">

               <hi>It seemeth (vnto vs) very requisite</hi> (say they) <hi>that in euerie Prouince twice euery yeere there should be a Synode, that all the Bishops of the Prouince meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may in common examine such questions</hi> as are occurrent in euerie place.

               <hi>It is come to our eares, that in (some) Prouinces the Synodes of Bishops are not kept, which are appointed by the Canons; and thereby many ecclesiasticall matters, which need reformation, are neglected.

               <hi>they are a sure remedy against all confusion: but this we dislike, that you giue the power to cal Synodes from the Magistrate to the Metropolitane, thereby maintaining a needelesse difference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Bishops, and suffer none but such as you terme Bishops to haue voyces in Councils, whereas euerie Pastour and Preacher hath as good right to sit there, and by consent and subscription to determine, as they haue.]</hi> What right wee yeelde to Christian Magistrates to call Synodes within their Territories, shall soone appeare; in the meane time you must tell vs, who called Synodes in the Primitiue Church before Princes fauoured Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. was it done by Magistrates, who then were Infidels? or by Metropolitanes? And when Princes protected the truth, did they moderate prouinciall Councils by their substitutes? or was that charge committed to the Bishop of the chiefe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church and Citie in euerie prouince? you challenge to bee men of learning and reading; speake of your credites, who called in ancient times prouinciall Synodes, or at any time who mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them besides Metropolitanes?

               <hi>The power of Metropolitanes was rather lengthened, then short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Bishop of Rome. for who suppressed Prouinciall Synodes, and brought Bishops and Archbishops to this height of pride they are at, but onely the Romish Decretals of Antichrist?]</hi> If your wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome serue you to call that Antichrists pride, whereto godly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were forced for their owne ease, &amp; wherewith religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were contented for the better execution of their lawes; my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the church of God and the magistrate stayeth me from reuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or disliking that course, which I see both Councils and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by long and good experience were driuen vnto.

               </gap>y that which the councils and princes of the Primitiue church by triall sawe needefull to be committed to their care; and we striue for no more. I trust you will not call that Antichristian pride when they are required by christian Princes to see their Lawes and Edicts touching causes Ecclesiasticall put in practise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fault we find is, that Archbishops haue suppressed the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Synodes, and reserued all things to their owne iurisdiction.]</hi> A greater fault then that is; you be so inflamed with disdaine, that you know not what you say. Who, I pray you, prohibiteth the vse, or abridgeth the power of Synods to make rules &amp; determine cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses ecclesiastical? the Metropolitane, or the Prince? Take good heed, lest by eager and often calling for the indictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and decision of Synodes at the Metropolitans hands without the princes leaue, you erect a new forme of Synodes, not to aduise &amp; guide the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, when they be thereto required, but to straighten or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall the Princes power. True it is, that with vs no Synodes may assemble without the Princes warrant, as well to meete, as to consult of any matters touching the state of this Realme; and why: They be no Court separate from the prince, nor superiour to the Prince, but subiected in all thinges vnto the Prince, and appointed by the Lawes of God and man in trueth and godlinesse to assist and direct the Prince, when and where they shall be willed
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:2102:208"/>
to assemble. Otherwise they haue no power of themselues to make decrees, when there is a christian Magistrate, neither may they chalenge the iudicial hearing or ending of Ecclesiastical controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies without or against the princes liking. Now iudge your selues whether you do not grosely betray your own ignorance, I am loth to say malice, when you declaime against the Metropolitane for want of that which is not in his power to performe but in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and be more silent hereafter in these cases (if you be wise) lest you traduce the Princes power vnder the Metropolitanes name.

            <p>Afore princes began to professe christianitie, the church had no way (as I noted before) to discusse right and wrong in faith, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ecclesiastical causes, but by Synodes and assemblies of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; wise pastors. that course always continued in the church (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when the sword most sharply pursued the church) from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles deaths to <hi>Constantines</hi> raigne; and was euer found in the church, when christian Princes were not. Those Synodes were assembled and gouerned by the Bishops of the chiefe and mother churches and cities in euerie prouince, who by the ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are called <hi>Metropolitans.</hi> When princes embraced the faith, they increased the number of Synods, and confirmed not onlie the canons of generall Councils; but also the iudgements and decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of prouinciall Synodes, as the best meanes they coulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise to procure peace, and aduance religion in euerie place. for as by their lawes they referred Ecclesiasticall causes to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Iudges; so lest matters shoulde hang long in strife, they charged eache Metropolitane to assemble the Bishops of his Prouince twise euerie yeere, and there to examine and order all matters of doubt and wrong within the Church.

            <p>So that not Antichrist, but ancient Councils and Christian Emperours perceiuing the mightie troubles and intolerable char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that the Bishops of euery prouince were put to by staying at Synodes for the hearing and determining of al priuate matters &amp; quarrels occurrent in the same Prouince; and seeing no cause to busie and imploy the bishops of the whole world twise euerie yeere to sit in iudgement about petite and particular strifes and brables, till al parties were satisfied, but finding rather, that by that means all matters must either be infinitely delayed, or slenderly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and hastily posted ouer; as well the Princes as the Bishops, not to increase the pride of Archbishops, but to settle an indifferent course both for the parties and the Iudges; referred, not the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Lawes and Canons, but the execution of them alreadie made to the credite and conscience of the Archbishop. And though the Fathers leaue an appeale either to the Councils, or to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of euerie Nation and Countrie; yet the Emperour seeing howelong causes woulde depend before Councils coulde duelie examine and determine them; and that to bring all priuate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Prouinciall Synodes to Nationall Councils, were to breede a worse confusion then the former was; decreed that all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales should go to the Archbishop.</p>
            <p>If you murmure at this alteration first established by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperours, and stil continued by the Lawes of this realme now in force; remember how vnreasonable and intolerable a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it were for al the bishops of this realme to assemble, and at their owne charges to stay the hearing, examining and sentencing of all the doubts, wrongs, quarrels and contentions which al the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories throughout England at this day do handle and determine.

without intermission? were it not a proper peece of work for your pleasures to bring all the pastours of this land to keepe continually in one place, and to doe nothing else but attend for appeales, that must and woulde bee sent from all the shires and quarters of this realme? who shoulde teach and administer the Sacraments to the people in the meane time? who shoulde defray the expences of so many hundred pastours, as are not able to maintaine their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies at home, and themselues abroade? who shall instruct them in the knowledge of the Lawes, without which they shalldoe more wrong then right? How long will it be afore so great a number, or the most part of them concurre in one minde to conclude euerie cause that is brought vnto them? And when all these inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be endured, and absurdities digested; to what purpose, since e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man may presently appeale from them to the Princes power and delegates?

               <hi>We could deuise many ways to preuent al this that you obiect, if we might be suffred. for we would haue standing Synodes in euery Citie that should consist of the Pastors, and some graue &amp; wise Lay Elders there dwelling to determine matters emergent within a circuite to be appointed vnto them; and from them appeales to be made to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node of Pastours and Elders residing in some Principall and chiefe Citie within this Realme; so that vnlesse the matter were of verie great weight, the Pastours at large shoulde not bee troubled to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble together; and when they assembled, their abode not to bee long, for sauing of time and charge; which men of their calling neither shoulde loose, nor can spare; lest wee busie them rather as Iudges of mens quarrels, then Stewardes of Gods mysteries.]</hi> The chiefe ground of your Discipline is your owne deuise, as may well appeare in that no part of it is ancient, or was euer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Church of Christ; and the ioyntes of it hang together like sicke mens dreames.

And where you could not abide, that Bishops shoulde haue Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses; nowe you be pleased, that <hi>Presbyteries</hi> shal haue circuits, and Ecclesiasticall regiment, without their Church and Citie.

And therefore to our Synodes are called, as your selues know; not only bishops, but deanes, archdeacons, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clerks aswel of the principall &amp; cathedrall <hi>Presbytery,</hi> where the episcopall seate &amp; church is, as of the Diocese at large. And though some Romish writers do stifly maintaine, that none but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops haue voices in Councils; yet you see the ancient institution of our synodall assembly in this realme ouerthroweth their late &amp; new assertion. Neither lacke we examples of the course which we keepe, euen from the beginning.</p>

               <hi>If Presbyters haue right to sit in Prouincial Synodes, why are they excluded from generall Councils?]</hi> Many things are <hi>lawful</hi> which are <hi>not expedient.</hi> I make no doubt but all pastours and teachers may sit and deliberate in Councill; yet would it breede a sea of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities to call all the pastors and preachers of the world into one place, as often as neede should require to haue any matter deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined or ordered in the Church. As therefore in ciuill policie, when a whole realme assembleth, not al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> persons there liuing are called together, but certaine chiefe ouer the rest or chosen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest, to represent the state, and to consult for the good of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth; so in the gouernement of the Church it were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly superfluous and tedious, but monstrous to send for all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the whole worlde into one Citie, and there to stay them from their cures and Churches till all things needeful could be agreed and concluded. It is more agreeable to reason, and as sufficient in right, that some of euerie place excelling others in dignitie, or elected by generall consent, shoulde be sent to supplie the roumes of the rest that are absent, and to conferre in common for the directing and ordering of the whole Church. And therefore Christian Princes in wisedome and discretion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sent for all the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the world to anie generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but onely for the chiefest of euery principall church and citie; or for some to be sent from euery realme far distant, as legates in the names of the rest, and by that meanes they had the consent of the whole world to the decrees of their Councils, though not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall appearance of all the Pastours and <hi>Presbyters</hi> that were in the world.</p>
            <p>So to the Council of Nice the first christian Emperor sent for

The like examples are to be seene in the three generall Councils that folowed, where onely Bishops determined matters in question; and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> that subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, in the Councils of Constantinople and Chalcedon supplied the places of Bishops, as their Legates and substitutes, which in the <note n="4" place="margin">

            <p>But what need we rip vp these things at large, which pertaine not so much to our purpose: we seeke nowe for the antiquitie and authoritie of Metropolitanes; and those we find not onely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and established in the foure first generall Councils, but confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them to haue anciently continued in the Church euen <hi>from the beginning.</hi> And surely, if you graunt Prouinciall Synodes to be ancient and necessarie in the Church of Christ, which you cannot denie; Metropolitanes must needs be as ancient and requisite, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom the Synodes of each Prouince can neither be conuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nor moderated.</p>
            <p>If to auoid Metropolitanes you would haue the prerogatiue of calling and guiding Synodes to run round by course, which order you fansied before in Bishops; our answere is easie: we looke not what you can inuent after 1500. yeeres to please your owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; but what maner of ecclesiasticall gouernment the Church of Christ from the Apostles times established and continued by the generall consent of the whole world; and that we prooue was not onely in euery Church and diocesse to haue a Bishop chiefe ouer the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> but in euery Prouince to appoint a <hi>Mother Church</hi> and <hi>Citie;</hi> and the Bishop thereof to haue this honour and dignitie aboue the rest of his brethren, that hee might by letters consult, or call together the Bishops of his Prouince for any question or cause
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:2102:214"/>
that touched the faith or peace of the Church, and not onely mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their meetings, but execute their decrees; and see them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed throughout his Prouince. This was the ancient and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall vse of Christes Church, long before any Princes professed the trueth; and when they began to vse their swordes, for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Church of Christ, then did Synodes serue for the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christian Princes; and Metropolitanes had the execution as well of Princes lawes, as Synodall decrees committed to their power and care throughout their Prouince.</p>
            <p>This course if you disdaine or dislike, you condemne the whole Church of Christ from the first encreasing and spreading thereof on the face of the earth to this present age; and preferre your owne wisedome, (if it be worthie that name, and not rather to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted selfe loue and singularitie,) before all the Martyrs, Confessors, Fathers, Princes and Bishops that haue liued, gouerned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased in the Church of God since the Apostles deaths. How well the heigth of your conceites can endure to blemish and reproch so many religious and famous lights of Christendome, I knowe not; for my part I wish the Church of God in our dayes may haue the grace for pietie and prudencie to follow their steppes, and not to make the world beleeue that all the seruaunts of Christ before our times, fauoured and furthered the pride of Antichrist, till in the endes of the world, when the faith and loue of most men are quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or decaied, we came to restore the Church to that perfection of discipline, which the Apostles neuer mentioned, the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Councils neuer remembred, the vniuersall Church of Christ before vs neuer conceiued nor imagined.</p>

               <hi>Will they depriue me of the chiefe seate? which heretofore some wise men haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired; but nowe as I thinke, it is the first point of wisedome to decline it.</hi> Then folow those words which you alleage; <hi>for which our whole estate is troubled and shaken, for which the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the world are in an hart-burning &amp; dissentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that cannot be appeased, nor expressed; for which we are in danger to be thought to be of men, when we are of God, and to loose that great and new name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occasions of this speach, as may be seene in his life, were the horrible tumult that <hi>Maximus</hi> raised in aspiring to the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike of Constantinople; the inconstancie of <hi>Peter</hi> bishop of Aleran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, who first by letters confirmed him in the place, and yet after sent some to ordaine <hi>Maximus</hi> against him; and the generall dislike the Bishops of Egypt and of the West partes had of him, (though they could not but commend the man) because he was placed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their consent.

               <hi>Ye men that are my fellow Pastours of the sacred flocke of Christ, it will be a shame and very vnseemlie for you, teaching others to be at peace, if you be at warre amongst your selues. for how shall you perswade them to agree, if you varie in</hi>

I am content to endure any thing for your concord, though I be guiltles; thrust me out of my throne, driue me from the Citie, onely embrace you trueth and peace.</hi> Thus christianlie preferred hee the vnitie of Gods Church before his owne safetie, and made more account of quietnes and secrecie, then of honour and dignitie.</p>
            <p>At the first rising of this tumult, <hi>Nazianzene</hi> was absent from the Citie; and vpon his returne, when <hi>Maximus</hi> and the rest of that faction threatned him with many things, he presently and pithilie made that oration to the people, whence your wordes are taken. Hence you may prooue there were many contentious and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heads in <hi>Nazianzens</hi> time; which in no time before or after, did, or will want; but you can inferre nothing out of these words against the lawfull vse of Episcopall or Metropoliticall moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and superuision prescribed and limited by the Canons of graue and godly Councils, which <hi>Nazianzene</hi> neither did, nor could mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.

President and Ruler of the <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> as the name of Bishop; and therefore it could not then be newe. Besides, <hi>Nazianzene</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth it a wonderfull inconuenience to loose that great and newe name; and to bee all one, as if they should bee taken <hi>not to bee of God.</hi> Now, if the name were new, and lately inuented by men, the losse thereof were not great; yea, retaining the name, they must be knowen to be of men, and not of God; which is contrary to <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzenes</hi> words.

               <hi>He wisheth there were no preheminence, nor prioritie amongst Bishops, and calleth their superioritie tyrannical.]</hi> Hee wisheth, if it were possible, that preheminence and prioritie amongst Bishops went not by the mightinesse of their Cities, but by the desertes of their vertues; not that the first is vulawfull, but that the second is farre more commendable. <note n="2" place="margin">Nazianz. in oratione post re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditum in vrbem.</note>

So saieth <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene. But now</hi> (when men are superiour by their Cities, and <note place="margin">3 <hi>Ibidem.</hi>

            <p>Lastlie, the wishing of a better way, if it were possible, is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing of that which was alreadie setled; by reason it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that <hi>Nazianzenes</hi> wish should take place. for that all men should be sincerelie regarded and honoured according to their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, is rather an heauenly, then an earthlie condition; and sooner to bee wished for, then to bee looked for at mens handes; yea, that course which he wisheth, vnlesse the execution might be answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his wish, would doe more harme then good. For it would not quench ambition and contention, as some men dreame, which are the vices that he complaineth of, but rather inflame them, whiles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man conceiuing well of his owne vertues, would make small account of other mens gifts and deserts. If to decide the strife, you reserue the iudgement thereof to other mens voyces; you amend the matter nothing at all. for if all men setting aside corrupt and partiall respects, would chuse the best to euery place, the Church of Christ would soone flourish without any wishing; and wish what you will, except that be first brought to passe, all the rest will doe you no good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An equalitie amongst the Pastours must needes slake ambition.]</hi> If you could reduce the Cities, Churches and parishes of each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth to aiust proportion: that one should not exceed another in any thing, you might chance with a generall equalitie of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, somewhat to temper ambition; but if you leaue any difference in the things, you shall soone finde a difference in mens affections. Nowe when, or how that may bee compassed, I leaue you to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that are so good at deuising.

If leauing an inequalitie of the places, which you must needs; you settle a generall equalitie amongst the Pastors and ministers of Christes Church; what fresh experience the later ende of the world may teach vs I will not foretell; I am sure, the meane to preuent schismes and dissentions in the primitiue Church, when the graces of Gods spirite were farre more eminent and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant then nowe, was not to make all equall; but to appoint some chiefe to ouersee and moderate the rest.

If euerie Presbyterie by Gods ordinaunce must haue a Ruler as your selues auouch, least they growe to dissention and confusion, howe shall the Bishops of a whole Prouince or kingdome meete, conferre, and couclude, as often as neede requireth, without one to call and moderate their assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies?</p>

We haue Lawes consisting partly of Synodal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, partly of the royall edicts of Princes, and by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them it is prescribed what the Bishop or Metropolitane shall require at eche mans hands; not what they list, but what the Canons of former Councils and lawes of Christian Princes haue thought meete to be performed by euerie one to the glorie of God and good of his Church. Nowe if the execution of Lawes bee Dominion and Imperie in your conceite; when as there is a present remedie by appeale to the Princes audience, if anie
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:2102:218"/>
wrong or hard measure be offred; what will you call it, to iudge by discretion, as your Presbyteries doe': which is the greater kind of Imperie to determine all matters as you list, or to be limited in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery point by the Lawes of the Realme, what you shall doe; and if you transgresse neuer so little, to giue account thereof to the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrate': If I vnderstand any thing, it were more liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for Bishops to bee referred to Synodes, where they shoulde beare some sway; then to be restrained to Lawes, from which they may not shrinke. The execution of your Presbytericall decrees, you giue to the moderatour of your Presbyterie; and yet you giue him no dominion nor imperie. Why then are you so inconsiderate or so intemperate, as to cal the execution of ecclesiastical Lawes by the Diocesane or Metropolitane, a tyrannicall power and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer their brethren':</p>
            <p>Would you haue no Lawes at all; but euery case as it falleth out, so to be censured at the pleasure of the Presbyters': That were a right tyrannie in deede, and not tolerable in any common wealth that hath a Christian Magistrate. If you admit euery matter to be ruled by writtten Lawes; and leaue appeales in all causes for such as find themselues grieued to the Prince, which is obserued in this Realme; the execution of Lawes is rather a burden imposed, then an honour to be desired; and but that some men must needes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that charge, it were more easie for Bishops to bee without it, then alwayes to trouble, and often to endanger themselues with the difficulties and penalties of so many Lawes as we haue, and must haue to guide those causes that are committed to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They haue others to discharge it for them.]</hi> They must haue some to assist them, except you wil haue Bishops to bestow more time in learning humane lawes, then in meditating y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diuine Scriptures. And therefore your inueighing at the Arches and other places of iudgement, she weth you litle vnderstand what you say. Were your Presbyteries or Synodes at their perils to handle and determine so manie &amp; so weightie causes as they are, you woulde reuerence them as much as euer you disgraced them; and see your own follie in impugning that which cannot be wanted. But what stand I on these things, which experience wil proue to be requisite in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian common wealth, better then speech. It sufficeth me that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitanes
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:2102:218"/>
were long before the Nicene Council accepted and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Church of Christ as necessarie persons to assemble the Synodes of eche Prouince vpon all occasions; and to ouersee as well the election, as ordination of Bishops within their charge. This if you graunt, necessitie will force you to yeeld them the rest, as it did y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Councils &amp; Princes, that were long before our times. If you like not the wisedome and order of the vniuersal and aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church of Christ, you must tell vs in your new platforme, who shall call and moderate Prouinciall Synodes, when occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth; or whether your Presbyters shall bee supreme Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of all matters, without expecting or regarding any Synodall assemblies or Iudgements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Synodes we admit, &amp; some to gather and gouerne those assemblies; but to preuent ambition we would haue that priuiledge to goe rounde by course to all the Pastors of euery Prouince.]</hi> You may doe well to change Deacons euerie day, Bishops euery weeke, Presbyters euery moneth, and Metropolitanes euery quarter, that the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the house of God may goe round by course. And surely you misse not much of it. Deacons and Presbyters dure with you for a yeere; Bishops you thinke in the Apostles times were changed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie weeke; what space, you wil appoint to Metropolitanes, wee yet know not; longer then one Synode I presume you wil haue no man to continue. But what reason or example haue you for it': Examples perhaps as you care for none, so you seeke for none. for if examples might preuaile with you, wee haue the setled and approued order of the primitiue Church against you, that Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politanes neuer went by course. Yea the name it selfe doeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre as much for if he be Metropolitane, that is Bishop of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis</hi> or <hi>Mother citie;</hi> the mother Citie remayning alwaies one and the same, the priuiledge of the Metropolitane could neuer change by course.</p>

Let vs then auouch that this Primacie of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (going round) by course of mutuall succession, was at length by very experience found not to haue force inough to represse ambitious Pastors, neither vaine and flattering Auditors, whiles euery Pastour in his course enioyed this superioritie. Therefore that which was common to all by succession, it seemed good to transferre to one chosen by the iudgement of the whole Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie; the which neither can, nor ought to be reprehended; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since this ancient maner to choose the chiefe of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie was obserued in the famous Church of Alexandria euen from Marke the Euangelist. Another cause of greatest waight without comparison, doeth Ambrose alleage, that this Primacie so going round to euery one by course, some Pastours sometimes were found vnfit to vndertake this gouernment, and thereby it came to passe, that such as were vnwoorthie, oft times ruled the rest, which brought with it the contempt of the Presbyterie, and opened a gappe vnto factions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How farre <hi>Ambrose</hi> is mistaken, I haue shewed before; hee saieth <hi>the Presbyters succeeded in order,</hi> when the place was voyde, but that <hi>they chaunged by course,</hi> hee saieth no such thing. It was a plaine ouersight (I will say no worse) in him that first wrested <hi>Ambroses</hi> wordes to that conceite.

               <hi>disorder and faction, and no whit decrease ambition; and the choosing of one to continue chiefe (for his life) began at A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria from Marke the Euangelist,</hi> (sixe yeeres before <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were martyred, and sixe and thirtie before the death of Saint <hi>Iohn;)</hi> in which there is <hi>NOTHING THAT can, or ought to be misliked.</hi>

            <p>Howe truely hee speaketh, if he should recall, or you refuse his wordes, reason and experience wil easily teach vs. for first in this circular change, it is not casuall, but essentiall, that all in their course, be they fit or vnfit, must haue the ruling of the rest. Now if to choose one good amongst many, be a matter of difficultie; howe impossible then is it, that all should be good? And yet by your rolling regiment, all, be they neuer so wicked or vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, must haue as much time and power to neglect and hurt the Church of God, as the well minding and godly Pastours shall haue to assist and helpe the same. Againe, what good can be done by any, when in euerie action, one must beginne, and another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, and a third conclude? If an euill man light on the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, middle or ending, he may soone marre all. And be the men not euill, except they be like affected and like instructed, when will they agree in iudgement, or tread one in anothers steppes? If any faction arise, I neede not put you in minde what contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting and reuersing will be offered by your weekely or moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gouernours. Who shall dare doe anie thing to a <hi>Presbyter</hi> or Bishop but he must looke for the like measure, when their course commeth? What can be one weeke made so sure, but it may be the next weeke vndone by him that presently followeth? This is the right way to make a mockerie of the Church of Christ; and to permit it to euerie mans humour and pleasure whiles his time la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth.

               <hi>It was long after the Apostles times before Prouinces were diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Mother Cities appointed, and therefore Metropolitanes are not so ancient as you make them; as may appeare by the 33. canon cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apostolike, where the chiefe dignitie ouer eche Prouince, is not attributed to any certaine place or Citie.]</hi> I stand not precisely for the time, when Mother Cities were first appointed in euerie Prouince; howbeit the general Council of Ephesus saith; <note n="1" place="margin">Concil.

            </p>
            <p>Of the Chalcedon Councill you did well to make no doubt; the name of <hi>Archbishop</hi> is so often vsed in the <hi>first, second, third, fourth, fift, eight, tenth, foureteenth and sixteenth actions,</hi> not only in the subscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but euen in the deliberations &amp; decrees of that Council, that with good conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it might not be dissembled.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:2102:223"/>
Now if you suppose these three generall Councils of Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Ephesus and Chalcedon; and all the Greeke Diuines and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there assembled, were so voyde; first of learning, that they knew not the force of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in composition; then of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they would robbe Christ of his proper titles, to increase the pride of men against the trueth of the Scriptures; I must confesse I vtterly dissent from you, the speach is so hard, that I cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest it. if you yeeld them but reasonable skill in their owne tongue, and moderate vnderstanding in the principles of faith, I haue my desire. for then not onely the function and office of Metropolitanes and Primates is as ancient and necessarie in the Church of God, as the hauing and guiding of prouincial Synodes, and confirmed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as lawfull by the foure first generall Councils; but their very names &amp; places were allowed and allotted vnto them by the full consent of the Christian world, euen from the beginning, and neuer since denied or doubted till this present age wherein wee liue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Contention and ambition of Bishops &amp; Primates did much afflict the Primitiue Church, and hinder and disturbe the best Councils, the very Nicene Council not excepted.]</hi> Who doeth maruell that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst so many thousands of Bishops as the whole world yeelded in so many hundred yeeres, there should bee some contentious and ambitious spirites? Or who can performe that those very weedes shal not grow as fast amongst Presbyters as euer they did amongst Bishops? Happily in a citie where the Magistrate seuerely repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the dissention &amp; discord of Pastors, some ten or twelue Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters may either be kept in tolerable peace, or presently ouer ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the publike state; but come once to the gouernment of the whole worlde, as the fathers of the primitiue Church did, and then tell me, not what contentions and factions, but what conflicts and vproares your paritie of Presbyters will breede. Were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours but of England, Fraunce, and Germanie to meete in a free Synode; I wil not aske you when they would agree; but if their tongues be like their pennes there wounde bee more neede of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to part the fraies, then of Notaries to write the Acts. Where the primitiue Church had one <hi>Theophilus</hi> and one <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> we should haue twentie. we may sooner flee their offices then their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; their affections will remaine, when their functions bee alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:2102:224"/>
Where all are equal, there is as great danger of pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as where one is superiour; yea, the prioritie of one man in euery prouince, as we see confirmed by the practise and experience of the vniuersall Church of Christ since the Apostles times, is soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner resisted and better endured, then the waywardnesse and headi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of so many Gouernours as you must and would haue in your changeable regiment of <hi>Presbyters.</hi>
