            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Cannot but with a chearful Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, declare my ſelf under a double Obligation of all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reſpect and Service to your Honourable and moſt Loyal Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and particularly of my preſent Addreſs, tho with ſo minute and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Offering, which hath indeed in you a moſt encouraging Goodneſs to
<pb facs="tcp:44903:3"/>
promiſe, but in it ſelf only the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Excellence of its Subject to ſollicite a favourable Reception.</p>
            <p>The firſt Obligation, is a Debt of Love and Honour; the Heathen could ſee this by the obſcure twilight of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſteeming their higheſt Love and Honour to be their Countries indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible due, firſt, to the King or Supreme, by what Name or Title ſoever digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or diſtinguiſhed; next, to them that are ſent by, or ſet in Authority under him; Laſtly, to the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of fellow Subjects. And ſuch as were their Affections at large to their Countries in general, ſuch alſo were their more particular Propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Devoirs to the particular Places of their reſpective Nativities, which is my preſent behoof.</p>
            <p>In this Ancient Corporation I drew my firſt Breath; and to this
<pb facs="tcp:44903:3"/>
therefore would gladly pay the firſt fruits of my Honeſt (howſoever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate) Endeavours. But to this natural Incitement of Love and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, we have in you the happy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of a moſt generous and noble Loyalty: Loyalty! the grand Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, in one Word, of all Publick and Political Virtue, ſo far forth as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the Subjects; an abridgment, like Love, not only of the Principles of both Tables of Poſitive Divine Law, but alſo of the Fundamental and Unwritten Divine Law of Nature, thoſe Common Notions and Tranſcripts of the Eternal Law, which are none other but the immutable Idea's of Religion, interwoven in the very Make and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contexture of our Beings; for what, but the peaceful Hands of Loyalty, beautiful as the Roſie Fingers of the Morning, preſerves inviolate the Sacred Marriage of the Fear of
<pb facs="tcp:44903:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Lord with that of the King; or (as it is equivalently phraſed) of the Fear of the Lord with the Honour of the King? 'Tis this prevents, with a Golden Chain of moſt harmoniouſly conſpiring Graces, the ſetting aſunder of thoſe whom God hath joined to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether: Nor can ſhe indeed apprehend theſe two capable of a real Exiſtence in a ſtate of Separation; for our Fear of the Deity, and our Honour of Majeſty, as like <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> they are lovely and pleaſant together in their Lives, ſo can they not be other than undivided in their Deaths; like <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Twins, as they live, ſo muſt they dye, (which Heaven ever forbid) dye together, and dye in each others Arms: So that Loyalty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe lights, tho on a Dunghil, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a commanding Luſtre in her Face; but an advantageous ſetting off the Jewel in Generous and Noble Metals
<pb facs="tcp:44903:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(ſuch as your ſelves); as it mightily commends its Beauty, ſo ought propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to heighten its Value: But wherewithal then can I evidence a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate Reſpect? Commenſurate! nay, in any Meaſure competent to ſo much, and ſuch excellent Worth? why in the preſent State of <hi>Truro,</hi> 'tis now (Thanks be to Heaven) eaſie to ſee awful Authority, and a moſt Rational, Ingenuous Candor, going Hand in Hand, and every where to the grief of Faction, but the Delight of God, and all honeſt Men, embracing and greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other with a Holy Kiſs; and certainly ſuch a temperate Body will not expect more from its <hi>Denizen</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, than the circumſtances of their Habitation can diſpoſe them to.</p>
            <p>The thick and miſty Air of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhy, and on every ſide moſt depreſſed Vale, ſerves not for ſuch Noble and Lofty Flights, as the benign Serenity
<pb facs="tcp:44903:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that bleſſes the flowry Banks of <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Cham,</hi> and thoſe ever Springful Bowers of moſt happy <hi>Thames,</hi> where the Muſes have their perpetual Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Imperial Court. As for Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold, ſuch as the more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and Heroical Pieces of Poeſie, I have none; but ſuch as the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Muſe affords, once in the Name of all that's Good, I humbly preſent you with, as the humble Specimens of an unmodiſh, hearty Gratitude: And this is a ſecond Obligation I would have all Men to know I lye under to your Honourable and moſt Loyal Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; a Debt of Gratitude, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of all Debts, and deeply found in Nature: I am (Sirs) undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably ſecured of no Inferior Place in your Favour, by many pregnant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but more eſpecially by your laſt moſt ſenſible demonſtration of Kindneſs, the Character whereof is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibly
<pb facs="tcp:44903:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wtitten in my Heart (as with a Diamond). Nor ſhall the Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame on all ſuitable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be only ingeminated in my Mouth, but alſo ſeconded by agreeable Action, ſo far forth as the Sphere and Abilities, which the Divine Goodneſs hath allotted me to act in, and by, ſhall permit: For ſo abundant and uncontroulably Gracious have been your Condeſcentions, that they are to me in reality as Glorious and obliging as the ſo much celebrated Deſcent of the Amorous God to his <hi>Danaes</hi> in a Golden Shower, could ever be to the moſt credulous Admirers of Poetick Fables: So that (<hi>Sirs</hi>) 'tis not at all to be reckoned amongſt Wonders, that I thus expoſe and hazzard the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reputation of my Parts, to evidence and evince the greater Power and Prevalence of my Gratitude: But to eaſe your Patience, I conclude with the

               <hi>I</hi> Muſt ſatisfy my ſelf in Advertiſing you, on what account my Littleneſs is ſo daring, as firſt, to offer any thing of its own to publick view; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Why a work of this Nature? As for the firſt, I can ſolemnly affirm, I do it not without much painful Reluctance, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the Conſcious and moſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture apprehenſions of my Inſufficiency to produce any thing of a Complexion ſtrong enough to endure an open and piercing Air, which I have good reaſon to expect: But in this Diſpute, the over-ruling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gratitude (as I afore hinted) remains Conqueror, and ſways my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons quite counter to my inclinations. As
<pb facs="tcp:44903:9"/>
for the ſecond, granting I am oblig'd by ſome moral inforcements to appear thus unwillingly publick; why yet ſhould I chuſe to do it in a dreſs of this kind, which by how much the more it is of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Materials, is by ſo much the more of weighty import, and hazardous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? For who is ſufficient for thoſe things? 'Tis the good pleaſure of Heaven, to which we all owe the profoundeſt and chearfulleſt obedience, that hitherto I ſhould remain ſhort of the prime and darling end of my Studies; Namely, of being admitted to ſerve at the Holy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, or of going, not as the <hi>Scribes,</hi> but as one having authority, before the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, into the Houſe of the Lord, in the Voice of Praiſe and Thanks-giving, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch as keep Holy-day; the Prime and Darling end (I ſay) of my Studies; for the meaneſt Door-keeper in the Houſe of God (as amongſt us) Eſtabliſh'd by Law, in a decency and order, well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming

the Beauty of Holineſs, and moſt expreſſive of the Heroical Primitive Piety, I ever Eſteemed infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable to the Proudeſt Prince in the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues of <hi>Corah</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For this reaſon, tho with my heart I abhor all Sacrilegious Intruſions on the Altar, yet fain would I rival the little Sparrow and Swallow in contending for a place to Set and Sing within an allowable propinquity.</p>
            <p>In purſuance hereof, I cannot but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, ſeeing Condemned (as the dumb <hi>Jack</hi> in the Virginals) to a Regretful ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, yet by one motion or other to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomewhat to the general Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in which all Creatures, by the Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Laws of their Creation ought to bear a part; that is, in the Reſounding the praiſes of the moſt Glorious Creator, that great <hi>Harmoſtes,</hi> or Maſter of Harmony, which hath ſo Muſically Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Poem of both the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and Senſible Worlds, in juſt
<pb facs="tcp:44903:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Number, Weight and Meaſure, that each part anſwers other, and all the Whole in moſt Tunable Proportions.</p>
            <p>Nor could I accompliſh this noble end in a more worthy Argument, than a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Contemplation of the Divine Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Works of Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; than which there is no part of Natural Theology more neceſſarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooveful, or more excellently comfortable.</p>
            <p>As to my ſelf, I am fully perſwaded, there is no more efficacious preſervative of the Life and true Happineſs, or a more Vigorous Antidote againſt the Stings of Miſery, than this one conſideration of an All-wiſe, moſt Gracious All-diſpoſing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; a General over the General Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of the World, a ſpecial over man, and moſt ſpecial over good men; which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration buſies it ſelf not ſo much in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (as <hi>Democritus</hi>) altogether with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick Creatures, to ſearch out the ſeat and nature of black choler; as in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting

(if poſſible) ſo malignant a humour; or if not, then in ſweetning the Waters imbitter'd by it, with infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of heavenly Nectar: Which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might prove incomparably more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potable than the bittereſt of the Waters of <hi>Meribah.</hi> And what is ſo ſenſibly evident to me, with immediate reſpect to my ſelf, I am alſo morally aſcertain'd of with Relation to others; and more particularly, my Brethren in Religion, Church and Country; that eſpecially, in theſe diſtracted and troubleſome times, when all order hath been wickedly deſign'd and attempted to be overwhelmed with Confuſion: There is no more opportune conſideration than this, as well for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as pleaſure: Nay, more neceſſary for the ſupport, as well as of the being, as of the well-being of all natural, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all revealed Religion; that being a main prop and foundation of this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44903:11"/>It is true, the Holy Jeſus, God bleſſed for ever incarnate, is the ſole fountain of our true comfort; eſpecially, of that moſt ſublimated comprehenſive comfort, the Peace of God, which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Yet without a previous perſwaſion of this over-ruling Providence, this inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Fountain <hi>(quo ad nos)</hi> would inevitably dry up, as to the Act of affording us any ſolid, either preſent, or hoped Conſolation. But let the good man which exerciſeth himſelf herein to keep a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of Offence towards God and towards Man, carry about in his Boſome an applying conſideration of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: And he is moſt truly the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>NOW becauſe amongſt all Moral &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Vertues, which indeed differ only as the rude and the compleat draught, (Chriſtianity being but <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Morale,</hi> Morality refined and ſublimated to an heroical and diviner pitch); humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and meekneſs are of all other moſt eminently exerciſed by an All-Wiſe, Holy, Juſt, and good particular Providence; and by its exercitations rendred more conſpicuous and reſplendent; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it not impertinent to annex as an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix to the foregoing debate, a Poetical Sermon on each of theſe moſt Divine and Metropolitan Graces.</p>
            <p>Nor may the name of <hi>Sermon</hi> here applied, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any with a ſeeming incongruity, that have but curſorily read (not to ſay any thing of the moſt harmonious Sermons of the Royal and other ſweet Singers of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) the excellent compoſures of at leaſt the <note n="⸫" place="bottom">Horace.</note> Prince, tho not the King of <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, exhibiting Inſtances of the like, both Nature and Title.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:44903:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>And becauſe theſe Mother Vertues, Humility and Meekneſs, never look more like themſelves, than in their genuine and moſt true begotten Daughters, Repentance and Obedience; particularly that which hath for her proper and immediate object humane Power; Obedience to God, never evidencing it ſelf more, than in a reverent and facile ſubjection to thoſe his moſt Wiſe and moſt Good Providence hath thought meet to ſet over us. I have therefore moreover added a Penitential Song in Four Parts; and Three Anti-Phanatical Poems; Anti-Phanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal I call thim, for Phanatical and diſobedient to humane Powers, if deliberately inſpected, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be in truth convertible Terms. Nor could I be diſanimated from theſe endeavours by ſuppoſing Poetry wholly unbecoming Divinity; for the firſt Theology of the Heathen, (as Antiquity tells us) was ſung by <hi>Linus, Orpheus,</hi> and other ſucceeding Poets, who in a ſpecial manner were eſteemed their Prieſts and Prophets; but paſſing by theſe, rather caſt an eye at your pleaſure on the true and ſelect Worſhippers of the One only true God. Here 'tis eaſily obſervable, that in both the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, the moſt ample and cheerfulleſt gratulations for the manifold and innumerable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits daily poured on the whole Creation by his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Majeſty, together with the moſt worthy Praiſes of both the Eſſential Infinite Perfections and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the Divine Nature, and alſo of its communicated Vertues and Tranſplantations of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44903:45"/>
Goodneſs to, and in all rational Beings, particularly Humane nature, were ever eſteemed an eſſential and moſt peculiar part of Divine Worſhip; and the celebration thereof principally performed in Pſalms, Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs.</p>
            <p>This in brief may be a competent Apology for at leaſt the kind of my aſſays, to dreſs Divinity in Poeſie, tho not perhaps for the quality of my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, to wrap ſo noble and high-born a Creature in ſuch ſwadling Clouts, as are the inventions and compoſures of an unfortunate and flagging Fancy. And yet thoſe homely productions may ſerve a little to diſplay the admirable Beauty of Providence in the moſt wiſe diſpoſition of things, <hi>viz.</hi> one in order to the advancement and commendation of the good and Glory of another, and all to the good and Glory of man, Lord Deputy of the World; but ſtill with moſt humble Subordination to the Glory and good Pleaſure of the ſupreme Lord of Lords, who is both <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the one only abſolutely firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ultimate End of all things viſible and inviſible; for the Beauty of this ſenſible World conſiſts chiefly in a well-proportioned variety gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually proceeding from leſſer to greater Perfections, from groſs and heavy Earth, to the thinner and more active body of Water, from water to more pellucid and ſpirit-like Air, from Air to Fire, the ſubtilleſt and moſt vigorous of the Elements; from Fire to Light, the moſt nimble and pureſt of ſenſible Beings. Were the World all Sun, or Stars, 'twould
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44903:46"/>
not be the Ten Thouſandth part ſo beautious, as now a parcel thereof is, Earth, the dulneſs and opacity of the one (as Oppoſites uſe to do) ſetting forth and amplifying the beauty and ſplendor of the other.</p>
            <p>And the Earth it ſelf is never ſo beautiful, as when <hi>dedala Tellus,</hi> (as <hi>Lucretius</hi> ſpeaks almoſt in his firſt ſtrains) arrayed in her Spring Coat of divers Colours; that which is ſad and grave, mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetting forth and commending her gay and flowry parts. Nor is it the leaſt Glory of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, that one Star differs from another Star in Glory. Even ſo in the World of Spirits is there the like gradation in a moſt proportioned variety of Perfection; from the ſpirit of Plants, which is educed out, lives with, and dies with its ſubject, containing only the powers of vegetation; there is an aſſent to the ſpirit of Animals, which is likewiſe educed out, lives and dies with its ſubject; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the powers of vegetation, contains moreover the faculties of ſenſe: From the ſpirit of bruit Animals there is another aſſent to the intelligence of man, unitable and actually united with matter, but in her ſelf and moſt genuine operations imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and immortal, a rational mind vertually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing both the vegetive and ſenſitive ſouls: from the ſpirit of Man at length the aſcent is to Angels, noble intelligences abſtracted from all matter and material conditions; From Angels the laſt aſcent is to the Father of Spirits, an Infinite Intelligence abſolutely abſtracted as to all act and poſſibility, not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44903:46"/>
only from all matter and material, but from all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite conditions, an eternal and immenſible Sea of Perfection, of which all created Perfections are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially dependent derivations, and compared with which, were they all ſublimated into one quinteſſence, the ſame would be infinitely leſs conſiderable, than the minuteſt drop of a Bucket in competition with the whole material and viſible Ocean. Amongſt the Angels, as we are aſſured from the ſacred Oracles, there is a great variety as to ſuperiority and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of Order and Office, ſo by all rational inference muſt there be a diverſity of degrees of Perfection anſwerable to their reſpective Orders and Offices: But in that part of the intellectual World, which comprehends men and humane ſociety, he that runs may read the greateſt variety both in body and mind, of natural and acquired Perfections, and as vaſt a difference of happineſs in the action and exerciſe of either, as great (might I ſay) almoſt as of Faces: All which variety abundantly declares the infinite fulneſs and fecundity of the ſupreme Fountain: For every good giving, and every perfect gift, of what nature and quality ſoever, how mean and contracted, or how large and noble ſoever it be, cometh down from above from the Father of Lights, with whom is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning.</p>
            <p>And tho there are diverſitits of Gifts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Operations, yet they all flow from one moſt Simple, Infinite Spirit of All-Wiſe Goodneſs; which gives and manifeſts in the World, the leſſer
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44903:47"/>
Wits, not only for an agreeable miniſtration to the lower and more ſcanty apprehenſions; but likewiſe as foils to ſet forth and commend the luſtre of the more large and nobler capacities: So that (Readers of both ſorts) the ſum of all is this; You which are of the meaner and more contracted parts, may read theſe with gratitude to Heaven for providing you ſuch ſuitable food: And you which are of the more large and nobler endowments, may read like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and bleſs Heaven in a more ample manner for its amplier and more magnificent diffuſions of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to you, than to others; ſo both and all together may contemplate, admire, and adore the Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Divine Providence in its ſo excellent contrivance of the whole ſyſtem of the ſenſible and intellectual World; to be its own moſt beautiful Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture by a wonderful commixture of Light and Shade in and throughout all its parts; that each one ſhould ſerve to the good and Glory of each other, and all together reflect the Image of the immortal Glory: Which one only Moſt worthy End, Heaven grant that, we may all eternally anſwer in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective capacities. <hi>Farewell.</hi>
