            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>From all which precedent paſſages in theſe two <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> it is apparent.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Parliamentary Councils of that Age, conſiſted only of the King, ſpiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lords and Peers, without any Knights of Shires, or Burgeſſes, of which we find no mention in this, or any other former or ſucceeding Councils, in the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> times; though ſometimes Wiſe-men of inferior quality, both of the Clergie and Laity, were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſummoned to them, without any popular electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the Kings ſpecial direction, for their advice.</p>
                  <p>2ly. That all Divine and Eccleſiaſtical matters, touching God, Religion, and the Church, and all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Realm of publique concernment, relating to war or peace, were debated, conſulted of, &amp; ſetled in Parliamentary Councils. 3ly. That the buſineſſes of God and the Church, were there in uſually firſt deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſetled, before the affairs of the kingdom, of which they ought to have precedency. 4ly. That all private grievances, injuries and oppreſſions done by the King, his Officers, or other private perſons, to the Church, or other men, were uſually complained of, and redreſſed in Parliamentary Councils, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and judgement of the King and Peers; and that either upon the parties Petition, ſetting forth his grievances, or a relation made thereof by the King, or ſome other Prelate or Nobleman, before the whole Council. 5ly. That what could not be redreſſed in one great Council, was in the next ſucceeding Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil revived and redreſſed, according to the merits of the cauſe. 6ly. That no Peer nor Member of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil might abſent himſelf in thoſe times, but upon juſt and lawfull excuſe, which he ought humbly to ſignifie to the King and Council by a ſpecial Meſſenger, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:133360:32"/>
Letter, as Abbot <hi>Siward</hi> did here. 7ly. That all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Council had free liberty of Debate and Vote, in all buſineſſes complained of, or propoſed to them; and a negative, as well as an affirmative voice. 8ly. That all buſineſſes then were propounded and debated before all the Council, and reſolved by them all, not in private Committees. 9ly. That our Kings in thoſe days, in Caſes of neceſſity, could not lawfully ſeiſe their ſubjects monies and plate againſt their wills, to raiſe Soldiers to reſiſt invading forein Enemies, but only borrow them by their free conſents, and held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to reſtore or recompence the monies lent or taken by them in ſuch exigencies, with thankfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement. 10. That our Kings in that age, could not grant away their Crown lands, create or in large San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, or exempt any Abbies from Taxes and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique payments, or impoſe any publique Taxes on their Subjects, but by Charters, or grants made and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in and by their great Councils.</p>

                  <p>From theſe paſſages of our Hiſtorians it is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident. 1. That this Tax of ten thouſand pounds to the <hi>Danes,</hi> was the very firſt we find impoſed on the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Nation, An. Domini 991, being never ſubject to any publike Civil Tax til then, for ought appears by Hiſtory. 2. That this Tax was then impoſed, and after reimpoſed, augmented on the Nation, only by common advice, grant, and conſent of the King, Prelates, and Nobles aſſembled in a publike and Parliamentary Council. 3. That the original ground of granting it was baſe degenerous cowardiſe, or unmanly fear, and ſluggiſhneſs, both in the King, Nobles, and People, and that by the very unlucky, imprudent, ill Council and advice, of an Archprelate, <hi>Siricius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> being the ptinciple adviſer of it. 4ly. That it was originally paid, not to a lawfull Native Soveraign king, for defence of the Nation, but to a forein invading prevailing, victorious <hi>Daniſh</hi> Enemy, to purchaſe peace, and be quit of future troubles and Invaſions. 5ly, That when this was firſt impoſed, it was with a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:133360:82"/>
belief and reſolution never to reiterate or draw it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into cuſtom or preſident in ſucceeding ages: and that only to ſatisfie a covetous invading Enemy for the preſent, without any thoughts that it would but ſtrengthen or encourage their Enemies to new invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tributes of this Nature, doubled and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on the Nation afterwards. Yet loe the contrary ſad effects of this ill preſident &amp; advice. 1. It is within few years after, ſeveral times drawn into Uſe and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom again. 2. It is every time increaſed, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more than other, till it amounted to 4 times as much as it was at firſt. 3. It did but impoveriſh, weaken the Engliſh themſelves, and much ſtrengthen, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their Daniſh Enemies, and keep them ſtill under their Vaſſalage. Whereas ſo much mony or leſs raiſed and ſpent for their own defence againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> would probably have expulſed and beaten them home to their own Country with loſſe, and ſo have prevented their future invaſion. 4ly After the <hi>Danes</hi> were quite expelled, and the occaſion of this tax quite extinct, yet it then became a uſual conſtant ſuppliment to our Kings for ſundry ages after, upon all occaſions, and was the only ground-work, pattern, of all the heavy publike Shipmony, Taxes, Aids, Impoſitions, Payments, under which the people have ſuffered in all ſucceeding ages, till this preſent. It is very dangerous therefore for Parliaments, or Stateſmen, upon any extraordinary preſſing Neceſſity, to lay any new Taxes, Tributes, or Impoſts on the people, and moſt perillous for the people voluntarily to ſubmit unto their payment; for being but once or twice granted, impoſed, paid, and made a Preſident, they are hardly ever aboliſhed or conjured down again, but kept ſtill on foot upon ſome pretext or other; yea oft doubled, trebled, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupled by degrees, to the peoples grand oppreſſion and undoing, as we may ſee by this old Preſident of <hi>Danegelt;</hi> and the late ſad Preſidents of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

time to be revenged of the <hi>Londoners</hi> for making <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> King, marched to <hi>London</hi> with his whole Army and Fleet, beſieged and blocked up the City with his Ships, drawn up the <hi>Thames</hi> on the Weſt-ſide of the Bridge, and then drew a large and deep trench round about the City, from the Southſide of the River, whereby he intercepted all ingreſs and egreſs to the Citizens and others, whom he ſhut up ſo cloſe, that none could go in or out of the City, and endeavoured by many ſtrong aſſaults to force it: but being ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by the Citizens, who valiantly defended the walls, he left off the ſiege with great confuſion and loſs, as well as diſhonor. Thence he marched with his Army into <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> to ſubdue it: Where King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> meeting him with ſuch forces as he could ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly raiſe, gave him battel at <hi>Penham</hi> near <hi>Gilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> where after a bloudy and cruel encounter, he put <hi>Cnute</hi> and his Army to ſlight, and ſlew many of them.

many of each party ſlain, the night conſtrained them to march one from another. But their bloud not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cold, the next day they buckled together again, with no leſs courage than before; till at laſt, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heat of the battel, the moſt perfidious Duke <hi>Edric</hi> perceiving the <hi>Danes</hi> like to be totally routed, and the Engliſh in great forwardneſs of victory, cut off the head of a Souldier named <hi>Oſmeranus,</hi> very like to King <hi>Edmund</hi> both in hair and countenance, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his bloody ſword, with the half gaſping head in his hand, which he lifted up on high, cryed out to the Engliſh Army: <hi>O ye</hi> Dorſetſhire <hi>men,</hi> Devonſhire men, <hi>and other Engliſh, flee and get away, for your head is loſt; behold here is the head of your King</hi> Edmund, <hi>which I hold in my hand, therefore haſten hence with all ſpeed, and ſave your lives.</hi> Which when the Engliſh heard and ſaw, they were more affrighted with the atrocity of the thing, than with the belief of the Speaker: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all the more unconſtant of the Army were ready to fly away. But <hi>Edmond</hi> having preſent notice of this treacherous ſtratagem, and ſeeing his men ready to give over the fighr, haſted where he might be beſt ſeen, and poſting from rank to rank, encouraged them to fight like Engliſhmen: who thereupon reſuming their courage, charged the <hi>Danes</hi> more fiercely than before; and bending their force againſt the Traytor, had ſhot him to death, but that he retreated preſently to the Enemy, the Engliſh reviving, and manfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the battel again till the darkneſs of the night cauſed both Armies voluntarily to retreat, from each other into their Tents. When much of the night was ſpent, <hi>Cnute</hi> commanded his men in great ſilence to break up their Camp, and marched to his Ships, and ſoon after, whiles King <hi>Edmond</hi> was recruiting his Army in <hi>Weſt-Sex,</hi> beſieged <hi>London</hi> again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereupon <hi>Edmond</hi> marching to <hi>London</hi> with a ſelect company of Souldiers, chaſed <hi>Cnute</hi> and his Army to their ſhips,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:133360:107"/>
removed the ſiege, and entred the City in manner of Triumph. <hi>Cnute</hi> and <hi>Edric</hi> perceiving the valour and good ſucceſs of <hi>Edmond,</hi> conſpired together, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him by <hi>Treaſon,</hi> whom they could not vanquiſh by <hi>Armes;</hi> for which end, <hi>Edric,</hi> before King <hi>Edmonds</hi> march to <hi>London</hi> (as ſome) or ſoon after, as others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, feignedly revolted from <hi>Cnute,</hi> and ſubmitted himſelf again to <hi>Edmond,</hi> as his natural Lord: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing his peace with him, <hi>fraudently ſwore that he would continue faithfull to him, only that he might betray him. Edmond,</hi> two days after he had chaſed the <hi>Danes</hi> from the ſiege of <hi>London,</hi> purſuing his victory, paſſed over the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Brentford,</hi> where, though many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were drowned in paſſing over the River, through their careleſneſs, yet he there fought with the <hi>Danes</hi> the fourth (or tather fifth) time, routed them, and won the field. After which, <hi>Edmond,</hi> by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Edric,</hi> marched again into <hi>West-Sex,</hi> to raiſe a more numerous Army, to ſupply thoſe who were drowned and ſlain in this laſt battel: Upon which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the <hi>Danes</hi> again returned to the ſiege at <hi>London,</hi> invironing, and fiercely aſſaulting it on every ſide; but being valiantly repulſed by the Citizens, they retired from thence to their ſhips, and ſailed into the River of <hi>Arewe;</hi> where leaping out of their ſhips, they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout pillaging in <hi>Mercia,</hi> killing all they met, and burning the Villages, returning to their ſhips with a great booty: Another company of their foot ſailing up the River of <hi>Meadway,</hi> pillaged <hi>Kent,</hi> their Horſe marching thither by Land to meet them, doing the like, waſting all places with fire and ſword. King <hi>Edmond</hi> having in the mean time raiſed a ſtrong Army out of all <hi>England,</hi> paſſed over with them again at <hi>Brentford,</hi> to fight the <hi>Danes,</hi> and giving them battel near <hi>Oteford,</hi> routed the whole Daniſh Army, not able to endure his fierce charge, and purſued them as far as <hi>Ilesford,</hi> ſlaying many thouſands of them in the purſute; and had

But perfidious Duke <hi>Edric</hi> by his moſt wicked Counſel (the worſt ever given in <hi>England)</hi> cauſed him to give over the chace. Whereupon the flying <hi>Danes</hi> eſcaped into the Iſle of <hi>Shepy.

And therefore he might as groſly miſtake in other things. 4ly, It appears by the recital it ſelf, that it was writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 130 years at leaſt after this Council under <hi>Cnute,</hi> becauſe it recites, it preceeded the Decrees made ſo long after, under Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> An. 1150. 5ly.

For after kiſſes of peace given, and joyful banquets, in the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the midnight, when as <hi>Alfred</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions had given their Members to ſleep, they were all taken unarmed in their beds, ſuſpecting no harm, by a multitude of armed men ruſhing in upon them, and their hands being tyed behind their backs, they were compelled to ſit down in order one by another: Where ſitting in this manner, <hi>nine of them were always beheaded, but the tenth diſmiſſed, and his life reſerved for a time:</hi> Theſe things were acted at <hi>Gildeford,</hi> a royal Town. But when it ſeemed to the Traitor <hi>Godwin,</hi> that there were more yet remaining alive of them, than was profitable, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them to be tithed over again, as before, and ſo very few of them remained alive. But young <hi>Alfred,</hi> every way worthy of royal honour, he ſent bound to the City of <hi>London,</hi> to King <hi>Harold,</hi> (that therby he might find greater favor with him) with thoſe few of his followers who remained undecimated. So ſoon as the King ſaw young <hi>Alfred,</hi> he cauſed him to be ſent to the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and there to have his eyes pulled out; of the pain whereof he ſoon after died; but he ſlew all his Souldiers too perniciouſly.</p>

If there were then any ſuch Parliament as this then held at <hi>London,</hi> and ſuch proceedings in it concerning <hi>Godwin</hi> it was moſt probably in the year 1043. as I here place it. And from theſe memorable proceedings in it, we may obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is mention onely of the King, Earls and Barons preſent in this Parliament as members of it, not of any Knights of ſhires, Citizens or Burgeſſes elected by the people, of which there is not one ſyllable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Earls and Barons in Parliament were the onely Judges in that age in Parliament between the King
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:133360:136"/>
and his Nobles, ſubjects, both in criminal and other cauſes there decided.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Peers in that age were onely tryed and judged by their Peers, for treaſon and capitall offences.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That appeals of Treaſon were then tryed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Earls and Barons the ſole Judges of them, and of what offences were Treaſon and what not.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Biſhops and Clergy in that age bad no votes in matters of Treaſon and capitall offences.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Judgement of Parliament then reſted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly in the Earls and Barons, not the King: and that their judgement was not repealable by, but obligatory to the King himſelf.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That no Subject could then by law wage battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King in an Appeal.</p>
               <p n="8">8.

               </p>
               <p>From all which relations compared together, it is apparent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Dangeld was a great, moſt heavy, and intolerable Tribute, firſt impoſed in King Ethelreds reign, to pay the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Navy, and Souldiers then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading <hi>Englana,</hi> to keep them from plundering, and ſpoiling the people.</p>
               <p>2. That King <hi>Swane</hi> the invading and uſurping Dane, after he had gotten the power of this Realm, impoſed it annualy on the Engliſh, and made it <hi>any early Tribute to pay his Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That the <hi>Daniſh</hi> ſucceding Kings continued, and made it a kind of annual revenue to cloath, and pay their Souldiers and Marriners, for ſundry years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>4. That it was yearly paid unto the Kings Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and reduced to a certainty, to wit, four pence a year, out of every Hide, or plough land, thorowout <hi>England,</hi> or elſe twelve pence or two ſhilings a year; as the laws of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor: the black Book of the Exchequor;</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his Gloſſary, <hi>Title Danegold,</hi> affirms.</p>
               <p>5. That King <hi>Edwards</hi> Officers after the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Kings expired reignes, did collect it of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects, without his privitie, to cloath, and pay his Souldiers and followers.</p>
               <p>6. That he out of mercy, piety, conſcience and juſtice to his people; not only reſtored it to them, when collected, and brought into his Exchequer, without retaining one farthing of it, but likewiſe for
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:133360:144"/>
ever releaſed it to them, ſo that it was no more col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, during his reign.</p>
               <p>7. That Taxes unjuſtly leavied upon the poor oppreſſed people, are very pleaſing and acceptable to the devill himſelf, who claimes the money ſo colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for his own; and that the Collectors, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of ſuch Taxes, (though for the payment of Armies and Souldiers) are really, but the devils agents, and inſtruments, who will one day pay them their deſerved wages.</p>
               <p>8. That heavy oppreſſions and taxes (though for pretended publike neceſſities) continued for many years together, ought not onely to be eternally remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but reſtored, when collected, by all conſcientious, pious, righteous, mercifull, Saintlike Kings, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</p>
               <p>9. That illegall heavy Taxes impoſed by, or for invading Uſurpers, if once ſubmitted to, and not ſtrongly oppoſed by the generality of the people, wil ſoon be claymed, &amp; leavied as a cuſtomary, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly legall revennue; both by the impoſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs, and their ſucceſſors, and hardly be laid down and diſcontinued again for the peoples eaſe.</p>
               <p>10. That this tax of <hi>Danegeld</hi> amounting but to thirty eight or fourty thouſand pounds in one whole year, was in truth, an heavy, and intolerable burden, and grievous oppreſſion to the whole Nation, fit to be aboliſhed, and releaſed eſpecially in times of dearth and ſcarcity; Therefore certainly our late illegal taxes, without authority of a free and legall Parliament, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to 120. 90. or 60. 1000 li. monthly, when loweſt; beſids Exciſes, Cuſtomes, Impoſts, amounting to twice as much more, muſt certainly be far more grievous &amp; intollerable to the Nation, and ſo not onely to be remitted, abandoned, excluded, but accounted for, and reſtored to our exhauſted, oppreſſed Nation, by all thoſe Governours, who pretend themſelves ſaints

of the higheſt forme, and men ruling in the fear of God; againſt whom this St. <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> will riſe up in judgement, if they imitate not his juſt and Saintlike preſident therein.

The Kentiſhmen having thus encloſed him round about, caſting down their boughs, bended their bowes, drew out their ſwords, ſhaked their pikes, held forth their other arms, diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their banners, and ſounded their trumpets in token of battel. The Duke and his Army being herewith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, (though ſo puffed up with their former late victory, that they had even now, to their ſeeming, the whole Realm of <hi>England</hi> in their hand) were ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily terrified herewith, that they ſtood in danger not only of the loſſe of the Victory and Army, but he even of his own life.

Neither will they be reduced under Bondage never yet felt by them, nor tolerate any new Lawes; For they can bear Royal Authority, but not Lordly Tyranny. Wherefore receive the</hi> Kentiſhmen, <hi>not as thy Servants, but as thy loyal, loving and affectionate Subjects. Yet upon this condition, That all the People of Kent may for ever enjoy their antient Liberty, without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and uſe the Laws and Liberties of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.

               <p n="1">1. That King <hi>William</hi> alwayes claimed the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> both before, at, and after his Coronation, as <hi>of right belonging to him,</hi> by the promiſe, gift, contract, gift and bequeſt of <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> and as his heir and next kinſman by the Mothers ſide.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he alleged, this gift and grant of the Crown to him, to be made with the conſent of the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Earls <hi>Godwin, Syward,</hi> and other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Realm; ratified by ſpecial Meſſengers ſent unto, and Hoſtages delivered him for its performance, and by <hi>Harolds</hi> own ſolemn agreement and Oath, ſent
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:133360:185"/>
to him by King <hi>Edward</hi> for that purpoſe, as himſelf at leaſt ſuggeſted to him: which deſignation and grant of King <hi>Edward</hi> to <hi>William,</hi> was no fiction; but a truth confeſſed by all our Hiſtorians, and <hi>Harold</hi> himſelf, who by his anſwers never denyed, but only endeavoured to evade it, and voluntarily acknowledged by all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>England,</hi> both at his Coronation, and in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf in the 4. year of his reign.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That after King <hi>Edwards</hi> deceaſe, divers of the Nobles would have elected <hi>William</hi> King, in purſuance hereof, but that <hi>Harold</hi> perjuriouſly uſurped the Crown by meer force and power, without the leaſt right unto it, or any election by the Lords or people; ſetting the Crown on his own head the very day King <hi>Edward</hi> was interred, and thereby prevented <hi>Williams</hi> election to it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That hereupon divers of the Nobles, Prelates, and other Engliſh, ſent private Meſſengers to <hi>William</hi> into <hi>Normandy</hi> to come and demand his right to the Crown, as due unto him; promiſing hoſtages and their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to recover it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That thereupon he ſent Embaſſadors twice or thrice to <hi>Harold,</hi> one after another, before his landing, inſiſting on his meer right and Title to the Crown, to gain it by parly without effuſion of bloud.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That upon <hi>Harolds</hi> obſtinacy, he appealed to the Pope, and to all his Nobles aſſembled in a Parliamentary Council, for the juſtice of his Title and Right to the Crown, who <hi>declared his Title Lawfull</hi> and Juſt; and thereupon encouraged, aſſiſted him all they could to regain it by force of arms from the Uſurper <hi>Harold,</hi> who would not otherwiſe depart from it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That immediately after his landing he made claim unto it only by the foreſaid Right, Title, and thereupon <hi>prohibited his Souldiers to plunder the Country or hurt any of the Inhabitants, as being his by right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. That very few of the Engliſh Nobility or Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:133360:186"/>
would march or engage with <hi>Harold,</hi> againſt <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> and ſundry withdrew themſelves from the battel, as conſcious of <hi>Harolds</hi> uſurpation, perjury, and <hi>Williams</hi> juſt cauſe againſt him, (however other cauſes were then pretended) and amongſt the reſt, his own Brother-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws, the greateſt Peers of the Realm, Earl <hi>Morcar</hi> and <hi>Edwin,</hi> deſerted him in the fight.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That after the firſt battel won and <hi>Harold</hi> ſlain, all the Prelates and <hi>Clergy</hi> generally (except <hi>Abbot Frederick)</hi> appeared for him, and would not conſent to ſet up <hi>Edgar,</hi> though right heir.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That after good deliberation, all the Nobles, Prelates, <hi>Londoners,</hi> and others who firſt appeared for <hi>Edgar,</hi> with the greateſt part of the Clergy, people of the Engliſh Nation, without the leaſt fight or reſiſtance, or before any ſiege or ſummons from him, together with Prince <hi>Edgar</hi> himſelf, voluntarily went out, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves, ſware faith and allegeance to him as their Soveraign, at <hi>Berkhamſted,</hi> and after that joyfully received him with higheſt acclamations as their lawfull King, at his entry into <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. That all the Prelates, Clergy and Nobility ſoon after, without any coercion, upon his foreſaid right and Title, freely elected, and ſolemnly crowned him as their lawfull <hi>King, in a due and accuſtomed</hi> manner, and then did Homage, and ſwore new Allegiance afreſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as their rightful Soveraign.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That he took the Ordinary Coronation Oath of all lawfull Kings; to mainitan and defend the rights, perſons of all his people, to govern them juſtly, &amp;c. as became a good King; which a King claiming by meer conqueſt, would never do.</p>
               <p>All theſe particulars are undeniable Evidences, that Duke <hi>William</hi> never made the leaſt pretence, claim, or title to the Crown and Realm of <hi>England,</hi> only as an <hi>abſolute Conqueror</hi> of the Nation, but meerly by Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as their true and lawfull King, by deſignation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:133360:186"/>
and cognation, ſeconded with the Nobles, Prelates, Clergy, and peoples unanimous election: And although it be true, that this Duke ejected <hi>Harold</hi> and got actual poſſeſſion of the Throne and Kingdom from him by the ſword, as did <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> and others before, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. <hi>Edward</hi> the 4. <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. with others ſince his reign; yet that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, nor could make him, <hi>a King by conqueſt only,</hi> no more than theſe other Princes, ſeeing the end of this warr was not againſt the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, the greateſt part whereof ſecretly abbetted his intereſt; but only againſt the unjuſt <hi>Uſurper</hi> and <hi>Intruder</hi> King <hi>Harold,</hi> and his adherents; not to create a Title to the Realm, by his and their Conqueſt, but to remove a U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper, who invaded it without and againſt all right, and to gain the actual poſſeſſion thereof by arms, from which he was unjuſtly withheld by force, againſt thoſe pretended lawfull Titles which he made. So that he got not the Right, Title, but only the actual poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Crown by his Sword, not as a univerſal Conqueror of the Realm without right or Title, but as if he had been immediate heir, and lawfull Succeſſour to the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> who deſigned him to ſucceed him.
