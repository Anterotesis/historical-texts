         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is the happy advantage of
our Contenplative Life above
all others, that we can never find

<hi>Idle;</hi> and when we have
a <hi>Writ of Eaſe</hi> given us from
more ordinary and neceſſary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
even in our relaxations

to Speculation will find out ſome
matter or other to work on, and
buſie it's ſelf about; and it can
as little be wholy <hi>repoſed</hi> from
that <hi>activity</hi> and motion, as
the Sea from agitating and

the iſſue of my improvement of

is worſe, like <hi>Spiders,</hi> to gather

            <p>As for this manner of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:47340:6"/>
ſome have thought it as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous

               <p>SOme are ſo Curious as to
conjecture that Chriſt's

Mentall but vocall, inferring
it from the manner in which
the Evangeliſts relate it, <hi>he
prayed Saying;</hi> which they will
have to imply an audible

               <p>However, whether we have

I think there is ſome advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

only, (although it be all one to

               <p>1. In that by joyning a
voice to our Mentall prayer,
our Affections are more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened

find by experience, that the

may not expreſſe it ſelf in

               <p>2. It limits the mind more
and keeps it more fixed and

which the Scripture o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen's
to us of <hi>Eternity,</hi> my
contemplation ſometimes pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
me in the midſt of that

<hi>Lazarus</hi> in the boſome of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and <hi>Dives</hi> in the
midſt of foul <hi>Fiends,</hi> with
eyes directed, now to the
conſideration of the one, then
of the other. Whither are
all the Rich man's joyes fled
in which his ſoul was ſteeped
and inebriated? what's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of his heightned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
his Muſick and
Maſques, Unctions, Feaſtings
ample buildings, and large
and jolly entertainments, his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47340:33"/>
train of attendants, the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
and the <hi>fine Linnen,</hi> his
wanton pleaſures and the
whole <hi>Pageantry</hi> of his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe?
On the other ſide,
where is the miſery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibleneſſe,
the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and hunger, the aches
the ſoars and the ſtench of the
poor man? Theſe things are
all vaniſhed: and the Scene
is altered. Their <hi>paſt</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is changed into a <hi>preſent</hi>
as different each from other
as Heaven from Hell; and
the <hi>preſent</hi> is fixed in a ſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as unalterable as <hi>Eternity.</hi>
Let us conſider and weigh
their Purchaſes in the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance</hi>

Rich man's exchange is, the

for <hi>a ſeaſon</hi> for thoſe dreadful

Delights that are as

that no Metaphor can equal
or Hyperbole tranſcend them
in expreſſion, ſo <hi>durable</hi> that
they ſhall run <hi>parallel</hi> with
<hi>Eternity.</hi> The Poor man's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
is, from a <hi>ſmall weight</hi>
of infelicity to an <hi>exceeding
weight of glory,</hi> from a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe
to a Land flowing
with plenty; from a Croſs to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47340:34"/>
a Crown; from tears without
their <hi>ſaltneſſe,</hi> ſorrows depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

as much without a <hi>period</hi> as
<hi>Eternity</hi> it ſelf. And who but

the <hi>Father? O miſerable hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of the one that concluded
in everlaſting miſery! O happy
miſery of the other, that ended

               <p>IT hath been a matter of no
ſmall debate where <hi>Paradiſe</hi>
was ſituated; ſome placing it
beyond an immenſe Ocean,
others by an extravagant fancy
have made a room for it near
the <hi>Moon's</hi> Orbe, ſome in the
third <hi>region</hi> of the aire, others
have ſet it under the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial,</hi>
moſt in or about <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia:</hi>
But the enquiry is
as fruitleſs as it is curious; and
the certaineſt determination
we have of it, is that which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
it in <hi>Terra incognita,</hi> I
mean out of the Sphear of our

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47340:132"/>
that now the Scripture ſpeak's
of is that <hi>third heaven</hi> into
which S. <hi>Paul</hi> was rapt. I will
not employ my ſelf to ſeek
where that Paradiſe was which
we loſt, while I know where
that is which I muſt buſy my
ſelf to ſeek. Our ſin ſet the
guard of the Cherubins and
flaming Sword at the entrance
of that, and hath ſince ſpoiled
and defaced it's glory; our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
hath opened a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to this, and hath prepared
it for a reenſtatement of us in
happineſs; and this which our
<hi>ſecond Adam</hi> hath purchaſed
doth in as great a portion ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
that which the <hi>firſt Adam</hi>
loſt, as the higheſt heavens do

Do feel them break a paſſage free</l>
            <l>For my glad ſoul unlinkd to flee</l>
            <l>On flaming charriot of Deſire!</l>
            <l>Oh! I'de rejoyce thus to expire,</l>
            <l>And in theſe beames my Death to find,</l>
            <l>To cinders <hi>Phoenix</hi> like calcind.</l>
            <l>Or that by large and laviſh grief</l>
            <l>While woing heaven for deaths reliefe</l>
            <l>In ſilent tears (tears without noiſe</l>
            <l>Are louder languag'd then a voice)</l>
            <l>My heart might quite diſſolve and melt,</l>
            <l>Till in the ſwelling ſtreame I felt</l>
            <l>My ſoule to make its vent, and fly</l>
            <l>Waſted to Heaven in one great Sigh.</l>
