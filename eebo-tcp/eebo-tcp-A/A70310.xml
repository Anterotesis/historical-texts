            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that vaniſhes into an <hi>Inſignificant

<pb facs="tcp:46500:4"/>

            <p>Preambles and Allegories, have been

an intent by Delightful Vanity, <hi>To

            <p>Touching the Original; Know, 'twas
my good hap to Arrive at <hi>Bilboa,</hi> juſt
when this Ingenious Piece of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> was taking Poſt
<pb facs="tcp:46500:4"/>
from a <hi>Chandles Shop,</hi> to the <hi>Land</hi>
of <hi>Oblivian.</hi> By this means I had
the Opportunity and Succeſs, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
from the Teeth of time, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Paw of Deſtruction, This ſo Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and pleaſing a <hi>Tract, Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in Spaniſh;</hi> whoſe beauty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to me in <hi>Tatter'd Robes,</hi> to
be the very <hi>Emblem</hi> of <hi>Eternity,</hi> it
having neither begining nor end; and
therefore the more juſtly I call it a
piece of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>It was very much defaced; <hi>Time</hi>
or <hi>Accident</hi> having <hi>Worn,</hi> or <hi>Torn</hi>
out thoſe <hi>Characters,</hi> which ſerve for
diſtinction of <hi>Ages;</hi> as alſo our <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers</hi>
Name; Except in one place,
where was Remaining thus much of
the <hi>Mouſe-eaten Author, <hi>Don Q.</hi>
               </hi>
And from hence I concluded, it muſt
be either <hi>Quevedo,</hi> or <hi>Quixot;</hi>
but that it was rather the former:
I offer this Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Becauſe, He of all the Spacious and
Flouriſhing <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:46500:5"/>
only Valiant to a Miracle: He that
never flinch'd at a Voyage to thoſe
Dangerous <hi>Caverns,</hi> in <hi>Plutos Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean
Dominions;</hi> was only capable
to undertake this ſo hazardous a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
Through the Confines of <hi>Terra
Auſtralis Incognita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you may Anſwer, that was but
a <hi>Dream,</hi> Why? may be ſo too; and
what if this ſhould prove no more, for
it ſeems as unlikely to be reall as
that; but I hope if our Circumſtances
can prove our Indefatigable <hi>Don</hi> the
<hi>Author,</hi> it will be ſufficient to gain
your good Opinion, and Acceptance;
and pray why may not we allow him
to walk in his ſleep, as well upon the
<hi>Surface</hi> of the <hi>Terreſtial</hi> Globe, as to
the <hi>Centre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further to Convince you, I
aſſure you the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> was excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Smooth and Eloquent, in which our
Elaborate <hi>Don</hi> was the <hi>Nonſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then Indeed the Character was
<hi>Black, Knotty, Rough</hi> and <hi>Uneven;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:46500:5"/>
Like the Notes in <hi>Gamut,</hi> well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by him; but allmoſt uninte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligable
to a Shallow Capacity. And
hence a ſeeming Objection may ariſe,
in the Opinions of ſuch as knew the
fairneſs of his Writing: but in my
Conceipt, is anſwered with this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Think you that his intimacy with
the <hi>Internals,</hi> could not obtain for
his Attendant, one of <hi>Plutos Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi>
to note, and tranſcribe what his
Curioſity Obſerved; yes doubtleſs;
and 'tis the rather my Opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it ſeem'd to be Written with
a <hi>Cloven hoof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſo, how far the Courteſie exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Common favours, Judg ye, when
the <hi>Devil</hi> to Accomodate him, ſhould
leave thoſe <hi>Hot Subterranean Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
and expoſe himſelf to the <hi>Sharp
Ayr,</hi> under the <hi>South Pole,</hi> and run
the hazard of getting a <hi>Kentiſh Ague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe Arguments I Conclude
in the Affirmative, and I would have

               </p>
               <p>Their Old Records do report, that
in former Ages, there were two
Rich and Potent Cityes, <hi>Fleſh-ton</hi>

ſtood much upon its Antiquity, but

Continuance with her own preſent

               <p>Well, a <hi>Parliament</hi> was called,
and Finally, the whole Houſe with

unto <hi>Fleſh-ton. Py-nople</hi> thus diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
decayed to nothing, ſo that it
is at this day almoſt Impoſſible
to know where it ſtood. Now
<hi>Fleſh-ton</hi> grew more and more in
Luſtre, and both to add a Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
to the Name, as alſo to
paſte the Foile of <hi>Py-nople</hi> upon the
Forehead of poſterity. It left the

laſt Syllable of its Old Name, and
Aſſumed the two Laſt of <hi>Py-nople,</hi>
joyning them together with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whereof their Antient Walls

               </p>
               <p>Touching the form, it is rather

Spring-Water Running almoſt

impaled Fiſhponds, wherein they
keep <hi>Swans, Geeſe, Ducks, Teals,</hi> and
all kinds of Water-fowl. This Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
is called <hi>Gravie-Channel.</hi> The
City is Double-walled about with
the Bones that remained of their
Carnival Feaſtings. Theſe Bones
are Artificially and with Judgment
cemented together with Morter
made of the whites of Eggs. Their
Houſes within are neither too State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nor too Lofty. They love no
Aſſents by Staires up to their Doors,
partly, becauſe 'tis dangerous to

throughly moiſtned; and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis toileſome to climb up,
when their Bellies are bumbaſted.
Inſtead of <hi>Lead, Tyle</hi> and <hi>Slat,</hi>
their Houſes are all Rooft with

               </p>
               <p>The City is Govern'd by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

ſtiled <hi>Alder-maws,</hi> who are
not Elected for their Wiſdom, their

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46500:17"/>
but by the circumference of their
Paunches, which at a ſolemn ſet
Feaſt once every Year, are Meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the more that each mans
Rotundity is found to be inlarged,
unto the higher place he is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Advanced: But if either ſickneſs,
or age, do chance to make any of
theſe <hi>Alder-maws</hi> caſt their Collops,
they are immediately put off the
Bench; and as they have loſt their
Greaſe, ſo muſt they loſe their Grace
at a clap: Why this is hard now:
but 'tis true, as hard as it is I can
tell you that.</p>
               <p>The Geometrical form of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is Oval, and hath four Gates;
at which there do daily attend
courſe by courſe four <hi>Alder-maws,</hi>
Selected to the Office of <hi>Supervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of the Paunchery;</hi> and theſe are
to examine all that come in, and
go out, and to mind that none go
out Faſting. If they find any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſo offending, he is condemned
to eat two Suppers. They are alſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46500:17"/>
to mind that none come in Empty-handed:
for not to go out full-Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied,
and not to come in full-Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is an heinous contempt of the
Cities Right-healthful Government.</p>
               <p>Every Month they are bound by
Law to Celebrate a ſolemn Feaſt,
where every <hi>Alder-maw</hi> of the whole
Society muſt be preſent, to conſult
about the Publick good: Their
place of meeting is <hi>Gurmonds</hi> Hall,
where being met, and having tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their Wine into Water, and
their Oyſters into Shells: Every one
takes his Chair, and to Dinner they
go: Now, they may not in any caſe
have their <hi>Boars, Sheep, Goats,
Lambs,</hi> &amp;c. ſerv'd up in Parcels and
Joynts, but they muſt have all whole.
You ſhall ſee the waiters come
ſweating with a whole <hi>Hogg,</hi> or a
whole <hi>Calf,</hi> upon a great Pewter En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine;
you would bleſs your ſelf to
behold it: and he that riſeth before
ſix hours be fully run, runs his

               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:46500:18"/>
And for the breaking up of the
Feaſt, thus is their Order. They
have a Door in the Hall, large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for the greateſt <hi>Gutmonger</hi>
that lives, and take him faſting. At
this Door they enter when they
come to the Feaſt, which being
ended, he that cannot get his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through, is let forth another way;
but he that paſſes as eaſily as he
came in, is ſtay'd by an Officer
appointed for that purpoſe, called
the <hi>Sergeant</hi> of the <hi>Maw,</hi> and
brought back again, where he muſt
ſeetle himſelf to a renewed Rouſe,
untell his Belly be able to kiſs both
the Cheeks of the Door at once,
and then he is diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>They have a common <hi>Hoſpital</hi>
belonging to this City, wherein all
ſuch as have got the <hi>Dropſie</hi> or
the <hi>Gout,</hi> or any ſuch diſeaſe, by
his Valour in Gurmondizing, are
Maintained at the Publick charge.</p>
               <p>But all ſuch as have loſt their
Teeth by Age, or by eating their

               <p>The Citizens are Generally of an

juſt like ſo many Tunns, moving

that man worthy of the leaſt Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

               <p>And ſuch ſhapes do the Women

               <p>They go for the moſt part all

               <p>Their Schools have no Lecture
Read in them, but only <hi>Apicius.</hi>
His Inſtitutions of the Art of <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie,</hi>
and there are all the young fry
taught the Sciences of Carving,

<hi>Full-Gorge;</hi> a man moſt rare in his

               <p>Their Library is a large Room
ranked full of Pots and Cans of all
ſorts, every ſort in their ſeveral

each his full Pot, and his laden
Platter for his Book. The Freſh
men have leſſer meaſures; the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters
larger, and ſo up to the
Graduaits. The firſt perhaps has
his Pint, and his Pullet; the next, his
Quart and his Gooſe; the third, his
Pottle and his Lamb, and ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46500:19"/>
Nor may any leave his
Task, or have leave to play, till
he have made an end of what was
injoyned him.</p>
               <p>If any one ſtay Seven years in
theſe Schools, and benefit nothing, he
is forthwith Baniſhed for ever into
the <hi>Starveling Iſles,</hi> or <hi>Hungerland,</hi>

with half Pilchards. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
alſo they thruſt all Phyſitians,

of them be ill at eaſe, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eats a raw Radiſh, drinks a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
hot Water, Spews a while, and
within a quarter of an hour, <hi>Viah</hi>

his roaſt as ſound as a Bell.</p>
               <p>They love veniſon entirely well,
but cannot tell how to catch it; only
ſuch Deer as comes willingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, thoſe they Intangle
in Nets, and take them. But the

Beaſt above all others! whether

uncapable to determine.</p>
               <p>If any one keep his provant while
it ſtinks, he is forthwith condemn'd
of High Treaſon, and ſpitted upon a
Stake. Only two Reſervations their
Law agreeth unto; The firſt is, they
may keep Veniſon till it be all
Hoary, and Mouldy; And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is, they may lay their Cheeſe
where they think good, till it be
ready to creep away with Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots:
To theſe Worms they uſually
ſcrape a little fine Sugar, and with
the point of a Knife, or a Spoon,
craſh them up as if they were ſo

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46500:32"/>
whoſe Borders extend as far as <hi>Vine-Prop</hi>
hills; ſo that ſome of it became
part of the Suburbs of <hi>Cluſter-Beg,</hi> a
prety fine City wall'd about with
Stones of the Colour of Brick, but
ſomwhat deeper of Dye. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtands in the bottom of <hi>Preſſing-Dale,</hi>
a Valley ſo called; through
which runs a delicate River called
<hi>Juce,</hi> which paſſeth along by three
or four pretty Cities, ſeated upon the
the Banks thereof, to the founders
eternal commendations.</p>
               <p>Their names are, firſt <hi>Tankards-Bridg,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tunning-Tree</hi> is fortified with a
wall of wood, and <hi>Broaching Ford</hi>
hath never but one gate open at
once; and that when it is ſhut, is
made faſt with nothing but the end
of a Faggot ſtick. There is not in
all the World any one River com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
to this, which runs through
theſe Cities; for beſides the pleaſing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46500:33"/>

courſe; the water is ſo ſweet
and delicate, that neither the beſt

<hi>Zerbeth</hi> can poſſibly excell it.</p>
               <p>It hath but one peculiar Fiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to it called a <hi>Tap,</hi> and this
Fiſh will ſomtimes lye by the Shore,
and ſpout a huge deal of the water
aloft; and it is ſomewhat more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in taſte than before, and this
the Inhabitants watch for in Boats;
and when they get it, make great
ſtore of it.</p>
               <p>This River, as I told you, paſſeth
through <hi>Tunning-Tree:</hi> but hold, I
had forgotten one Town, it goeth
from thence to <hi>Celleridg,</hi> ere it come

               <p>The City is built upon a Hill,

               <p>It is of Antient Renown, and one

               <p>In the entrance of the gate is

Law Commands to be duly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;

               <p>But by chance, I met with a

with their faſhions, brought
me ſecretly by night into the Town,
and ſhew'd me ſuch things as I

               <p>The Fronts of their Buildings are
ſo wholly hid with ſpreading Vines,
that had I not ſeen the Signs hang

In the Market-place are all the

with the Dukes Stamp.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants go all naked,
but for a Wreath of Vines about
their Fore-heads; but their skins
are all painted after the manner
of the Ancient <hi>Picts,</hi> every one
after what form he pleaſes: you
ſhall ſee ſome ſo perfectly painted
like Flaggons, that if one of them
ſet but his Armes a Kimbo, you
wou'd ſwear it was a living <hi>Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
with two Handles: I ſaw one
painted ſo directly in the ſhape of
a <hi>Whale,</hi> that when he Vomited,
no Man in the World, but would
have taken him for a live <hi>Whale</hi>
Spewing up the Ocean.</p>
               <p>I had a great deſire to ſee the
manner of their Publick Feaſts, and
not be ſeen by the Citizens; and
mine Hoſt with much intreaty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to perform my Requeſts,
giving me withal certain Cautions
of Danger; and likewiſe informed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46500:35"/>
me in ſome neceſſary Points of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour;
So mine Hoſt and I got
us into the Town-Hall in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
un-eſpyed, by and by came
the Feaſters, and taking their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
juſt as the <hi>Eat-All-Mains</hi> did,
only theſe had leſs Meat, and more
Drink.</p>
               <p>At firſt they began a Sacrifice to
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> their general god, whoſe
Statue ſtandeth at the upper end
of the Table, holding in his right
Hand ſupported by his left, a
mighty <hi>Goblet:</hi> into this ſtanding
Cup, the Maſter of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
in the Name of the whole
Company, pours a Hogs-head of
Wine (for it holds no leſs) which
paſſeth in Pipes, as through Veins
into his Body, and from thence he
piſſeth it, till it be all out; and
this is the Hour-glaſs, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the continuance of the Feaſt;
for when he leaves pouring out,
they muſt all leave pouring in, and
that upon pain of Sacriledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:46500:35"/>
Then comes up a Service; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
at firſt ſight, I took it for a
Diſh of <hi>Shooing-Hornes,</hi> but upon
ſtricter Obſervation, found they
were <hi>Red-Herrings:</hi> There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a Diſh of <hi>Anchovis,</hi> with <hi>Capers,</hi>
and <hi>Pickled-Cowcumbers;</hi> and laſtly,
a <hi>Weſtphalia-Gamon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then begins the Full-pots to move
about the Table, and the empty
ones againſt the Wall; ſo that one
could not poſſibly tell, whether
they were ſooner fill'd to be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied,
or emptied to be fill'd.</p>
               <p>Now, when one of them will
Drink to another, he firſt Challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him with a Solemn Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Song: Then they joyn hands
faſt together, and giving a ſound
ſhake, the Challenger Advanceth
his moiſtned Weapon, and blowes
it dry: he may puff a little, but
the Pot muſt be ſure to be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged

the other anſwers him at his own

               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:46500:36"/>
Well, the Seaſoning Banquet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Devoured, and the Cloath thruſt
up on a heap: The Maſter of the

times, with an Audable Voyce:
And I ſuppoſing this had been a

till my Hoſt pulling me by the
Sleeve, told me, the Feaſt was
hardly begun: Pray ſtay (quoth
he) and ſee the Concluſion; don't
you ſee how faſt god <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s
Hour-glaſs Runs? So I ſate down
again.</p>
               <p>Then ſteps me out one of the
Company, and taking off his Wreath,
down upon his Knees he falls, (I
thought he had been going to
Prayers) and preſently calls for a
Quart. A Health quoth he to Great
<hi>Bowſing-gut Wool-ſack Duke</hi> of <hi>Belly-All-Main,</hi>
and preſently the Pot
ſtops his Breath, he Drinks, he Puffs,

               <p>Well, they all follow in Order,

               <p>This Showre over-blown, out

the <hi>Quagmiriſts,</hi> which is the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

Foundation of a new Round.</p>
               <p>Now every man having his

(Pox on't that Madded me) go

of <hi>Bacchus</hi> only, every one
Sings his own Song; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Harps, they have their
Knives and the quart Pots, and
truly they made fine Muſick on't.
One in his Song commends his
Miſtriſs, another the Goodneſs of
the Wine, a Third Relates all the
Paſſages between him and his Wife
at home, another Rhimes all in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
againſt one that was not at this
Drinking, every one keeping Tyme
with the Muſick.</p>
               <p>While theſe Songs were Singing,
it was ſtrange to ſee their ſeveral
Poſtures, and Behaviours; you ſhall
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46500:37"/>
ſee one for pure Love weeping in
his Fellows Boſom, another ſit kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Companion, one in an Extaſie
of Laughter, though himſelf knows
not at what, another down upon
all four in Devotion to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Arguing of Religion, and
matters of State; and here in a
Corner, you ſhall have another ſit
Nodding, and Slavering: 'Twould
do a Blind mans heart good to ſee
it. But all this while the Cup is
not forgotten.</p>
               <p>Well, the Hour-glaſs being run
all out, they Riſe (if they can)
and with wheeling Complements,
are taking Leave of each other.</p>
               <p>One thing my thought was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Obſervable; they have certain
<hi>Flamins,</hi> who are Prieſts to <hi>Bacchus,</hi>
who frequent theſe Revelling Feaſts,
they go Cloathed only in a Gown
of Black, girt about their Waſtes,
with a Silken Cord; and ſeeing
theſe amongſt the reſt in motion, I
could not chuſe but ſmile; for their all
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46500:38"/>

Faces,</hi> ſeemed juſt like ſo many
<hi>Charcoles</hi> lighted at one end, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

Multitude.</p>
               <p>Well, but quoth I to mine Hoſt,
how the Devil will they get all
home now? Fear nothing quoth
he, don't you ſee thoſe Ropes there
in the Court, that are faſtned to

Officer who is always kept Sober
for the purpoſe, he guids each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

as good to them, as the Clue of
Thread in <hi>Roſamonds</hi> Bower, or
<hi>Ariadnes</hi> that guided <hi>Theſeus</hi> from
the Labyrinth of <hi>Minotaur:</hi> very
likely quoth I, But what if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Wag ſhould come in the

end to the wrong door? Why,
do you think, quoth he ſmiling,
that any are awake in this City in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46500:38"/>
the Night? Yet I have known it
done, and the men have gone to bed
to other mens Wives, who perhaps
being as Drunk as they, never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the matter till next day
at noon, and then, that which they
ignorantly committed, they make
a double ſport of, and is but the
Preface to repeated Impreſſions.
For it is a Principle here, that a
Drunken man can never Offend,
it being the Effects of <hi>Bacchus.</hi>

being throughly tap-ſhackled, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the Window for the door, and
ſteping raſhly on, down he came
with the wrong end forward, and
in plain Engliſh broke his Neck.</p>
               <p>His Funerals was very richly ſet
forth; I can tell, for I was there;
every man was painted over with
black for that day, and wore a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
wreath inſtead of his Vines.
The Body was not laid in a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin,
but put into a Cask half full
of Wine, and ſo Boarn to the Grave,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46500:42"/>
and rouled in rather to a Ciſtern
of Sack, than a Grave of Earth;
and was rather drown'd, than bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;
each one having inſtead of
Roſemary, a Kan of Wine his hand,
which they threw into the Grave,
Kan an all; and taking their leaves
in theſe Words, thrice repeated,
<hi>Adieu ſweet Corpulent Country-man:</hi>
and inſtead of putting finger in Eye,
each thruſts his finger into his
Mouth, and diſgorges, inſtead of
tears ſome Quarts: Then hand in
hand to the Tavern they go to drink
his Remembrance.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Quagmiriſt</hi> it ſeems was well
eſteemed amongſt them, for he had
a Statue erected in <hi>Bacchus</hi> Court,

               <p>Now I had ſtaid two dayes in

               <p>At laſt I overtook a Traveller

Bare-Foot and bare-Headed, and
demanding whither he Travell'd;
Sir quoth he, on Pilgrimage to St.

helps may do me much good,
for I am a man ſo imployed in my

nor never Riſe in the Morning; but
before Noon, I am Drunk and faſt
aſleep again: therefore have I gone
theſe three days without Drinking,
becauſe I would merit the more of
this Holy Saint, when I come there:
nor dares any importune me to

               <p>I was glad of ſo good a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and intreated his Company

Chatting on, untill I obſerving the

now?</p>
               <p>This Country (quoth he) ever
ſince we came over the <hi>Lake-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theglin,</hi>
is called the County of

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46500:45"/>
yet is more fertil than our

of Soil, and pureneſs of Ayr;
the People of this Nation are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
Slovenly, and of a Fierce
and Terrible Aſpect, yet they uſed
us very kindly; we lodg'd in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
City, (I have forgot the Name
of it) very quietly, for we found
almoſt all the Town dead Drunk,
at our coming; and left them ſo at
our parting.</p>
               <p>And next day Travelling through
many Craggy, Fenny, Woody paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages,
we arrived at a Famous Port-Town
called, <hi>Aqua Fort:</hi> (Now
quoth I) being as weary as a Dog,
is not this <hi>Bottles-brook?</hi> No (quoth
he) but chear up, for we go not a
Foot more by Land, all the reſt of
our Journey is by VVater.</p>
               <p>VVell, to Ship we went, and by
this time imagine us Lanched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Main Ocean; but what an
eminent Danger, think you we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
there? Our Marriners were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46500:45"/>
all as drunk as Wheelbarrows, not
a man could guide himſelf, one was
aſleep at the <hi>Helm,</hi> another going
about to Row, fell overboard; whom
two more ſeeking to hall up again,
had not we two held them, had
both fallen after; a third quarrels
and layes a fourth over the Pate
for not helping his fellow, he ſtrikes
again, and too't they go, fight <hi>Dog,</hi>
fight <hi>Bear:</hi> All the reſt divided
themſelves into two partyes; now
flew the ponderous Oars about their
Ears, and hand Spikes and Pump-ſtaves.
The water was quiet, and
every one uſed his Oar in the Air;
but indeed they were eaſily knocked
down, whoſe <hi>hamſtrings Bacchus</hi> had
already cut in two, only two ſtood
Conquerors, who being too weary
of the Maſſacree fell upon us; but
we ſcorning to be put down by a
couple of walking Tankards, got
up a Brace of Cudgels, diſarm'd
them, bound them faſt to the Maſt,
and play'd the Sailors our Selves;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46500:46"/>
but our Veſſel ſympathizing with
her Antient Maſters, did ſo reel from
ſide to ſide, that had not a brisk
gale ſprung us forward, we had laid
our Bones in the Bottom of thoſe
Seas.</p>
               <p>As we paſſed on, I deſcried aſ-far
off a high ſmoaking Land, and
enquiring of my Fellow Traveller
how it was called: <hi>That Smoak</hi>
quoth he <hi>comes out of Mount</hi> Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,
<hi>wherein the Souls of ſuch as lived
too ſober, are purified by Fire, until
ſome of their Living-Friends go on
Pilgrimage to</hi> Chappel-Ardent <hi>for
a Bottle of St.</hi> Brochio's <hi>Liquor, and
powring it upon their Tombs they are
freed.</hi> I ſmiled at this, and thought
now ſure I have found the Original

               </p>
               <p>Well, by that time our Sailers

approach, we with comfort had the
proſpect of our deſired Port, which
in little time (though with great

Ship had ſo jumbled my brains to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

Taylors for Bottle-Caſes. So that

had utterance for their Hides.</p>
               <p>The Men of this Town and
Country, uſe no pure Wine, but
certain Diſtilled Waters, mixed with
the ſtrongeſt Grape that they can
get, which are ſo forcibly hot, that
the brittle Glaſs cannot hold them;
and therefore they are driven to
fortify their Bottles with Leathern
Dublets, Rivetted together with Pitch
and Rozin.</p>
               <p>The Citizens are fiery of Face,

moſt terrible of all, they drink and

they belch nothing but Flames:

known unto you, that we took this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
in the Confines of that damn'd
Country of</hi> Letcheritania, <hi>who are a

               <p>She having made an end of my

my Nation to be Old <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>

Telling her Ladyſhip that it would
derogate much from her Nature

               <p>Well, theſe good words I can tell
you wrought ſo pretty well, that the

I met many of my own Country
men (was it not very ſtrange in
a Country ſo remote) whom I knew
by ſight as well as a Beggar knows
his diſh: Theſe Acquaintance (like
true Friends) gave me Cautions from
their own Experiences, of what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
might attend me in
ſtaying here Long, or being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious
to inſpect their Cuſtoms and
Manners; alſo giving me ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
which with heed I Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
And following their Advices,
found the way (at length, though
with much difficulty,) through the
dirty Fens of <hi>Blubberick,</hi> over the
<hi>Muſhrum-Palian</hi> Mountains, and ſo
arrived upon the Confines of <hi>Fooli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you may ask why I travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
not into that part where the
<hi>Modeſtianians;</hi> otherwiſe called the
Women of <hi>Black-Swan-Mark</hi> had
their Habitations.</p>
               <p>Why truly, I hold my ſelf In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
in that one thing alone,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46500:61"/>
That I could not come to ſee their
State as well as the reſt; ſeeing that
my mind preſaged unto me, that it
excelleth all the forenamed.</p>
               <p>There is ſuch a People, my friend,
I tell thee plainly, but the Region
wherein they Inhabit, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to diſcover; only their
name, I had from the Antient Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles
of the others States, and that
as I ſaid, is <hi>Black-Swan-Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed there are ſome of them

                     </gap>;</hi> but their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are generally unknown, and
almoſt Inacceſſible; he that will take
the pains to ſearch thoſe vaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts,
may by Miracle meet with
ſome of thoſe holy <hi>Votareſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I happened, I think, unleſs it was
a Dream, to ſee one or two of them,
whoſe variety of Virtues, Beauties
and Behaviours, have left me in an

If ye come to any of them all with

They have ſome <hi>Phyloſotterical</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors

due.</p>
               <p>But for them to force a loving

               <p>This City ſtands at preſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:46500:70"/>
So famous for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Pendants, Knots, Fanns
and falſe Curls for the Females:
Here alſo was found out that moſt
Incomparable Faſhion of <hi>Sholder
Taſſells,</hi> by which any Ingenious
Man with careful Obſervation, may
come to know his Right hand
from his left, and therein readily
anſwer the Querieſt without ſtudy.</p>
               <p>As I Travelled along the Valley
<hi>Capricious,</hi> I chanced to enter a
Town that had ſome ſhape of an
Univerſity: The Name they told
me was <hi>Gallipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilliter;</hi> here I met
with ſome Shadows of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi>
but no ſubſtance: It is loſt labour
to look for any Lectors, Rectors,
Books, or Schools of the Seven Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
here; every particular man
being his own Teacher, and his
own Auditor: Yet here are two
Colledges; one of the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> who
deny that any truſt is to be given
to the Sence; and they are herein
ſo abſolute, that they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46500:71"/>
any thing poſitive. Steal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
one of their Purſes, or his
Gown, and he preſently falls in
doubt, whether ever he was poſſeſſor
of ſuch a thing or no. Strike one
of them as hard as you can, he
doubts whether you ſtruck or not,
or whether he felt any ſtroke or
not. Speak to him, or touch him,
though he hears, feels and ſees, yet
he dares not aſſure himſelf, that any
one thing of this is true.</p>
               <p>The other Colledg, conſiſteth
wholly of <hi>Gewgawiſts,</hi> who give
themſelves wholly to the Invention
of Novelties; in Sports, Games,
Buildings, Garments and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
He that can deviſe a new
Game, or a New faſhion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Invention, hath a place
of Dignity Aſſigned him by the
Duke.</p>
               <p>He that firſt Invented to blow
bladders of Sope and Water out of
a Galli-pot with a Tobacco-pipe, is
of as great Renown among them, as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46500:71"/>
the Inventers of Printing, Gun-found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the moſt Ingenious of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-works
are amongſt us of <hi>Europe.</hi>
Theſe <hi>Gewgawiſts</hi> are in great eſteem
at Court, and among the meaner
ſort too; for many of them will not
ſo much as have a Button ſewed to
their Coats, without firſt conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Approbations.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Gewgawiſts</hi> are not only
Scholars, but Originals, for they
have deviſed a new Language,
wherein they keep the Myſteries of
their knowledg only to themſelves:
It is called the <hi>Supermonical</hi> Tongue,
<hi>Parracelſus</hi> was provaſt of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
whoſe Judgment went a great
way in the Invention of this ſtrange
Language. But indeed, I am not
ſure whether this Tongue continues
ſtill amongſt them, or has by this
time given place to ſome Language
of the Later Edition.</p>

Scituate in the very heart of <hi>Lyers-Bury-Plain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They never budge abroad in the
day time, but keep within-doors,
and contrive, what they bring to
Action in the Night: They hate
the <hi>Sun,</hi> and love the <hi>Moon</hi> with

               <p>The Trees of this Soyl are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally

No Bird can light upon them,

               <p>The Chief Town of traffick in
theſe parts is <hi>Pick-Pocket-Angle,</hi>
wherein are two Streets, <hi>Tongue-Street,</hi>
and <hi>Pawns-Brook,</hi> which in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46500:100"/>
my judgment, exceeds all the Streets
of any one City in the World, for
length and ſtatelineſs of Buildings.
<hi>Tongue-Street</hi> is the general Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz
of all the <hi>Lawyers;</hi> and <hi>Pawns-Brook</hi>
of the <hi>Brokers, Vſurers, Taylors</hi>
and <hi>Scriveners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis moſt certain, that no Nation
under the <hi>Moon</hi> is ſtored with <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi>
as this is, who if they want
means of Contention, play the
Seedsmen themſelves; ſowing the
Seeds of Animoſity and Diſcord
among their peaceable Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> adding all the

               <p>Their Numbers do daily encreaſe;
yet notwithſtanding, it is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the wiſeſt Polititians of this
Land; that they cannot continue
long; for when they have eat up
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46500:100"/>
the whole Country, as they have
almoſt done already; they muſt
needs decline for want of Clyents,
unleſs by the want of buſineſs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

out, and go to Law one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and by that means diſperſe
abroad what they have Ravenouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
claw'd together, among the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
again; and indeed, by this
means, they may leave to their
poſterities, a proſpect of more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
and better imployment, in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Times.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Lawyers Footmen</hi> are cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Knave of Clubs,</hi> to ſignify that
their Maſters are ready to take Fees

               <p>The Uſurers afford them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
part of their imployment;
but principally the violent Current
of the River <hi>Fraud;</hi> which running

away one piece of Land here, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46500:101"/>

               </p>
               <p>Nature has wrought a very
ſtrange work upon the Inhabitants
of this Town; their Skins do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
attract Gold and Silver,
with as powerful a ſtrength as the
Loadſtone draweth Steel, and holds
it as faſt: If a piece of Gold touch
but their hands, it ſticks ſo cloſe,
that it is impoſſible with all your

thence; a thing never ſeen elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,

               <p>
                  <hi>Pawns-Brook</hi> is peopled with all

Trading to this City, (no

more buſie and leſs careful, ſlides
his hand gently into the Trap,
which the Gentleman all this while
obſerved, but took no ſeeming no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,

               <p>There are in this Town more

They do eat earth as the Woolf

               <p>They ſerve a God, whom they

On the Banks of this dead Sea,

               </p>
               <p>The Citizens are unwilling to

               <p>This City was lately invaded,
by the Valiant <hi>Mendico,</hi> Son to
<hi>Tatterdemallion</hi> Duke of <hi>Ragland.</hi>
The Reaſon of which Invaſion was
(as I am inform'd) That whereas
the Inhabitants of this Province,
were Obliged by certain Articles,
to defend and protect the Tatter'd
Offspring of the Duke of <hi>Rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
They have of late, not only
withdrawn their aſſiſting <hi>Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
but likewiſe committed many
Outrages upon his Subjects, having
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46500:105"/>
lately Murdered one of his Antient
and Dear <hi>Allies,</hi> called <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi>
and ſorely bruiſed another, called
<hi>Charity,</hi> which Cruelty was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by Sir <hi>Laviſh Lackwit,</hi> Son-in-Law
to the Lord <hi>Covetous Rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi>
by driving a <hi>Coach</hi> full of
<hi>Ladies</hi> (with <hi>Six Horſes)</hi> over
them.</p>
               <p>The aforeſaid <hi>Mendico,</hi> with a

a Confedracy with, and Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of, two other Valiant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
drew up his forces againſt
this City, and beſieged it: Theſe

During this Siege, many Sallies,

for the moſt part being the

Reſolute and Fatal Sally of Captain
<hi>Tallymando,</hi> who with a Party of
Foot, Conſiſting of <hi>Marſhals-men,</hi>
made great havock amongſt them;
ſo that what with the hardſhips
of a long Siege, and being infeebled
with dayly Loſſes, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
to quit their Stations, and
leave the Citizens to their Antient
Liberties, whilſt the Recruitleſs
<hi>Raglanders</hi> with their Weather-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

               <p>Touching the other Cities of this
