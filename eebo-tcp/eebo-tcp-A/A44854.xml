            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>So far hath the Author been from pressing any Texts to serve him, that they have pressed him in their service; he thought to have gon but one mile with them, and they made him goe with them twaine.</p>
            <p>These Texts found him as <hi>David</hi> found the <hi>Amelekites</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, faint, and sick, and hungry, and ready to die, but by their Spirituall revivings, they put strength and life into him, to make discovery of those accursed <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who have totally devoured <hi>Ziglag</hi> the Kings and the Churches inheritance.</p>
            <p>This weake Tract beggs of you (most reverend Fathers) as that fainting Aegyptian did of <hi>David,</hi> that you will not kill it, nor deliver it into the hands of these <hi>Amalekires.</hi> It lies at your mercy, and without your mercy, at the merciless cruelty of brutish, and unnaturall men: it is as <hi>Lot</hi> without doors, in the midst of <hi>Sodom,</hi> unlesse you prove its gardian Angells, and pluck it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The subject of the Treatise is unquestionably excellent, it is of the Apostasie and the Antichrist, and of the finishing and

            <p>Apostates, those Vipers within the belly of the Church, have gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their way out through the bowels of it, and they proclaim it impudently, that the Reformed Protestant Religion is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism; which is as much as to say, except you utterly renounce it, you will undoubtedly be damned by it: this our <hi>quondam</hi> brethren, and fellow Professors of the same Religion with us, say against us and our Religion, from which they have Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statized.</p>

No man (much lesse the Divel, that spiritual Fouler, that great spider of hell) will lay snares to catch tame birds that he hath in a cage already. As Christ by his spiritual fishermen catcheth souls in the Divels ponds and feeds them in his own: so the Divel alwayes goes about with his unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nets and poisonous baits to catch men in Christs pond, the Church, and carry them into the black sea of eternal misery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where the spiritual seed is sown, there the birds of hell will be picking, and plucking of it up.

            <p>Soon after this, Churches became Sanctuaries for Thieves and Murderers, by the Popes order; Lay-Monks were made equal with Ordained Ministers in the execution of their Office: Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at the Font were forbid to marry each other: Churches were superstitiously deck'd: Holy-dayes appointed, and superstitiously enjoined; Priests strictly forbidden to marry, and enjoined to shave<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 1, 2, 3</note> their heads; Latine Service introduced by Popish injunction into other Churches; upon which the Popes daily inchroached by the usurpation of their Faction in other Nations: Christian Burial was prohibited to those persons, be they never so great, that should deny the Popes Supremacy; the Liturgy of the Church augmented and put into tune to be sung; the Paxe injoyned to be kissed, the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped Title of the Vicar of Christ given to Popes, and the Roman Emperors Authority contemned by them; they making their leige Masters to kiss their feet: Images were brought into the Church, and Emperors not permitted to pull them down: Rebellion against Emperors was taught upon this account, so that the Emperors for withstanding Images, lost the Roman Throne. Sacrifices and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were enjoined to be made for the dead: Kings of forrain King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, were by the Popes Usurpation, dethroned; Bishopricks, as it were by a Conquest, subjected daily to the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> Bastards, Bribers, Rebels, beastly Fellows, Atheists, and Magicians, for the most part, possessed the Episcopal Chair of <hi>Rome;</hi> which makes <hi>Bellarmine</hi> call these times, <hi>Saeculum insoelix.</hi>

the prevailing Faction in <hi>Rome</hi> gave themselves to such abominable wickednesse, and persisted in it; so that one in his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned History of the Roman Bishops, saith, They proceeded from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping <hi>Nimrods,</hi> to luxurious <hi>Sodomites;</hi> and from luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Sodomites,</hi> to Egyptian <hi>Magicians;</hi> and from Egyptian <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians,</hi> to devouring <hi>Abaddons;</hi> and from devouring <hi>Abaddons</hi> to incurable <hi>Babylonians:</hi> yet it is most probable that in <hi>Rome</hi> it self there were to be found Godly Ministers and people, that were none of the time servers, as it is manifest there were in other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where the Popes and their Faction usurped a Power.</p>
            <p>This is most certain, that in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, until the Pope and his Faction became incurable <hi>Babylonians,</hi> men might with freeness profess and practise the principles of true religion: The Apostles Creed, the ten Commandments, and the Lords Prayer, the sum of a Christians Faith, Worship and Obedience, were alwaies in profession maintained in the Roman Church, though violently oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the wicked practices of the Pontifick Professors.</p>

            <p>The Pope and his faction fearing to what this of <hi>Luthers</hi> might come, writ to the Emperour and the <hi>German</hi> Princes to suppresse <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrines. Thereupon, a general councel was desired as the means of reconciliation, which was at last granted, and called to sit at <hi>Trent.</hi> They had three severall meetings at <hi>Trent.</hi> In the third Session of the first meeting, they, i. e. the Popes packt party, decreed, that the old Latine translation should only be used and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick in Schools and Churches. In the fourth Session they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that original sin was so taken away in Baptism, that the concupiscence which remains after Baptism, is not to be accounted a sin untill we consent thereto: and farther they decreed as truth, that the Mother of Christ was not conceived in original sin.</p>
            <p>In the fifth Session they decreed, that since the fall, there remains a freedom in mans will to good, which being excited, concurrs with Gods grace.</p>
            <p>In the seventh Session, seven Sacraments were decreed; after this, the Pope removes the Councel to <hi>Bononia,</hi> which discontents the Emperour, which puts an end to the Councell for that time.</p>
            <p>At the second meeting of the Bishops in the councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> declared (as the Queen of <hi>England</hi> before had done) that neither he nor his Subjects were bound to obey a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bishops, whose design was meerly thereby to advantage the private interest of the Pope, to the generall disprofit of the Church.</p>
            <p>At the second Session, the doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> was established.</p>
            <p>At the third Session, that pennance and extreme unction were
<pb facs="tcp:52152:9"/>
new Testament Sacraments. At this Session the Protestants would, but were not permitted to bring in their confession of faith, the Popes Legat withstanding them. The warrs then breaking out in <hi>Germany,</hi> the councel was dismissed.</p>
            <p>Nine years after, they met again the third time. At the fifth Session whereof, they decreed, that it was in the power of the Pope to dispose of the Sacramentary elements as he saw expedient for the good of the people, provided that the substance were kept. Thus denying the cup in the Communion to the people.</p>
            <p>At the sixth Session 'twas concluded, that the whole Mass was a propitiatory sacrifice for quick and dead, and whoever should say otherwise, should be accursed.</p>
            <p>At the eight Session, they pronounce him accursed who shall deny that the Church hath power to dispense with Gods Law, <hi>Lev. 18.</hi> in giving liberty to incestuous matches against the word, and forbidding lawful matches according to the word.</p>
            <p>At their last Session, they confirmed the doctrine of Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, bowing to images, giving of indulgences, and preserving of reliques; and with an excommunication of all hereticks in generall, they dissolved the counsell.</p>
            <p>By excommunication of all hereticks, they meant all those that should withstand any of their cannons which they had decreed. Here the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Protestants parted; and if it be seriously viewed on both sides by a clear and impartial eye, 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that the Church (if you'l call a faction so) of <hi>Rome</hi> left us. Pope <hi>Adrian 6.</hi> acknowledged, that the Church and chair of <hi>Rome</hi> was at that time in many things abominable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>German, English,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches desired that those abominations might be purged out; for this end a generall councell was desired, and under pretence of granting it, a party of men were packed to oppose this end, and carry on a contrary designe, to the ruine of those who desired a reformation; and in stead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving those grievances, established them: Which now of these two parties is in the right? They that kept their faces <hi>Zion</hi> ward in the reformation of a Church generally acknowledged to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; or they that hardened their necks in a resolved obstinacie to persist in that corruption, and added much more abominable corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, and established it by a law, and made those that depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their abominations, to become a prey to them.</p>
            <p>This is the true case betwixt us and <hi>Rome:</hi> The faction of
<pb facs="tcp:52152:9"/>
               <hi>Rome</hi> pretended with us (whose hearts were set upon a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to reform; but in stead thereof established those very grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Church complained of; hereby 'tis manifest, that they star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aside like a deceitfull bow, left us in the high way of a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. If we have left them, 'tis because they have left the truth; whiles error was in a private faction in <hi>Rome,</hi> though 'twere damnable, yet we left not that Church; but when that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate faction so prevail'd as to establish damnable heresie by a Law, and excommunicated all that would not drink of the same poisonous Cup with them, then 'twas high time to leave their Communion, notwithstanding they usurp the name of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> left not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> because governed by Bishops, but because those Bishops were become <hi>Starrs fallen from heaven to earth,</hi> apostatized <hi>toto coelo,</hi> from their primitive institution. The See of <hi>Rome</hi> is become the <hi>beast of the Sea, with seven heads and ten hornes, and upon it's heads the names of blasphemy:</hi> The inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of <hi>Romes</hi> fornication, therefore we come out from <hi>Rome:</hi> and herein we have obeyed the voice of our Lord Iesus, <hi>Revel. 18. 4.</hi> We never held Bishops, <hi>quatenus</hi> Bishops, Antichristian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though many Schismaticks and ignorant zelots have builded high upon that stramenous foundation; which since, the Iesuites by their Gunpowder plots, have neatly fired about their ears.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, the German, French and British reformers that left <hi>Rome,</hi> or rather, were left of <hi>Rome,</hi> could never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that reformation was requisite, and they desired; and the reason thereof is generally known: For <hi>Rome</hi> with her Allies was alwaies so potent against them, that it is rather to be admired they have a being, then to be complained of that they have attained to no better a being. The Churches beyond the Seas, both in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many and France, by reason of their innumerable number of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent enemies, were constrained to do what they might, not what they would: happy they that they may eat the Manna of true Doctrine, though under the tents of an incompleat and insollid government. Those Churches are like the wounded man betwixt <hi>Jericho</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> they have met with a friend that hath powred oyl into their wounds, and brought them to an Inn; but that Inn of government is not (I think) their proper home; however, happy they, they are got safe out of the bloudy hands of Romish theeves, unto that Inne;
<pb facs="tcp:52152:10"/>
God send them from thence safe home. Let's be thankful for pure Doctrine, that the Ark; but lets not rest till we have lodg'd it within the Temple of right Government.</p>
            <p>I have oft thought, that the white linnen of the Saints, signifies the right Government of the Church, which is the Churches upper garment: if so, then let them wait with patience; for this white linnen they shall not wear untill the Witnesses are risen: the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are yet in sack-cloth, or actually slain; when they are resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, this white Vesture of Church-Government shall be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Church in splendor. Let us not censure, but pity and pray for those Churches that have not on this white garment: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident I am, that it is not for want of will, but power, that all this while many reformed Churches have it not on. I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <hi>Bergermannus's</hi> words in the Assembly of Dort (as I have them from a good hand) to the Bishop of <hi>Landaff;</hi> who, when he had declared to him how the cause of the German divisions was for want of right Discipline, he makes this affectionate replie in the midst of that Assembly, <hi>Domine, nos non sumus adeo f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>The Churches that protested against the Babylonish abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons established by the Popish faction at the councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> have ever since born the name and title of the Reformed churches; not that all or any of them are perfectly reformed; for many of them are corrupt in severall doctrinal points, and the most of them deficient as to the pattern of primitive government, or as the sacred Rule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p>Amongst these reformed churches, <hi>England</hi> hath alwayes been esteemed the purest, as being most conformable to primitive purity and the word, both in Doctrine and Discipline. This appears even from the pens of the Heads of other Reformed churches; such as <hi>Calvin, Camerarius, Melancton, Bucer, Beza, Zanchie, Molinens, Causabon, Fergevil, Saravia,</hi> and others, who many of them confesse in plain words, and all by consequence conclude, That the church of <hi>England,</hi> of any church in the world, comes the nearest to the Apostolick rule.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this, what by reason of the Popish pollutions on one hand, and schismatical Separatists on the other hand, the church of <hi>England</hi> could never put on that white garment of pure Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline she so much endeavoured: for though the Temple of Doctrine was purged, and the walls of Discipline raised to a comely height, under which the church flourished in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> and King
<pb facs="tcp:52152:10"/>
               <hi>James</hi> his dayes; yet the Romish foxes in sheeps clothing crept up the wall of Discipline in King <hi>Charles</hi> his time, and laid the church open (as it is this day) to the bloudy cruelty of the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians. The popish Prelats (or rather the Spanish Faction, then and ever since prevailing, informing them) knew the way to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Doctrine was first to bring in popish Discipline; which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a double effect tending to their end: For hereby cities and counties (<hi>non ignota loquor</hi>) were filled with superstition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse, having liberty from the Prelates to profane the Lords day: and we all know how great enemies superstition and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse have in all ages been to a powerfull and orthodox Ministry. Which Ministry was hereby not onely exposed to the scorn and hatred of the people, but also made liable to the Prelates persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for did they but withstand their popish Innovations, or but a little swerve from their rigorous injunctions, immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed bitter persecutions: thereby many eminently learned and godly Ministers (as you may read in Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> Lives, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Writer) were silenced, suspended, vexed, discouraged, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred, imprisoned, and some inforced to leave the Kingdome: Mean while, superstitious, scandalous, popish and profane persons were admitted into Orders, countenanced, encouraged, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Thus did the prevailing Faction of popish Prelates (for all were not so) prove like those Angels <hi>Revel. 7. 1.</hi> holding the winde of the Gospel from blowing on the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Nor was this all; but needs must these Popish Reformers go to <hi>Scotland,</hi> an ancient Reformed Church, that was no enemy to the ancient primitive Government of Bishops, and kept the Doctrine of Christ pure, though God, for her security and profaneness had many things against her, of which this rod was a special warning.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> rejecting the usurpation of the English Prelates, who did <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52152:11"/>This War begun by them, was the beginning of the Brittish Wars, which Wars have ruined the Brittish Royall Family, the Brittish Nobles, with many of their Families, the ancient Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Laws, and the Brittish reformed Church, and all begun by a brutish Clergie in that Church: <hi>Cursed be their wrath, for it is cruell.</hi> These fire-brands of State made the Bishops odious to the Gentry and Commonalty of both the Nations; insomuch that when a Parliament was called, which they were accidentally the cause of, a certain party of the Commons of the Parliament, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the preposterous Petitions of the over-zealous people, and ('tis more then probable) incouraged by some of the covetous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, who thereby intended to make purchase of their Lands, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to be satisfied with nothing but the utter extirpation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy. Here a fallacy was put upon the honest hearted Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in the Kingdome; for the subtil Lawyers of the House of Commons, whose Speeches were alwayes most prevalent in that House, envying the wealth and dignity of the Clergie, vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pressed, that in stead of questioning the guilty, they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse all the Bishops; and in stead of questioning their persons, they would pul down their Order, purposely to take away the Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This was carried on by a private faction of Polititians in the House, who drew in many honester then themselves into the Designe; which, although not then, yet since hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>The Prelates (it mainly concerning them) at that time clearly discovered the Designe, and thereupon were most firmly united. Whereas, had it been for a personall reformation amongst them, (which the grave and moderate Members desired) or removing Innovations brought in by the Popish Faction amongst them, they would many of them have hung more loose, if not altogether sided with the Parliament against the upholders of any Doctrines or Discipline against the true Reformed Religion: especially since the King declared himself at this time for a reformation of abuses crept into the Church, and having respect unto tender conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But here lieth such a mystery of iniquity, that the wisest and most scruti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ous in States mysteries cannot discover. On whom to charge the overthrow of Episcopacy, and the Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of a long time continued in their hands, in the general wee know: but on whom to charge the designes against the Protestant Religion in their overthrow, we know not; or at least wise, <hi>nunc non est narrandi locus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52152:11"/>It is true, the Primate of <hi>England</hi> with the insolent faction at Court, became odious to the Nobility and Gentry about the Court; and those of his faction elsewhere stepping up into civill Offices in the State, made them odious to the Lawyers of the Kingdome, whose Offices they usurped.</p>
            <p>The schismaticall Separatists made it one of the chief principles of their Religion to oppose them; concluding that man to have true illumination to salvation, that had his eyes opened to see Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be Antichristian.</p>
            <p>The generality of the sincere Professors of the Gospel were much grieved at the barbarous rigour of their Discipline, in suspending, silencing, and molesting learned, godly, orthodox Ministers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not wear a Surplice, signe with the Crosse, stand at the Creed, kneel at the Sacrament, observe a superstitious ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li-day: but most of all they were grieved that such persecution should befall them for refusing to read the book of Sports to their people; a most abominable book, giving liberty to people to profane the Lords day.</p>
            <p>The people also generally disliked their rigour in citing them to their Courts for working on Holi-dayes, or marrying without a Licence, or upon a groundlesse suspicion of inchastitie: Many such poor pretences, meerly to drain the peoples purses, did their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers make.</p>
            <p>Thus had the Prelatick party drawn the <hi>odium</hi> of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gentry, and Commonalty upon them; and now a Parliament being called, and in that Parliament severall Members of both Houses, professed enemies to their Degree; and not onely to their degree in the Church as Bishops, but to their Office (as since they professe) as Ministers, upon what designe may easily be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. These members also being popular, took the opportunity of lifting these Protestant Churches off their hinges, whiles the eyes of all men were on them for a Reformation: Here, I say, was the fallacy, that whiles they pretended to root out Popish pollution, they struck at the very root of Primitive purity: whiles they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reform Episcopacy, they struck at the very Office of the Ministry, as now that wound being searched to the bottom, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to us.</p>
            <p>The King and his party saw to the bottom of this wound many yeers since: Those Remonstrances now seem full of Prophecies, which we have seen fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52152:12"/>But lest we should seem to throw dirt upon the Parliament, and the Purliaments cause, we must distinguish of a threefold party which sate in the house; in plain truth, the Parliaments covenant distinguisheth them. There was a Popish party, a Protestant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Schismaticall party; the Protestant party made this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant against the other two parties. This Protestant party main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Protestant cause against all other parties.</p>
            <p>No Protestant can be ignorant, how much those Worthies that maintained the protestant cause, are by a bruitish rabble of degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate protestants slandered and reproached: and how much the cause of God suffers hereby, to the causing of many a good Christian to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall; dark providences, are as dangerous as deep questions to a weak Christian; both make him to stagger. Prosperous apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and successfull predominant hypocrites are like land-markes removed, that shipwrack the ignorant marriner that steeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</p>
            <p>In good truth, our land-marks are removed, and few Pilots this day are to be found, to steere us into the harbour of truth and peace. Some say loe here is Christ; and others, loe there is Christ: Some say, loe here is Antichrist; and others, loe there is Antichrist; and hereby <hi>(if 'twere possible) they would deceive the very Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those called the Presbiterians are decryd by all opposite parties, as the Antichristian party; and they wittily quibble on one part, and say their covenant which they made for the maintaining of Religion in doctrine and discipline against Popery on one hand, and Schisme on the other; together with the preservation of the Kings person, and the fundamentall laws, hath just 666 words in it, the number of the beast; and thence they conclude, the Protestant Religion, the King, and the Fundamentall Laws to be Antichristian.</p>
            <p>Others, who seem more rational, lay it to their charge as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, 1. In taking up Armes against the King, and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the People thereto. 2. in making a Covenant contrary to Law, and imposing it on the Kings Subjects against his pleasure. 3. In robbing of the Church of it's lands. 4. In not establishing the King according to their former remonstrances, when it was in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>Two things are here to be premised before we proceed.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That Parliaments are of as great antiquity in a national Church, as Monarks over that Church: here's the difference; the one
<pb facs="tcp:52152:12"/>
is an humane Institution approved of God; the other, the Monark, is a divine Institution, immediately ordained of God to be the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of his people. This is clear in <hi>Moses,</hi> and the 70 under him, chosen by him, and afterwards approved by God.</item>
               <item>2. To our purpose: The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was called by the King, chosen freely by the people, assembled at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and established by the King; where they sate freely, and voted freely.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Here they became formally our Rulers: and <hi>Of the Rulers of the people we are not to speak evil. Charity hopeth all things, and is not easily provoked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Parliaments taking up of Arms, the Question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did it legally? That a Parliament may leavie an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in the absence of the King, is out of doubt legall; for <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune periculum, commune auxilium petit.</hi> But to levie it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, was absolutely illegall. Now the Parliament in their Remonstrances, Petitions and Applications to the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted themselves of any such rebellious attempts, making their War but meerly Defensive. Now whether this were legall in the Parliament, is very questionable; many good men are divided about the question: For say these of the Negative part, when those of the Affirmative plead a necessity for what they did, making <hi>Salum populi suprem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>m esse Legem:</hi> say they, There can be no necessity pleaded against a morall precept; neither in the reallity of the thing was there any necessity; only and at the most, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of evil to ensue, if the King should come without resistance with an Army to <hi>London:</hi> Nor by the rule of Charity, was there so much as a probability; for the King declared, that he would preserve the Lawes, the Religion, and the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as carefully as his own Family; and why might not he be beleeved as well, if not more and before the Parliament? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, say they, The Parliament as Subjects, ought to keep to the Rule, to act within their Spheere, leaving the successe to God: The King called them not thither to dispute his Authority, nor could the people that chose them give them any such Commission: Let the guilt of bloud, or Injustice, or Tyranny, lie upon the King; there was a righteous God would call him one day to a severe account for such actions, when they as loyal Subjects, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering by him, would be vindicated and justified in the eyes of all the people</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52152:13"/>On the other side, say they of the Affirmative part, The Case is far otherwise: for the Parliament kept to the rule; they le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally attached those persons of Treason, who had endeavoured to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the <hi>Magna Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To suppresse and apprehend these persons, the Parliament might command aid from the Kings Subjects; otherwise wee shall deny that priviledg to the Parliament, which the law in such a case allows a petty Constable: For the King to protect such armed men, is contrary to Law; <hi>et quicquid contra legem fit, pro infecto ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur,</hi> say the most learned in our Laws: in such a case the Kings Commission is invalid; for <hi>Nihil potest Rex quam quod de jure potest,</hi> saith <hi>Comines.</hi> Who should protect the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the absence of the King, but the Parliament of <hi>England?</hi> and who should defend the Courts of Iudicature in the absence of the King, against those of their prisoners that were broke from them, and now making head against them, but the Parliament? and how should they defend them against men in arms, but in raising men in arms against them? Whereas 'tis objected, They raised men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King; They answer negatively, and bid us read their Declarations, their Remonstrances, their Commissions to their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, their Protestations, and their Covenant which they solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly swore to God, with their hands lifted up to him, to preserve the Kings P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>They answer, that they did it, to declare to his Majestie and the world, how sincerely they were knit in loyal affection to his Person and Dignity; that without any compulsion they would solemnly swear to God, when they could not to him, that they had no intention to diminish his just rights: and that they never order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that any should take that Covenant, but such as entered into their service, or were conversant with them; that so all their

servants might be the Kings true Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Committees (without any order from them) and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall other pragmatick fellows made it a snare to tender consciences of the Kings party, by pressing it upon them, and oppressing those that refused it: This was doubtlesse a grosse sinne, but it cannot properly be laid to their charge, as if they thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make a party for themselves against the King; but to make all within their Garisons and Commands, both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and People, true Subjects to the King, to the Lawes, and the Protestant Religion. Whiles this was strictly observed in the Parliaments Quarters, Iesuites and Popish Priests were not so frequent, nor so bold, as since they have beene amongst us.</p>
            <p>3. As to that of throwing down of Bishops, a double scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal is taken, if not given thereby: 1. In their manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding without and against the King; which in it self was absolute usurpation; for though they did send to the King to passe it, yet they resolved upon his denyal, to proceed: which was an absolute denyall of his Negative voyce, in which implicitely they denyed him to be their Soveraign.</p>
            <p>2. In throwing down the ancient Government of the Church by Bishops; which Government hath continued in the Church since the Apostles time unquestioned, until within these hundred yeers; and then the Orthodox onely questioned their Persons, not their Office; onely the Anabaptists cryed down the Office as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
            <p>Now for the Parliament (under pretence of Reformation of Religion) to cast off that primitive Government (universally received in the Churches) without and against the consent of the King, and solemnly ingage others in the same thing, seems to be a most rash and inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

would clash with the first in the Covenant: so that their meaning is, they will extirpate so much of Prelacy as shall be found contrary to the word of God, and the Example of the best reformed Churches: I suppose by Churches, they meant the purest Primitive Churches; for all these late Reformed Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did, before we thought of a Reformation, yeild, that we were better reformed then they.

E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very solid Protestant is so far from thinking the Office of a Bishop to be Antichristian, that he rather thinks it a high degree of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism to oppose that Office; this is (as we have shewed) to deny the Father and the Son; for he that denyeth an Apostle, or the Successo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s of an Apostle, in the Office of the Ministry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth Christ, and he that denyeth Christ, denyeth God that sent him. Charity therefore makes me hope, that the sincere Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants (what ever other subtil Foxes designed) intended no otherwise by that second Article in the Covenant, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Church of <hi>England</hi> to a Primitive Purity, by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Popish Prelates, and all those humane Institutions depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the English Hierarchy: if through Error they were mis-led from the right means to this end, the discovery of that Error may seasonably reduce them into a right way; for wise men never think it a shame to repent.</p>
            <p>It is most certain, that the intent of the sincere Covenanters was to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ine, not ruine the Ministry: by pulling down the English Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they struck not at the order of the Ministry, but at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Episcopacy; they struck at the Discipline of the English Church therein, more then at the Ministry; for they pulled down Bishops as they were Superintendants over their brethren, not as Ministers; so that they took away their degree above their brethren, but left them standing in their order as Ministers. Bishops lost not their Order by the Covenant, but their Degree; for though they
<pb facs="tcp:52152:14"/>
are in a distinct degree above the Presbyters, which have ever been allowed them in the purest Churches since Christ time, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were a distinct order from the Presbyters, neither the Scripture nor the Fathers make them so; so that <hi>Aerius</hi> an ancient Writer, in that saith truth; a Bishop and a Presbyter are joined in the same Commission; the Bishop imposeth hands, so doth the Presbyter; the Bishop administers the Sacraments, and dispenseth the Ordinances, so doth the Presbyter; so that essentially there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, what is, is only gradual.</p>
            <p>Now here lies the great question, Whence they had this degree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their fellow Ministers in the Church? If they had this from Apostolical Institution, then without all doubt it was a grieveous sin in any Civil Power to pull it down, and they that convenanted so to do, did unadvisedly and foolishly: But if this degree of Episcopacy be but an Ecclesiastical Institution, though of great Antiquity, the case is altered, there cannot be an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute necessity of its immutability: Meer humane Institutions<note place="margin">In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But (to come to the thing) suppose this degree to be (as probably it is) an Apostolical Institution, which continued unquestionable in the Church for many hundred years. Yet here the question will still be? Whether since the grand Apostasie that <hi>Paul</hi> prophesies of, there hath not been an Apostasie from this Institution? whether this Institution in the Apostasie did not contract much corruption? This is granted by all the Protestant English Bishops, especially by the late Lord Primate of <hi>England,</hi> B. <hi>Laud</hi> in his Conference with <hi>Fisher;</hi> Bishop <hi>Jewel</hi> and Bishop <hi>Downam;</hi> hence these two latter<note place="margin">

               </note> conclude, That the Hierarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> is so corrupted and apostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed from its Primitive Institution, that it is become the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian State; nay, more then that, they call it the Antichrist.</p>
            <p>That question then which concerns us, is, Whether the Hierarchy of <hi>England</hi> were so exactly conformable to the Primitive Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as that it needed no alteration? These two things are granted:</p>
            <p>1. That the persons in that Hierarchy needed to be reformed; for some of them were prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ssed Papists, and the most of them bitter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to a powerful and a painful Orthodox Ministry.</p>
            <p>2. That whatsoever is built upon an humane foundation, may
<pb facs="tcp:52152:15"/>
upon humane or divine considerations be taken down again: if so, then those Titles, Offices and Dignities conferred meerly by men, may be taken away: but the title of Lord - Bishop, Dean, Arch-Deacon, Chancellor, Vicar - Generall, Commissary, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, Surrogate, Register, Promoter &amp;c. Of which our English Hierarchical politie was compacted, were meerly humane titles and offices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as appears upon record. In 16 of <hi>Rich. 2.</hi> Chap. 1. we find the English Bishops first putting on the title of Spiritual Lords,<note place="margin">Case of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures 35.</note> though as Barons long before (in <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy's</hi> time, who conferred that temporall honor on them) they claimed a place in the house of Peeres. These acts of grace conferred by the Kings of England on their Clergy, argued their piety and true affection to religion. Nor did those honours they conferred on the Clergie make those persons, much lesse their office, as some foolishly affirm, Antichristian; only thus much, it argues them mutable; that civil power that changeth them, so farre, changeth not a divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>So farre therefore as the alteration that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> made in the Hierarchy of <hi>England,</hi> was not against the primitive institution; so farre, for the <hi>matter</hi> of it, it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: but as for their <hi>manner</hi> of proceeding in it, without and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Kings consent, let him that hath skill vindicate them. I am sure none that know the duties of the second Table, and are sincerely pious, will dare to applaud it, or once open their mouth to plead for it.</p>
            <p>My aym is onely to vindicate the Parliaments Cause from that fowl aspersion of Antichristianisme cast upon it: as for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their particular acts, they are inexcusable.</p>
            <p>4. Another great Scandall taken and given, is, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament not only took away the dignities of the Clergy, but the estates of the Clergie.</p>
            <p>What shall we make for an answer to this monstrous Crime? Before we say any thing to this, we wil make a step back to former times.</p>
            <p>We shall find the house of Commons alm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>In <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth his raign, the Lords and Commons fell upon the Clergy for their fleece; took from them (as saith <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>) in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> Six hundred forty five Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; they dissolved ninety Colledges, and of Chanteries and fire Chappels two thousand three hundred seventy four, of Hospitals One hundred and ten; The yearly value being 161100<hi rend="sup">l</hi>.

            <p>And in the Reign of King <hi>Charles,</hi> the last Parliament that that King called: which was the gladding of the hearts of all the people of the Kingdom, whose eyes were fixed upon them, in hopes of enjoying some eminent good from them: these alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and against the consent of the King, fell upon the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies Estates, and swept all that away which King <hi>Henry</hi> left.</p>
            <p>What shall we say here? That we may not condemn the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with the wicked, we answer,</p>
            <p>1. They never pretended at the first to any such thing; <hi>Ab initio non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For my owne part, I really beleeve, That God is this day punishing the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Family for that sin of their Fore-fathers: <hi>Henry the Eighth's</hi> sins are not yet forgot, chiefly that of Sacriledg; God will punish to the third and fourth generation, except we repent of those sins
<pb facs="tcp:52152:16"/>
by endeavouring a reformation. And as for the Church-robbers of this age, wait but a while, and without their repentance, you shall see misery and shame upon them; God will find them out: It hath been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>bserved, that scarce any prospered an age with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated Lands of the Church.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, many, who before they griped it, lived well; after they got it, decayed and were brought to beggery and great want: That sacred flesh stollen from the Altar, had a cole in it, which burnt up their nests where their other store lay. God grant the guilty of this age repentance for this crying sin; otherwise, let <hi>David's</hi> deprecation be fulfilled upon them, <hi>Psalm 83. 11, 12. Make them like Oreb and Zeeb, as Zeba and Zal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munna, who said, Let us take to our selves the houses of God in possession, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to that scandall, That when the Parliament had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to declare to the world, that all their Remonstrances, Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Vows, Protestations, and Covenants, proceeded from a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart, by establishing the King, when they had drove evill Counsel from about him; that then, directly Contrary to those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and vows, they began upon new termes with him, they must have the sword put into their hands, else they could not trust him; and necessity and self preservation put them upon it: The self same arguments that were used (as a just judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them) in their overthrow, which soon followed.</p>
            <p>To this there is a double answer by divers persons; a witty one, and a pious one.</p>
            <p>Some say, that the King desired, for the Satisfaction of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, a treaty with his Parliament: before he came to be reestablished, and that upon the surest grounds of reason and policie, it was on both sides thought most fit for to have it: yet it had been most Religious in the Parliament, and more for the honour of their cause, if not for the safety of it, to have kept to their former Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and performed their word and publick promises made therein.</p>
            <p>Others more piously say, and those formerly of the House, God in justice hath overthrown our policie with others sinful policie. God shews us our own sins in their lively pictu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This Learned Doctor was <hi>Pauls</hi> Tutor. Now how to reconcile <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 3. with what I have writ, or rather, what the Holy Ghost disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the forementioned Texts of <hi>Pauls</hi> Education, I do not know; for it is generally concluded from this Text, that <hi>Paul</hi> was a Tent-maker by Trade; now that <hi>Paul</hi> should be a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifee and a Tent-maker, was as absurd amongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as it is amongst Orthodox Christians, to say a man is a Minister, and a also a Cobler or a Tinker, unless <hi>Paul</hi> were (as by his wild Zeal he should seem to be) a <hi>Tub-Pharisee:</hi> indeed, the Jewish Church was at that time exceedingly degenerated from its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Purity, and that very Sect declared so much; for a <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see</hi> was but an hypocritical Sectarian Separatist: And <hi>Drusius</hi> tels us, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>an Division to seven: there was the Praise-seeking Pharisee, and the Self-justiciaty, and the Self-afflicting Pharisee, that wounded his head, and scratched his body with thorns; the Slavishly-fearful Pharisee, the virtuous Pharisee, the covetous Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee; and lastly, the down-look'd devoted Pharisee, who wore a thing like a Mortar on his head to hinder his looking upward. But I find another distinction more grave, but whether more Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, I leave to the Jewish Antiquaries to determine; there are two sorts of Pharisees, namely, <hi>Porashim</hi> and <hi>Parushim,</hi> as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews term them, that is, <hi>Docentes</hi> and <hi>Separati,</hi> Teaching Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s, and Laik Pharisees: now this distinction is brought by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries purposely to salve that Text <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 12. where the Pharisees boast that they paid Tythe of <hi>Mynt</hi> and <hi>Cummin.</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52152:20"/>
Now if they paid Tythes (saith the Disputant) how were they Church-men? To this it is answered, The Teaching Pharisees paid not Tythes, But received them, but the Laick Pharisees paid it. But this distinction is not satisfactory; for if none but Laicks paid Tythes, then we may as well conclude, that all the Levites were Laicks, because the Levits paid Tythes to the Priests. I humbly conceive the answer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>would be sound and true thus, That it does not follow, that of absolute necessity, the Pharisees that paid Tythes must be Laicks; for why might not they, being Church-men, pay Tythes to the Priests at the Temple, as well as the Levites who receive Tythes pay the Tythe of their Tythes to the Priests, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 28, 29. But the Priests were Levites, and the Levites called Priests, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 5. But we need none of these distinctions or answers to solve this question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Paul,</hi> for we do affirm (from <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 4, 5.) that <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">

               <p>Likewise <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 3. proves <hi>Paul</hi> was never bound to that Trade of Tent-making, for he was brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel:</hi> now all men know that <hi>Gamaliel</hi> was no Laick Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, he was no Tent-maker, but a Doctor of the Law, who taught <hi>Paul</hi> not Tent-making, but as the Text tells us, the perfect manner of the Law of the Fathers. <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> affirm<note place="margin">

               <p>Moreover <hi>Pauls</hi> Learning, Eloquence and practices, tell us, that he never learnt before his Conversion, nor ever practised the Trade of Tent-making; he had a far worse Trade, which hee followed too hard, to be of that; in stead of making Tents for men, he pulled down and destroyed the Tabernacles of God, the bodies of the Sainrs.

And we finde in his fourteen Epistles, which (like the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> builded for an <hi>Armory</hi>) have <hi>hanging in them a thousand bucklers, all the shields of mighty men.</hi> There is no weapon that the Church, or any member of the Church wants at any time, in any case, against any Enemy but he may be ready furnished in <hi>Paul's</hi> Armory against him: His Epistles are another Paradise full of fruit and flowers.</p>
               <p>Thus out of <hi>Paul</hi> the man-eater came out meat for man. This barren wildernesse became a spiritual <hi>Canaan</hi> to the Christian Church, flowing with spiritual milk and honey.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why do you call him <hi>Paul,</hi> when his name is <hi>Saul?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52152:22"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I call him as he calls himself in all his Epistles, except that to the Hebrews. But since it fals in my way to discourse of his name, and the changing of his name; I shall not baulk it, but briefly touch of it, and passe immediately from the Author, to the Subject; from the name to the thing.</p>
               <p>Some think <hi>Paul</hi> had two names given him, as an honor to him: if so, then the question will be, who bestowed that Title of honor upon him; who gave him that name of <hi>Paul?</hi> Truely the answer will be uncouth, yet very true; not his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers nor God-mothers (I mean the Church or Company pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) at his Baptism; nor the Minister that baptized him; For they all after his baptism called him <hi>Saul,</hi> Brother <hi>Saul.</hi> Indeed, the correlate title [<hi>Brother</hi>] was <hi>Paul</hi>'s greatest title of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; for however the world contemns it, it is not onely a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of great honour, but of exceeding great and unconceivable profit to be a true brother of the Church militant; for they have undoubted Title to an everlasting Crown and Kingdome, which Usurpers cannot dispossess them of.</p>
               <p>Now if the Church gave not <hi>Saul</hi> the name of <hi>Paul</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to him; certainly the enemies of the Church would not doe it: then it must be concluded as most probable, that <hi>Saul</hi> gave himself the name of <hi>Paul:</hi> and so that opinion will fall to the ground; for 'tis not to be imagined that he would give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Title of honour: Self-created Titles are false and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and rather defame the person as a proud Usurper, then speak him a person of merit, to whom truly belongeth honour.</p>
               <p>But if we seriously view this new name of <hi>Paul,</hi> we shall finde the person owning the name to be probably the Author of it, and the name in no wise to be a Title of honour, but of true Christian debasement.</p>

It was an ancient custom among the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, when they would express their passions, to change their name, and so make it sutable to their sad condition; so <hi>Nahomi</hi> in <hi>Ruth</hi> changeth her name to <hi>Marah.</hi> True repentance works a self-abhorrencie, and raiseth a holy indignation in the soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it self for sin. <hi>Paul</hi> little thought he had persecuted the God of that Law which he was so zealous for, when he went to bring Christians from <hi>Damascus</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on purpose to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them: 'Twas a dreadful speech in <hi>Sauls</hi> ears, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> I believe this voice caused as great an heart-quake in <hi>Saul,</hi> as the hand on the wall wrought an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake on the <hi>Babylonish</hi> King. What! that <hi>Paul</hi> the great Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot for God, should now by the voice of God be questioned for persecuting God! This was a little day of Judgment with <hi>Paul,</hi> happy man that it was not Doomes-day with him; that God that struck him to the earth, might justly have struck him down to Hell; certainly this gracious dealing of Christ with <hi>Paul,</hi>

considering what a bloudy enemy <hi>Paul</hi> had been against him, so overcame him that he ever after loathed himself; therefore he calls himself, <hi>The least of the Apostles, not worthy to be called an Apostle, a man born out of due time, a wretched man,</hi> or a man carrying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 18.</note> who desired now to be as conformable to his Master in all things as might be; for if his Master the great Carpenter (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence be it mentioned) of the mighty Fabrick of the Universe, did not disdain to be, when he was on earth in the flesh a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, much less ought <hi>Paul</hi> to disdain to be a Tent-maker.</p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly touched of <hi>Pauls</hi> Name, his Conversion, Education and Birth, that the Reader may be justly informed of the Author of this Subject I am now entering upon; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have writ all this, because I find some from <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 3. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing <hi>Paul</hi> before his Conversion too much, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers elevating him much above himself, from <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1. where (misreading the Text) they would make him a man of Princely Education, pretending him to be some great Officer in this time of Perscution, whereas I scarce believe he was above a Solicitor General; I am confident, and I believe most men believe, that he could not be so high as an Atturney General in the height of his Persecution: and therefore let no man favour himself in so gross and disorderly a mistake, as to put a Lord Presidents Gown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Pursuiants back: for though <hi>Paul</hi> before his Conversion had a heart as full of venome and malice against the Saints, as the highest of them, yet his power extended no farther then to bring them to the High-Court, he could not pass sentence upon them; he could only accuse them, and rail upon them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them to execute the Saints, that was all.</p>
               <p>But we have no more to do with him as an enemy, but as a friend, and the greatest friend of all the Apostles to us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for whom he was designed.

               <p>The <hi>Prophetick</hi> part of this Epistle lieth in the twelve first Verses of this second Chapter, which is my designed task.</p>
               <p>This part of the Chapter hath been for above these hundred yeers past, the common Theater whereon the learned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the <hi>Europan</hi> Churches have met, and fiercely incountred each other. <hi>Paul</hi> was not more tossed in his Voyage from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> then <hi>Pauls</hi> Text hath been tossed amongst Christians since the name of Protestant and Papist hath been heard of in the world. They both throw dirt in each others faces, and then set this Prophecy of <hi>Paul's</hi> before each other as a glass of Infamy. My care shall be to avoid those that cause Division, my Design being to follow truth and peace, and thereby (if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly I can) to unite those that love it.</p>
               <p>The very Title of this Subject may justly cause me to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish it; for as the Sun is too glorious an object for a sore eye to look on, and the Rocks too hard for foundered feet to go upon; so is this Prophetick Subject too high and mysterious for such a weak head as mine to comprehend, especially since the Ancients conclude, this prophesie is not to be fulfilled until to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the world, so that we in this Age must look<note place="margin">Certius &amp; fine periculo est ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectare usque ad impletionem Prophetiae, quàm temerè divinare. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus l. 5. c. 21.</hi>
                  </note> for the fulfilling of it: And in good manners I might take that Greek Fathers grave Counsel, rather patiently to wait on God for the fulfilling of Prophesies, then rashly to determine of future events.</p>
               <p>But, if I may, I shall plead my excuse for this my boldness to the Reader in the Preface.</p>
               <p>I am now (though long first) come to the Text.</p>

wife was sent: I shal divide only so much as I intend to handle, avoiding all affectation of Noveltie or Singularitie.</p>
               <p>These twelve first Verses divide themselves into two General parts: 1. A <hi>Doctrinal Part:</hi> 2. A <hi>Prophetical part.</hi> Which<note place="margin">

               <p>But by the Doctrinal part here, we mean, that <hi>Thesis</hi> which lieth implicitely in the two first Verses, and part of the third, <hi>That the day of Iudgement is not at hand:</hi> This I call the Doctrinal part; and then from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. to <hi>ver.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>We must first see to the true reading of these words before we can come to divide them aright.</p>

               <p>Herein the wisdom of that Lamb-like Lion (as I may call him) <hi>Paul</hi> doth much appear. <hi>Paul</hi> perceived how the design of the Seducers was to undermine his new planted Church at <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> by disquieting their souls with terrifying Doctrines, as that Doomes-day would be within a yeer; and for proof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they quoted <hi>Paul.</hi> Wonder not then if the new planted Church of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> which were all but tender Lambs, were much tossed and perplexed in their mindes at the hearing of this strange Doctrine; for if <hi>Felix</hi> that lion was made to tremble but at the hearing of that day, well might these Lambs who daily expected to see it. This tender Church was to be fed with milk, and not with such strong (to say truth) poysoned meat. They were begotten by <hi>Paul</hi> to the true faith; but not to that heighth of evidentiall faith, as not to be moved, to hear that on a sudden they, their wives and children should be brought to judgment.</p>
               <p>These boisterous windes of false Doctrine raised by these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate Divels, the false teachers, and beating so impetuously upon the fluctuant passions of these new planted Christians, raised so great a storm against that holy house and houshold, that had it not been built upon the rock, it had doubtlesse fallen, and great had been the fall thereof. To allay this storm, it seems to me a harder task for <hi>Paul</hi> at land, then for <hi>Christ</hi> at sea to effect. Christ first rebuked the wind, and then comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the water to be still, and they were so; but contrariwise, <hi>Paul</hi> begins first to allay the waves, as the onely means to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the winde: <hi>Paul</hi> like a wise Physician layes his finger on the right pulse, he there began the cure where the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the wound: their passions had made them enraged; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions caused through sudden fear, had made them as it were mad; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> comes in good season with his heavenly melodious charm to allay them: [<hi>We lovingly beseech you, brethren.</hi>] Thus <hi>Paul</hi> (like another <hi>Orpheus,</hi> or rather, like
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52152:26"/>
                  <hi>David</hi>) with the well-tuned harp of Rhetorick, perswades these brain-stung <hi>Thessalonians</hi> to take a cure. He hath half done the cure upon the judgment, that hath but allayed the timorous distempered affections of a seduced <hi>soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> comes in the same method here to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> that Christ came to his disciples in, after his Resurrection: the first word is <hi>peace;</hi> it was a word in season from the Prince of peace to his poor disconsolate and disquieted servants: He that would settle Truth, must first make Peace. The first word of Command is Peace, which being made, is commonly the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to Obedience.</p>
               <p>Behold here also the vehement desire of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding earnestnesse of his spirit to repair the ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But <hi>Paul</hi> voluntarily falls upon his face, to set them (fallen) upon their feet. <hi>Paul</hi> saw the dangerous consequences that would follow; and therefore (as<note place="margin">In rebus magni momenti solet Apostolus adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere obtestatio nem. <hi>Aretius.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Aretius</hi> observes) <hi>Paul</hi> useth these supplicatory terms, as a prudent Ambassador of Christ, who knew the times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the time when to imbrace, and when to refrain from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing; when to come with a rod, and when to come in love.

               </p>
               <p>2. The second thing observable in the doctrinal part, is the Matter it self; which though in its form it be Supplicatory, yet in its quality it is Dehortatory.</p>

and those are Seducers; be sure so long as their hearts were a Magazeen of powder, these fire-brands would never cease until they had blowed them up, by the sparks of false Doctrine cast in amongst them: therefore the Apostle dehorts them from crediting such persons, whom he describes by their subtile pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, commonly putting on one of these three cloaks when they went a cheating: 1. Either fained revelations: 2 Or fained words: 3. Or fained Epistles.</p>

                  <hi>Of the coming of our Lord Iesus Christ, and of our gathering together to him</hi>] (for so we read the Text.)

                  <hi>And of our gathering together unto him:</hi>] So the Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Translation reads it. The addition of this clause deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the controversie against those that say the Apostle meanes not here the day of Judgment; for to 1 <hi>Thess</hi> 4. 15, 16, 17. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle alludes, where he had delivered the comfortable Doctrine of the Resurrection of all the Saints, and of their glorious gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, and their being caught up with Christ at the day of Judgment: Out of this chapter, most probably, the Seducers took their Text; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> both repeats his own words, and their false glosses upon them in this Text I treat on, and the second verse, as we shall shew in order as we open the ensuing words. The Seducers (it seems) repeated <hi>Pauls</hi> words, they said, thus saith <hi>Paul;</hi> now in comes <hi>Paul</hi> as the fittest and best inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of his own words, openly professing and acknowledging that he had delivered such a doctrine as that of Christs coming, and the Saints being gathered unto him, but flatly denies that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he writ or spake any thing of the suddenness of that great day, as if it were neer at hand, as men account neerness, <hi>viz.</hi> within a yeer, or an age: and further he denies, that ever he preacht or writ it for to distract or trouble the Church, or drive them from the truth, but to comfort and settle them; this you may find in the Texts being compared together.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Paul</hi> (in the Text) having repeated the matter of their fear, proceeds now to the causes of this their trouble, which in the general are two, extrinsecal and intrinsecal: one cause of this their trouble and fear, was from within themselves; the other was from without them, and that was false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine brought in by false Teachers.<note place="margin">

An Army sometimes is more easily overthrown by a false Alarm in the night, then by a pitched Battel in the day: this was the way that these Seducers went, first they went to make it night in their understandings by leading them from the truth, and then they intended to give them a false A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme to distract them, fear them, and disorder them: As <hi>Gideon</hi> by his Rams<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>horns sounding, his Pitchers chinking, and his new and sudden light appearing, ruined that strong and mighty Army; so did these Seducers intend by the chinking of their Pitchers, producing of their new and unexpected light, and crying the word of the Lord, and the word of <hi>Paul,</hi> intend to rent and ruine the Church of <hi>Thessalonica:</hi> Now <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might prevent the mischief, indeavours to remove the cause; which lay more in the weak minds and timorous hearts of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> then in any thing else; for had they held fast to <hi>Pauls</hi> Truth (which it seems by <hi>ver.</hi> 5. they had forgot) and not been terrified, these Seducers had been utterly disappointed of their ends; for they came into this Church but as Pick-poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets into a Fair, making an uproar on purpose thereby with more ease to beguile the people; therefore the Apostle saith to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>O ye Thessalonians, Non solum non moveamini quoad intellectum, sed neque terreamini quoad affectum,</hi> Gorhanus.

               <p>Now such, and so numerous are the various opinions of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men about Anti-christ, that it gives occasion to many men who regard not the times or the seasons, scoffingly to give out, that Anti-christ is some <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> that is now in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, now in that, anon no where, and presently again every where; some make him a Divel, some a State, some a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, a King, a General. Others give out, that Anti-christ is like the Philosophers Stone, much talked on, but never seen yet, or known: But all these Scoffers do not one jot diminish the truth of the sacred Word concerning Anti-christ; for as for example, there are many Ignoramuses this day in States affairs (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom my self is one) that do not distinctly know who are the <hi>Custodes Libertatis Angliae:</hi> some say, the General Councel of the Army; some say, the House of Commons, as now modelled; others, the Councel of State; others, the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Great Seal; and others, the Judges of the Land: now because we through our ignorance, do not know them, will it therefore follow, that there are no <hi>Custodes Libertatis Angliae?</hi> this would prove in the end but a bad conclusion; for my part, I draw no such conclusions, but my prayer to God and my hope is, that he will speedily dispel all fogs and mists of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from deceived people, that at last they may eminently and clearly perceive who are the <hi>Veri Custodes Libertatis Angliae.</hi> But to our purpose.</p>

This hath been, and to this day is, I am confident, the cause of those gross mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes concerning the powring out of the vials, making all the vials almost of Gods wrath to be poured out upon <hi>Rome</hi> and her adherents; when, if we look into Scripture soberly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to History with an unbyassed judgment, we shall find not one vial as yet to be poured out. I know this opinion is vineger and smoak to some, but I presume, not to sober men well read in these mysteries: humane Histories at the best are but the worst Interpreters of the Scripture: The body of the Scripture is like <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Temple, which a wiser then <hi>Solomon</hi> hath builded for the Church of God; every stone is fitted before it come hither for its fellow, here window answers to window, and pillar to pillar; no noise of axe or hammer is heard throughout it: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is like <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> compact and at unitie in it self; it is (as <hi>Strabo</hi> saith of that City) <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>My task therefore shal be to search after that testimony which the Scriptures give concerning the Apostasie, and that testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (though but single) will carry it against all others.</p>
               <p>I shall only first mention the reason that they give (that hold <hi>Paul</hi> means the ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in this place) why <hi>Paul</hi> did not speak plainly and openly of it: To this the Greek and Latine Fathers answer, <hi>viz. Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Ambrose, Hierom, Tertullian,</hi> and several later Writers, as <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and <hi>Aretius,</hi> &amp;c. '<hi>Paul</hi> (say they) in prudence kept covert this truth, 'lest hereby the Christians and the Christian Religion should 'suffer as enemies to the Empire of <hi>Rome.</hi> Indeed I have read of Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> and it is spoken in his commendation, as a grave prudential act of his, that considering the season, and the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy of Hereticks, <hi>pro temporis ratione, &amp; Haereticorum princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patu,</hi>

Without all doubt, there is a season for all things, <hi>a time to speak and a time to be si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;</hi> and a <hi>word spoken in due season, how pleasant is it?</hi> But all this shall never make me believe, that <hi>Paul</hi> would, for fear of Humane or Diabolical power or crueltie, put Gods candle of Truth under a bushel; he spake as the Spirit gave him utterance, neither adding to, nor detracting from any thing imparted to him by the Holy Ghost; he delivered the whole mind of God to them: <hi>Paul</hi> had none of that baseness in him, which is so frequently found in the Ministers of this Age, to baulk Truths for fear of persecution. The least Truth of God is worth all the Churches in the world: yea, set me say it, were the least Divine truth put in the scales against all the souls in the world, it would out-weigh them. Better all those souls should eternally miscarry, then that truth should perish. Though the pretended Saints of God in this age, think a little of the world to be worth a great deal of Gods Truth; yet those that are truly sanctified and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, think far otherwise.

And then he is crowned and horned, to note his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Temporal affairs, he is one of the Roman Emperors in power. But all this doth not make him the Man of sin, nor the Antichrist here spoken of; nor such an antichrist as some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe him. How many learned Scholars, both Protestants and Papists, set up a Jack-a-lent of their fancies framing, and then hoot at it for Antichrist? Peradventure many will take me for one of these Fantasticks. The safest way is to say so much of Antichrist as the Scriptures say, and no more; where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures distinguish concerning the <hi>Antichrist</hi> and the <hi>Apostasie,</hi> let us distinguish; where they are silent, let us be silent: Most men say the self same that I do, highly extolling Scripture, and truly acknowledging (what the Mythologists sabulously report of their Goddesse <hi>Pandora</hi>) that 'tis Gods treasure on earth, filled with all manner of heavenly riches; and yet mean while, either through ignorance or wilful wickednesse, there are many, too many of these in this age, that open Scripture as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pimetheus</hi>

This therefore I say, and intend to follow it, That it is a safe way to interpret Scripture by Scripture, and to make the Interpretation conformable to the rules of Interpreters: with this resolution I return again to the Text, where we shall indeavour to clear those premised Scruples concerning the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie and the Antichrist.</p>

It is not denyed but that there were great Hereticks in the Church before, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. those that denyed the Resurrection: and the <hi>Nicolaitan</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. of which read <hi>Clem.

                  </gap> the Church into a general Apostasie, which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> foretel. Two Texts (<hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 1. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1) seem to point out the heads of this Apostasie; the Texts seem to run parallel with each other: The opening of the sixth Seal, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 12. to 17. is that which immediately precedes <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 1. Now
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52152:39"/>
the sixth Seals opening, say the soundest and best that ever writ, is the overthrow of the Heathen Empire by <hi>Constantine.</hi> The Pagan Emperors were the grand enemies before the Apostasie; for I take <hi>Iohns</hi> Prophesies to be put under four periods of time: the first under the <hi>Roman</hi> Heathen Emperors until <hi>Constantine:</hi> the next under the grand Apostasie under the four Angels, and the Beast of the Sea; the third under the Antichrist; and the fourth under the general restauration of Jewes and Gentiles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of Jesus Christ by the Witnesses; to each of which the Holy Ghost prefixeth a time, a certain time: The third, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Apostasie, may be included in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               <p>Two of these periods fall within my compass at this time to discourse of, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Apostasie, and that of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ; now this Apostasie being acknowledged by all, or the most Protestants, to be, 1. An Apostasie of Gospel Churches from the faith: 2. and this Apostasie to be a general Apostasie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these two things must follow, 1. That one person cannot well be the head or ringleader of this general Apostasie. I know what may be said against this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet the utmost of it maketh not my consequence invalid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. It will follow, That the Ring-leader<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie must be men that profess Christianity, as well as those that they lead into Apostasie: for as for the <hi>Turks</hi> (prophesied of <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17) they were rather the punishers of the apostate Churches, then the Ring-leaders of the Churches in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52152:39"/>
bound in the great River <hi>Euphrates (Revel.</hi> 9. 14, 15.) are now loosed to slay the third part of men; that is, to subdue and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and inslave, and utterly ruine those Apostates. The Turks were raised up as a scourge to the apostate Christian world, hundreds of years after the Apostasie began, and therefore their <hi>Mahomet</hi> cannot properly be said to be the head of the Apostasie, he being no professor of Christianity.</p>
               <p>The great question then will be, Who are those four Angels who are accounted the heads of the Apostasie? If I knew how, I would here baulk this question, for the avoiding of Novelty and contention; but if I am mistaken, it is but a weak mans o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and so (amongst many others) it may harmelesly pass.</p>
               <p>By these four Angels, I conceive, are meant the four Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies of <hi>Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> these were designed for the four quarters of the Christian earth: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they were designed for the propagating of the Gospel; but we very wel know, that at last those very Patriarchs by turning from the truth, corrupted the Church, and turned the whole world after Arianism, as one of the Fathers complains: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Object</hi> But where is your Scripture to prove these four An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels the four Patriarchs? you make fair promises of holding forth nothing as credible, but what you bring Scripture for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I confess, it is a hard task to prove this positively by any Text; only in a word, as near as I can, thus, From their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, as they are called Angels, the Holy Ghost calls the Bishops of the several Churches (where this Defection after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward<note place="margin">In Apocalypsi Angeli dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, qui Asiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Ecclesiis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erant. <hi>Bezain 1 Cor. 11. 10.</hi>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52152:40"/>
heads of the Church in their several Divisions; and therefore on the four corners of the earth, because they divided the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world amongst them. The grand Apostasie began in the heads of the several Churches; they grew proud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and covetous, and idle, and whiles they thus slept, the enemy sowed the tares of Heresie in their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Profaneness in a Church-man is the high Road to Heresie and Apostasie. Such was their prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (saith <hi>Nazianzen</hi>) that those that took upon them Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charges, brought no other Ornament then that of long hair with them; which gross absurdity (for he calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) they most delighted in, and cared for: he calls them Dogs, yea, worse then Dogs, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. They neither remained Dogs, nor became Pastors, except to devour others labours. I will forbeare here to insert History, partly for brevity sake, and principally because the Historie in the fourth and fifth Century is so easie to be read and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of every one that can but read English, especially of those that can but understand the Latine and Greek tongue, and have leisure to read the Councels in those Centuries: So now my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended inference from all, is this, That the Bishop, Head, or Pastor of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is one of the Ring leaders, or general Heads of this Apostasie. Now Jesus Christ foreseeing the height of Apostasie that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church would rise unto (if I may pass with my expression) my meaning is, to what a height of wickedness in this grand Apostasie the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her Ecclesiastick Head or Polity would rise, sets it forth in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and various expressions to <hi>Iohn:</hi> as first, you have him but as one of the four Angels standing on the Western corner of the earth, the Patriarch of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no more, though much more then ever Christ by his approving providence (I mean, by his revealed will in his Word) allowed him; though how large a power the Councels in Christian prudence may grant unto a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Church-man, and how far that grant doth oblige the Church in obedience to that single person, I will not dispute. These Patriarchs, as <hi>Prideaux</hi> well observes, were entering into intolerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and inexcusable Apostasie. Next you have the Politie or Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, set forth as a Star not falling, or ready to fall, but fallen at that present from Heaven to Earth.

               <p>Very many Scriptures more there are of the like signification and expression; as <hi>Isa.</hi> 34. 4. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 10. and 3. 16. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 6. which by their expressions make it probable to us, that <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 12, 13, 14. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 8 9. do both set forth the overthrow of the Pagan Empire by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Christian Emperor.

[<hi>For I would not, brethren</hi>] that is, you of the Church of <hi>Rome: That ye should be ignorant of this mystery,</hi> that is, he would by all means have them acquainted with it; of all Churches, he would have the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this mystery; and why that Church acquainted with it more then any other? The Apostle gives the reason, <hi>Lest they should be wise in their own conceits:</hi> Lest they should be proud in their own conceits (saith a Learned Jesuit) supposing

that <hi>Paul</hi> useth a <hi>Metalepsis</hi> here, putting one word for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Great priviledges puffe, not only persons, but Churches, up above what is meet. <hi>Paul</hi> then by the eye of prophecie saw what we and all the world see in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now; <hi>viz.</hi> excessive pride, apostasie and insultation. Now, to pull down this pride, he would have them acquainted with this Mysterie.</p>
               <p>Now the question is, Where lies the mysterie?</p>
               <p>Some learned and holy men affirm, that the mysterie lies in the rejection of the Jews, and the taking in of the Gentiles to the Gospel: But this cannot be it; for though the coming of Christ had been to the world a mysterie, yet this mysterie was revealed to the world, especially to the Roman Church by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching. This therefore, though it be in it self a mysterie, and the deepest of mysteries, yet it is not the mysterie that <hi>Paul</hi> here would not have them ignorant of; for they were so far from being ignorant of the Jews rejection, and their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that they insulted and boasted thereupon: therefore that cannot be the mystery that <hi>Paul</hi> importunes them of all mysteries not to be ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>But the mysterie (as learned <hi>Cajetan</hi> observes) lyeth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally<note place="margin">Hoc est mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um [donec ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo Gentium intret] comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hoc tempore.</note> in these words, [<hi>Untill the fulnesse of the Gentiles shall come in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>] That the Jews were a people cast off for their unbelief, is a thing known to all the Churches in the world: but to know that the twelve Tribes shall after this sad captivity be brought to Christ, and their own Land again, and to know how long this their rejection and dissipation shall continue, untill they be brought into favour again, and restored to be a Church, this is a mystery to all the Churches in the world this day. And blessed is he that readeth and understandeth this mystery.</p>
               <p>This mysterie of all mysteries the holy Ghost would have this Church to take notice of; therefore 'tis ushered in with this double guard, [<gap reason="foreign">

Now if the great work of grace amongst the Gentiles must be accomplished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jews shall be converted, how will those words be true? and those many Prophecies of the innumerable number of Gentiles that shall flock in to the Gospel with the Jews? 'Tis expressed in that prophecie, that ten Gentiles shall in the day of the Jews conversion, come in to God for one Jew: <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 23. <hi>In those dayes ten men shall take hold (out of all Languages of the Nations) even shall take hold of the skirt of a Iew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you. And in that day</hi> (Isa. 19. 23, 24, 25.) <hi>the Lord of hosts shall blesse, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.</hi> Those three verses with the precedent matter, run parallel with <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 8, 9, 10,—16, 17,—20, 21. We might multiply Texts to prove, that when the Jews shall be converted, there shall be a glorious coming in of the Gentiles unto Jesus Christ with them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But how shall this mysterie be finished?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5, 7. seems to answer this, together with <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. In <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. you have (as 'tis generally acknowledged) <hi>Rome</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ruine; and in what dresse is she in now she is going to ruine? she is arrayed in <hi>purple, and scarlet colour, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthinesse of her fornication,</hi> (that is, Heresies, presented in the golden cup of profound Truths, and glorious new Light) <hi>and upon her forehead was a name written, Mysterie, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the earth.</hi> This is spoken not of the bare City <hi>Rome,</hi> but of the Head and Politie of that City, which is the Popedome: when the Popedome came to be the Beast with seven Heads and ten horns, then came he to be the generall Head of the Apostasie; and now <hi>Rome</hi> comes to be neer her

                  </gap>, hath much of a Paradox in it, is legible on her forehead, <hi>i. e.</hi> the mystery hidden from the Ages past is now revealed openly to all the world; for that is the meaning of <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi> upon her forehead; and this is the last vision <hi>Iohn</hi> hath of the Polity or or Government of <hi>Rome: Romes</hi> Government and Magnificence seems to be greatest at last: I think (I hope I am not mistaken) she hath her last suit of Apparelon.</p>
               <p>But to make this Text answer the question, How this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is finished? We answer, 1. The mystery is finished, when to all the world it is revealed. When the head of the Gentile A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie comes to ruine, then the mystery is finished, but in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>The judgment of the great whore;</hi> that is, the Polity of that City, which now is got to be the general head of the grand Apostasie, the ruine of this head is shewed to <hi>Iohn</hi> in this Chapter, and the mystery that formerly was a mystery, is now written upon her forehead, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>i. e.</hi> published: then doth a thing cease to be a Mystery, when to all the world it is laid open.</p>
               <p>But when shall this mystery be finished? <hi>Paul</hi> tells us it shall last but until the <hi>fulness of the Gentiles be come in;</hi> that is, saith <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 24. <hi>until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled;</hi> that is (saith <hi>Iohn</hi>) the space of <hi>forty and two monthes, Rev.</hi> 11. 2. which is. (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) so long as the <hi>Witnesses remain in sack-cloth,</hi> which is, <hi>One thousand two hundred and sixty days:</hi> Now when these shall be at an end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7. tells us, <hi>viz. when the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Angel shall begin to sound,</hi> and until then we must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the mystery of God to be finished, <hi>i. e.</hi> the finishing of the Gentile Apostasie and Tyranny, and the raising up of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to the Throne.</p>
               <p>That this Apostasie is for an appointed time, none doubt it; but many question, how long it shall be? Very many Learned men have endeavoured to limit it by setting out its farthest bounds, and they have gone the right way to work by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to demonstrate the yeer of its beginning; but mistaking their time, they have been (like very many women this last yeer) big bellyed of a false Conception, so deceiving themselves and others: Could the beginning of this grand Apostasie be sound out, it were the more easie to find out the end thereof:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52152:47"/>

I know what others have said, and I partly know what may be said as to the rise of this Apostasie; but because its greatest prop is History, from whence only probability can be inferred, I shall omit that way of search, and go a surer way to work, and that is, to find out the end of this Apostasie, a thing glanced at in one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Texts: now that we may not straggle from the fore-cited Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. there we shall see in <hi>v.</hi> 5 6, 7. the <hi>Angel lifting up his hand, and swearing by him that lives for ever, that time should be no longer,</hi> that is, the time of this Apostasie (which is the great Mystery) should be no longer; <hi>bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I might draw an Argument from <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. to prove this, If these revealed things belong to the Jewes, and to their children for ever; if the revealed curses under the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonish</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy belongs to the Jewes and to their children, then the revealed blessings belong to them, and to their children for ever; for surely Gods bowels under the Gospel are not more shut up, then under the Law, but when the set time under the Law for their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities accomplishment was fulfilled, then God restored them from under the <hi>Babylonish</hi> yoak; and is his arm short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he cannot, or his bowels shut up that he will not redeem his captives from under the Romish iron yoak? God forbid any Christian should be so sinfully, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately uncharitable as to think so. This Prophecie of <hi>Moses</hi> cleares it to us, that the Jewes shall be both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Gospel, and restored to their ancient possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: observe what Gospel promises are made to them, <hi>ver. 6 God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed to loveth Lord;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 7. there is a curse upon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Monarchy which persecuted, hated and afflicted the Jews,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52152:49"/>
and to this day hates them; All the curses that are now on the Jewes shal fal on the Romish Monarchy: This curse hath in its eye principally the Roman Monarchy; for the promise is this to <hi>Israel,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>They shall return, and obey the voice of the Lord, and do all his Commandments:</hi> Now the nature of these Commandments evidenceth to us, that this promise is a promise made under the Gospel; and if so, then the curse must needs be upon the Roman Monarchy; for since the Gospel none have been their enemies comparable to the Roman Monarchy: Who laid waste their Kingdome, destroyed their City, Temple, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, Government, and sold the people into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and all other parts of the world for slaves, but the Romane Monarchy?

               <p>And hither doth Christ send the Pharisees to learn when the Kingdom of God should come, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 20, 21. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God cometh not with outward shew, neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there; for behold, the Kingdom of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you,</hi> i. e. as <hi>Moses</hi> saith, in thy mouth, and in thy heart. Christ
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52152:50"/>
is a Spiritual King, and the soul of man is his Kingdom: now that soul that subjects it self to Christ by believing, becomes a little Kingdom wherein Christ raigns: then is Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come, when the soul believes: so that Christ seems to tell the Pharisees, that when the Jewes believed, the Kingdom should be restored.</p>
               <p>From all which (for I am too tedious) it appears mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, that <hi>Moses's</hi> command, (for to obey which, God will circumcise their heart, and upon obedience will restore them to their own fathers possessions, and bring their curse (which now lies upon them) upon their enemies) is a Gospel command, and was delivered in a Prophetick precept for the Jewes to listen unto and obey, when God intends to restore them, and ruine the Roman Monarchy: for since the Doctrine of the Resurrection and Ascension of Christ hath been preached to the would, the Roman Monarchy hath been the grand enemy of the Jewes.</p>
               <p>That we may make it more evident, that this Prophecie of <hi>Moses's</hi> extends to the state of the Jewes and Gentiles under the Gospel, we will look into <hi>Moses</hi> his Song, which (<hi>cap.</hi> 31. 29.) tells us, is a Song concerning the evill that wil befal the Jewes in the later dayes; which song (<hi>v.</hi> 21.) is to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick testimony against the Jewes when all the foretold evils shall come upon them.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>Moses</hi> reckons up in his Song the great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings that God bestowed upon <hi>Israel,</hi> and the ignoble and injurious returns they made to God; they kicked the heel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, cast him off, followed their own lusts, and obstinately persisted in their hardnesse, and unbelief, so that God was provoked to jealousie by their high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and paid them in their own coyne: As the great King of <hi>Babylon</hi> dealt with his proud Queen <hi>Vasti,</hi> so God dealt with those insolent Jewes, he kicked them out of the Royal Bed the Church, and took in poor bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaves, captived Gentiles. This of the Jewes rejection, and the Gentiles taking in to be a Church, is clearely held out in <hi>ver.</hi> 21 which <hi>Paul</hi> expounds <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 19, 20.

                  <hi>I will provoke you to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie by them that are no people, and by a foolish Nation will I anger you:</hi> and then he answers it in <hi>Isaiahs</hi> words, <hi>Isai.</hi> 65. 1, 2. <hi>I was found of them that sought me not, I was made manifest to them that asked not after me;</hi> this <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church; <hi>But to Israel he saith, All the day long have I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> so that for their obstinacy, hardness and unbelief God cast them out, and took in the Gentiles. I am confident none can deny, but that by these Texts, as <hi>Paul</hi> expounds them, the rejection of the Jewes from being a Church, is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and the taking in of the Gentiles to be a Church; which could be in no age of the world but under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; so that <hi>Moses</hi> his Prophecie extends to the rejection of the Jewes under the Gospel: and now follows the sad effects of their rejecting of the Gospel, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to <hi>ver. 26. Famine, and pestilence, and bitter destruction, the teeth of beasts, poison of Serpents, the sword without, and terrors within, and scattering of them into corners;</hi> The same which Christ prophesied <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. Indeed this song of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> is, as it were, another Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> wherein we find Christ, and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> communing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same thing, I mean of the Jewes rejection, and the Gentiles reception; of the Jewes restauration after their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction under the Roman Monarchy, and of the Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies ruine in their restauration.</p>
               <p>I confess I could heartily wish my self well out of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred thicker, wherein I find not so much as the track of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny late Authors, to lead me this way through it, and confident I am, I shall be scratched with the briars of Censure for my labour; yet this I can say to my own encouragement, that I have Christ, and his beloved Disciple <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul,</hi> to lead me through this old, but unbeaten way.</p>
               <p>I will therefore do no more, or very little more then shew the method, and give the parallel Texts.</p>
               <p>1. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. to <hi>ver.</hi> 31. there is the Jewes captivity after they were provoked to anger by a foolish Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is (saith <hi>Hierom</hi>) by the Gentiles, who until then, did follow their vain and foolish minds, in worshipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52152:51"/>
Such, in the esteem of the Jewes, were as bruits and dogs: these foolish Gentiles should provoke them to anget by beleeving in the Gospel, and Gods judgments shall follow on the Jewes. So that these must be their afflictions under the Gospel; and <hi>per consequentem,</hi> the very afflictions that to this day they lie under. Parallel with this of <hi>Moses</hi> is that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. from <hi>ver.</hi> 15. to <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and that of <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 23, 24. Saith <hi>Luke, These are the daies of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</hi> And what are those things written, but even those of <hi>Moses,</hi> which even word for word as it were, answer to <hi>Luke</hi>'s expressions of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>2. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. you have the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Jews conversion, and the Gentile <hi>Roman</hi> Apostasie described: in <hi>ver.</hi> 34. it is said to be <hi>hidden and sealed amongst</hi>

Observing this first, before wee proceed, that <hi>Vine</hi> cannot in this place relate to the Jewes (as some would have it) but to those their enemies, that shall then oppresse them: for (if you please to observe it) <hi>their Rock</hi>] in <hi>ver.</hi> 31. and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52152:51"/>
                  <hi>their Vine] ver.</hi> 32. relate to each other, and both stand in opposition to [<hi>our Rock] ver.</hi> 31. But it is concluded on all hands, that [<hi>Our</hi>] there implyes the whole Nation of the Jewes, who had God for their Rock, and by their profession owned him so to be. 'Tis granted by our opposites, that <hi>ver.</hi> 37, 38. are, or at least wise may be meant of the Gentiles their enemies: if so, it will easily follow, that <hi>ver.</hi> 32, 33. must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be meant of the Gentiles; for there is no disjunctive to be found betwixt them; so that their Vine must either mean the <hi>Turkish</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Politie: but I rather incline here to the Romish Tyrannie, which was most inhumane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vine</hi> signifies both the Head of a Church, and the Church it self: both these you have in one expression, <hi>Psalm</hi> 80. 8. this Vine signifies the Church of God, brought out of Egypt into Canaan, before whom the Heathens fell: and this also sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies CHRIST, who was brought out of Egypt after the death of <hi>Herod;</hi> he being Head of the Church, who hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, and subdued all the powers therein to be subservient to his glory and his Churches good. Now there is Gods Vine, and the Divels Vine; there is the Vine that Gods own right hand hath planted, and there is the Vine of <hi>Sodom</hi> which is of the Divels planting, which grows in the fields of <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> both these Vines have grapes, and clusters, and yeild wine: there is in Gods clusters red wine, wine which maketh glad the hearts of the sons of God: but there is in the Divels Vine bitter clusters, and poisonous wine, the wine of Dragons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and no wonder here <hi>Moses</hi> his Vine yeilds the wine of Dragons, for <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 2. the vine is of the Dragons planting; <hi>Hee gave him his Power, and Seat, and great Authority.</hi> Here wee take Vine for the Head of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Apostate Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and so the Pope is this Vine of the Divels planting, as the next significant word expresseth; for <hi>Moses</hi> by Vine of <hi>Sodom</hi> hints to us the place where this Vine shall be set, and that is <hi>Rome;</hi> for <hi>Rome</hi> is called <hi>Sodom</hi> (say the Learned) from <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 11. 8. where (when the Witnesses are slain) 'tis said, they <hi>lay in the street of the great Citie which spiritually is called So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> i. e. in one of the Kingdomes (not all the Kingdomes) subject to <hi>Rome,</hi> which is this <hi>Sodom.</hi> So that by <hi>Vine of Sodom</hi> is meant the head of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis questioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sodom</hi> relate to the Street or Citie? If to the Street, then
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52152:52"/>
how comes the place where the Witnesses are slain to be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? 'Tis answered, Antichrist and his followers make it a Sodom; and from such accidents it is usuall in Scripture to change the names; as 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 13. There Mount Olivet, whose proper name is <hi>Har Hammishcha,</hi> Mount of Unction, is by reason of the Idols Chemosh and Molech set on that hill, called <hi>Har Hammashchith,</hi> the Mount of corruption.</p>
               <p>3. Or, <hi>Vine of Sodom</hi>] as it signifies a Church, so it may sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the great apostasie and generall defection that that Church hath made. The Vine, and Grapes, and Clusters, and Wine and all are mortall and deadly poyson. The wild Vine (2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.) is rank poyson; and such is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> this day; it is become the <hi>degenerate plant of a strange Vine. Moses</hi> sets the Roman Church forth (as <hi>Iohn</hi>) under the representation of a Vine, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. which Vine the Angels pray the Lord Christ to cutdown; which <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19. he doth with great furie: and in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. where 'tis <hi>Romes</hi> great Vintage time, then when she is neer her ruine, there she comes with a golden cup, which she holds out to all: and what is in it but the juice of her own grapes, full of the filthinesse of her fornication? This <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 3. is that wine of fornication which shee hath made the Kings of the earth drunk with.</p>
               <p>So that by the wine of Dragons, and the venome of Asps, is meant the Blasphemies, Idolatries, Heresies and Abominations of that degenerate Vine the Church of Rome: for of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Monarchy neer its ruine <hi>Moses</hi> prophesies, as wee shall make out: and now it onely stands upheld by the Papal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which every sober, judicious Christian knows, is the most idolatrous, blasphemous, heretical, venemous Government and Power against the true Church, both in its Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: And of this doth <hi>Moses</hi> prophesie the destruction, when the Jews shall be converted to the Lord Jesus, and united into one body with the true Church of Gentile gospellers.</p>

                  <item>5. An Hallelujah throughout the Gentile Churches, with and for the Jews conversion, ver. 43. the reign of Antichrist, and the finishing the Apostasie; parallel with <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 10. where <hi>Paul</hi> tels us plainly, that there is a day to come when the <hi>Iews and Gentiles shall rejoyce together;</hi> which is not yet come.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In <hi>ver.</hi> 36, 37, 38. there are two signes of the Jews conversion; the Gentile Churches resurrection, and the ruine of Antichrist and the Apostasie, which is called. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 4, 20. the casting of the beast and the false Prophet into the lake, and the chaining of the Dragon; for these are all together: the ruine of these later is the establishing of the two former.</p>
               <p>The reason why the Prophets oft-times joyne the true Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile gospellers and the Jewes together, in their prophecies which respect these times, are (as I conceive) for these reasons: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they come out of tribulation together. 2. Because they shall be united in one Faith together: There shall be no distinction in Religion betwixt Jew and Gentile; and therefore for the most part, the prophecies that look to the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the seventh Trumpet, joyn both Jew and Gentile toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as in this of <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 13 <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>In <hi>ver.</hi> 36. there is one signe of the seventh Trumpet's being ready to sound; and that is, the Jews and gospel Churches low condition, <hi>When their power is gone, and there is none shut up or left:</hi> when the true Churches (for they are Gods servants) power is gone, when their Armies are overthrown in the field, and when all the true Churches Garisons are won, that there is none shut up against a day of need, nor any left; <hi>i. e.</hi> uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52152:53"/>
this is the time, even the set time for God to come to ruine his enemies, and restore his Church: then will God judg for his people righteous judgment; for (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 26.) <hi>The Iudgment shall sit, and repent himself for his peoples long and sore affliction.</hi> Yet how may we take up <hi>Isaiahs</hi> lamentation this day, <hi>Who hath beleeved</hi> this <hi>report? or to whom is</hi> this <hi>Arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> The unbelief, the timorousnesse, the profanenesse, and the most abominable Apostasie and Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian complyance of Christians at this day, in this Kingdom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these dispensations, makes me beleeve that God hath yet some more dreadfull stroke against all sorts of Professors; so that few Nobles, and few Ministers, and few of the Professors shall live to see these glorious Gospel days that are approaching.</p>
               <p>Where can we find a soul that lives this day upon this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick promise, so much as to raise his hopes, but even sinks by despondencie under the sad dispensations of God upon his Church, or else feeds his hopes with the husks of humane helpes, as if Armies or Navies could bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these things, as if Christ stood in need of <hi>Belial</hi> in the accomplishing of his glorious Prophetick promises: but the Scripture must be fulfilled, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. <hi>When the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?</hi> Scarce such a strong faith as to believe the Resurrection of the Church, in such a state as now it is.</p>
               <p>The other signe of the approaching of Antichrists ruine and the finishing of the mystery, is the blasphemy of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, in <hi>ver.</hi> 37, 38. where the Antichrist mocks at the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy and the Ministry, and the fasting and prayers, and the religious ingagements of the Church; parallel with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 8. where the Antichrist speaks great words, but we shall leave them till we come to touch of the Antichrist.</p>
               <p>The fourth special thing observable in this Prophetick Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> is the coming of Christ the Lord, to ruine Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, finish the grand Apostasie and the heads thereof, and convert the twelve Tribes to the Gospel, from <hi>ver.</hi> 29. to <hi>v.</hi> 43.</p>
               <p>When Antichrist had bereaft the true Church of all its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward visible strength, so that their Field power, and Fort power was taken away, and none was left to own the Churches cause, but they were all subdued by Antichrists prevailing Armies, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. then in <hi>ver.</hi> 37, 38. doth Antichrist boast and insult in a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52152:53"/>
blasphemous way over the heads of the Church and their cause; and now (<hi>ver.</hi> 39.) doth Christ appear to be the mighty Prince of all the earth, who declares himself, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 16. <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> fulfilling the Prophetick promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in restoring the Church out of its low condition, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its enemies down to hell; therefore <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1, 2. (a parallel Text with <hi>Moses</hi>) sets forth this day of wounding and healing, (<hi>i. e.</hi> of wounding the enemy and healing the Church) as a little day of Judgment, by Christ coming to deliver the poor Jewes, and to bring trouble upon their enemies. 'Tis resembled to the Resurrection; so <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. the Holy Ghost sets forth the Jewes restauration after the Roman captivity, under the resemblance of raising bones that have long lyen in the grave, taking flesh upon them, and living, and becoming mighty and terrible: and no wonder the Prophet compares the Jewes conversion to the Gospel, and their restauration, to the Resurrection; for <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> 11. 19) saith, <hi>What shall the receiving of them be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but life from the dead?</hi> and therefore in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4 (which is a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parallal Text <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 16.) this day is called the <hi>living and raigning of those that were beheaded, i. e.</hi> the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, who <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 11. are said to have a <hi>Spirit of life enter into them, and to stand upon their feet, as a man rising out of his grave;</hi> thence it is that this is called (<hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 5.) the <hi>time of the first Resurrection, which he is blessed that hath a part in it;</hi> that is, which is <hi>undefiled, keeps himself a Virgin, and follows the Lamb wheresoever he goeth,</hi> Revel. 14. 4. <hi>Keeps his mouth from guile, and his person innocent,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>That worships not the Beast, nor his Image, nor receives his mark in his forehead nor his hand,</hi> v. 9. <hi>But watcheth, and keepeth his garments clean,</hi> Revel. 16. 15.

               <p>The effects of the end of this mystery, are the finishing of the Gentiles Tyranny over the holy City and holy people, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. and the raising up of the distressed Jews, together with the raising and establishing of the Witnesses, and the repairing and enlarging of the Gentile Church: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moses</hi> concludes this Prophecie as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> conclude theirs, with an Hallelujah to God, <hi>ver.</hi> 43. <hi>Rejoyce O ye Nations with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and wil be merciful unto his land, and to his people;</hi> with such an Hallelujah doth <hi>Iohn</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Prophecie for the downfal of <hi>Rome,</hi> the head of the Apostasie, and the raising up of the Witnesses to the Throne; in <hi>cap.</hi> 19. there are five times Hallelujahs sung in the Church, and for this that Antichrist was dethroned, and the grand Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie with <hi>Rome</hi> the head of it, ruined; and that now Christ had recovered the Throne again: In <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>Constantine</hi> threw the Divel out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Throne, and it being possessed by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperors became Gods Throne; but then came the <hi>Beast with the seven heads and ten horns, which rose out of the sea, Revel.</hi> 13. 1. and dispossessed Christ and his Officers, and drove
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52152:55"/>
them into the wilderness; but now comes Christ and ruines the Popedome and Antichrist, that is his main prop, and then Christ by setting up of his dethroned Witnesses, is said to raign. This dethroning of the Popedom of <hi>Rome,</hi> and destruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, are by Jesus Christ in his Prophesie <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. set forth in the same expressions as the fall of the Pagan Emperors is by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> for as it is said, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6 12, 13. <hi>The Sun became black, and the Moon as blood, and the Stars of heaven fell</hi> in that grand and glorious revolution of the Polity of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Constantine,</hi> in casting down those red Dragons from the Throne, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led heaven: So in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29. this last grand and glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the Polity of <hi>Rome</hi> in the ruine of the Popedom, is called the <hi>darkning of the Sun,</hi> and the <hi>eclipsing of the Moon,</hi> and the <hi>falling of the Stars from heaven; and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man, and then the Tribes of the earth</hi> (i. e. the Jews) <hi>shal mourn,</hi> i. e. <hi>over him whom they have pierced;</hi> for <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 28. <hi>This is the time of their redemption:</hi> And so far as I can find in Scripture, and from this verse of <hi>Luke,</hi> the great sign that the Jewes shall have whereby to know that their Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neer, is the downfal of the Antichrist, the ruine of the Polity of <hi>Rome</hi> the head of the grand Apostasie, and the raising up of that, or those three national Gentile Churches out of their sad and low condition by the raising up of the two Witnesses which by Antichrist were slaine: The slaying of the Witnesses must be a thing published through the world, and truly I believe the sound of it is gon throughout the world already. But no more of this in this place, since it falls rather under the discourse of the Antichrist, which is the next thing to be treated on: So much of the grand Apostasie, its beginning, rising, continuance and ending.</p>

               <p>1 From that of the grand Apostasie there arise many doubts, as whether there be any one particular head of it, or more then one? Who that head or heads are? When the Apostasie begins? What this grand Apostasie is? And when it ends?</p>

               <p>3 That of the Witnesses, which affords us these doubts: Who they are? Where they are? What is meant by their slaying? When they shall be slain? Who shall slay them? What their rising is? And what shall be the Consequents of it?

and <hi>Constantine</hi> possessed the throne, or (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith) when the Roman Monarchy is to be ruined? 2 Where or in what part of the World must the Antichrist appear? Whether (as <hi>Downam</hi> and <hi>Brightman</hi> say) in <hi>Rome,</hi> or in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists say? 3 Whether Antichrist be past, as <hi>Brightman</hi> saith, or yet to come as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith? 4 Whether he be the seventh head of <hi>Rome?</hi> 5 Whether he be one single person, or a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as some affirme? Whether he be the head of the general A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie, as <hi>Calvin</hi> saith, or whether he be the Apostasie it self, as others affirm?

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> It may be asked, why <hi>Paul</hi> should say so little of the Apostasie, and so much of the Antichrist?</p>
               <p>This question only I will answer, and then proceed to the words in the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, <hi>Paul</hi> here follows the method of all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets that Prophesie of the Antichrist. For <hi>Daniel</hi> in the seventh and eleventh Chapters, makes a larger description of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist that riseth in the end of the Roman Monarchy, then of the Roman Monarchy it self, and Christ himself in his Prophecies, <hi>Matth</hi> 24. speaks more of the time of Antichrist's appearing then any other, and so <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 11th <hi>Revel.</hi> and 13th and 17th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes Antichrist more largely then the Apostasie: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (as I conceive) is because the Holy Ghost knew the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie would be obvious to the sense of every Christian, as what is more cleer then this of the Apostasie of the Eastern and Western Churches. But now the Antichrist, by reason of his subtilty and successes, and goodly pious pretences would not be so easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: therefore it is so much is said of him.</p>
               <p>2 The appearing and the destruction of Antichrist in the Church, is the great ensigne that God hangs out to the World, that the day of the Jews redemption, &amp; the Gospel-Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance draweth nigh. Then the grand Apostasie is drawing to an end, and the mystery of God is ready to be finished, then is Christ at the door comming forth on his white horse, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. to clothe all his Saints in white, and to take off from off the back of his two Witnesses the filthy garments, their sackcloth; and to put Priestly robes on his <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and to set his slain Witnesses in the<note place="margin">

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52152:57"/>
the Witnesses have finished their testimony in sackcloth: then doth Antichrist arise, make war with, overcome and kill the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; this is his sin, which <hi>Daniel</hi> explains (as I may say) in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 24, 25. 1 He is (saith <hi>Daniel</hi>) one that ariseth after the ten Kings belonging to the fourth Kingdome, the Roman Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, which must necessarily be about the end of the Apostasie.<note place="margin">The sin of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist what?</note>

by which 'tis evident that Antichrist tyrannizeth in those 3 King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, where the Saints of the most High have possession; and which those are, I leave the Reader to judge. From these observations of <hi>Daniel</hi> I draw this conclusion, That the sin of the Antichrist (which is one individual person) is the humbling of three Kings, and usurping a lawless, arbitrary, tyrannical power over the Saints of God, in going about to ruine them (as <hi>Montanus</hi> reads it) in destroying the fundamentals of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Church and State, and blaspheming against the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes<note place="margin">Et Sanctos al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimorum abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Aretius</hi> on this place, seems to me to write his History; he tells us, that he is called the man of sin, because he is the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and patron of gross sins, he tolerates idolatry and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, he invades Kingdomes, and under pretence of setting up piety, and promoting Saintship; he takes possession of the throne; none so great a Saint as he, if you will believe his words, or the flattering titles of his followers, who adorn him with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly titles: but when he shall begin to appear publickly (<hi>i. e.</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, as the Apostle saith,) he shall have no other ornaments to put on, but what the Apostles allow him (<hi>viz.</hi>) the man of sin, the son of perdition.</p>
               <p>He is (saith <hi>Gorran</hi>) therefore called the man of sin; because he is the whole servant of sin, he doth, as it were, homage to sin. He lays his ground-work in sin, and all his superstructures are by sin; his tongue and his hands and his heart are eminently sinful: he leads into sin all that follow him, and punisheth the Saints for not sinning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:52152:58"/>Divers of the Fathers conceive, that he is called the man of sin, <hi>Quia &amp; ipse plurimùm peccabit, &amp; alios ad peccandum coget:</hi> Because he is a notorious sinner himself, and constrains others to sin in the same abominable villanies with him.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the multivarious expressions rather then opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the sin, wherefore Antichrist is called the man of sin.

               <p>A man needs go no farther then his own arguments to fetch fire enough, to turn into vapour and smoke each of these gross mistakes which have no Scripture for their bottom; for the present, this shall be all the confutation (which is enough to that ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader, who peruseth him seriously) that we shall give, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we have work of more consequence to follow, which will reach him fully.</p>

               <p>This is an undeniable truth, that the Antichrist shall arise in the midst of the purest Church in the world, even when it remains pure, therefore (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.) 'tis said, He shall wear out the Saints, and change their customes and lawes; by which it appears, it is the true Church in which he appears; and that Church (by their customes and lawes) is a Nationall Church; where should the two Witnesses be but in the true Church? and where then should he arise that slayes them but in the true Church? look not for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist any where but in the midst of the true Church, and at that time (and not before) when the Witnesses have finished their testimony; in that place, at that time, look for the Antichrist. But that time is not immediately after the overthrow of the Roman Pagan Emperours, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We will grant him the greatnesse of being that monstrous head of the Western Apostasie, and this the Scripture saith of him; but to affirm, that the Pope or Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is the Antichrist that shall arise when the Witnesses have finished their testimony, and shall slay the Witnesses, or the little horn in <hi>Daniel,</hi> rising after the ten horns, or the man of sin sitting in the Temple of God, then to be revealed, when that which did let is removed, all the learned men in the world shall never make me believe; and therefore let not the Papists think their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion hath wonne the day of the Protestants, because he grounds an argument upon their mistakes; no, for we deny that the Pope is the Antichrist that slayes the Witnesses, and yet we do affirm, that the Popedome of <hi>Rome,</hi> and those that have possessed that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped charge make the beast with seven heads and ten horns, which drove the Witnesses into sack-cloth, and into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they drove the woman, the true Church into the wilderness, into her place, and what place is that? but where the Witnesses finish their testimony, and are slain by the Antichrist, who reigns onely so long, as the Witnesses lie dead, which is but three yeares and the halfe of three years in that dominion, where he slew the Witnesses.</p>

reall Devil, that he is one single person, not onely the restrictive articles to each of his names do evidence, but the things attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, as also the time of his continuance do convince us, that the Antichrist is one single person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He is a little horn,</hi> saith <hi>Daniel, speaking great words against God, and wearing out the Saints for a time, times:</hi> and the dividing of that time, which, according to <hi>Daniels</hi> interpretation, can be but four years and a half in probability at the most; the like doth <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. say of the Antichrist.</p>

               <p>The Pope, the father, pretends to exceeding much piety and godlinesse; and so doth the Antichrist, the son; therefore the Antichrist is called the false prophet, and <hi>Paul</hi> (2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 9.) calls him, that person that comes <hi>with power, and lying wonders, and signes, and all deceivablenesse of unrighteousnesse;</hi> insomuch, that if it were possible, the very Elect would be deceived by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his followers: and then in his tyranny over the Saints he much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles his father the Pope; for the Popedome drove the true Church out of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was once the purest Church, and the

famousest in the World, and drove it into the Wildernesse, and caused the Witnesses to sit in sackcloth, that is, in the poorest, lowest, vildest, and most abject state. The Popedome secluded the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> from their right of Dominion in <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath made them sit in sackcloth: mistake me not; for by the Emperours of <hi>Rome</hi> I do not mean the Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> no; they are as excentrick and as unlawful in their constitution, as the Pope himself, who is Pope by the election of his own creatures; there will be found in the world one day one that hath a lawfull title to the Empire by succession, whose predecessours had their title founded upon a lawfull Conquest. Now, as the Pope the father (together with the Eastern Apostasie) drives the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the lawful Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> into the wilderness, which is the true Churches place (observe that <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 14.) so in that place the Antichrist slayes the witnesses; that is, the lawful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed ones of God, who finish their testimony to the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the grand apostasie and usurpation of <hi>Rome:</hi> and after he hath slain them, usurps their power and authority: just like the Pope, when he had drove the Emperour out of <hi>Rome,</hi> seated himself in his throne and authority, and trampled under feet the Ministery of <hi>Rome,</hi> that neither Synods nor Censures of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery were of any force, except such as were of the Usurpers faction, and cried him up for a Saint and a petty god. Herein the Antichrist, the son, is also like the Pope, his father. Hence from the resemblance of their tyranny in <hi>Revel</hi> 13. 12. <hi>the beast of the earth,</hi> (which is the son of perdition <hi>Paul</hi> here mentions) is said to <hi>ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But we leave this sense.</p>
               <p>We come neerer to the literal and general sense, and (as 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived) to that which the Holy Ghost alludes unto. The Antichrist is called the son of perdition, by way of allusion to <hi>Iudas,</hi> who is<note place="margin">Grotius.</note> called <hi>the son of perdition, Iohn</hi> 17. 12. which gives us this notion, that as there arose a son of perdition to betray Christ the lawful Monarch of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and hereby brought a dreadful curse upon the Church and State of the <hi>Iews,</hi> so as that the Gospel departed from them and went to the <hi>Geneiles;</hi> so there shall about that time (when God will cause the Gospel to go forth to the <hi>Iews</hi>) ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther son of perdition arise, which shall betray to death the only true Christian Monarch in the World, that so the <hi>Romish Gentiles Epha</hi> may be full, and God may bring upon them the judgements written, and restore again in their ruine the twelve Tribes, to their ancient possessions.

               <p>This verse gives us a description of those actions which give the <hi>esse formale</hi> to the Antichrist; for 'tis not the person, but the sinne makes the Antichrist formally so to be. This text is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ's looking-glasse, wherein he may see himself face to face.</p>
               <p>His prodigious sin is the slaying of the Witnesses, and this is the sin which the text sets forth.</p>
               <p>In the words there are three generall parts. 1 Antichrist's acts. 2 The object of these actions. 3 The end of his acts.</p>
               <p>1 His acts are set forth under two names or titles given to him. 1 He opposeth. 2 He exalteth himself.</p>
               <p>2 The objects of these actions are, 1 All that is called god. 2 Or that is worshipped.</p>
               <p>3 In the end of his actions we have, 1 The ambitious aimes of the Antichrist laid open, 'tis to make himself supream. [<hi>So that he as God</hi>] there's his Supremacy. 2 We have the place where Antichrist makes himselfe King and Supream, and that is in the Temple of God, in the true Church of God [<hi>Sits in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</hi>]</p>
               <p>3 We have also his kinde of title to all this greatness, described [shewing himself that he is God] 'tis a self-created title that he hath to his Supremacy: he shewes himselfe, he displayes his own colours: the meaning is, he is an Usurper, he hath no title, but what he gives himself.</p>

alludes to souldiers lying in siege against a Castle, who lie close in their trenches against it; so doth the Antichrist lay a siege against the Witnesses, watching for an opportunity, to surprize them, and bereave them of their power and glory. The word answers (saith <hi>Grotius, Zanchie,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>) to the word Satan in Hebrew, which signifies an adversary, as they prove. This turns us to a text which gives us a view of the Antichrist, (<hi>Zach.</hi> 3 3, 4) and the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in filthy garments, and the Lord rebuking Antichrist, who is there twice called the adversary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the rebuking of whom there is a fair Miter put upon <hi>Ioshua</hi> the high Priests head, that is, the Witnesses are called up to the Throne; but this text will require much time to clear, and therefore at this time I passe it by.</p>
               <p>We will take it as 'tis byassed the other way by Commentators, and so the expression, (as that next before it) alludes to <hi>Iudas:</hi> saith Chist, <hi>Have not I chosen twelve, and one of you is a Devil?</hi> and why a Devil? but because he proved a traitor to his own Master, and an hypocriticall cunning traitor against him; so doth Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ against his Liege Sovereign.</p>
               <p>To conclude, he is most probably called the adversary, because he is the opposer of the Lords anointed ones; hence the learned call him the Antichrist, because <hi>Christo ex diametro oppositus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[<hi>And exalteth himselfe,</hi>] these two expressions turn us to two texts, which two texts describe the Antichrist (say the most of the most learned) Commentators) in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 35. <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. he makes war with the Witnesses, &amp; overcomes them; here in opposing them, he makes war with them; &amp; in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming them he exalts himself above them; and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11 35. you have <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>He shall exalt himself above every god, (i e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> saith <hi>Brightman</hi>) above every Magistrate; in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. he resisteth God, that rebels against Magistracie: Oh this is Antichrist, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. 22.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the Antichrist's actions described, he opposeth and exalteth, that is, he maketh war and overcometh.</p>
               <p>Now you have in the next place the objects of his actions, or the parties whom he doth oppose and exalt himself above.</p>

               <p>On the contrary, say the Papists this cannot be; for (say they) Antichrist must deny Christ: oppose God and Christ, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and worshipped as God and Christ: But the Pope will not be worshipped as Christ, for he believes in Christ and worships Christ: so farre is he from denying Christ: Therefore he is not the Antichrist. But if this were all the defence the Papists could make, for ought I know the Pope will still remain Antichrist. For there was never any professor of Christ ever lifted up his head so high against the Lord and his Christ as the Popes have done, except the Antichrist. But to answer their Argument, we utterly deny that the Scripture holds out any such thing, as that Antichrist in open words denies the Deity, or that he requires di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship as a god, or that the <hi>Iews</hi> shall worship him as their <hi>Messias.</hi> There is no such thing as they affirme of Antichrist to be found in Scripture: the two main Scriptures which are brought to prove it, are the Text we are upon, and that of 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It may be that this answer may satisfie those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which live by an implicit faith; but it can never satisfie any rational Protestant, for these two reasons. 1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath not an <hi>iota</hi> of Scripture for his opinion. 2 He hath not so much as probability in his assertion; therefore I leave him, &amp; passe to the other extream of the Protestants, who make this one of their arguments to prove the Pope the Antichrist. But that this cannot be meant of the Popedome, or Pope wil be sufficiently cleer to every unbiassed Reader, as I doubt not, but in part already it is, by what hath been writ to this effect in this Treatise.</p>

               <p>1 There shall be a generall Apostasie, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>before the man of sin be revealed.</hi> 2 That man of sin before he comes to be formally the man of sin, must (<hi>v.</hi> 4) <hi>stay the Witnesses:</hi> and this was no strange or new doctrine; for <hi>v.</hi> 5. he had preached it to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: so that from this double Demonstration, he in this Text concludes with a confutation of their former preposterous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions; for the forme of the Apostles speech is Elenchicall;<note place="margin">Est Elenchus Syllogismus cum contradictione conclusionis. <hi>Arist.</hi>
                  </note> they concluded that the day of Judgement was at hand; No such matter, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> for the generall Apostasie must continue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain space first, and then must come the man of sin in the end of that, and he must slay the Witnesses; and this you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I taught you; therefore now certainly you cannot but know what lets the Antichrists appearing since you have been double taught it; (<hi>viz.</hi>) that of the generall Apostasie, which God by his revealed decree hath ordered first to be; and then the slaying of the Witnesses, the overcomming and suppressing of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy and Ministery which upheld Gods holy Ordinances in their purity <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Apostasie did but drive the Witnesses into the wildernesse, where the Antichrist in the end of the Apostasie findes them and slayes them.

And <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>They that dwell on the earth, i. e.</hi> Antichrists followers, they rejoyce and make merry, and send gifts one to another; and what's the matter? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those two Prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth, that is, those Antichristian factions; they, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Witnesses kept down Antichrist with his followers; therefore these rejoyce for their slaying.</p>
               <p>I very well know the diversity of opinions on this Text:</p>
               <p>Some and those of the Eastern Churches conceive the great let is the Spirit of God, whose powerfull influence in the Gospel kept Antichrist under. This in some sense is true, yet not in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, but confirmation of that opinion of the Witnesses being the great let; for what Mediators doth the Spirit make use of betwixt his Majesty and men but only the Witnesses? <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were thus his Mediators. Others say, the great let is the decree of God: this in some sense (though not in theirs) is true; for there are no events but what fall under Gods decree: but we speak (and so doth the Apostle) of the second, not of the first causes. Others say, the doctrine of the Gospel, was that great let which kept Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ from appearing. This opinion is not totally to be rejected, as contrary to that opinion of the Witnesses; for the doctrine of the Gospel going forth of the mouthes of the Ministery, and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, backed and defended by the sword of the Magistracie, is that that would have kept Antichrist from rising; but here is the mischief, Antichrist by his policy divides Magistracie and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and Ministery and Ministers: and thereby ruines both. And this is one signe of Antichrists comming; for he divides a Kingdome against it self, and friends and families he divides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder. But I digress.</p>
               <p>Others say, the let was the Paganisme of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, which untill removed hindred Antichrist from getting into the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52152:68"/>
Throne. 'Tis true indeed, Antichrist must be one that professeth Christ, not a Heathen, nor profest Atheist, as the Papists say: but Paganisme could not be the let; for the Antichrist is not tied to the <hi>Roman</hi> Throne, nor was Atheisme to possesse the <hi>Roman</hi> Throne, until Antichrist came. The general opinion of Expositors is, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire is the let: this is the opinion of the Fathers, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, say the <hi>Scholiasts,</hi> and they speak best and truest; and to this many learned and pious Protestants consent. I do not love to stretch out <hi>contra torrentem brachia,</hi> as here I must in contradicting this opinion: if they mean the Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, it cannot be; for that was long since ruined, and then Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ must by all the Fathers opinion be long since ruined also, he being to continue in his tyranny but three yeers and an half, as they say, if they mean the <hi>Roman, Christian</hi> Empire (as <hi>Carthus. Bruno</hi> affirms) in some sense it is true; for the <hi>Christian</hi> Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Rome</hi> did doubtless hinder much of the Antichristian pride from rising. Yet this cannot be true in any sense, unless we will grant (which I think may lawfully be granted) that the lawful Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Apostasie was drove (<hi>Revel.</hi> 12.) into the Wilderness, where he did in sackcloth, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a clouded, obscure, remote place and state continue, and in that state kept the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ from rising. Upon the overcomming and depressing of whom the Antichrist arose: if this be granted, it falls into the lap of that opinion of the Witnesses, being the let of the Antichrist, and in all probability we can then point at the place and person both of the Witnesses, and the person that slayes them, and where; but we forbear, it being not to do.</p>
               <p>Others say, the grand Apostasie did let and hinder the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ from appearing. This also in some sense is true; for the grand Apostasie is to precede the Antichrist, and so Antichrist was not to be untill towards the end of this Apostasie: but this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie in its own nature did no more hinder the Antichrist, then the father hinders or lets the birth of the son, because he is ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be before him; or then the horses let or hinder the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots appearing, because they go before it, and it comes after: the grand Apostasie is the begetter and the drawer on of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, not the hinderer of it; and therefore that (as <hi>v.</hi> 7. clears) cannot be the great let of Antichrist; but (as we have said) the great let must necessarily be (as in <hi>verse</hi> 4.) him whom the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ doth oppose, and exalt himself above; and those, (<hi>Revel.</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52152:69"/>
11. 7. and 10.) which he overcomes and kils, and they rejoyce that the old tormentors are removed which did oppresse them and keep them under; therein keeping Antichrist from rising.</p>
               <p>There is one opinion, which I forgot, I finde it but in one<note place="margin">B adshaw.</note> Author, and besides himselfe I think it scarce ever entered into the heart of any Expositor: he holds, that <hi>Paul</hi> by the let here doth not mean that which hindered Antichrists, but Christs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing. This opinion is distant <hi>toto Coelo</hi> from all other; but that neither makes it truer or falser, onely stranger. But to this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinon we answer, that it is not to be received, because it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the scope of <hi>Pauls</hi> words, and to the method; 'tis contrary to the scope of the matter, which in <hi>verse</hi> 4. and <hi>verse</hi> 7. treats of Antichrists rising, revealing, and reigning, and that which hinders him; so that [<hi>he</hi>] in <hi>verse</hi> 6 hath relation to [<hi>he</hi>] in <hi>verse</hi> 4. as [<hi>that wicked</hi>] in <hi>verse</hi> 8. hath relation to [<hi>he</hi>] in <hi>verse</hi> 4. also.</p>
               <p>We will once more touch upon this Text, to see what may (by Gods grace) be drawn from the method and the words.</p>
               <p>The Text (as we said) is <hi>Pauls</hi> inference from what he had laid down in the premisses. In this inference we have the repetition of<note place="margin">Oste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>) is so called, because there the mystery of ruining the Pagan Empire, and the mystery of the grand apostasie, and the mystery of the Antichrist, and the mystery of Christs comming to raise up the Witnesses, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and such goodly pretences, Antichrist; he shall be known to be the Antichrist but by a few; it shall be a speciall blessing, and peculiar favour of God to know Antichrist; very few shall know him, and those that do know him, it shall be revealed to them; he shall deceive, if it were possible, the very elect, so far shall he be from being known to all men to be the Antichrist; and therefore let no man vainly dream, that Antichrist, when he is in the height of his tyranny, shall then be generally known to be the Antichrist. No, he shall be cried up of the loose, hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and apostate professors for an eminent Saint, and the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>Take this as a generall note of Antichrist, that few in the world shall know him to be Antichrist, onely those few peculiar choice ones, to whom he shall be revealed.

               <p>And secondly, it is called that his time, in respect of the length<note place="margin">Usque ad tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, &amp; tempora particulámque temporis. <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.</hi> in <hi>Dan. 7. 25.</hi>

               <p>Mistake me not; for I do not mean that Antichrists time is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished when the Witnesses arise, and his 7000 names of men are slain by a great Commotion, which we read Earthquake.

               <p>In holy writ we finde those rebels against the Lords anointed <hi>Moses,</hi> to be called men of renowne in the Congregation, <hi>Numb</hi> 16. 2, 3. the ring leaders of the wrong-lead people: against <hi>Moses</hi> there were but two hundred and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fifty, but here's seven thousand of them bandied together against the two Witnesses; but here's the comfort; if they were 77000, they mnst suddenly be slain by this great Commotion. But what's this to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How doth this shew the difference betwixt the two great Earthquakes? For answer therefore, it is manifest that there are three wo-trumpets spoken of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the first brings in the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops apostasie, and the sad effects thereof, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. The second wo began, <hi>verse</hi> 13, 14. when the <hi>Turks</hi> arose and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the apostate <hi>Christians,</hi> and this continues until the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ appear and slay the Witnesses, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. and until these Witnesses arise, and that houre the great Commotion or Shaking
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52152:71"/>
(<hi>verse</hi> 13.) throw down the tenth part of the City, that is, that part of dominion where the Witnesses were slain; for there they are said to arise, there their enemies see them, and there the 7000 Chieftains of men are slain. By the fall of the City is meant the fall of it from the Antichrist: it becomes no more a den for such thieves and murtherers; but the Witnesses arise and possess the throne.</p>
               <p>And this is the finishing of the second wo, <hi>v.</hi> 14. &amp; 15. imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows the seventh trumpet, which is the third wo: here then is the difference as in time (the one Earthquake or Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being at the finishing of the second wo, the other at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the third) so in place and measure they differ, for here no more then the tenth part of the City falls, and the 7000 heads of men (but at the third wo, <hi>verse</hi> 15. all the Kingdomes in the World fall, that is, from the Dragon, the Beast, and the false Prophet; to become the Kingdomes of our Lord and his Christs, that he may reign for ever and ever. This last, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 18. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. tell us 'tis such an Earthquake or Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as never was before on earth.</p>
               <p>Again, at the Earth-quake, which accomplisheth the second wo, though we finde the followers of the Antichrist to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and those Kingdomes where he slew the Witnesses, fallen from him, and restored again to the Witnesses; yet we finde not a word of the slaying of the Antichrist; for certain, he escapes to plot further mischief, that he may come to greater ruine at the third wo: for in <hi>Revel.</hi> 16 13. we finde him with the dragon and the beast plotting to draw forces against the Church, to bring them to the great battel of God Almighty; he is called the false prophet, because <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 13, 14. he doth wonders like a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, but his tricks are false signes and false miracles, on purpose to deceive the people; therefore he is a false prophet: now that beast of the earth is the Antichrist; therefore the false prophet is the Antichrist, who, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 9, 10. is said to <hi>come after the working of Satan with lying wonders, and all deceivablenesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, this last Commotion or Earth-quake, which is at the third wo, is super-abundantly surpassing that Earth-quake at the finishing of the second wo; for, as we said, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 15. <hi>The Kingdomes of this world become his;</hi> so in like manner in <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. compared with <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 19. we finde Gods judgments in a far larger measure to be poured out upon the three
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52152:72"/>
generall enemies of the Church of Christ; for that Earth-quake at the rising of the Witnesses onely throwes down one tenth of the City; but this divides the City into three parts, and causeth the Cities of the Nations to fall, and gives Babylon the cup of the wine of the fiercenesse of Gods wrath; this makes the Islands flie, and the mountains to obscure themselves; this Commotion brings hail-stones from heaven; each stone a talent-weight, and makes the enemies blaspheme.</p>
               <p>That Earth-quake, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 13. destroyes not one of the three generall heads of Gods implacable enemies: but this in <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. destroyes them all three; for in <hi>vers.</hi> 14. those three go forth to the Kings of the earth to gather them to the battel of the great day of God Almighty; and in <hi>v.</hi> 16. they are gathered together: and now at what time <hi>Iohn (Revel.</hi> 19. 19.) sees them gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to make war against Christ: in the next verse, at the same time, he sees the beast taken, and with him the false prophet which wrought miracles before him, (as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 12, 13, 14.) and deceived them that worship his image; and two verses after (though unhappily divided by those that made it a Chapter) you have the dragon bound a thousand years, and cast into hell, with the beast and the false prophet: and this is the meaning of [<hi>It is done, Revel.</hi> 16. 17.] and in <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 6. [<hi>Time shall be no longer;] i. e.</hi> either for the Dragon, the beast, or the false prophet, to infest or trouble the Church: for then is the day of vengeance in Gods heart, and the year of his redeemed is come, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 4. if we would know that day, compare we the three foregoing verses with <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But <hi>Paul</hi> had just cause to declare so much from the very doctrine of those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, which in the beginning of the Chapter he refutes: for the designe of the seducers was principally to defame <hi>Paul</hi> as a Preacher of false doctrine, and so to cast him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church of <hi>Thessalonica.</hi> Here, though mysteriously, the seducers struck at the two great Offices of Magistracie and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery in the Church, in striking at <hi>Paul;</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> as an Apostle was both Magistrate and Minister in the Church. The Apostles were extraordinary Officers, they had something of all the three Offices of Christ resplendent in them: hence it was, (as some learned amongst the Ancients think) that, during the continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their extraordinary Office on earth, that Majesticall rite of anointing whom they pleased with oil, continued: it was a badge of their power which was communicated to them by the Holy Ghost from the great High Priest that had made a generall, and universall, and all-sufficient atonement by the mighty sacrifice of his slain body upon the Crosse, and afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>FOr the mystery of iniquity now worketh only, until what let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth be taken out of the way.</hi>] The meaning is, as I conceive, that the great Apostasie worketh alone without the appearing of the Antichrist, until the slaying of the Witnesses, so he said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>verse</hi> 3. Before the day of judgement there shall come the grand Apostasie, and then the revelation of the man of sin; first, the apostasie, and then the Antichrist after that [<hi>until what letteth be taken out of the way.</hi>] Here is the exact precise time prefixed of the Antichrists appearing, and the slaying of the Witnesses, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the finishing of Apostasie.</p>
               <p>Parallel with this text is that in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. <hi>When they have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit, shall make war against them, and overcome thom;</hi> this text [<hi>when</hi>] and the other text [<hi>until</hi>] are parallel; for in this the mystery of the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legality, which <hi>verse</hi> 3. he calls the apostasie, is to work alone until what letteth be removed: and in <hi>Revel</hi> 11. the Church was to be under foot by the same <hi>Gentile</hi> apostasie, until the Witnesses had finished their testimony.</p>
               <p>This [<hi>until</hi>] is also parallel with that [<hi>until</hi>] in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. where mention is made of the <hi>Iews</hi> unbelief under the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy until the fulness of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be come in, and so <hi>Israel</hi> shall be saved. Where observe the time of the Witnesses slaying and rising again, is the time when the Jewes shall be converted, the same [untill] we finde in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 24. which tells us, how long the Jews dissipation and the Gentile Churches affliction shall by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Apostasie be inflicted, even [<hi>until</hi>] the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Parallel also with the Texts [<hi>until</hi>] is that [<hi>when] Revel.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>In the dayes of the seventh Angel, [when] he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God,</hi> or the great mystery, the mystery of mysteries <hi>shall be finished: then there shall be time</hi> (for the apostasie) <hi>no longer.</hi>

               <p>Of this let we have in the former Verse touched already, shewing the various opinions of the learned upon it.

                  </gap>] betokening the present tense tell us thus much, that even at that present time when the two Witnesses are removed out of the way; or as other texts have it, slain, then the Antichrist shall appear in the World; look not for the Antichrist until the Witnesses be slain, that very act makes him Antichrist: therefore he is said, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. then at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time to arise out of the bottomless pit when he slayes the Witnesses; he was doubtlesse in being as a man, as one single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, before that time; but he was not the Antichrist before he actually made war with, and overcame the Witnesses: the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Antichrists Kingdome is laid upon the slain bodies of the Witnesses, which so soon as they rise must needs tumble down again; their night is his noon. When they are at the very lowest, then is he at the very highest. Be confident of this, that the Antichrist is one single person, destinated eminently to this one single act of slaying the Witnesses; from which act he takes the name of Antichrist; and therefore before that time he is not to be expected to be revealed in and to the world.</p>

               <p>The word is very significant, and addes this to our discovery of Antichrist when he comes: 1 That when the Witnesses are slain the prodigiousnesse of the act shall make the person that slayes them eminently noted and observed in the World: I mean that person who in their ruine exalts himself, and rules, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizeth by his Sword-power. Therefore it is said, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 16. he causeth all, both small and great to submit to his new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so that small and great shall know, and feelingly know the person when he reignes; they shall know him by his new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which much like that of <hi>Caesars, vers.</hi> 12. and by his successes and prosperous attempts against his enemies; and by his manner of enforcing men to subscribe to his new government; but though the World know him thus, yet they shall not by this know him to be the Antichrist. For as when Christ came in the flesh, the Elders, and Scribes and Pharisees, and <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> saw him, and heard of his miracles, yet did not know him, nor believe in him as the Son of God; because it was hidden from these wise and learned men: they had eyes to see him, and the miracles that he did; and eares to hear him, and the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words that he uttered; but they did not see nor hear so as they ought; <hi>viz.</hi> to believe in him as the <hi>Messias:</hi> what! said they, is not this the Carpenter? and the son of a Carpenter? even so shall Antichrist of the apostate Gentiles be seen, and felt, and heard, but not understood to be the Antichrist; they shall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52152:78"/>
not know him when he comes; for he shall deceive them, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 14.) that dwell on the earth; yea, saith Christ, If it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, the very elect; but 'tis impossible, for God shall reveal this lawlesse one to them to be the Antichrist. The word imports the revelation of a mystery, which is revealed onely to some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar choice familiar friends, but remains a mystery to the vulgar world notwithstanding: this secret is revealed onely to such as fear the Lord: Antichrist shall not be known to be the Antichrist, though the prodigious acts of Antichrist shall be known to the generality of men in the world: I mean, that part of the world, where Antichrist usurpes a dominion.</p>

As Antichrist puffed at the Saints of God, disdeining all their force and power, and easily vanquished and overthrew them: so the Lord Jesus when he comes, he will puff at Antichrist and easily vanquish him, and therefore Christ in disdein to him &amp; all his power, that he brings against him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 17, 18. sends his messenger to invite the fowls of the air to a supper, that he would give them made of the carcases of those Kings and Captains, and mighty men, so much doth he disdein the armies of his enemies, and so little doth he doubt of the success of the day, that before he fights he promiseth the fowles a supper at night of these mighty men that set themselves in array against him that day; the breath of Christs mouth against his enemies, is that that shall overthrow them in the height of their strength. Therefore, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 59 19. <hi>When the enemy shall come in like a floud, the Spirit of the Lord shall</hi> by blowing against sin, make him to flie; the Spirit of Christs mouth shall vanquish the adversary, the Antichrist.</p>

                  </note> the Roman Gentiles yield not; whereupon the great day of the Lambes wrath fell upon the Roman Emperours, that they were not able to stand against <hi>Constantine,</hi> but were utterly overthrown, and cast from heaven, the Imperiall Throne, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>The next great day of battel against the Roman Gentiles is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the apostate Antichristian Gentiles, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. where we finde Christ again appearing on his white horse utterly to ruine the heads of the Romish Apostasie, and the Antichrist, which are both set forth under these two titles, the beast and the false Prophet. Now, as at the first great overthrow of the Romish Pagan Gentiles the Jewes were driven out of their own Countrey, and scattered throughout the World; so at (or about) this great day of Christs comming to plague the Antichristian Gentiles, the Jews shall be both converted to the Gospel, and called again to be a Nation, and therefore we have (both in the Old Testament and the New) these prophecies joyned together; for the great signe of the Jews conversion to the Gospel shall be the ruine of Antichrists followers by a great Commotion, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 13. and the calling up of the Witnesses to heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> to their imperiall Seat and Throne. This we shall finde to be the scope of severall prophecies, both in the Old and New Testament; and this is the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52152:80"/>
scope of this fore-cited Text in <hi>Isa.</hi> which when we look neerer to it, we finde both the manner of expression and the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it exactly matching <hi>Pauls</hi> expression and prophecie; for in it (as in <hi>Pauls</hi>) we finde an ingemination of the thing, and the denomination of the person; for <hi>Paul</hi> calls him the <hi>wicked one,</hi> and <hi>Isaiah</hi> calls him the <hi>wicked one; Paul</hi> saith, <hi>he will destroy him with the spirit of his mouth;</hi> and <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, <hi>he will destroy him with the Scepter of his mouth;</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. <hi>with the sword of his mouth;</hi> which sword is called, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 1. the Lords <hi>great and strong sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in that he saith, <hi>he will smite the earth;</hi> I humbly conceive in this place he means the Antichristian earth; and by the <hi>wicked one</hi> is meant the Antichrist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which <hi>Paul</hi> (in the Text we are upon) calls the <hi>wicked one;</hi> therefore, now in that he saith, <hi>He will smite the Antichrist with the Scepter of his mouth;</hi> it gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that Antichrist shall not be destroyed by humane power, but by the immediate power of the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall gloriously manifest his justice therein, &amp; therefore in that Type of the Witnesses in sack-cloth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. under the representation of <hi>Iehoshua</hi> the Priest in filthy garments, and of their state of rising, again under the type of Crowns being put on their heads, and their garments changed, and <hi>Ioshuah</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> standing like golden Candlesticks of the Temple, and Olive-trees supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. The Prophet wondering how this should be brought about in such an afflicted state as the Church was then in; the answer is, <hi>Not by humane help or power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts, Zach</hi> 4. 6. the mighty power of the Spirit shall make that mountain a plain before his <hi>Zerubbabel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of Christs mouth goeth a sharp sword, wherewith he smites the Gentiles.</hi> The sword in his mouth is his imperiall command: the word of an absolute Monarch is a sword, against whom none can stand: there lies the majesty of a Monarch in his absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which commands are the spirit of his mouth, or the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his mouth, or the sword of his mouth: how much more is it so in the King of kings, and Lord of lords.</p>
               <p>If the Word of Christ from the mouths of weak Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours be sharper then a two-edged sword, vvhat is it immediately from heaven? the voice of the Lord breaks the Cedars in <hi>Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> it bringeth mighty things to passe; the voice is the spirit of the mouth; this voice is that vvhich calls the Witnesses from
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52152:80"/>
death to life; from their low and sad state up to heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 12. <hi>and the same hour causeth an Earth-quake</hi> or Commotion to overthrow the Chieftains of men, who were by their sword-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the upholders of the Antichrist, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and this voice causeth all the Kingdoms in the world to flock in unto the Gospel and Scepter of Christ; and what power in heaven or earth can effect such glorious things, but onely the spirit of his mouth who breaths the life of all souls into them? <hi>Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, whereby he smites the Nations, Revel.</hi> 19. 15.</p>
               <p>That which from all this we may gather is, that neither the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing<note place="margin">Note.</note> of the Witnesses, nor the ruine of Antichrist shall be by meer humane help or power, but by the mighty imperiall power of Christ. Hence it is, that when Christ commeth to accomplish this great work, (<hi>Luke</hi> 18. 8.) he shall scarce finde faith on the earth; and why? but onely because he'l come to raise the Witnesses, when there is no visible power in the world to own them, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 36. <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 16, 17, 18, 19.) and when the enemies are in their might and strength irresistible. When the adversary shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall blow him to flight; and this shall be (<hi>v</hi> 16.) when there is no man to help or save his Church; as in that of <hi>Moses</hi> before cited, when there is none shut up, nor left; and all their power is gone; then God ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to judge for his people against their proud insulting enemies. These three verses comprehend the fore-cited Texts which run pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with <hi>Pauls.</hi> In <hi>v.</hi> 16. you have Christ clothing himself in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to come against this enemy, as in <hi>Revel</hi> 19. and <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>he destroys the adversary by blowing upon him;</hi> 'tis as much as to say, the Lord shall destroy him with the spirit of his mouth.</p>
               <p>But when shall this Text of <hi>Isaiahs</hi> be fulfilled? compare <hi>v.</hi> 20 with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25, 26. it tells you when it shall be fulfilled, when the fulnesse of the Gentiles is come in, <hi>i. e.</hi> when the Gentile A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie is come to the full; <hi>i e.</hi> when the Antichrist appeares with his great successes against the true Church, which <hi>Isaiah</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 18. seems to tell us shall be situated in the Islands towards the Evening-Sun, <hi>v.</hi> 19. for as the Gospel in its first glorious day came from the East, and shone into the West; so in the second glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous day of the Gospel; this day (<hi>Isaiah</hi> tells us) it shall go from the West to the East; for then all Israel (the Easterne people) shall be saved, <hi>i e.</hi> converted to the faith, and restored to their own land, as it is written, <hi>There shall come out of</hi> Sion <hi>a deliverer</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:52152:81"/>
                  <hi>and turn ungodliness from Iacob:</hi> I'le appeal to all sober men in this world whether ever this Text that <hi>Paul</hi> quotes, since <hi>Pauls</hi> time hath been fulfilled; if not, then probably it is to be fulfilled when the apostasie of the Gentiles is fulfilled, when the Antichrist the Popedome, and the Dragon are cast into utter darknesse, and by Christ destroyed.</p>
               <p>As for that Text, <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 4. we take the boldnesse to affirm that it is literally meant of the destruction of the Antichrist, as <hi>Pauls</hi> Text is: <hi>Paul</hi> taking this prophecie from <hi>Isaiah;</hi> that so the Jews in time to come might believe <hi>Paul</hi> as well as their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to be sent of God. My reasons why I take this Text to be prophesied of the Antichrist, are,</p>
               <p>1 Because of the stupendious change which shall then be wrought, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. there shall be a blessed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cordial, and charitable union wrought betwixt Jew and Gentile: this (say the learned) was partly begun by the twelve Apostles, but it shall be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after Antichrists ruine by the prosperous successe of the two Witnesses: so that the glorious effect of Christs appearing to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Antichrist is to be accomplished.</p>
               <p>2 Because of the gracious promises then to be fulfilled, which to this day have not been fulfilled, <hi>v</hi> 9, 10. There shall be no kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nor destroying in all Gods holy mountain, or in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of holinesse, <hi>i. e.</hi> all wars shall cease amongst Christians; The mountain of the Lord shall be on the top of all the mountains; that is, the Church shall prevail, as Christianity did in <hi>Constantines</hi> dayes, and much more abundant, and the Gentiles shall flock in unto it; hereby their union shall be wrought, which shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a generall peace in the Church. Now to this day, this hath not been accompilshed; therefore it is to be, say many learned men; yea the Rabbins themselves in a manner affirm as much, that it is to be, when the Lord shall come to destroy Antichrist; for, they say, it shall be accomplished, when their <hi>Messias</hi> comes, which they say will be in the end of the Roman Monarchy, which they call their last redemption, being exceeding angry at the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians (would they had not just cause) for extending many of their most ample and glorious prophecies no further then the second Temple. <hi>Vide</hi> Rab. <hi>Solomon</hi> on <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 40. and then the promise is, that the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea; <hi>i. e.</hi> there shall be an universal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ in the world, which never yet hath been: and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52152:81"/>
then (in <hi>v.</hi> 10.) it shall be in that day that Christs rest shall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or exceeding glorious: by rest is here meant either the peace and tranquillity of the Church, which he calls [his rest] or the place of Christs residence, which signifies his Church. So that either way the Text hath not been yet fulfilled: for the Church hath had little rest since Christs time; for the generall Apostasie hindered its glory: but when the Apostasie shall be taken away, then the rest of the Church shall be glorious: therefore this smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the wicked one in the Text, is most probably the smiting of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>3 From <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14. we argue, for this smiting of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one shall be in that day when God will recover the remnant of his people the second time from <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Pathros</hi> and <hi>Cush:</hi> this must be meant of some recovery of them after their carrying Captive into <hi>Babylon</hi> by the <hi>Assyrians;</hi> for they were never set down in Scripture to be delivered above once from <hi>Assyria,</hi> and that was when they were restored by <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But now here is a second restoring again of the Jews, which must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of their restoring under the Gospel, which yet hath not been; for their recovery, (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) shall be from the four corners of the earth, from whence they were never yet redeemed, but are to be, <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. 30, 31. compared with <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 37. 9, to 28.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>when Christ comes in the clouds;</hi> that is, <hi>sits on the white cloud,</hi> Revel 14. <hi>with a Sickle in his hand to cut down the vine of the earth, i e.</hi> the beast of the earth, the Antichrist. In <hi>Isaiah</hi> Christ sets up an Ensigne, and in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. there is the signe of the Son of man, by that, in both the dispersed Jews are gathered from the four corners of the earth.</p>
               <p>And that which most of all confirmes it, that this conversion and redemption of them is to be in these latter dayes, is (<hi>v.</hi> 13.) for <hi>Ephraims</hi> and <hi>Iudahs</hi> enemies shall be cut off; and both <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> and <hi>Iudah (i. e.</hi> the ten Tribes and the two Tribes, never since <hi>Solomons</hi> time united) shall be now at peace, and firmly united; but this hath never yet been; therefore (say very many) this promise is to be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>From all this I argue, If the great Gospel-effect in uniting Jew and Gentile together, of universall peace in the Churches of Christ, of universall knowledge of Christ in the earth, of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of the Hebrews from the four corners of the earth, and uniting them, being recovered, be to be in that day, when Christ

shall smite the earth with the rod of his power, &amp; with the breath of his mouth slay the wicked one; then this day is yet to come; and, in all probability, this smiting is the smiting of the Antichrist, after whose ruine these glorious things are to be effected: as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many of the Ancients, and of the pious learned Recents affirm, besides many clear Texts which make it apparent. The destruction of the Antichrist is onely ascribed to the Lord Jesus, and to none else: hence it is that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 39, 40, 41, 42. we finde Christ in fighting against him, speaking of himselfe at least eleven times in the singular number, <hi>I, even I am he,—I kill, I make alive, I wound, I heal, I lift up my hand, I live for ever; if I whet my sword,—I will render vengeance, I will make mine arrowes drunk with blood:</hi> Christ in the first person singular, he alone will have the honour of Antichrists destruction; and hence it is, that thrice in <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. we have the little horn (the last upstart under the Roman Monarchy) his ruine set out like the day of Judgement; though the horn be little, yet his ruine is great, in <hi>v.</hi> 9. he is ruined by the Ancient of dayes, who did sit; this is the Lord Jesus, who is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> who in the ruine of this little horne sets up, <hi>v.</hi> 14. his own Kingdome, which is an universall Kingdome, and a perpetuall Kingdome, that is, untill the end of the World. In <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. there you have the Antichrist, and the quality of those over whom he tyrannizeth, they are Saints: which gives us by the way to know, that Antichrist must tyrannize within the purest Church; in that Church where are visible Saints. And you have the Ancient of dayes again appearing; many take this to be the day of Judgement, because here is mention made of the Ancient of dayes comming, which is onely to be understood of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ to ruine Antichrist, and to call the elect of Jews and Gentiles unto the profession of the Gospel; the same you have again in <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. and in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 45. and 12. 1. when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall come to his end (after he hath prevailed so far against the Saints, as to pitch his tents in the mountain of holinesse) at that time <hi>Michael</hi> shall stand up to bring trouble upon the enemies of the Church, and deliverance to his distressed people; this <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> is none other but the Lord Jesus Christ, who by his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate providence in making bare his Arm, making naked his Bowe, and appearing with the sickle in his hand (all Scripture-expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his immediate power) terribly and utterly confoundeth Antichrist, and all Antichristian powers. Hence also 'tis that <hi>Ioel</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:52152:82"/>
calls this great day of the destruction of the Antichrist, <hi>the day of the Lord, Ioel</hi> 3. 14. and what is this day of the Lord? in the verse before, 'tis the time of his putting in his sickle to reap the great harvest of Antichrists ruine, as 'tis expounded, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 15. the place is called <hi>the valley of decision:</hi> and why of decision? not that this alludes to the harvest, but to the place where this harvest shall be, which is Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> alluding to that great rent that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall make there, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 4. the great division shall be made betwixt Antichrist and the true Church: by Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> cannot be meant otherwise then some eminent National Church of Unity within it selfe; out of which Church Antichrist and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate company arise against it; and this makes Mount <hi>Olivet</hi> to cleave in sunder; so that now that place is become the <hi>valley of decision:</hi> and then the next verse after the Text, <hi>v.</hi> 15. tells us this day of the Lord is to be, <hi>when the Iews redemption draweth nigh, Luke</hi> 21. and (as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. hath it) <hi>when the signe of the Son of man appears in heaven;</hi> for <hi>the Sun shall be darkened, &amp; the Moon shall withdraw her light,</hi> as 'tis in all the Evangelists except <hi>Iohn;</hi> and the immediate effect of it is (as in the following verses) <hi>a glorious day of Church-reformation:</hi> likewise in <hi>Obadiah</hi> 15, 16. this day of Antichrists destruction is called <hi>the day of the Lord upon the Gentiles:</hi> what Gentiles?</p>
               <p>1 The Gentiles that have drank the blood of the Church, they were those Gentiles that had dranke blood upon the holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: therefore, as these Heathens had done to the Church, so the Lord would now do to them. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 16. is a parallel Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this Text.</p>
               <p>2 They are those <hi>Gentiles</hi> that shall be destinated to destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Gospel-Church shall have a glorious deliverance; and the <hi>Iews,</hi> both the ten Tribes and two Tribes (for these are the sonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi>) shall possesse their possessions, <hi>verse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 17. by which it seems most probable that this day of the Lord must be that day when God destroys Antichrist, who gathers great strength (<hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 19.) against the Lord Jesus, that is, against his true Church, and this war is called a war with the Lambe, <hi>i e.</hi> with the true Church; for it is impossible they should make war with the Lord Jesus any otherwise, then by ruining his Offices and his Ordinances, and blaspheming his Name, and denying his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and—which so neerly concerns his honour, that he will by his immediate power and might arise and ruine the Antichrist and

                  </gap>; this is that other expression of the manner of Antichrists ruine. It is a word (say the Learned) rarely found amongst other Authors, but familiarly in <hi>Pauls</hi> writings; it is a word setting out the utter ruine of the Antichrist: as Antichrist by his appearing made the power of the two Witnesses, and all their pious endeavours of none effect; he brought it to nothing by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their honour and majesty in the dust; so Christ by his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall bring down and destroy the government, and strength, and power of Antichrist; he shall render all that he hath done as vain, Christ shall overturn his <hi>Babel</hi>-strength and ambition, Christ shall make all his successes to come at last to nothing; and all his wealth and conceited honour, to vanish away. He thinks by his prosperous successes to be some body, and to raise himselfe a sure pillar; but Christ shall make all this uselesse to him, and of none effect: he'l not leave one stone of his Government standing upon another. Hence, (<hi>Daniel</hi> 7. 26. a Text parallel with this, both in phrase and sense) 'tis there said, <hi>The Iudgment shall fit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and destroy him unto the end.</hi> The like expression to the same end we have, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 19. of <hi>casting the vine of the earth into the great wine-presse of the wrath of God,</hi> that is, crushing him to nothing, grinding him as small as the dust, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him lighter then vanity, uselesse and vanishing as the smoke. Concurring in sense with these, is that Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 20. where the Antichrist is taken &amp; cast alive into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; which notes first, the dreadfulnesse of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, He is cast alive: and secondly, theirr ecoverableness of his ruine, He perisheth for ever; for out of hell there is no redemption: and thirdly, it notes the Author of this ruine, The Lord Jesus: for none can cast into hell but he; none hath the power of heaven and hell but he; he hath the key of <hi>David,</hi> and none but he. Once again let's view the word, and it denotes the quality of the person as well as the manner of his ruine; I think we may stretch the sense so far without cracking

               <p>Some say, by this comming of Christ is meant the comming of Christ to Judgement: some say no, but it is meant Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to reigne personally upon earth amongst his Saints: Say a third, neither, but Christs comming is to destroy Antichrist by his glorious power in raising up the Witnesses.

               <p>That opinion that this is meant of the coming of Christ to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is most imbraced and followed, and their reason for it is the same that the Chiliasts use to maintein their absurd, and little lesse then blasphemous opinion of Christs personal reign upon the earth amongst his Saints militant, before the day of Judgement. They say, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (when used about Christ) signifies his personall appearance alwayes in Scripture; but (say they) Christ shall not personally appear untill the day of Judgment; <hi>Ergo</hi> the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Antichrist shall not be untill the day of Judgement. Cold comfort for the Church Militant, (which by this opinion is like to lie under the frozen Zone of Antichristian persecution untill Doomes-day,) that all the world be on a fire: and colder comfort for the twelve Tribes, who are like to lie in the dungeon of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, impenitencie and unbelief, untill the day of Judgement come upon them, and damn them: they (by this opinion) shall never see Christ, till he come to damn them; their consciences shall be fast asleep untill hell-fire awake them; their faith in Christ shall be no other then that of the devils, to believe and be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52152:84"/>
damned. Thus making void both the gracious purposes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God towards them, both in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is really so, for it is a generall received truth amongst the learned Expositors, that the Jews generall conversion to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel shall not be untill Antichrist be destroyed, and it is a clear truth in Scripture. But if Antichrist be not destroyed untill the day of Judgement, farewell the Jewes conversion and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever.</p>

               <p>In this sense, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 39. is th be understood, [<hi>Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi>] Look back to the Context, and it tels us that the Church and state of <hi>Iudea</hi> should be desolate untill that time that they welcomed the messengers of the Gospel whom now they despised <hi>[Ye shall not see me] i. e.</hi> know me: 'tis an intellectuall sight of him by faith; ye shall not believe in me untill the day that your heart be inclined according to <hi>Isaiah's</hi> prophecie, to say, <hi>How beautifull are the feet of them that bring the glad tidings of peace?</hi> untill then, <hi>the vail should be over the eyes of their minde,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth it; <hi>but when the time is fulfilled, then they shall look on him whom they have pierced, i. e.</hi> by faith look on him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10.</p>

and as from Mount <hi>Paran</hi> he blessed the Civill Government, in endowing the Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> with a large measure of his Spirit: thus establishing their Church and State-Government after their glorious deliverance out of the cruel bondage of Egypt; so God shall come to deliver the house of <hi>Israel</hi> from under the long and sore captivity of the Roman Monarchy, by converting them to the Gospel, and restoring them to their own land, so forming them to be a Church and State again. Thus God shall come from <hi>Teman,</hi> (this is the comming of Christ) and the holy One from Mount <hi>Paran. Teman</hi> and <hi>Paran</hi> were two Wildernesses, in which the Church of God wandered; and where they had these glorious apparitions of Gods favour, to note, that the Church under the Gospel shall be, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. and 12. in the Wildernesse, when God speaks thus comfortably to her, <hi>Selah</hi> being a note of musick; for the elevation of the voice is very Emphaticall here; for when God shall restore the Jews from captivity, Jacob (<hi>Psal.</hi> 53. 8.) <hi>shall rejoyce, and</hi> Israel <hi>shall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be glad:</hi> therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> heares (<hi>Reve.</hi> 19. after the Roman Monarchy was ruined) a great voice of much people, saying, <hi>Hallelujah:</hi> the highest song deserves the highest note: the note was so high set, <hi>v.</hi> 6. that it was as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, <hi>Allelujah.</hi> But how is this comming parallel with that of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Matthews</hi> and <hi>Iohns?</hi> this is exactly parallel with them: for as here he is said to come, so he is said to come with great splendor and glory; and with great power; his glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise; and his brightnesse was as the light: here's the brighnesse of Christs comming; and then he had hornes comming out of his hand, there is the comming of Christ in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, there was the hiding of his power, or the mystery of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; by which it appears, this comming of Christ in glory and power to destroy Antichrist, and convert the Jews is a mystery, as <hi>Paul, Romans</hi> 11. <hi>Iohn, Revelat.</hi> 10. and <hi>Moses, Deuteron.</hi> 32. call it.</p>

               <p>The Holy Ghost describes him (that the Church may know him above all others when he comes) 1 By his manner of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world. 2 By his followers or subjects.</p>

               <p>[<hi>Whose comming</hi>] Comming, or appearance, or presenee, is here put for the full possession that Antichrist hath of the throne he usurpes; his appearing formally to be Antichrist; and how is this appearance? the Text answers, [<gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Some learned men conceive that by Satan is not here meant the Devil, but such an enemy and adversary of the Lords Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was; their ground for this is partly from the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which signifies not an infernall spirit, or reprobated Angel, but an adversary or spightfull enemy. If this be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Text, then it must run parallel with that, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 12. he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, or in the

presence of him; that first beast is the Pope, so that as the beast of the Sea with seven heads and ten horns got up to his usurped greatnesse by supplanting his Sovereign; so by the same rounds of policie doth the Antichrist climbe up to his usurped greatnesse: and thus he may be said to come after the working of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary the Pope, who is the grand adversary of the true Christian Church, and of the Jews conversion; but I cannot adhere to this opinion: for Satan here (as for the most part every where) is one of the black attributes of the Devil, appropriated onely to him.</p>

                  <hi>Iudas, (Matth.</hi> 26. 48.) gave his souldiers (of whom for a time he was Conductor Generall) a signe whereby to know Christ.

This usually accompanied the Prophets before Christ, when they were made Apostles, and had a word put in their mouths, usually a signe went along with their word of prophecie. Therefore when Christ was cried up of the people for a Prophet, the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees come, and require a signe from beaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 1. that was to confirm his extraordinary mission, and the new doctrines that he taught.</p>
               <p>As Christ by signes and miracles confirmed his Anointing as only Head, Priest, and Prophet as man, and so anointed above his fellows, above all that ever were, he was <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, the King of Kings, Priest of Priests, and Prophet of Prophets, as he, I say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confirms his unction and his new government by signes and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.

               <p>This observe as a general truth, that that man, or Church, or<note place="margin">Note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> State, since the establishing of the Gospel-Church upon the Bible, that have no better title then the present signes and miracles they bring with them to uphold it, do build upon an Antichristian foundation. For you may be sure their title is not good by the law of Christ in his sacred records, who flie from that to feigned signes and miracles of their own.</p>
               <p>I cannot say particularly what these signes are; but sure I am from the text, they are deceitful signes and prodigious signes. What prodigies and signes, <hi>Europe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

subjection to his new government, as you may see in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>Another parallel text we have in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24 24.—where the Antichrist is set forth by his followers, those that comply with him, and promote him by dividing and corrupting and over-top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Church by those factions of Apostates, which they draw out of the Church against it. They are ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I am loath to enter upon <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. it being a Chapter so full of unrevealed revelations, there being much more difficulty in it then commonly Expositors conceive: yet if I did affirm that <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 16. ran parallel with <hi>Pauls</hi> prophecie in the description of Antichrists ruine, <hi>verse</hi> 8. whereby the breath of Gods mouth, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 15. <hi>and the brightness of his coming</hi> (as <hi>verse</hi> 12, 16. manifesteth) <hi>he is destroyed with his fellows, verse</hi> 20. that is, brought to <hi>Armageddon, Revel.</hi> 16. 16. I think I could easily prove it, and upon better grounds then as yet I see by former Authours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinions refuted: but I must return to a harder task, and that is to prove that <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. is a prophecie of the Antichrist and his followers. For proof hereof we must borrow the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of him who wrote the last Annotations upon this Chapter:<note place="margin">Annotations on the Bible.</note> Here are (saith he) three questions propounded. 1 Of the ruine of the Temple and of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> 2 Of Christs comming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Jews. 3 Of his comming to judge the World. As for that end spoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 14. it is not meant the end of the World, but the end of the Jewish Church and State-government, the Temple and the Throne should be ruined.</p>
               <p>Now to these three questions Christ distinctly answers, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none as false, nor reproving them as needlesse. To the first question you have an answer which extends to <hi>v.</hi> 22. To the second question, <hi>viz.</hi> when Christ shall come to convert the Jews, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Kingdome to <hi>Iudah,</hi> that is, unite the twelve Tribes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52152:90"/>
again in one Religion under one King, as it was under <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> The Disciples were questionlesse right in the question, for otherwise Christ would have shewed them their errour and mistake: but that Christ doth not, neither in this Chapter nor in <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6. where they ask this question, <hi>Wilt thou at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Kingdome to</hi> Israel? <hi>i. e.</hi> unite <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> the two sticks in Gods hand. They had this opinion not onely by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from their fathers, but they had it from their prophecies, the written received Word, from <hi>Moses</hi> and all the Prophets. See what answer Christ makes to them, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and the seasons that the Father hath put into his hands, but ye shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power;</hi>—the Spirit of Revelation after his ascension; should reveal this to them, as it was to the beloved Disciple <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to all them who by the Spirit afterwards understood Christs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. So that Christ positively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes, that such a restauration of the Kingdome to <hi>Israel</hi> there should be, and they should have in due time a more full discovery of that truth: in the mean time 'twas reserved in the Fathers hands. He that wrencheth the scope of Christs words to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary sense, in my judgement offers exceeding much violence to the Text. Likewise in <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 20. when the Pharisees that ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this question of the comming of the Kingdome of God upon the Old Testament-prophecies, which are clear in the thing: Christ denies not the question, but answers to it in <hi>Moses</hi> words, from whence they raised the question. So that it is manifest, the Disciples were found in the question about Christs comming to call home the twelve Tribes; to which he answers from <hi>v.</hi> 23. to <hi>v.</hi> 35. where he gives the Symptomes immediately going before his comming, and that is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The end of his miracles is to cheat the people into a compliance with his false wayes; whereas the end of true miracles was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the truth.</p>
               <p>The originall of these miracles is the Devil; Antichrist is helped by Sorcerers and Witches that pretend Revelations, and come with all manner of cunning to cheat and deceive soules.</p>
               <p>The matter of them are meer deceits; for dive into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of them, and you shall finde the fire he pretends came from heaven, is fire of his own making, to delude the people.</p>

                  <hi>Ant.

               <p>Here we have a general Character of those Reprobates, who are the followers of Antichrist.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> seems very much to confirm it.</p>
               <p>They would mock God with a mock Religion, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns their mocks upon them again, by suffering others to mock them with a mock Religion, turning <hi>Solomons</hi> proverb into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, and fulfilling it: The back-slider in heart shall be filled with his own wayes, he shall have enough on't.</p>
               <p>An hypocrite puts on <hi>Iacobs</hi> smooth skin of profession to cover the <hi>Esau's</hi> hands and face of his villainie, as <hi>Iacob</hi> put on <hi>Esau's</hi> counterfeit skin, meerly to deceive. He intended to wear it no longer then untill he hath thereby accomplished his designe. He loves Religion no more then <hi>Iudas</hi> loved charity. Though he carried the bag of charity and the tongue of charity, yet he was a hard-hearted thief that robbed the Church, by converting the Church-stock to his own private use. Such are Antichrists follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who receive Religion in the form and externall shew of it, but not in the love and power of it: they receive it into their armes, but not into their hearts; they imbrace Religion, as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> did his beautifull sister, not to be tied in Nuptiall bonds of unity and love, but to satisfie his lust, and after that disgracefully to shut her out of doors.

blindness of their minde, to be cheated by the Devil and Antichrist to their own damnation. Whiles they cheat men under the cloak of religion of their honours and estates, the Devil that whiles cheats them of their souls.

               <p>Some others conceive 'tis meant of the deficiencie of charity in Antichrists followers, they have knowledge and gifts and faith, but no charity, which profiteth nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>Probably, truth is here put for the whole doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in opposition to all other false Religions, so that the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Antichrists followers is this: They are professors of the Gospel of true Religion, but they are hypocriticall professors and temporary; professors: for, 1 They receive not the truth into their hearts; they love not what they professe. 2 Neither do they professe Religion with a designe to be saved by it.</p>
               <p>Religion is not a <hi>Iacobs</hi> ladder for them to climb to heaven by, but a blinde zeal, under which without suspition they carry on their hellish designes: all the heaven they look at, is the wealth and greatnesse and pleasure of the world. They receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved by it; but the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the truth, that they may be preferred by it.</p>
               <p>Hence observe, that the Antichrist is so far from an open deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Christ, that he is a great professour of Christ, who prefers all his followers upon the account of religious men and Saints, men that professe religion: but what saith the Text? 'tis in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie. 'Tis true, they fast and pray, but 'tis not out of love to that solemn duty, that they may be saved by it; but that they may thereby advantage their carnall Interests; as a reverend Divine said wittily once, eying some mens designes, They have (saith he) humbled themselves into the Throne, and fasted and prayed, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52152:94"/>
which they accounted <hi>Achans</hi> wedge, and the <hi>Babylonish</hi> garment into their possession; fasted fine cloathes upon their backs, and self-denyingly wound themselves into all the great and profitable offices. This is all the heaven that Antichrists followers aime at by all their eminent professions; they receive not the truth to the mortifying of their lusts, but for the palliating of their lusts. 'Tis a good place, not grace; a Kingdome here, not a Kingdome here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that their profession chiefly pursues and closely hunts after.</p>
               <p>Shall I say any more? I will not, I need not; Reader, I leave thee wisely to Comment upon this too-too easie Text in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age, <hi>vid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>But the Holy Ghost, as I humbly conceive, by the restrictive articles, and the Scope of the prophecie intends some eminent truth at this time opposed by Antichrist, upon the rejecting of which truth they become Antichrists subjects, as Antichrist by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it becomes formally Antichrist: but of this we shall touch in the last verse.</p>

               <p>In the former verse (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> observes) there is onely the sinne set down. In this verse there is both their sinne and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; their being deluded is both their sinne and their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In the following verse there is onely their punishment set down, which is damnation; the end of all their Apostasie, a just reward for such iniquity.</p>
               <p>In the words there are these particulars: 1 The Judgement denounced [<hi>delusion.</hi>] 2 The Author inflicting it [<hi>God.</hi>] 3 The persons on whom it is inflicted [<hi>them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>In the Judgement or punishment denounced we must observe the Apostles manner of delivery, which is potent in the Causall Conjunction Copulative, for I cannot call [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] imports two things. 1 A false professours damnation is from himself, not from God. He is the cause of it, for 1 He loves not what he professeth; and would you have a man for ever tied to what he loves not? Religion is an hypocrites purgatory, through which he wades with much regret of soul in hope at last to reap some profit. He loves the truths of Christ no more then a Merchant loves the Sea; he longs to be over it at his goald; he intends not to dwell at Sea in any wise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian loves this present world, so a false Christian loves Religion; he cares not how soon he is rid out, so he may obtein his desired ends. So that as a true Christian counts it his hell, and will in no<note place="margin">U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If a man would commune with an hypocrites heart, it would tell him that he looked not at communion with Christ, nor expected any robes of righteousnesse from him, he neither loves Christ nor his truth, nor intends a Spirituall Crown, but earthly advantages by his profession. He loves not the Gospel after such a manner as to glorifie God, and be saved by it: and is not such a man the cause of his own damnation? God will save no man against his will. He will have all his servants Volunteers; he ties none by fatall necessity or absolute determination to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all by free choice; hence our state in the first <hi>Adam</hi> was mutable, because God would be served by a voluntary choice. Since our restauration God gives us a will to choose him, and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in that will to continue with him. And this is the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> of a Christian, that God will give him a will, that he shall never depart from him. But these followers of Antichrist, they are unwilling to receive truth unto sanctification, onely to outward washing, for some carnall end they will receive truth, but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> well observes) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 'tis not their cannots, but their will nots that will damn them; they would not receive the truth to be saved by it.</p>
               <p>2 It imports thus much that a formall hypocriticall professour will easily become an heretick and an apostate, in time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he will fall away. <hi>For this cause God shall send them strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions.</hi> For this cause <hi>Ierusalems</hi> house is left (unto this day) unto

her desolate; for this cause they had eyes to see, and saw not; and ears to hear, and heard not; and hearts to understand, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not. For this cause we have this day so many apostates and hereticks, and fearfull and unbelieving persons even at the mouth of hell. They were formerly eminent professours, but their eminencie was onely in externals, in formalities; there was no inward heart-imbracing of the truth with an inward purpose and resolution to be saved by it; and hence it is, they are so soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to another Gospel, or rather bewitched to imbrace the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Devils; <hi>strong delusions.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the efficacie of delusion, so reads the Syriack; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies errour, and such grosse errour (say the learned) as leads a man from the way of nature, even to sin against the light of nature, against convictions of naturall conscience. But as if this were not high enough, the Apostle underlayes it with this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to raise it above superlative; to note, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs followers who are described to be eminent professours, shall be given up to the excesse of errours, even against the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Covenant-breaking, Treachery, Apostasie, lying with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to deceive, adultery and murther are all sins against the light of nature, and these grosse sins shall professours be grosly guilty of in that time when Antichrist shall be revealed.</p>
               <p>There is yet something more in the phrase; for the efficacie of delusion lies chiefly in this, that all these prodigious sins should be committed by Christians, and Christians bearing the name and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Saints, and they so far from shame and reluctancie in the committing of them, that they vaunt, insult, rejoyce, boast and triumph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> openly in the committing of them, as if they had done God and the Church some speciall service: here lies the efficacie of delusion, that ever professours should be thus given up to a reprobate minde to commit such abominable sins against the light of nature with delight and greediness. This is the grand Character of Antichrists followers.</p>
               <p>But it is said, that God sends these strong delusions: if so, then is not God the Author of their sin and damnation?</p>
               <p>To this the generall answer is, that God sends not this delusion <hi>effective,</hi> but <hi>permissivè;</hi> he is not the efficient of it, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter of it. He permits it by letting loose the rains to Satan, and to Antichrist, and his Instruments. God doth not positively send them delusions. There cannot greater blasphemy be thought
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52152:96"/>
of then to affirm God to be the Author of evill. God sends not any thing for that end to make men believe a lie, neither doth he permit it for any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such end, though in the consequents by accident it effects the same. The Judge fore-warnes his servant of theft, and then tries him by laying money in his way; he steals it; the Judge in punishing him is not the cause of his sin, but the Author of his punishment. God permits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">Object.</note> unwillingly: permission stands not in opposition to the will; for permitting a thing is in some sort willing a thing: and besides, it cannot be supposed that God is an idle Spectator of events; for he is the Governour of all things, and directs all things according to the counsell of his will, and therefore by permitting of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>se delusions to beguile souls to their damnation, he wills them.</p>
               <p>To this we answer, that God doth will these things; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as a means, nor as an end tending to evill; he wills them as actions simply considered, which are not evil, but are made so by accident, through the defects of evill men. Or thus, God wills<note place="margin">Vide <hi>Bazil.</hi> Tom. 1. Homil.</note> them as punishments to the wicked, and so they are good, as being destinated to a good end. He sends seducers amongst hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call professors, as a King sends fire-ships which he takes from his enemies; and guiding their sterns, sends them into the midst of his enemies Navie, whereby he fires and destroyes his enemies. God may be justly said to will these things, as punishments; but not as sins. One and the same thing may be both a sin, and a punishment of sin, as <hi>Augustine</hi> instanceth in many particulars;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> contra <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianum,</hi> l. 5. c 3.</note> a sin both in the seducer and the seduced, and a punishment, as by the wise providence of God ordered to both their destructions.</p>
               <p>As a Judge makes one thief to intrap and destroy another, so God destroyes one sin by another. <hi>Peccata praecedentia punit pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis sequentibus.</hi> God here makes their after-sins to punish their former: since they would not imbrace truth to their salvation, they shall imbrace errours and lies to their damnation; God, as the supream Author of his own righteous vengeance, can take up what weapons he will against his enemies. Now what fitter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument can you finde to punish Apostates in heart with, then to fill them with their own wayes: a false tongue is most fit for an itching ear. These blinde hypocrites God lets them take hands, and lead each other in their new-found paths of delight, untill they both irrecoverably fall into the ditch.

They heap to themselves Teachers after their own hearts; a false heart will choose a false Teacher; and God lets them both alone: Ephraim <hi>is joyned to Idols, let him alone:</hi> this is all the sending which God is said to send.

They would not receive the truth; well, saith God, they shall not receive the truth, but shall be hardened in their sin, untill they die. Since they refused coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and knowledge and the fear of God; they shall have none of it; I will refuse them, saith the Lord; they shall be given up to strong delusion to believe a lie.

As Christ by his gracious wisdome did save an adulterous woman from the judgement of adulterous men, by causing the shamefull sin of the condemned to flie upon the guilty conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the condemners: So God in his glorious wisdome brings to damnation hypocrites, by letting seducers baits catch those seduced souls, that so greedily catch at them; whereby they shamefully (like those accusers of the woman) go away and leave Christ, his Ministers and his Ordinances.

when they have resisted the truth, <hi>i e.</hi> the Witnesses maintaining the truth in opposition to the lie Antichrist; when they have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their own and others mindes with heresies and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and when they have shewed themselves reprobates concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faith, then they shall proceed no further: they shall then receive the wages of their work, damnation. These that <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies of to <hi>Timothy,</hi> are the same that here he prophesies of to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> for they are all professors of Religion, all in one livery, practising the same devillish things, and being alike corrupted and depraved. We finde Antichrist and his followers in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. proceeding no farther then the slaying of the Witnesses, and triumphantly insulting over them, and their authority for three dayes and an halfe; and then on a sudden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly a cloud is seen, and a loud voice is heard, the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses rise, the 7000 names of men are slain by a great Schisme, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, or Earth-quake, which finisheth the second wo; and then followes presently the third wo, or seventh trumpet, and then the Dragon, the beast, and the false Prophet are cast into hell: and <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> and praises throughout, the Church are thundered, and no more of Antichrist appears for ever.</p>
               <p>So that I will say to the true Church, as Christ in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. When ye see these things begin to come to passe, know that the time of Antichrists damnation is nigh at hand, even at the door.</p>

                  </gap>. The Holy Ghost seems to point at some peculiar eminent truth, which these hypocrites and Apostates did reject and would not believe; for 'tis not to be imagined that they rejected all truth, and turned Infidels and Heathens, for then they must necessarily cast off the profession of Christianity, which they that follow Antichrist do not do; and therefore I conceive it is some eminent truth, which God permits to be opposed, purposely to trie the knowledge, faith, love, since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Christianity and courage of his people, and to discover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the rottennesse, hypocrisie, and back-sliding of formal professours; this God usually doth in every age: some eminent truths or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he permits to be opposed, and calls out eminent professours to witnesse unto blood on their behalfe. There's never an Article in the Creed, but at one time or other hath been thus victorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in blood defended; all being delivered to us sealed with our holy Ancestors blood; Thereby teaching us our duty in a time when truth's opposed. God permits certain truths in severall ages
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52152:98"/>
to be opposed in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes: the doctrine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments was opposed, and the true way of externall worship; and then God first sealed his truths with his Martyrs blood; and then delivered them to us, their posterity. Now in the time of Antichrists appearing the great truth, which shall be called in question, to the trial of the Saints, and the discovery of hypocrites and formall professors who shall reject this, is the two great Offices originally Christs, derivatively those whom he anoints, or designes thereunto, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to the Kingly Office, and to the Sacerdotall or Ministeriall Office. (Blessed is that Nation that enjoyes them both together.) These two Offices Antichrist shall (as we have already shewed) oppose and depose: and this makes him formally Antichrist. Now to this Antichrists followers (even against their former protestations and open professions) shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and in the ruining of the Offices shall concurre; and thus they shall rebell against the truth, and become the followers of Antichrist. This onely is signified, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. by giving the mark to the beast, and receiving the mark of the beast; that is, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging against the anointed Offices to be a subject to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Antichrist in direct opposition to it.</p>
               <p>[<hi>Truth</hi>] is here put in opposition to [<hi>lie</hi>] in the foregoing verse, which is there to be understood of the Antichrist; they could put confidence and trust in the lie, the Antichrist, the usurper; but in the truth, the Ordinances established by God they could repose no trust, but rejected them: therefore (<hi>Iude</hi> the 11.) these followers of Antichrist are said to perish in the gain-saying of <hi>Core,</hi> who rejected the two great anointed Offices of Magistracie and Ministery, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> and in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8. There the truth that these Rebels resist, is specified, 'tis that of Magistracy and Ministery; such a resistance as <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> in vilifying them, their commission and authority.</p>

What readest thou? what finde ye there? finde ye not that the ends of the world are come upon ye? finde ye not this day those Scriptures fulfilling in your eyes? Learn from them to know the times and the seasons, that so the great and terrible day of the Lord, which is neer upon all the Gentiles, may not come upon you unawares: be sober, and watch unto prayer; gird up the loines of your minde; stand fast in the faith; quit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your selves like men, your enemies on all hands are great and furious. The Devil is now exceeding wrath, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath but a little while, a short reign. Let's therefore be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to patience, and let me write one word of comfort from my prison, to those Saints of God that seem to be prisoners to the Devil, that are held in the dreadfull black chains of desertion, that groan out their souls in dolesul complaints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let them be comforted with this, Behold, the day of the Lord draweth nigh, your chains are dreadful, but not eternall.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter I had put an end to what I have writ upon the foregoing subject, an eminently learned Text-man (having viewed my papers) sent to me this insuing note.</p>
            <p>Sir, If I mistake not, you and I differ much concerning the time of the destruction of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist; for there are two great battells to be distinguished, the one of the Resurrection of the witnesses, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. which is called a great Earth-quake, tending to the fall of the tenth part of the Citty, the other the field <hi>Armageddon, Revel.</hi> 16. <hi>Such an Earth-quake as was not since men were upon the Earth, so mighty, and so great, v.</hi> 18. then the great City and the great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies fall together; also I am of opinion that we are under the sixth Viall.</p>
            <p>These words in themselves (as also in their effects upon me) are as Apples of Gold in pictures of Silver, <hi>i. e.</hi> of ten times greater value, then they promise to the outward view. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could come more opportunely to me, for hereby I have an occasion given me, to gather up those sacred mysterious frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which I onely left behind, because I thought <hi>Pauls</hi> basket (I meane the 12. <hi>verses</hi> I treated on) would not well hold them all.</p>
            <p>The things then to be discoursed of from this happy occasion are, first, of the two great battells, the one <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. the other <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. under this, the time of the destruction of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, falls to be largely and clearly discussed. Secondly, of the time of the pouring out of the Vialls.</p>
            <p>For the first, I am so far from questioning it, that I fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the truth thereof, and rather then detract, I will add a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52152:102"/>
third battell to be distinguished amongst the rest, or at least wise make it questionable. The first, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, 13. when the witnesses rise, and the Earth-quake shall beate down the tenth part of the City.</p>
            <p>The second battell, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. when the Vine of the Earth, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Church is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
            <p>The third battell, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 16, 17, 18. compared with <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 18, 19, 20. when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Dragon, the Beast, and the false Prophet are destroyed. Now to question much whether these two latter are not one, but of that in its order we shall discusse, if we have roome. As for that Battle, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. (though I improperly call it a Battle) it is clearly distinct from that in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 16, 17, 18, 19. and that <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 19.</p>
            <p>I cannot well call this in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. a Battell, because in the raising of the witnesses, the fall of the tenth part of the City, and the slaying of the seven thousand heads of men we finde not so much as a sword unsheathed, nor a battell fought for it. But <hi>verse</hi> 11. the Spirit of life from God entring into the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, hath this double contrary effect, it sets the slaine wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses on their feet, and makes their lively merry enemies trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">The shaking of Heaven and Earth in the Scripture-sense is the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Throne of Kingdomes, and the strength of the Kingdom's of the Heathen. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 22.</note> with feare.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Secondly, they are three Kings that protected the Saints of God, for in their subversion the Saints are worn out; when Blasphemy is tollerated, the Saints must not thinke to thrive. Thirdly, they are three Kingdomes, which had good Lawes and Customes, else Antichrist would not change them. This little horne (saith <hi>Hierome, Theodoretus, Aquinas,</hi> and severall others both of the Greek and Latine Fathers) is the Antichrist, and considering the forecited Symptomes in the text with what immediately followes, I cannot see how we can conjecture him to be any body else, especially when these texts agree so fully with <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. but that which cleares it most of all is, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27. which compared with <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 15. evidence it clearly, that this little horne is the Antichrist, and that this Antichrist is to be slaine at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet. And upon this very ground I conceive you have a fuller description of this little horne, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36, 37, 38.—45. whom the Fathers call the Antichrist; for when he shall proceed so far against the Church, as to pitch his Tents in the Mountaine of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and for all that shall surely come to his end, at that time, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Michael,</hi> i. e. <hi>Christ shall stand up, and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a Nation;</hi> tis the same with <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 16. <hi>Daniel</hi> calls it <hi>a time of trouble, Iohn</hi> calls it <hi>a great Commotion,</hi> the Evangelists allude to this of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when they speake of Christs comming in the clouds with glory and great power, which is at the seventh Trumpet. The Holy Ghost, that we might know Antichrist when he comes, hath both in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelations</hi> given full and ample descriptions of him. <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. is parallell with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 24. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.—is parallell with <hi>Dan.</hi> 11 36, 37, 38.—in the former you have the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of that sinne, that makes him formally the Antichrist, which is the slaying of the witnesses: in the latter you have the plat-forme or Modell of his government, which he sets up after he hath slaine the witnesses; from both you have him a third time twice againe mentioned, whereby you may assuredly know him, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 8. respecting <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 7. and in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 20. where he is called the false Prophet, in relation to his cheating signes and false wonders, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 14. and also to his government wherein he pretends to imitate <hi>Moses</hi> the great Prophet, he is a mock-<hi>Moses,</hi> and therefore a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Thus by the way something out of my way, yet much conducing to the purpose, have I given you a description of Antichrist, in laying before you the texts that make mention of Antichrist; I now returne, onely be pleased to observe thus much to our purpose, from this which we have said by the way of the Antichrist, that the Antichrist which is a false Prophet is not destroyed untill the seventh Trumpet sound for that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. unto which the Kings of the earth and the whole world (<hi>ver.</hi> 14.) are solicited to send aide, and that <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 19. are both under the seventh Trumpet, at both which (which are both one) the false Prophet appeares.</p>

               <hi>Sol.</hi> For answer hereunto we lay downe these two generall propositions, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That none of the seven last Plagues or Vials are poured out under the second woe. Secondly, that there is a threefold time, in the clearing of these things, to be distinguished, <hi>viz.</hi> First, the present time of the passing of the second woe, and the things at that present time to be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Secondly, the intervenient time betwixt the passing of the second woe, and the coming of the third, and the things in that intervall of time to be acted. Thirdly, the sounding of the seventh Trumpet, or the coming of the third woe, and the effect of it.</p>
            <p>We affirme that none of the seven Vialls are to be poured<note place="margin">1. Proposition.</note> out under the second woe-trumpet.</p>
            <p>The conclusion we intend from the proving of this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that we at this time are not under the sixth Viall; in drawing to this Conclusion, we shall prove two things which confirme the Proposition. First, that none of the seven last plagues come untill the second woe be past. Secondly, that as yet, the second woe is not past, these being put into a Syllogisme, the Conclusion followes. <hi>Ergo,</hi> we are not under the sixth Viall, the first position I thus prove.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> If none of the seven Vialls be poured out untill the third woe or the seventh Trumpet sound, then none of the seven Vialls are poured out under the second woe or sixth Trumpet, for (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 4.) the sixth Trumpet or second woe is past, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the seventh Trumpet or third woe cometh.</p>
            <p>But none of the Vialls are poured out untill the seventh trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet sound. <hi>Ergo,</hi> none are as yet poured out, the <hi>minor</hi> I thus prove.</p>
            <p>If the seven Vialls are not poured out (as they are not) untill the seven Angels that poure them out (<hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 5, 6.) come out of the Temple, and that Temple be not open for them to come forth, (as it is not, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>9.) untill after the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet have sounded, then no Vialls are as yet poured out, because the third woe is not yet come; and the third woe cannot yet come, because the second is not yet past; this leads me to the proof of the second position, <hi>viz.</hi> that the second woe is not as yet past. Thus we prove it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> The second woe is not past untill the witnesses have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished their Testimonie, be killed, lye dead three dayes and an

            <p>There is a threefold division of time to be considered in the<note place="margin">2.

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>. as but even now we have shewed. For the clearing of the thing in hand, let me premise a word or two of the three woes: Know then that there are but three woes mentioned in this Prophesie, the first woe falls upon the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Churches, caused through the foule and horrible apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacie of the heads of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Papacy, which is called a Star fallen from Heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. <hi>verse</hi> 1. to <hi>verse</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>The second wo falleth upon the Eastern Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 13. 21. the Instruments of which woe are the Turkes, the Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan brutish Tyrants, who have not onely defaced the Christian Churches in the Easterne part of the world, but also keep the Jews from possessing freely their own promised Lands and possessions.</p>
            <p>Now at the end or finishing of this second woe, God begins to visit his Church under her long Sackcloth, state and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to raise up his slaine witnesses, and take away one tenth from the grand enemies, and at the same time to slay a great number of notable enemies of the Church; and after this in a very short time, comes the third woe, which falls dreadfully upon all the enemies of the Church that oppose it, throughout the world, both the Turkes and the Papacie, who have brought such woes upon the Western and Eastern Churches.</p>
            <p>Now after the second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>oe is past, when the witnesses are
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52152:105"/>
raised, and the tenth part of the City is fallen, and the 7000. are slaine, betwixt the second woe passing, and the third woe coming, there is an intervall of time which is diligently to be observed.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Iohn</hi> sees in this intervall of time, is in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 15. (for <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 13. the next following the eleventh, are a vision of the Churches state under the <hi>Arrian</hi> persecution, under the Papacie and under the Antichrist, and his new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Revel.</hi> 33. 12. 18.)</p>
            <p>In <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. we have a vision of the comfortable and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull presence of Christ in his Church, that Church where the witnesses rise, it is they that are redeemed from the Beast of the Earth, which sing the new song upon the harp to God, <hi>verse</hi> 1, 2, 3, and <hi>verse</hi> 6. now the witnesses are risen, great preparation is made for the promulgation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, the Ministery, flie swiftly through the world, to call both Jewes and Gentiles from the foure corners of the Earth, to bring them to the knowledge of God in Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>And <hi>verse</hi> 8. you have the courage, faith and zeal of the ministery raised to such a height, that they confidently preach the certain and speedy downfall of <hi>Babilon,</hi> because of her filthy blasphemous Idolatry, wherewith she hath made all Nations, <hi>i. e.</hi> Christian Nations drunke.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>verse</hi> 9, 10. (compared with <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 15, 16.) the Ministers of that Church which (<hi>verse</hi> 1.) bears the name of Christ in his forehead, which (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) is a Virgin Church, which followes the lambe. The Holy Ghost sets this Church out under the notion of peculiar selected persons, to note that it shall not be the generallity of professors of the Orthodoxe faith, that shall thus carry on Gods worke against the three grand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the truth, but some particular faithfull ones in those dominions where the witnesses were slaine: in that Church after the witnesses are risen, do the Ministers (<hi>verse</hi> 9, 10, 11.) boldly denounce damnation, and the eternall vengeance of God against those that adhere to the Antichrist.</p>
            <p>Now this must be in the intervall of time, betwixt the passing of the second, and the coming of the third woe, for it cannot be after the third woe, because at the third woe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. all the enemies are destroyed, and it is not to be thought that they will worship the Beast, or receive his mark
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52152:105"/>
after that he is caught alive and cast into Hell. And then this bold prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, it is not before the second woe be past, <hi>viz.</hi> that the witnesses are risen, and the power that upheld the Antichrist be overthrowne and slaine, (which is to be at the passing of the second woe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 11. 14.) <hi>exempla probant;</hi> for I take this bold preaching to be one eminent effect of the rising of the Witnesses; and if this be one effect of the spirit of life from God entring into them, you may safely swear upon the Sacred Bible they lie now dead, they have no spirit in them against the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, the feculent matter of predominent fear hath so stupified them that they are speechlesse, like <hi>Pliny</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they are mouthless men, I only mean, in not pleading for the great <hi>truth</hi> against the great <hi>lie,</hi> in not vindicating the great <hi>truth</hi> opposed, by declaring openly against the great <hi>lie</hi> that doth prevaile against it; it is an infamous and irreligious piece of cowardise to quit a persecuted truth that cryes aloud, come help me; and strenuously to defend a truth which persecutors shake hands with; is this thank worthy? No, (tis to use a Heathens words) not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: tis not only an ungodly, but an unmanly act. Here's then one effect of the Witnesses rising, that they dare bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speake against the Antichrist and his government, and those that are the followers of him, whereas before they durst not open their mouths; therefore I conceive this intervenes betwixt the second and third woe: and now by way of prevention of other objections from what we have seen in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. we observe.</p>
            <p>1. That the great preparations for an Universall Reformation, and<note place="margin">Observ. <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>2. That after the witnesses are risen, though the Church shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper and prevail, yet untill the third woe come, the Church must not look to sit downe in peace without molestation, the patience of the Saints and their integrity will be still tryed, even to the death, as the two next verses seeme to tell us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, 13. for though at the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the second woe, the chief of the Antichrists followers, who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his usurpation in the tenth part of the City be slaine, yet the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist himself is not slaine, nor all his adherents; for the first viall falls upon the remainder of Antichrists adherents, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 2. and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is plotting, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13. with the Dragon and the Beast againe to overthrow the Church and the risen Witnesses: this vision of the plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Dragon, the Beast, and the false Prophet, is another of those things which are to be placed in this intervall of time, betwixt the second
<pb facs="tcp:52152:106"/>
and the third woe, I meane the passing of the second and the comming of the third, for though <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 13, 14, 15, 16. be placed as if it were an effect of the 6. viall, yet he that seriously views it will see it a distinct vision of it selfe, giving us the immediate foregoing symtomes of Christs unexpected comming to pour out the vialls. At this battell Christ comes like a thief, <hi>i. e.</hi> suddainly, terribly, unexpectedly, in the midnight of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine security; but how will he come? <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11. he comes on his white Horse, signifying victory and triumph, taking vengeance on his enemies, therefore his garment ver. 13. is dipt in bloud, and ver. 17. he comes in the greatnesse of his might, bidding such defiance to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that he sends a messenger before he fights his battell, to invite the fowls of the aire to feast upon the slaine enemies which he intends to give them to supper; ('tis safe being on such a Generalls side) and what flesh is it that he gives them? ver. 18. 'tis the flesh of Kings, and the flesh of Captains, and the flesh of mighty men; but the Beast, and the false Prophet (ver. 10.) he, by the sword of his mouth, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his mandatory power, casteth them alive into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone; they die not the common death of all men, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and irrecoverable, ruine is their undoubted portion, for the sword of the Lord shall effect it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 21. Now what is all this but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effects of the 7. Trumpet? and what are the effects of the 7. Trumpet, but the sending forth the Angels out of the Temple to pour out the seven last plagues of God upon the earth? If this great battell should be any thing distinct after the vialls, then the vialls cannot be the seven last plagues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 1. nor is all done, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 17. when the last viall is poured out, because this great battell which is greater then the greatest plague, is still to come; and this would lead us to the third <hi>Epecha,</hi> or distance of time by us in the second proposition distinguish'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the comming of the woe, or the sounding of the seventh Trumpet, but we must not so leave where we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. for at ver. 14. to the end of the chap. there is another vision which may raise doubts, but this vision being under the seventh Trumpet we shall passe it, onely to take in the 4. first verses of cap. 15. parallel with the 4. first verses of <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. here <hi>Iohn</hi> had a sight of the seven Angels, with the last plagues; who, or what these Angels are I cannot tell, but if v. 2. be any way exegeticall of it, I am of opinion that these Angels come out of that Church where Antichrist had set up his usurped government, and by the great commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (<hi>Rev.</hi> 11.) was thrown downe; for I take <hi>Sea of glasse</hi> to signifie a refined Church, and these that stand upon it the Witnesses, which in the downfall of Antichrists power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. ascended to the Throne, to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52152:106"/>
Heaven; this I take to be the mount <hi>Sion (Rev.</hi> 14. 1.) on which those that openly and purely confessed Christ stood, there they stand on mount <hi>Zihon,</hi> there they stand on a sea of glass mingled with fire, <hi>i. e.</hi> a pure and a zealous Church. These are said to get the victory over the Beast, and over his Image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name: this clearly points out to us <hi>that</hi> Church which of all the nations in the Christian world shall be first purged and refined, and freed from Antichristian bondage, and that is that Church where the beast of the earth set up his new government.</p>
            <p>These 3. verses in <hi>Rev.</hi> 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> set forth the happy progresse in a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which the witnesses wholly risen from under the Antichrists cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Tyranny have made, they became more pure and more zealous after their great deliverance, which they thankfully publish to the world, in hope that God will do great things against his enemies for the further propagating of the Gospel. These are the visions which we finde to fall betwixt the passing of the second wo to the comming of the third: I shall onely adde this, and then passe to the third, and add by way of Quaere, Whether that space of time <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11, 12. be not the space of time betwixt the passing of the second woe and the full accomplishment of the third, I say full accomplishment, becuse the vialls I conceive doe set forth Gods graduall proceeding against the enemies of the Church under the third wo trumpet, all things under the third wo are not accomplished in a day, either for the good of the Church, or the ruine of the enemies. Now at the end of that 1290. dayes, the time of the Jews persecution and dissipation shall be at an end, and they shall begin to flock in to Christ, but the day of their establishment in their own land, that blessed day, is not to be untill the 1335. day, but this we leave.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the last <hi>Epocha</hi> of time which lies within our circle, and that is of the time of the third woe, and the effects thereof, which leads us to the second thing in the little note of my noble friend to be discussed, <hi>viz,</hi> of the great battell distinct from that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>We shall finde, if I mistake not, the seventh trumpet mentioned but twice in the Revelation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. in chap. 10. 7. when the seventh Angel shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, that is the time of the Gentiles tyranny over the Jewes, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Gentiles shall be accomplished, and the twelve Tribes shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. compared with <hi>Isa.</hi> 23. 13. and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 24. as we have already shewed in the foregoing treatise.</p>
            <p>The other Scripture <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. mentioning the seventh Trumpet

shewes the effects or consequents of it, which is the opening of Gods mystery to be finished at this time; and you have two sides of this cloud, the darke and the bright side; the bright side is the bringing in of the twelve Tribes to the Gospel, and the drawing of the Gentiles after them, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 12. to the same faith and worship, where it is said that the Kingdomes of this world are become the Lords and his Christs, and he shall reigne for evermore: and then here is the dark side of this mystery, which is wrath, ver. 18. and eternall ruine on the enemies of the Church; we find this mystery thus finished, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 26, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, 3. there the fulfilling of the word of God, or the finishing of the mystery of God is resembled to the day of judgment, and so it is <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 20, and 20. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 'tis doomes day, the day of damnation to the wicked, to the Dragon, the Beast, and the false Prophet; and it is the resurrection day to the believing Jewes, and sincere gospel-Gentiles, ver. 5. this is the first resurrection; what is the first resurrection? see ver. 4. the establishing of the witnesses in the Throne, and giving them power to reigne over the world, and to purge the earth. At the passing at the second woe the witnesses rise, but at the comming of the third woe the witnesses are fully established in their power; they will have then a large power, and a lasting power. You knew where he was born that by his Christian piety and courage turned the heathenish world from Idols to serve the living God, he made <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen to become <hi>Rome</hi> Christian, he threw downe the heathenish potentates: from the same place look for a Monarch by his Christian courage, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous endeavours to throw downe <hi>Rome</hi> Antichristian, and carry on a glorious Church and State-reformation in <hi>Europe;</hi> sanctified affections fit a noble Christian for great understandings. Then are afflictions san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, when they drive to repent for our forefathers sins, our own, and the nations sins, and make us looke onely to Christ for mercy. <hi>David</hi> by Gods providence was brought so low as to beg his bread of a rigid surly clowne <hi>Naball</hi> before he cast his shooe over <hi>Edom,</hi> and made <hi>Philistia</hi> glad on any tearms to accept him. Crosse providences shall make me admire the unsearchable wisdome of God, but never make me dispon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to call in question the faithfulnesse of God: that which most men this day make the ground of their diffidence, I make the argument of my confidence, and I build my arguments on that which I am sure is more stable then Heaven and Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the prophetique promises of that God, who is both a Sun and Sheild to all that believe in them: a Sun to give light, heat, and comfort to them; a Sheild to safe-guard and protect them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:52152:107"/>The seventh Trumpet produceth these two generall effects, the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the enemies of the Church throughout the world, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of the Jewes from all parts of the world, and the sending out of the Gospel to the reforming of the nations of the world. Of these effects of this Trumpet do both the Old and New Testament Prophets prophesie, as also of the signes immediately foregoing the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, which are the prodigious things done against the professors of the Gospel, and Gods rising up by his eminent judgements against the grand enemies of the Gospel to their utter overthrow: this I take to be the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the sign of the Son of Man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> in <hi>Hom.</hi> 72. on <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. speaking of these dayes immediately preceding the seventh Trumpet, calls them the dayes of Antichrist; and so far he is right, but me thinkes he quite mistakes the signes, and the time of this signe, for both he and <hi>Hierome</hi> take the signe to be the signe of the Crosse, and the time when the signe shall appeare the day of Judgement; but I humbly conceive it is the time of the comming of Christ at the seventh Trumpet, which 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 8. is called the brightnesse of his comming, because when Antichrist with his fellowes are destroyed, all the world shall conclude that the hand of Christ destroyed them: <hi>Luke</hi> bids us to take this for the signe, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28. <hi>When these things begin to come to passe, look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh:</hi> When what things begin to come? ver. 25. when the signes in the Sun and Moone come, and ver. 27. when the Son of Man comes in a Cloud. See 3. parallel Texts which expound these two verses: by Cloud is meant the white cloud <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14. wherein Christ appeares with a Crowne on his head, there's his great glory; with a Sickle in his hand, there's his power; his hornes in his hand is the secret of his power: <hi>Mathew</hi> calls this the signe of the Son of Man in Heaven, <hi>comming in the Clouds of Heaven with power and great glory,</hi> Mat. 24. 30. and <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 11, 12, 13, 15. calls it the opening of Heaven, and the appearance of Christ on a white Horse, that's an Emblem of his victorious power, [and on his head many Crownes] there is his glory: his Vesture dipt in blood signifies his revenging power, and his sharp sword going out of his mouth signifies his majestick power, and his Motto [King of Kings, &amp;c.] signifies his great Glory. This glory and great power hath respect to a double contrary effect of his comming, <hi>viz.</hi> to the downfall of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ver. 29. and to the conversion of the twelve Tribes, ver. 31. both which are under the seventh Trumpet, as is cleare, if we compare with ver. 29. <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. 13. 15. and with it <hi>Revelat.</hi> 14. 14. and with ver. 31. <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:52152:108"/>In <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 29. immediately after the tribulation of those dayes <hi>i. e,</hi> those dayes of Rebellion against lawfull Magistracy, the dayes of Heresie, of Blasphemy, of Truce-breaking, of Murder, of Treason, and great Apostacy of professors, as the former verses imply, and as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3, 4. tells us, the meaning is, after the witnesses are slaine, then comes the judgement on their enemies, the greatest of their enemies; <hi>the Sun shall be darkned, and the Moon shall not give her light, and the Starres shall fall from Heaven, and the powers of the Heaven shall be shaken,</hi> i. e. the grand enemies of the Church that possesse the imperiall Thrones of the world whereby the progresse of the Gospel is hindred: these the Protestants rightly call the Popedome, and the Turkish Empire, and the grand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders of both: the one keeps the two witnesses from their lawfull rights and dominions, the other keeps the Jews out of their posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: now when God shall remove these, both Jewes and Gentiles under the Gospel shall be restored. By darkning Sun and Moon is meant that which is expressed <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 18. the destroying of Kings, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and mighty men; and so is that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32. 7. to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, <hi>viz.</hi> of the overthrow of the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of his Princes and Priests, and destroying of that dynastie. The very words of Christ are fetched from the Prophet <hi>Ioell c.</hi> 3. 15. the day of the Lord in the vally of decision is neare, the Sun and the Moone shall be darkened, and the Starres shall withdraw their shining: there are the same words with the same in <hi>Mathew,</hi> and we prove them one and the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; in a word, 1. Compare <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 17. with <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 27, 28, 29. and it will evidently appear that from that to the end of the prophecy (which is but one Vision) is prophecied of those things which were to be fulfilled in the Gospel-day. This granted (which cannot be denyed) I prove that this prophecie falls under the seventh Trumpet, for in cap. 3. ver. 1. [in those dayes and in that time] in those dayes, <hi>i. e.</hi> Gospel-dayes, there you have the time in generall, [and in that time, what time? the time when I will bring againe the captivity of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi>] here is the time of that day: before you had the day, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Gospel-day, in which this is to be effected. Now you have the time of that day when it shall be effected, it is (whether at the noone or evening of the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day I know not which to call it) when the captivity of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> is to be brought againe, which the Prophets and Apostles call the last dayes, <hi>i. e.</hi> of reformation untill the day of judgement come. That part of the prophecie which <hi>Peter</hi> expounds belongs to the morning of the Gospel-day, but this to the afternoon; for the twelve Tribes are not to be restored untill the time of the seventh Trumpet, as is every
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52152:108"/>
where in the Prophecies plaine, nor are they to this day restored. Now in that we have proved this Prophecie to be under the Gospel, it is easie to prove it to be fulfilled under the seventh Trumpet: in a word, thus I prove it, That which in substance and matter doth sunchronize with the things conteined in other prophecies which are under the seventh Trumpet, must also it selfe be under the seventh Trumpet; but this of <hi>Ioels</hi> and that of <hi>Iohns</hi> in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 15, 16. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 18. 21. and 11. 15. 18. and 19. 11. to 21. all being under the seventh Trumpet, point at one and the same thing, &amp; which materially agrees with that of <hi>Ioels;</hi> let's compare the Texts, and then the Matter in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 15. an Angel comes out of the Temple crying with a loud voice to him that sate on the Cloud, <hi>thrust in thy Sickle and reap;</hi> every word of this proves it to be under the seventh Trumpet, for no Angel (as we have proved) comes out of the Temple untill the seventh Trumpet sound, nor can you finde two loud voices but what are at, or under the seventh Trumpet; nor doth Christ appeare on the Cloud untill the seventh Trumpet: therefore this is under the seventh Trumpet that this Angel cryes put in thy Sickle, in <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. 13. you have the same words, <hi>put ye in the Sickle,</hi> and the same reason of the words, <hi>for the Harvest is ripe;</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how materially they agree in <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. 2. 14. the multitude of Gentiles comming together against the converted Jewes and Gentiles, is called the gathering of the nations to bring them into the valley of <hi>Iehosephat,</hi> ver. 2. and ver. 14. that gathering together is called the day of the Lord, and in <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 12. when preparation was made for the Kings of the East to passe, the enemies were gathered together, ver. 16. to <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedon,</hi> ver. 14. their gathering together is called the battell of the great day of God Almighty. Look we farther into <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. 15. <hi>The Sun and the Moon shall be darkned, and the Starrs shall withdraw their shining,</hi> i. e. the Roman and Turkish policy shall be thrown down. This is an effect of that day of the Lord, and the same effect we shall finde from the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell of the great day of God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. for ver. 19. the great City was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three, their usurped Supremacy fell, the Sun in that Horizon was darkned, and the Cities of the nations fell, and great <hi>Babilon</hi> came to the block, and every Island fled away, and the Mountaines were not found, though the expressions in this and that differ, yet they materially agree in this to set forth the incredible and terrible prodigious things which shall befall the enemies of the Church at the seventh Trumpet, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 18, 19, 20. (that Vine of the Earth may be meant the Turkish Monarchy) in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 18. the flesh of Kings, and Captains, and mighty Men shall in that day be Doggs meat and Crows meat; for if it be done
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52152:109"/>
thus to the green tree, what shall be done to the dry? if Judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the house of God, and the righteous can scarcely escape, where shall the ungodly and sinners appeare? what great things may we look for to be effected in these latter times from these prophetique Texts? <hi>Be wise now therefore O ye Kings, be instructed ye Iudges of the Earth, Seek the Lord with feare, and rejoice with trembling; kisse the Son lest he be angry.</hi>—</p>
            <p>One thing more we have in <hi>Ioel</hi> to prove that this prophecy of his is to be fulfilled under the seventh Trumpet, <hi>Ioel</hi> 3. 7. it is to be fulfilled after the time that the Jewes are sold to the Graecians, to the Sonnes of the Graecians, <hi>i. e.</hi> into <hi>Europe;</hi> their seventy years captivity was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Asia</hi> under the African Monarchy; but this captivity of the Jews is to be under the Roman Monarchy in the Europian part of the world: we know <hi>Titus Vespatian</hi> sold them for slaves into <hi>Greece</hi> and other parts of the world, and they after that suffered grievous and bloudy conflicts under the Roman Emperours: now their redemption from under their last and longest captivity under the Romans and the Turks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not to be untill the sound of the seventh Trumpet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. <hi>And he shall send his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet, and they shall gather together his Elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. Mathew</hi> calls it the great sound of a Trumpet, and <hi>Isaiah</hi> calls it the great Trumpet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 12, 13. when God shall gather his Elect one by one, <hi>it shall come to passe in that day that the great Trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the Land of</hi> Assyria, <hi>and the out-casts in the Land of</hi> Egypt: at the seventh Trumpet the twelve Tribes shall be redeemed from all the quarters of the world. This alludes to the sounding of the Trumpet which proclaimed the yeare of Jubilee, which was to sound aloud throughout the whole Land, that all the poore captives might heare and rejoice thereat; for then they were to be set free and restored to their own possessions, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. even so at the sounding of the seventh Trumpet shall the Jews be restored to their ancient possessions, from which they have so long time been driven out, as those many clear texts which we have quoted do evince.</p>
            <p>Thus have I humbly presented my opinion of the two battels, and how they are to be distinguished and not confounded, they being as distinct as the first and second wo. I have also given my reason why I think we are not undr the 6. viall: the reason why I have said so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> little of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls is because time to come will be their best Expositer, as men have made time past their worst. I will not fly reproachfully upon any that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52152:109"/>
have writ upon the vialls, for their fancy once had drawn me fully to their opinion: but since I searched more into it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde it is either obvious to sense (I do not say fancie) or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to reason, or agreeable at all with Scripture to say that any of the vialls are as yet poured out upon <hi>Rome;</hi> it is absolutely, as farre as I see, contrary to Scripture, for <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. at that time when she is come to judgement, ver. 1. ver. 15. the Whore (<hi>i. e.</hi> the last policy or government in <hi>Rome</hi>) rules over peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues; the Prophecy mentions not onely the extent but the efficacy of his power in blasphemy, and murder, and seducements. The policy of <hi>Rome</hi> prevailes so much (<hi>Revelat.</hi> 18. 7, 8.) in those Kingdomes and States formerly under, or now subject unto its spirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, that in its pride it saith (like an audacious, proud, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Whore) I sit a Queene, and am no Widdow, and shall see no sorrow; therefore shall her plagues come in one day, that day that shee thus vaunts it and boasts of prosperity and successe (seeing I suppose the Witnesses lye dead) that day shall death, and mourning, and famine, and consuming fire fall upon her: and what's all this but the effects of the vialls, which in one day come upon her? I cannot tell whether this one day be put for one year or one age, but 'tis put, I presume, to signifie the speedy end, that God will make with <hi>Rome</hi> when he begins to pour out the vialls, so speedy as that the Kings of the Earth, her confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, beholding with astonishment, fear, and wonder, such suddain and unexpected judgements on <hi>Rome,</hi> call this day one hour; 'tis, I suppose, an hyperbolicall speech comming from the mouthes of men amazed and terrified with such dreadfull judgements, comming so suddainly and unexpectedly upon that mighty City: all is to tell us that when the vialls are poured out, they are poured out or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, but not leisurely, there will not be hundreds of yeeres, nor months betwixt Viall and Viall, I scarce beleeve dayes: For God when he begins to judge the Whore, he will make a speedy end with her. At the seventh Trumpet this mysterie of God shall be finished.</p>
            <p>Ile conclude my Discourse of the seventh Trumpet with setting downe in figures, not in words, that part of <hi>Iohns</hi> Prophesie, which properly falls under the seventh Trumpet, <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 11. 15. to the end of the Chapter. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 14. to the end of the Chapter. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15, 16, 17. all for the most part a preparatory vision of the seventh Trumpet. The 15. Chapter tells us who shall execute the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52152:110"/>
wrath of the seventh Trumpet, and whence they come. The 16. Chapter sheweth the manner and matter of the seventh Trumpet. The 17. Chapter sheweth the two grand Enemies of the Church, on whom the wrath and woe of the seventh Trumpet falls. These are the great Whore, ver. 1. and the Beast of the bottomless pit, ver. 8. that carries her, ver. 7. From hence tis clear that the Beast of the bottomless pit and the Pope are distinct persons; for if by <hi>Whore of Babilon</hi> be meant the Pope (as the most learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants truly affirm) then the Beast of the bottomless pit which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Pope cannot be Pope himself. My inference hence is this, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Pope is not the Antichrist, for he that slayes the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses is the Antichrist, but the Beast of the bottomless pit slayes the Witnesses: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Pope is not the Antichrist, being distinct from the Beast of the bottomless pit. I do not disprove that the Pope is not an Antichrist, but not the Antichrist whose reign over the slain Witnesses is to continue but three dayes, and the half of three dayes at the utmost: as there are many Witnesses, and have been in all ages, yet they are quite distinct from the two Witnesses; so there have been and are many Antichrists, which, notwithstanding are distinct from that Antichrist, the Fathers and the after Churches have from <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> desciphered. In the end of the Chapter we have a vision of the Instruments of inflicting the wrath of the seventh Trumpet, which are called ten horns, who (v. 17.) gave <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, their Kingdome, tis not Kingdomes, but Kingdome, by which it appears that it is that Poliarchy or supream authority in those dominions under one supream head where Antichrist slew the Witnesses that shall destroy <hi>Rome,</hi> that government or that policy which through their oversight put all their power into the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs hands: these when the Witnesses rise shall also arise; indeed their rising from under the Antichrists Tyranny is a great part of the Witnesses rising; though these are profound Texts I touch upon, yet my doubts are not greater then my hopes of great things and glorious for the Church of <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>'s good from them, and that speedily.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Revelations</hi> 18. is the Vision of the effect of the seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet upon the great <hi>Babilon,</hi> that is <hi>Rome,</hi> say many Papists, and all the Protestants.</p>
            <p>And ver. 9. The great lamentation of the Kings of the Earth for her ruin; these Kings which committed Fornication with her, <hi>i. e.</hi> were of the same Popish Idolatrous Religion with <hi>Rome,</hi> the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52152:110"/>
Romish Catholique Princes. Observe here, not the Popish Kings of <hi>Europe</hi> eat the Whores flesh and burn her with fire, for they weep and wail for her: I am very prone to believe that the ten horns which destroy Antichrist are those Peers or Princes who in those dominions where the Witnesses are slain, arise from under the Tyranny of Antichrist after the great Commotion, <hi>Revelations</hi> 11. 12, 13. and (<hi>Revelations</hi> 17. 16.) shall destroy <hi>Rome:</hi> for (I beseech thee Reader observe) the ten horns that Antichrist gets on his head, <hi>Revelations</hi> 17. 12. they are not ten Kingdomes, nor no where so called, but ten Kings, <hi>i. e.</hi> a certain company assuming Kingly power (would that were all) but have no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but receive power as Kings one hour with the Beast who set them up in the slaying of the Witnesses. These usurpers are overcome in a battell with the Lamb, ver. 14. and after that ver. 16. that lawfull power which Antichrist threw down (yet pretended to set up, purify, and establish, therefore called the ten hones on the Beast) shall arise and destroy the Whore. 'Tis clear, that both the ten horns here mentioned are those that are within the power and dominon of the Antichrist, he getting power from the ten horns, ver. 17. to invest those other ten horns, ver. 12. of his faction with power to make war with the Lamb: sure I am this is a clearer exposition of these Texts then that which makes the ten horns ten Kings of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> who being Papists shall turn, they say, from the Pope, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him: I wish it may be so, but I can find no ground for it in Scripture. In the next Chapter the quite contrary is most true. In chap. 19. and chap. 20. we have the white side of this Trumpet, the rejoicing of the Church for Gods glorious deliverance of it, and after the finall overthrow of the three grand enemies which is parallel with <hi>Rev.</hi> 14, 4. 20. the Church hath a large respite of rest from all its both secret and open enemies from <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog,</hi> and the Witnesses are firmly seated in the Throne, and the 12. Tribes restored to their own land.</p>
            <p>Thus have I, as I could, endeavoured to remove all Objections to clear those Doubts and Obscurities which I find obnoxious to the mind, in finding out truth, or embracing that which from the written Word is laid before it. There are two other Questions arise from this Discourse: the one is, 1. Whether the Antichrist in person shall be at the great battell at <hi>Armagedon?</hi> and whether Turks and Papists shall joyn together to resist the Jews Restoration, and the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

Reformation, the Antichrist being a chief leader in this battell against them? 2. Whether <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. and 22. be meant of the state of the reformed Church under the seventh Trumpet, or it be a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of that state of bliss which the Saints are made partakers of in the life to come? To this last much may be said against what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently by some asserted, but I wave it, lest I be accounted both bold and tedious; both which I disaffect in others, and hate in my self.</p>
            <p>Whether this Reverend Person whose Paper hath drawn all this from me—will take it well or ill, I know not: but with humble thanks I do acknowledge his favour (as the first that ever I received of this kind) in shewing and correcting of my Errours, for which I shall ever subscribe my self his Disciple, humbly submitting whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have writ to his, and such like learned prophetick Text-mens Censures.</p>
