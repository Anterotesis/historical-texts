         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>THE smalness of this Treatise would hardly justifie the solemnity of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, but that it might be thought too great a rudeness to press without some Ceremony upon a Book, which both the Merit and Character of the Author, and the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of those Approbations he has prefix'd to it, may justly seem to have fenced from all vulgar attempts, as Sacred and inviolable. It may perhaps be some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the Reader too to know, how it is come to pass that a Meer <hi>Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of Rome,</hi> pretending to contain nothing but what they have always professed, and in their Council of <hi>Trent</hi> plainly declared to be their Doctrine; should have become so considerable, as not only to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by many Persons of the greatest Eminency in that Church, but even to be recommended by the whole body of the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> in their Assembly 1682; <note place="margin">Method. 10.</note> and whereever it has come, done so many Miracles, as not only common report speaks, but even the <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement</hi> it self prefixed to it, takes care to tell us that it has.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:36811:6"/>
The first design of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi>'s Book was either to satisfie or to seduce the late <hi>Mareschal de Turenne.</hi> How far it contributed thereunto I am not able to say; but am willing to believe that the change that honourable Person made of his Religion, was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some better grounds than the bare <hi>Exposition</hi> of a few Articles of the Roman Faith; and that the Author supplied either in his personal Conferences with him, or by some other Papers to us unknown, what was wanting to the first draught which we have seen of this.</p>
                        <p>The Manuscript <hi>Copy</hi> which then appeared, and for about four Years together passed up and down in private hands with great applause, wanted all those Chapters of <hi>the Eucharist, Tradition, The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church and Pope,</hi> which now make up the most considerable part of it; and in the other points which it handled, seemed so loosly and favourably to propose the Opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that not only many undesigning Persons of that Communion were offended at it, but the Protestants who saw it, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed that <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> durst not <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</hi> own, what in his <hi>Exposition</hi> he <hi>privately</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be their Doctrine.</p>
                        <p>And the Event shew'd that they were not altogether mistaken. For in the beginning of the Year <hi>1671 the Exposition</hi> being with great care, and after the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of many years reduced into the form in which we now see it; and to secure all, fortified with the Approbation of the Archbishop of <hi>Reims</hi> and nine other Bishops, who profess that <q>Having examined it with all the Care which the importance of the matter required, they found it conformable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, and as such recommended it

to the People which God had committed to their conduct,</q> it was sent to the Press. The impression being finish'd and just ready to come abroad; the Author, who desired to appear with all the Advantage to himself and his Cause that was possible, sent it to some of the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> for their Approbation to be joyn'd to that of the Bishops, that so no Authority, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary or extraordinary might be wanting to assert the Doctrine contained in it, to be so far from the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Protestants had conceived of it, that it was truly and without disguise <hi>Catholick, Apostolick, and Roman.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to the great surprise of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux,</hi> and those who had so much cry'd up his Treatise before, the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> to whom it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, instead of the <hi>Approbation</hi> that was expected, confirmed what the Protestants had said of it; and, as became their faculty, marked several of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable parts of it, wherein <hi>the Exposition</hi> by the too great desire of palliating, had absolutely perverted the Doctrine of their Church.</p>
                        <p>To prevent the open Scandal which such a <hi>Censure</hi> might have caused, with great Industry, and all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy possible, the whole <hi>Edition</hi> was suppressed, and the several places which the <hi>Doctors</hi> had marked changed; and the Copy so speedily sent back to the Press again, that in the end of the same year another much altered was publickly exposed, as the <hi>first Impression</hi> that had at all been made of it.</p>
                        <p>Yet this could not be so privately carry'd, but that it soon came to a publick knowledge; insomuch that one of the first Answers that was made to it, charged <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Meaux</hi> with this change. I do not hear that he has ever yet thought fit to deny the Relation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:36811:7"/>
in the <hi>Advertisement</hi> prefixed to the later Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Book, wherein yet he replies to some other passages of the same Treatise, or in any other Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Whether it be that such an imputation was not considerable enough to be taken notice of, or that it was too true to be deny'd, let the Reader judge. But certainly it appears to us not only to give a clear account of the Design and Genius of the whole Book; but to be a plain demonstration, how improbable soever <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> would represent it, <q>
                              <hi>That it is not impossible for a Bishop of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>either not to be</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Advertisement Pag. 1.</note> 
                              <hi>sufficiently instructed in his Religion to know what is the Doctrine of it; or not sufficiently sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, as without disguise to represent it.</hi>
                           </q> And since a Copy of that very Book so marked, as has been said, by the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> is fallen into my hands, I shall gratifie the <note n="*" place="margin">See the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection at the end of the Preface.</note> Readers curiosity with a particular View of some of the Changes that have been made, that so he may judge <hi>whether of the Two</hi> were the Cause of those great advances, which the Author in that first Edition had thought fit to make towards us.</p>
                        <p>It might perhaps appear a very pardonable curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in us, after the knowledge we have had of the first miscarriage of this Book at the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> to enquire how it comes to pass, that among so many <hi>other Approbations</hi> as have with great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry been procured to the later Editions of it, we do not yet see <hi>any subscription of theirs</hi> to it, even now. <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> could not certainly be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what weight the Censure of that Learned Faculty is with us; and that such an <hi>Approbation</hi> might not only have been more easily obtained, but would also more effectually have wiped away the blot cast upon his Book by their former refusal, than all the Letters
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:36811:7"/>
and Complements that could come from the other side the Mountains, and which <hi>France</hi> it self hath taught us, in maters more considerable than this, not to have too high a Value for: Nor can we suppose any thing else, than that the fear of a <hi>further Correction</hi> kept it from being any more submitted to their <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</hi> and that the Author would rather pass without the Honour of their <hi>Approbation,</hi> than run the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a second Refusal.</p>
                        <p>But for this, because we cannot speak any thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, we will not pursue our Conjectures. Certain it is that whatever the judgment of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> would now have been of it, many of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were still dissatisfied with it. <note n="*" place="margin">See his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement.</note> And how improbable soever <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> would have us think that one of his Answerers affirms, that a Papist should have written against him; Yet not only the confessed sincerity of <hi>Monsieur Conrart</hi> who often declared that he had seen it, but the undoubted integrity of <hi>some others</hi> by whom I have been assured that they had it, in their hands, obliges me to joyn in the assertion, that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur M—,</hi>one of the Roman Communion had finish'd an Answer to it, before any of the Protestants were published, however upon some certain Considerations it was thought fit to suppress it.</p>
                        <p>It will perhaps be looked upon, that this confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Manuscript Answer deserves as little as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> has thought fit to give to <hi>Monsieur de la B—</hi>'s first Assertion of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to shew that it is not impossible, nor indeed very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that Papists should write one against another; and that the Method of the <hi>Exposition,</hi> how plausible soever to deceive Protestants, has nevertheless of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the sincere and Undesigning of the other Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:36811:8"/>
I will beg leave to produce two or three undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Witnesses upon some of the first and chiefest Points of it; and which though not written purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against it, yet I am perswaded, <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> himself will be so just as to confess, that he cannot be altogether unconcerned in them.</p>
                        <p>For his first Point, <hi>The Invocation of Saints;</hi> The great moderation of the <hi>Exposition</hi> tells us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <q>That it is useful to pray to them, and that we ought to do it in the same Spirit of Charity, and in the same Order of Brotherly Society with which we intreat our Friends on Earth to pray for us: that all the Prayers of the Church howsoever they may be worded, yet must still be understood to be reduced to this form, PRAY FOR US.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now what <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> here says in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral concerning the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> another Tract Printed about the same time at <hi>Cologne,</hi> and intituled <hi>Salutary Advertisements of the Blessed Virgin, to her indiscreet Adorers;</hi> particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that Service, which with so much superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                              <hi>[Avis salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taires de la bien heureuse Vierge à ses Devots indiscrets.</hi> This Tract was publish'd first at <hi>Gand</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> by <hi>Monsieur Widenselt</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> Intendant of the Affairs of the Prince of <hi>Suarzembergh;</hi> afterwards Translated into <hi>French.]</hi>
                           </note> is paid in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Mother of Christ.</p>
                        <p>The Book is every where full of Expressions of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Respect for her; and only speaks against that Worship which <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in the name of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> to be none of theirs. It was sent abroad into the World with all the Advantage imaginable: It had the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> of the Bishop of <hi>Mysia,</hi> Suffragan to the Archbishop of <hi>Cologne;</hi> of the Vicar General of
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:36811:8"/>
the place; of the Censure of <hi>Gant;</hi> of the Canons and Divines of <hi>Malines;</hi> of the University of <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain;</hi> and Lastly of Monsieur the Bishop of <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> who recommended it as a Treatise <q>full of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Piety, and very fit and necessary to draw peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of those Errours and Abuses into which their Superstition had led them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet notwithstanding all this Applause, if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what success this Book had with others, <hi>Father Crasset the Jesuit,</hi> who wrote purposely against it, <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <q>
                              <hi>That for fear of giving Scandal to Hereticks, he had given a very great one to</hi> (those he calls) <hi>Catholicks: That the Learned Men of all Nations had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against him; that the Holy See had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd him;</hi> Spain <hi>had banish'd him out of its Dominions, and forbid to Read or Print his Book, as containing Propositions suspected of Errour and Impiety, that abused the Holy Scripture, and imposed upon Catholicks, by taking them off from the Piety and Devotion due to the Mother of God; In a word, from the general Invocation of Saints and Worship of Images.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I shall not need to say how far the Fathers Zeal carries him in the Answer it self: It is evident that what <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> tells us, is only <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> the Jesuit declares to be <q>
                              <hi>absolutely Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>

                              <hi>That we are indispensably obliged to pray to her: That it is the intention of God, that we should obtain both Grace and Glory by her; That all Men should be saved by the Merits
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:36811:9"/>
of the Son, and the Intercession of the Mother, and that forasmuch therefore as God has resolved not to give any Grace but what passes through the Hands of</hi> Mary; <hi>as we cannot be saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace, so it must be confessed that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saved without her.</hi>
                           </q> This is I presume some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than what <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> expounds to us; and I shall leave it to any one to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Father who has shew'd himself so zealous against the Author <hi>of the Blessed Virgins Salutary Advertisements,</hi> could have been very well pleased with <hi>Monsieur de Meaux's Exposition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The next Point which the Exposition advances, is concerning <hi>The Worship of Images, Monsieur de Meaux</hi> in the Edition suppressed, affirmed, <q>
                              <hi>That the</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">See the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection at the end of the Preface.</note> 
                              <hi>Church of</hi> Rome <hi>does not so much honour the Image of the Apostle or Martyr, as the Apostle or Martyr in presence of the Image.</hi> And though the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure passed upon this new fancy, obliged him to speak a little more plainly, yet is it only thus, even now, <hi>that when the Church pays an Honour to the Image of an Apostle or Martyr, her intention is not so much to honour the Image, as to honour the Apostle or Martyr in presence of the Image.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Concerning which the Reader may please to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that <hi>Cardinal Capisucchi</hi> one of the <hi>Approvers</hi> of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux's Exposition,</hi> has lately set forth a Volume of Controversies at <hi>Rome,</hi> with all the most solemn Permissions and Approbations that can be desired, in which he formally contradicts the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the same <hi>Exposition</hi> in this Point; and concludes, <q>
                              <hi>That the Church in the Councils of</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Art. 8. p. 647.</note> Nice <hi>and</hi> Trent <hi>forbids only such a Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Images as is Idolatrous,</hi> i. e. <hi>says he,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:36811:9"/>
which is paid to Images in and for themselves; and by which the Image is worshipped, as if some God or Divinity were contained in it. But for that Divine Worship which is paid to the Images of the Holy Trinity, of our Saviour Christ and the Holy Cross, upon the account of the things represented by them, and as they are in that respect one and the same with the thing which they represent, and ascribes not any Divinity to the Images, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, nor can be any dispute of it.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> may please to consider whether this be not sufficiently contrary to the Doctrine <hi>Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by Him; and how we are to reconcile the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies of the <hi>Cardinal Capisucchi,</hi> with the Letter and Approbation of the <note n="*" place="margin">So he was when he wrote to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situr de Meaux.</hi>

                           <hi>Master of the Sacred Palace.</hi> In the mean time I will beg leave to add one instance more, that is nigher home, and I think still at this time depending; and which the particular interest <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> has more ways than one had in it, will I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose undoubtedly satisfie him, that notwithstanding the <hi>Assembly of the Clergy</hi> have recommended so much both his Book and his Method, all nevertheless at this day are not very well satisfied, even in <hi>France</hi> it self, either with the one or other.</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Monsieur</hi> 
                              <note n="†" place="margin">The whole of this is taken out of the <hi>Factum</hi> which he printed of his Case.</note> 
                              <hi>Imbert</hi> Priest and Doctor of Divinity in the Province of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> was not long since accus'd, that upon <hi>Good Friday</hi> before he proceeded to the solemn service of that day, which consists chiefly in the <hi>Adoration of the Cross;</hi> He turned to the People, and taking occasion from the rashness of some of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Mission</hi> whom he had with grief heard maintain, <hi>That the Cross was to be adored after the very same manner as Jesus Christ in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Eucharist;</hi> profess'd to them that
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:36811:10"/>
he could not enter on the service of that day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring truly to them what the real Doctrine of the Church as to this point was. That the Church designed not that <hi>we should adore the Cross which we see,</hi> but that we should <hi>adore Jesus Christ whom we do not see.</hi> That there was a great difference between <hi>the Cross</hi> and <hi>the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> That in this our Saviour Christ was really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, whereas that was only a simple figure or represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of him.</p>
                           <p>This was his Accusation, and he confessed that his Opinion was, That the Church <hi>adored not the Cross,</hi> and that the contrary Opinion was not only <hi>false</hi> but <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> That not only the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants made their advantage of those who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd such Errours, but that he himself was scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized to converse every day with the Missionaries and others, whom he had openly heard preach a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, <hi>That we ought to adore the Cross with Jesus Christ, as the Humane nature of our Saviour with the Divine.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Being accused for this, he defended himself with all the strength of Argument that he was able; yet being still accounted a Heretick for it, he finally alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his defence, <hi>That the Exposition of</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>defended the very same; that he went upon his principles, whose book was approved by the Pope and several Cardinals in</hi> Italy, <hi>by the Bishops and Clergy of</hi> France <hi>and others of the greatest note in the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
                           <p>Nevertheless he was suspended in a manner grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and extraordinary: He wrote to <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> himself about it, who presently sent to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> in his behalf: He addressed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:36811:10"/>
besides to many other the most considerable Persons of the Kingdom; to <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Chancellour; <hi>Monsieur de Chatteau-neuf;</hi> to the Intendant of the Province, only that he might have justice in a cause, which <hi>according to Monsieur de Meaux's principles, was certainly very favourable;</hi>
                           </p>
                        </q>
                        <p>But I do not hear that he has yet had any other Effect of all his supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the interest of those Honourable persons in his behalf, than that they still draw more and severer menaces from his Judges, and threats either of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Imprisonment, or even death it self for his Offence.</p>
                        <p>After this clear conviction I may reasonably hope it will appear no improbable matter to <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> himself, either that one Papist should have written against his Book, or that many others should have expressed themselves to be of a mind very different from the principles and opinions of it. Had it pleased him to have gratified the World with the sight of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Buillon's</hi> and <hi>Monsieur l'Abbé de Dangeau</hi>'s letters to <hi>Cardinal Bona</hi> and <hi>Cardinal Chigi,</hi> as well as of their answers to them, they would perhaps have shewn, that not only the Protestants pretended such oppositions of his own party to his Book, but that <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> himself was not altogether unsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it.</p>
                        <p>No sooner was the first Impression of the Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">See the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement.</note> which was permitted to pass abroad, finish'd, but presently a Copy was dispatch'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> with Letters and recommendations to prepare the way for its reception in that Court; and provide against <hi>those faults</hi> which <note place="margin">

                        <p>It is not to be supposed that either the dignity of the Cardinal who sent the Book, or of him to whom it was address'd, would have permitted them in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to take notice of <hi>the faults</hi> and <hi>the Contradictors</hi> which their Letters speak of, had they not been both things, and Persons worthy their consideration.

                        <p>What other particular persons were employ'd upon the like Offices, is a secret too close for us to be able to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate.

                           </note> the few Letters we see set out with so much Industry both in the Originals and their Translation, and the long History of them in the Advertisement, were the effects of a labour and interest, great as the long term of eight years that were spent in the procuring of them.</p>
                        <p>The second Answer to <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> has so fully examined every one of these Approbations, and so plainly shew'd how small account is to be made of them, that we do not find that in four years that it has been publish'd, any one has undertaken to reply to it. I will therefore only add in general a remark or two that may serve to inform those of our own Country who are unacquainted with such intrigues, what
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:36811:11"/>
                           <hi>the Method of the Approbations of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is, and how little stress is to be laid upon them.</hi>

                        <p>It is a long time since it has been resolved by many of their Casuists, that it is lawful to disguise the sentiments of their Religion, not only in private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but in the very Pulpit it self, when there is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reason for the doing of it. But I cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be yet so generally known that it is lawful for them to set their hands to and approve those Books whose Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Doctrine they dislike, by an Art peculiar to themselves, and which Protestants, who are used to sincere dealing, will find it a little difficult to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
                        <p>The instance of <hi>Cardinal Capisucchi</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is an undeniable proof of this for <hi>Italy;</hi> Who about the same time that he sent his Letter and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> of his Exposition, wrote, as we have seen, directly contrary to the Doctrine of it, and had his Book approved with no less solemnity at <hi>Rome,</hi> than <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> can pretend his to have been. And for <hi>France,</hi> a Person very justly esteemed both for his great Quality and his own worth, <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Procureur General</hi> of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> having clearly revealed the mystery of it, I shall beg leave to represent it to the World, under the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of so great and unquestionable an Authority.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Father Thomassin</hi> about twenty years since print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Book which he called <hi>Notae in Concilia;</hi> the design whereof was to set up the Authority of the Pope above all Councils, which he renders in a manner useless to the decision of Ecclesiastical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Copies of this Book were all seized, and lock'd up in a Chamber of the <hi>Fathers Oratorians</hi> at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                           <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:36811:12"/>
Ten or twelve years after, with some changes to fill up the Leaves that had been censured, and <hi>the Approbation of the Doctors of the Sorbonne,</hi> he again attempted to have it publish'd. But <hi>Monsieur</hi> the <hi>Procureur Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> opposed it, and told him that but in consideration of Father <hi>Harlay,</hi> his near Relation, who interposed for him, he would have had his Book burnt by the hand of the common Hangman.</p>
                        <p>The Father justified himself that his Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no other Principles than what were found in <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine's</hi> Controversies, which <hi>had been printed with authority, and were permitted to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day publickly sold in</hi> France. The Procureur General replyed, <q>
                              <hi>That they suffered in</hi> France, <hi>that an</hi> Italian <hi>should write according to the Principles of his Country, and that this ought not to hinder but that a Book, otherwise good, might be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly printed and sold with priviledge; but that for a</hi> Frenchman <hi>to do the same, was another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and would have different consequences:</hi> and that in short, <hi>The</hi> Italians <hi>used the same method towards them.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed the late change of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in their <hi>Approbations</hi> plainly shews, that it is permitted to those of the Church of Rome <hi>to write and approve not so much according to their own Opinions, as to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and</hi> Genius <hi>of the Country in which they live.</hi> For which reason the Fathers of the Society do no longer now, as formerly they were wont, take out their <hi>Licence</hi> from the <hi>General of their Order,</hi> but from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Provincials;</hi> who accommodate themselves to the current Doctrine of the place in which the Book is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd; without which it would be almost impossible for them to write in <hi>France,</hi> but they should be subject to the danger of a censure at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>But whatever the Opinion either of the Pope or Papists has been of this Exposition, certain it is the Protestants have openly enough declared their thoughts concerning it; and the Exposition according

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Monsieur de Turenne</hi> not long before that last Campagne in which he lost his Life, made great boasts of a Reply that was speedily to be publish'd to them; but after the long expectation of above eight Years, only <hi>an Advertisement</hi> was prefix'd to a new Edition of the Book, which neither touches at all the greatest part of the Exceptions that had been made against it, nor gives any satisfaction to those it do's take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
                        <p>It has been the constant method of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux,</hi> having once written, to leave his Tracts to the World, and take no care to defend them against those assaults, that seem with success enough to have been sometimes made upon them. We should think the great Employments, in which he has had the Honour to be engaged, might have been the cause of this, did not he who takes no care to defend his old Books, find still time enough to write new. Perhaps he looks upon his pieces to be of a Spirit and Force sufficient to despise whatever attempts can be made upon them; but sure he cannot be ignorant, that Protestants make another and far different Conclusion, and look upon <hi>those O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions to be certainly indefensible, which so able and eminent an Author is content so openly, and, if I may be permitted to add it, so shamefully to forsake.</hi>

What other Answers besides those I have now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned have been made to it, I cannot undertake to say; Two others only that I know of have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd; the Author of the latter of which <hi>Monsieur de Brueys</hi> having in a very little time after his writing left his Religion, might have made a new instance of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi>'s Conquests, did not his inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to answer his own arguments against the Exposition, give us cause to believe, that some other Motives than those of that Book induced him so <hi>lightly</hi> to forsake <hi>a Cause,</hi> which he had so <hi>soundly</hi> and generously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
                        <p>And now after so many Answers yet unreplied to, if any one desires to know what the design of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent undertaking is, they may please to understand, that having by a long Converse among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists of our own and other Countries perceived that either by the ignorance or malice of their Instructors, they have generally very false and imperfect Notions of our Opinions in the matters in Controversie between us, I have suffered my self to be perswaded to pursue the Method of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi>'s Exposition as to the <hi>Doctrine of the Church of England;</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose sincerely to what he pretends is the Opinion of the Roman Church, <hi>that form of Faith that is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profess'd and taught without any disguise or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation among us.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I was not unwilling to take the Method of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> for my direction, as well upon the account of the great Reputation both of the Book and of the Author, as because it is now some years that it has pass'd in our Language without any answer that I know of made to it. Besides, that the late new Impression made
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:36811:14"/>
of it, with all the advantages of the <hi>Advertisement</hi> and <hi>Approbations,</hi> which the later <hi>French</hi> Editions have added to it, seemed naturally to require some such Consideration.</p>
                        <p>I do not pretend by any thing of this to treat <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> as an Enemy, but rather as both his great Learning, and that Character which I have ever learnt very highly to reverence, oblige me, to follow him as my Guide. To render an account to him and to the World what our differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are, and point out in passing some of those reasons that are the most usually given amongst us, wherefore we cannot totally assent to what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.</p>
                        <p>I am perswaded the whole is done with that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Moderation,</hi> that there is nothing in it that can justly offend the most zealous Enemy of our Church. If I knew of any thing in it that without dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Truth might have been omitted, I sincerely profess I would most willingly have done it, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to please all, that so, if it be the will of God, I may by any means gain some.</p>
                        <p>For this cause chiefly have I forborn to set my name to it, lest perhaps any prejudice against my Person, might chance to injure the Excellence of the Cause which I maintain.</p>
                        <p>This effect at least, if no other, I would willingly hope such a Treatise may have upon those of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try that have been taught to believe very different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning us; That they would please no longer to form such horrible Ideas of our Profession as they have heretofore been wont to do; at least till it can be shewn that I have either palliated or prevaricated <hi>the
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:36811:14"/>
Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England in this Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. Which I am yet so assured I have not done, that I here intirely submit both my self and it to her Censure; of whose Communion I esteem it my greatest Happiness that I am, and for whose preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Enlargement I shall never cease, as I ought, to pray.</p>

                              <hi>MOnsieur de Meaux</hi> in the very beginning of his Book speaking of the design of it, had these Words:</p>

                                 <q>So that it seems then to be very proper to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to them (the Protestants) the Doctrine of the Catholick Church, <hi>separating those Questions which the Church has decided, from those which do not belong to Faith.</hi>

                              <p>It is evident, the meaning of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> in that passage must have been this; That <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was either not at all</hi> contained in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, or was <hi>otherwise maintain'd</hi> by any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Authors, beyond the Exposition he gives us of those Points which are here mentioned, was not to be look'd upon by us, as any of <hi>the Church</hi>'s <hi>Decision,</hi> nor <hi>necessary to be received by us as matter of Faith.</hi>

                           <p>As to the point of <hi>the Invocation of Saints, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Meaux</hi> still shews us that he knows not what account to give of the grounds of it. He proposes seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways how the Saints may possibly know our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but cannot well tell us by which it is they do so.</p>
                           <p>But in the first Edition he shew'd yet more doubt: Not only <hi>which way the Saints hear them,</hi> but <hi>whether they hear them at all or no:</hi> Not only, <hi>whether they joyn with them in their Prayers, as they desire them to do,</hi> but whether it is not rather <hi>by some other means, yet more unknown to them,</hi> and not by <hi>their Intercession,</hi> that they receive the benefit of them.
<q>The Church, says he, contents her self to teach with all Antiquity, these prayers to
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:36811:17"/>
be very profitable to such who make them; <hi>Whether it be</hi> the Saints know them by the Ministry and Communication of Angels, who according to the Testimony of Scripture know what passes amongst us; being established by Gods order as administring spirits to co-operate with us in the work of our salvation: <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be</hi> that God makes known to them our desires by a particular revelation: Or <hi>whether it be</hi> that he discovers the secret to them in his Divine Essence in which all truth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>And that in <hi>the manner,</hi> and <hi>according to the measure</hi> which he pleases; or <hi>whether</hi> lastly by <hi>some other way yet more impenetrable and more unknown he causes us to receive the Fruit of those Prayers which we address to those blessed Souls.</hi> 
                                 <bibl>1 Ed. p. 23.</bibl>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>So that in effect, <hi>whether the Saints hear us or no, whether they joyn with us in our requests or no,</hi> according to <hi>Monsieur de Meaux's Exposition,</hi> their Church knows not; which is sure a sufficient prejudice against their <hi>Invocation;</hi> and was, it seems, thought so by those who therefore caused all the latter part of this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph to be struck out, for fear of the advantage we might reasonably make of it.</p>

                           <p>But if <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> in his first <hi>Exposition</hi> freely confess'd how uncertain <hi>the grounds</hi> of this <hi>Invocation</hi> were, he no less freely left it to our choice whether we would practise it or not. He assured us <hi>there was no manner of obligation at all upon us so to
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:36811:18"/>
do:</hi> And that the Church <hi>would not condemn us if we did it not,</hi> provided we <hi>refused it not out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> or <hi>with a Spirit of dissension and Revolt.</hi>
                              <q>Furthermore, says he, there is nothing so unjust as to accuse the Church of placing all her piety in these devotions to the Saints; since on the contrary she lays <hi>no obligation at all on particular persons to joyn in this Practice.</hi>

                           <p>This was <hi>Monsieur de Meaux's</hi> first <hi>Exposition of the Doctrine of the Catholick Church</hi> in this point: But such as his <hi>Correctors</hi> it seems would not admit of: Who therefore obliged him wholly to strike out that passage,
<q>That the Church imposes no obligation at all upon particular persons to practise this Invocation:</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>And instead of condemning only those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it out of <hi>contempt,</hi> or a <hi>Spirit of dissension and revolt,</hi> which had freed us wholly from their <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> to expound it now more severely.
<q>That she condemns those who refuse this practice whether <hi>out of disrespect</hi> or <hi>Error.</hi>

                           <p>In the article of Images <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> having first laid down this foundation,
<q>That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not attribute to them <hi>any other virtue</hi> than that of exciting in us the remembrance of those whom they represent;</q>
added in his first Exposition which was suppressed,
<q>'Tis in this consists <hi>the use</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of Images. <bibl>1 Edit. p. 25.</bibl>

                           <p>And to assure us yet further how little Honour they had for them, concluded thus,
<q>So that to speak properly, and according to the Ecclesiastical style, we <hi>do not so much honour the Image</hi> of an Apostle or Martyr, as we do <hi>honour the Apostle or Martyr</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Image. <bibl>1 Edit. p. 26.</bibl>

                           <p>Now though we do not doubt but that this is the real opinion of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux,</hi> and all which he himself does, yet to say that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> does neither <hi>require,</hi> nor <hi>practise,</hi> nor <hi>intend</hi> any more, was to presume too much upon our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and indeed to give too great a scandal to many of his own Communion, more zealous than himself for this service: And therefore we find it now <hi>expounded</hi> in a manner more conformable to the truth, though still exceedingly mollified,

                           <p>In the Section of Justification <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> has omitted this whole paragraph since his first Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<q>The Catholick Church, says he, is no where more invincible than in this point, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it would need no long discourse to shew, that the more one searches by the Scriptures into the design of the redemption. of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which was to make us Holy, the more one shall approach to our Doctrine, and the more depart from the opinions of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which are not maintainable, nay are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory and ruinous of all true and solid piety. <bibl>1 Ed. p. 36, 37.</bibl>

                           </p>

                              <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> may please some other time to <hi>expound</hi> to us, what those Opinions of <hi>Calvin</hi> in this matter are which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is so invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in, and which all parties among them will agree to be so contradictory, and ruinous to all true and solid piety, as he then said.</p>

In the mean time we will only beg leave to observe on occasion of this Correction, that perhaps there are some in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s mind in the worst of those Principles Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> refers to, and to assure him that there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Protestants in the World that are not; tho they dare not therefore so severely censure the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of those that are.</p>

                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> having in a very few words explained the Doctrine of Justification, upon which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is so long and perplex'd, assured us in his first <hi>Exposition,</hi> That <hi>that was enough for any Man to know to make him a through Christian.</hi>

<q>Thus have you seen what is most necessary in the Doctrine of Justification, and our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries

<q>The Church has always acknowledged these two different manners of applying the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins, which we have proposed; because she saw that in the Scriptures, besides the <hi>first Pardon,</hi> and which ought to be the only, if Men were not ungrateful, and which is pronounced in the terms of a <hi>pure Remission,</hi> there is <hi>another Absolution,</hi> and <hi>another Grace,</hi> that is proposed in form of <hi>a Judgment,</hi> where the Church ought not only to <hi>loose and remit,</hi> but also to <hi>bind and retain.</hi>

                              <q>Thus, says he, all Christian Churches have religiously retained this Practice, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it (the Imposition of Hands) with holy Chrism. <bibl>1 <hi>Ed. p.</hi> 65.</bibl>

<q>So that it (the Mass) may, says he, be very <hi>reasonably called a Sacrifice:</hi>

                           <p>As to the point of the Pope's Authority, the first Exposition ran much higher than it seems the Spirit of the Gallicane Church could bear.
<q>So that our Profession of Faith obliges us as to this point, to believe the Roman Church to be the <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Mistress</hi> of all Churches, and to render a <hi>true Obedience</hi> to the Pope, the Successor of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and Vicar of Jesus Christ. <bibl>1 <hi>Ed. p.</hi> 166.</bibl>
                              </q>
It is now more loose, and in general thus;

                           <p>These are some of those Passages that gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the <hi>correction</hi> we have spoken of at <hi>the Sorbon,</hi> and to the <hi>suppression of the whole first Edition,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>authorized by the Bishops of France</hi> in the same words it now is. I might have added many more; but instead of it, will beg leave to offer the Reader one <hi>Correction</hi> made very lately by <hi>another Faculty,</hi> that of <hi>Louvain;</hi> if not immediatly of Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s <hi>Exposition,</hi> yet at least of a Doctrine which they were before-hand given to understand, was so explained in it.</p>

                              <hi>I.</hi> The Introduction.</head>
                           <p>IT has always been esteemed more reasonable to doubt of <hi>Principles</hi> first, and then to deny the <hi>Conclusions</hi> that are drawn from them, than having granted the Foundation, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to cavil at the clear and necessary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions from it.</p>
                           <p>To profess that <q>Religious Worship is due to God only;</q> and at the same time to say that we ought to adore Men and Women, Crosses and Images, and all that infinite variety of Follies which these latter Ages have set forth under the pious name of Relicks. To declare, <q>That we are saved only by Christ's Merits;</q> and yet still continue to teach us that we ought to set up our own. In a word, to say, <q>That the Death of Christ was a perfect Sacrifice, and one drop of his Blood more than sufficient for the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</q>
                              <pb n="4" facs="tcp:36811:25"/>
and nevertheless go on to require our Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions as necessary too, and oblige us to believe that other Propitiatory Sacrifices besides that of the Cross, ought to be offered up continually to God in his Church, for the Sins both of the Dead and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: This must certainly be the part of a Disputant, either too ignorant to understand, or too obstinate to submit to any Conviction.</p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> the design of whose Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seems rather to be an <hi>Apology</hi> for the Popish Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than a free <hi>Assertion</hi> and <hi>Vindication</hi> of its Errors, is above all things sensible of the Justice of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection: and therefore endeavours by all means pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in the very entry of his Treatise to prepare his Reader against it, By shewing <q>
                                 <hi>the Injustice of charging Consequences upon Men which they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;</hi> and that therefore tho their Superstructure should chance to overthrow their Foundation, yet since they profess not to know that it does so, they ought not to be taxed with what they do not believe.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is not deny'd but that Consequences may be sometimes either so obscure, or so far distant, that a Person prejudicate for the Principle, may well be excused the charge of a Collection, which his Actions shew he neither believes nor approves. But when the Conclusions, as well as Principles, are plain and confess'd, and the Dispute is only about the <hi>Name,</hi> not the <hi>Thing;</hi> we must beg leave to profess, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but say that he believes not as he ought <hi>the infinite Merits of Christ's Sacrifice,</hi> who requires <hi>any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Offering for Sin;</hi> and that no subtilty of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will ever perswade us that those destroy not their Principle of <hi>worshipping God only,</hi> whom we see, contrary to his express Command, <hi>prostrate</hi> every
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36811:25"/>
day before an <hi>Image,</hi> with Prayers and Hymns to Creatures that have been subject to like Infirmities with our selves, and that are perhaps at this very time in a worser Estate, than the most miserable of those that call upon them for their assistance.</p>
                           <p>Be it therefore allow'd to be as great a Calumny, as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> can suppose it, to accuse Men of Consequences obscure and disavow'd; the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with, are plain and confess'd, the Practice and Prescription of the chiefest Authority in it. And to refuse our Charge of them, is in good earnest nothing else than <hi>to protest against a matter of Fact;</hi> a Plea, which even Justice it self has told us, may without Calumny be rejected as invalid.</p>
                           <p>However, thus much at least we have got by this Reflection, that it directs us to the true State of the Controversy between us; and shews, That we, who have been so often charged by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Innovators in Religion,</hi> are at last by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, allow'd to hold the ancient and undoubted Foundation of the Christian Faith; and that the Question between us therefore is not, <hi>Whether what we hold be true?</hi> which is on all hands agreed, but, <hi>Whether those things which the Roman Church has added as Superstructures to it, and which, as such, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, be not so far from being necessary Articles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as they pretend, that they indeed overthrow that Truth which is on both sides allow'd to be Divine; and upon that account ought to be forsaken by them?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Declaration of this, not so much by any new proof, as by clearing rather the true state of those Points which are the subject of our Difference, is the design of the following Articles; in which I shall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36811:26"/>
endeavour to give a clear and free account of what we can approve, and what it is that we dislike in their Doctrine; and as far as the shortness of this Discourse will allow, touch also upon some of those Reasons that are the most usually given by us for both.</p>

                              <hi>ARTICLE II.</hi> That Religious Worship is to be paid to God only.</head>
                           <p>
                              <hi>THat Religious Worship is due to God only,</hi> how necessary soever those Practices of the Roman Church, which we are hereafter to consider, may have rendred it to Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> to declare, yet is it, we suppose, but little necessary for us to say,</p>
                           <p>We firmly believe, that <q>the inward acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Divine Excellencies as the Creator and Lord of all things, is a part of the supream Worship that is due to him. We believe that all the Powers of our Soul ought to be tied to him by Faith, Hope, and Charity, as to that God who alone can establish and make us happy.</q> And tho we do not think that there is now <hi>any sensible, or material Sacrifice</hi> to be offered to Him under the Gospel, as there was heretofore under the Law; yet do we with all Antiquity suppose the <hi>Sacrifice of Prayer and Thanksgiving</hi> to be so peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his due, that it cannot, without derogation to his Honour, be applied to any other.</p>
                           <p>What our Opinion is of that Worship which the Roman Church pays to the <hi>Blessed Virgin,</hi> and <hi>Saints
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36811:26"/>
departed,</hi> we shall hereafter fully shew: But certainly great was the difference of those <hi>Holy Men</hi> whom Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> mentions as their fore-runners in this practice, from the present manner of the Popish Invocation. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in a Rhetorical Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe, <hi>called</hi> to <hi>Constantius</hi> in one, to his Sister <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia</hi> in another Oration, but he <hi>prayed</hi> to neither. St. <hi>Basil;</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose;</hi> St. <hi>J. Chrysostom;</hi> St. <hi>Hierom;</hi> St. <hi>Augustin;</hi> they desired sometimes that the Martyr or Saint would joyn with them in their requests, but they were rather <hi>Raptures</hi> and <hi>Wishes,</hi> than direct <hi>Prayers;</hi> and their formal Petitions, but especially those of the Church, were only to God Almighty. They <hi>doubted whether the Saints could hear them or no;</hi> and were rather inclined to believe that they could not. The <hi>Addresses of the Mind,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> allows no less than the others to them, they look'd upon to be so peculiarly God's due, that they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed he did not communicate them to the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that are in Heaven. They declared against all thoughts of being assisted by the <hi>Merits</hi> of their Saints, or that God would ever the more readily, or indeed so soon accept their Prayers coming by the Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another, as if they had gone themselves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Throne of Grace. In a word; they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imagined that this was <hi>an Honour due to them;</hi> but, on the contrary, constantly taught that it was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice belonging <hi>only to God Almighty.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Well therefore might <note n="*" place="margin">And that it is the most he does; See <hi>de Cult.</hi> Lat. l. 3. c. 18.</note> Monsieur <hi>Daillé</hi> refer the beginnings of this <hi>Invocation</hi> to these Men, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Wishes, and Rhetorical Flights, being still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by the Superstition of after-Ages, first gave birth to this Worship. But certainly the <hi>Romanists</hi> cannot with any reason alledge them in favour of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36811:27"/>
their Error, till it be shewn either that we are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in those differences we have here declared to be between what they did, and what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now practises; or that they are otherwise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be so inconsiderable, as not to make any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table alteration in it. And yet that the Ages before knew nothing, even of this, not only their confessed inability to produce any Proofs from them of this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, but the contrary Testimonies of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Writings of <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian, Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus, Origen, Novatian,</hi> and Others, so plainly shew, that it ought not to be esteemed at all rash at this distance to assert, that in this very small Change, <hi>the Fathers of the fourth Century, did certainly begin to depart from the Practice and Tradition of those before them.</hi> And if that Reason of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be of any strength, why they pray'd not to the Holy Men under the Old Testament, viz. <hi>because they were not then admitted to the sight of God, and therefore ought not to be prayed to.</hi> It seems to us that not only the greater part of the Primitive Fathers, but even those very Men Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> mentions, could not certainly have allowed such an Invocation as is now used in their Church; the most of them being noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously known, and even by their own Writers freely confessed, to have believed the same, <hi>That neither do the Saints and Confessors of the Christian Church any more enjoy the Presence of God even now.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus much was thought fit to be said to remove that Prejudice Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> had thrown in the way. We go on now with him to consider the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it self, and what our Church's Opinion is of it.</p>

                           <p>THE Invocation of Saints, <hi>as it is stated</hi> by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> we look upon to be one of those Practices which our Church stiles, <q>fond things, vainly invented, and grounded upon no Warrant of Holy Scripture, but indeed repugnant to God's Word.</q> 
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Artic.</hi> xxii.</note> Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> himself dares not say that they do or can ordinarily by <hi>any ability in themselves,</hi> hear, see, or know, the Wants, State, or Prayers of Men upon Earth, to be mindfull of them unto God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Nor can it ever be proved that by <hi>any of those ways which he proposes,</hi> but seems himself not to lay any great stress upon, they are certainly and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated to them.</p>
                           <p>We think therefore, that till this be cleared, it is too great a hazard to leave a Mediator, who both certainly knows our wants, and has promised to hear us; that has invited us, nay commanded us to come to him in all our Needs, to go to Intercessors which God has no where appointed, and which we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be sure our Prayers shall come up to. It suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not that they may know <hi>some things, in some places, at some times,</hi> and <hi>of some Men extraordinarily,</hi> unless we could tell <hi>what Saints,</hi> and <hi>what things,</hi> and <hi>in what places,</hi> and <hi>at what times,</hi> they do know them. When this is cleared, it may then be more reasonable to desire us to joyn with them in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. In the mean time, tho we should not charge
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36811:28"/>
them with <hi>Idolatry</hi> meerly for this, yet we must needs confess we cannot but think these Addresses to be too full of hazard and uncertainty to venture any Requests at all, much less so many as they do every day, upon them.</p>
                           <p>In vain therefore does Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to defend the <hi>Innocence</hi> of this Invocation, whilst he forgets to shew us the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of it. We should be pleased indeed to be assured of that; but we cannot be convinced that we ought to joyn in the Practice till we are satisfied of the other too. And yet we cannot but regret, that if their design be truly no more than this, <hi>to entreat the Saints to pray for them,</hi> we should find the greatest part of their Service addressing to them after so contrary a manner; that they would interpose not only their <hi>Intercessions,</hi> but their <hi>Merits</hi> too for their forgiveness: Not only that they would <hi>pray to God for them, but that they would themselves bless them.</hi> That the Angels and Saints <q>
                                 <hi>would give them Strength, Grace, Health, and Power.</hi> That St. <hi>Peter would have Mercy upon them, and open to them the Gate of Heaven.</hi> That the Blessed Virgin <hi>would protect them from their Enemies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them at their Death:</hi> In a word, <hi>that she would command her Son to forgive them by that Right, which as</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">This Passage is often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd: See <hi>Cassander Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult.</hi> in Art. 21.</note> 
                                 <hi>a Mother she had over him.</hi>
                              </q> All which their very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Rituals so far allow, that the Service which is paid to God in his Church <hi>by the Mediation of Christ,</hi> is infinitely exceeded by the Addresses of this nature, through <hi>the Merits of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and of the Saints.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now if these Prayers signify no more than, as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> expounds them, <hi>to entreat the Saints to pray for them,</hi> why have we such Scandal given us in the Practice? If they intend really what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36811:28"/>
we suppose, and what their words do certainly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify; what Ingenuity can it be to impose upon us in the Declaration? However at least they will please to excuse us that we have fallen at so just a stumbling Block; and charged them as derogating from the Merits of Christ, whilst they have thus cry'd up the Merits of their Saints, and of a Presumption unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, if not wholly Idolatrous, in desiring any but God alone <hi>to help,</hi> and <hi>succour,</hi> and <hi>give them those Blessings,</hi> which God only has power to dispense.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. When therefore we shall be certainly assured that all that infinite number which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has canonized, are truly and infallibly <hi>Saints.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. When we shall be assured that these Saints do <hi>already enjoy the Presence of God Almighty;</hi> a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which the Papists themselves confess necessary to warrant their Invocation.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. When it shall be made undoubtedly appear, that either by their <hi>own Knowledg,</hi> or by some <hi>other Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, they do ordinarily and particularly understand all the Requests that are made to them;</hi> so that we can be as secure of their hearing us, as when we desire our Brethren upon Earth to pray for us.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. When the Liturgies of their Church shall be reformed, and all those dangerous Insinuations of the <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Personal Assistance</hi> of their Saints be removed.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. When those desperate Doctrines, and yet more desperate Addresses of their School-men and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertists, which scandalize the more moderate even of their own Party, shall be censured.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. And Men taught to practise this Invocation with such Sobriety, as neither to make it so freely and publickly their Worship as they do, nor with any Opinion of being either <hi>sooner heard,</hi> or more <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36811:29"/>
answered</hi> by this way of Address, than by going directly to God by our Saviour and only Mediator Jesus Christ.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. In a word, when even an Invocation so mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, shall be shewn either to have been comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God Almighty, or to have been advised by his Apostles, or to have been practised <hi>ordinarily and directly</hi> by the most Primitive Christians: Or lastly, but to be no way injurious to the excellent Goodness of that Intercessor, who has so kindly invited, and even conjured us to come to Him in all our needs; Then will we not fail to joyn our <hi>Ora pro Nobis</hi> with them: But till then we must beg leave to conclude with a Charity and Moderation, which we suppose they themselves cannot but approve in us, <hi>That it is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Holy Scripture, but rather indeed contrary thereunto.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And what we have now said of their Prayers, we must in the next place apply to their Sacrifices too. <hi>To mention the Names of the Holy Saints departed in the Communion;</hi> this we look upon to be a Practice as innocent as 'tis ancient. So far are we from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it in them, that we practise it our selves. <hi>We name them at our Altars, we give God thanks for their Excellencies, and pray to him for Grace to follow their Examples.</hi> But as we allow thus much to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, so we cannot but condemn that Practice which Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> seems to have omitted, tho yet the chief thing that offends us; that they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Offerings which they make to God, through <hi>the Merits</hi> of their Saints which they commemorate, and desire that by their Merits they may become a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to the Churches needs. As if <hi>Christ himself,</hi> whom they suppose to be the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> needed the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36811:29"/>
                              <hi>Assistance</hi> of St. <hi>Bathildis</hi> or <hi>Potentiana,</hi> to recommend him to his Father: Or, that the <hi>Merits</hi> of an Offering, which they tell us is the very same with that of the Cross, should desire the joynt <hi>Deserts</hi> of a St. <hi>Martin</hi> to obtain our Forgiveness.</p>
                           <p>They who shall consider these things as they ought, will, we doubt not, confess that we have some reason to complain, both that they derogate herein from Christ's Merits, and attribute to their Saints more than they ought to do. If this Practice be reformed, our Complaint, as to this point, ceaseth. If it be not, in vain does Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> endeavour to perswade us, that they <hi>only name their Saints to give God thanks for their Excellencies,</hi> whilst their publick Practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vows, that they desire both the pardon of their Sins, and even the acceptance of their very Sacrifices them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by their Mediation.</p>

                              <hi>ARTICLE IV.</hi> Of Images and Relicks.</head>
                           <p>VVHat the Opinion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is concerning the Worship of Images and Relicks, will need no long Declaration to shew, they being joyn'd by her in the same Article with that of the Invocation of Saints before-mentioned, and by <note place="margin">Artic. XXII.</note> consequence, submitted by her to the same Censure.</p>
                           <p>But then, as we before complained, that both the Practice of their Church in the publick Liturgies of it, and the approved Doctrine of their most reputed Writers, should so far contradict what Monsieur <hi>de
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36811:30"/>
Meaux</hi> would have us think is their only design in that Service; so we cannot but repeat the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in this: That if all the use their Church would have made of Images and Relicks, be <hi>only to excite the more lively in their Minds the remembrance of the Originals,</hi> not only the People should be suffered to fall into such gross Mistakes, as 'tis undeniably evident they do, in their Worship of them; but even their Teachers be permitted without any Reproof to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in their Errors.</p>
                           <p>Has St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and his Followers, nay, and even their <hi>Pontifical</hi> it self, ever yet been censured by them, for maintaining <hi>in plain terms,</hi> that <hi>the Image of the Cross ought to be worshipped with the same Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as that Saviour who suffered on it?</hi> Have the Jesuits been condemned for teaching Men <hi>to swear by it?</hi> Does not their whole Church upon <hi>Good-friday</hi> yet address her self to it in these very dangerous words, <hi>Behold the Wood of the Cross! Come, let us adore it.</hi> And do not their Actions agree with their Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the whole Solemnity of that day's Service plainly shew, that they do <hi>adore it</hi> in the utmost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Phrase? Does she not pray to it, that <hi>in this time of the Passion, it would strengthen the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and give Pardon to the Guilty?</hi> Is the Hymn for the day of the <hi>Invention</hi> corrected, wherein they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that <hi>the Cross heals their Sicknesses, ties up the Devil, and gives them Newness of Life;</hi> and thereupon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it <hi>to save its Assembly, gathered together in its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</hi> Is the manner of consecrating them changed, in which they intreat God to bless the Image of the Cross which they there sanctify, that it may be for <hi>the establishment of their Faith, an increase of their good Works, the Redemption of their Souls, and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36811:30"/>
against the cruel Darts of the Enemy? That Christ would embrace this Cross,</hi> over which they pray, <hi>as he did that</hi> upon which he suffer'd: <hi>That as by that he delivered the whole World from its Guilt; so by the Merits of this, they who dedicate it may receive remission of their Sins.</hi> In a word, that <hi>as many as bow down before it, may find health both of their Souls and Bodies by it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And is all this in good earnest no more than <hi>to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite more lively in our minds the remembrance of Him that loved us, and delivered himself to the Death for us,</hi> and to testifie by some outward marks our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of that favour, by humbling our selves in presence of the Cross, to declare thereby our submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Him that was crucified.</p>
                           <p>Is not this rather, if not absolutely to fall into, yet certainly too nearly to approach to that which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> himself confesses to be Idolatry, viz. <hi>to trust in the Images as if there were some divinity or virtue joyned to them,</hi> and for which they not only shew all imaginable marks of outward Worship, by Kissings, Prostrations, and the like Ceremonies; but make as formal Addresses to them, and that in the publick Service of the Church, as to God himself?</p>
                           <p>How this allow'd practice can be reconciled with the prohibition of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> 
                              <q>Not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any Divinity or Virtue tied to their Images for which they ought to be adored; nor to demand any Grace of them, nor place any Trust or Confidence in them; </q>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> may please to expound to us. In the mean time, as we are so far from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the making of all sorts of Images, that we think it not any Crime to have the Histories of the Gospel caryed or painted in our very Churches, which the

Walls and Windows of several of them do declare: As we publickly use <hi>the sign of the Cross</hi> in one of our very Sacraments, and censure no Man for practising it, only without Superstition, on any other occasion: so we cannot but avow the Scandal that is given us by those Doctrines and Practices before mentioned; and that we think that Worship justly to be abolished which the Primitive Church abhorred, and which at this day scandalizes not only so great a number of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> but even our common Enemy the <hi>Jew</hi> &amp; <hi>Turk:</hi> In a word, which is so far from being commanded by God, that it needs many nice Distinctions to render it not directly opposite to an express Prohibition; and is therefore if not down-right Idolatry to those who know how <hi>to direct their Intention aright,</hi> yet to the Simple and Ignorant, that is, to the much greater number, and the most zealous practioners of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, so very near it, <hi>that the Generality of the wisest Papists, no less than We, complain of it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For the honour that is due to Reliques, no <hi>Protestant</hi> will ever refuse what ever <hi>the Primitive Church paid them; or may be fit to express the Honour we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for those Bodies that by Martyrdom have been made Sacrifices to God Almighty.</hi> If this be all Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> desires of us, we are ready to profess our Opinion, that we judg it to be neither offensive to God, nor fit to be scrupled by any good Man.</p>
                           <p>We believe that according to the Circumstances of the Times, the Church may <hi rend="margQuotes">testify this Honour by more or less outward Signs and Marks of Respect. And we do with satisfaction read that Declaration of Mr. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> That we ought not to be servilely subjected to these outward Ceremonies, but to be invited by them to offer up to God that reasonable
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36811:32"/>
service, in Spirit and in Truth, which he requires of us.</hi> And if this be the State of the Question, we confess the Explication of it has taken away a great part of the difficulty.</p>
                           <p>But what then means the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to tell us, That we are not only to honour them, but to <hi>worship them</hi> too? That by doing so, we shall obtain many <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Graces of God.</hi> That these sacred Monuments <hi>are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably revered, but are to be sought unto for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their help and assistance; to cure the Sick, to give Eyes to the Blind, Feet to the Lame, and even Life to the Dead.</hi> How comes it to pass that their Church not only ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours them, which we could allow, but carries them in Processions, makes Offerings to them, gives Indulgences to such as shall go to visit them; prescribes Pilgrimages to them, swears by them, touches their Beads, or Hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, with them to sanctify them; thinks to obtain one Blessing by virtue of this Relick, another from that; and the like superstitious usages, which we suppose we have good reason with our Church, to conclude to be <q>fond things, vainly invented, and grounded upon no Authority <note place="margin">Art. xxii.</note> of Holy Scripture, but indeed repugnant thereunto.</q>
                           </p>

                           </head>
                           <p>THE Doctrine of <hi>Justification</hi> is one of those Points that deserves our careful Consideration; as being not only one of the chiefest of those Points wherein we suppose the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to have prevaricated the Faith, but as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> remarks, <hi>one of the first that gave occasion to that Reformation</hi> that was made from it.</p>
                           <p>It is not necessary to say to what an Extravagance the business of <hi>Pardons, Indulgences,</hi> and other means of <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying</hi> the Divine Justice, was arrived; and how much more confidence the People generally put in the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men, than in the Merits and Satisfaction of Christ. If they have been somewhat better instructed since, they may thank the Reformation for it: tho we fear all the difference is, that they are somewhat more reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in exposing these Follies now, but yet still retain the Foundation of that Doctrine upon which they are built.</p>
                           <p>We willingly allow Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> this honour, that he has reduced the long Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to a short and easie Debate; and proposed the things which contain our Difference with such tenderness, as might invite us to close with a great part of it, did not the Decrees of the Council seem too plainly to refuse Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Exposition of them.</p>
                           <p>We believe with him, <q>That our Sins are freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by God's Mercy through Christ; and that none of those things which precede our Justification, whether our Faith, or our good Works, could merit this Grace.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>We are perswaded that our Sins are not only covered, but are entirely done away by the Blood of Jesus Christ.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>We confess that the Righteousness of Jesus Christ is not only imputed, but actually communicated to the Faithful, through the operation of the holy Spirit, in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36811:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so much that they are not only reputed, but made just by his Grace</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>We deny not that this Righteousness is a true Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, even in the sight of God; because that it is God who by Charity works in us: </q>only we think it withal such as is too weak to obtain for us the pardon of our Sins, which Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> seems content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess with us.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>We willingly acknowledg that our Righteousness is not perfect in this Life. Whilst we are in the Body, the Flesh will lust against the Spirit, and in many things we shall offend all.</q> The Life of a Christian is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued state of Repentance: and he must be too much opiniated of himself that refuses to conclude with St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine;</hi> 
                              <q>That our Righteousness in this Life, consisteth rather in the Remission of our Sins, than in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our Vertue.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>In a word; the sum of our Difference as to this Point, seems to be this. Our Church by <hi>Justification,</hi> understands only <hi>the Remission of our Sins:</hi> We distinguish it from <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which consists in the <hi>production of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Righteousness in us.</hi> We believe our Sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned only through the Merits of Christ imputed to us. And for the rest, we say, that this Remission of Sins is given only to those that repent; that is, in whom the holy Spirit produces the Grace of Sanctification, for a true Righteousness and Holiness of Life.</p>
                           <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> comprehends under the notion of Justification, not only <hi>the Remission of Sins,</hi> but also <hi>the production of that inherent Righteousness,</hi> which we call <hi>Sanctification.</hi> They suppose with us, that our Sins are forgiven only by the Satisfaction of Jesus Christ. But then as they make that inward Righteousness a part of Justification too; so by consequence, they say our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication it self is wrought also by our own good Works.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="21" facs="tcp:36811:34"/>
It appears by this, that were these things clearly sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and distinguish'd the one from the other, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between us, considered only in the <hi>Idea,</hi> would not be very great: And that we might safely allow whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has advanced upon this point, provided it be but well and rightly explained; tho in some things he has expressed himself after a manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual among us; and which we suppose not so entirely conformable to the Expressions of holy Scripture.</p>
                           <p>The sum of all is this. Christ died, and by that Death satisfied the Justice of God for us. God therefore through the Merits of his Son, freely forgives us all our Sins, and offers us a Covenant of Mercy and Grace. By this Covenant, founded only upon the Death and Merits of Christ, he sends us his Holy Spirit, and calls us power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to Repentance. If we awake and answer this Call, then God by his free Goodness justifies us; that is, he pardons our Sins past, gives us Grace more and more to fulfil his Commands for the time to come; and if we persevere in this Covenant, crowns us finally with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. And all this he is pleased to do, not for any thing which we have, or can perform, but only through the Merits and Satisfaction of his Son by Faith applied to us.</p>
                           <p>This is the Foundation wherein Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> seems content to agree with us. We go on to see how the following Doctrine will stand upon this Foundation.</p>

                           <p>The word <hi>Merit</hi> we acknowledge to have been very antient in the Church; and tho to prevent those mistakes which many in these latter ages have made on occasion of that expression, we think it safer to discourse more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly of the <hi>Merit,</hi> and press more strongly the <hi>Necessity</hi> of good Works: Yet if it be understood so as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> expounds it, That all our Merit derives its force only from the Merits of Jesus Christ, who works in us both to will and to do; and when we have done, renders by the same Merits our good Works acceptable to God, and avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Eternal Life, we shall not be difficult to allow of it.</p>
                           <p>If this be All the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ascribes to Good works, that our Justification proceeds <hi>absolutely</hi> from God's Bounty and Mercy, and but <hi>accidentally</hi> only (in as much as God has tied himself by his Word and Promise to reward them) from our own Performances; We need no long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to receive a Doctrine which we have always defended against such of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it, and are not yet, that we know of, censured for their so doing.</p>
                           <p>That which we reject is, <q>That we do as <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> merit Rewards when we do well, as we do me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Punishment when we do ill: so says the Jesuit <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate.</hi> That our Good Works do merit Eternal Life <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 20.</note>

the Works of just Persons <hi>by the Merits or Person of Christ,</hi> which the same would not otherwise have, if they had been done by the same Grace bestowed freely by God alone without Christ. 3. That God's Promise is <note place="margin">16. c. 8.</note> indeed annex'd to the Works of just Men, but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs no way to the <hi>Merit</hi> of them, but cometh rather to the Works themselves, which are already not only worthy, but meritorious also. </q>From all which he draws this remarkable Corallary; <q>Seeing the Works of just <note place="margin">Disp. 222. <hi>c. 3. n.</hi> 30, 31.</note> Men do merit Eternal Life, as an Equal Recompence and Reward, <hi>there is no need that any other condign Merit, such as that of Christ, should interpose, to the end that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life might be rendred to them.</hi>—Wherefore we never pray to God that by the Merits of Christ, the Reward of Eternal Life may be given to our worthy and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Works; but that Christ's Grace may be given to us, whereby we may be enabled worthily to merit this Reward.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is that Doctrine of good Works which we most justly do detest: And if the Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be so directly opposite to it as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> professes, we are a little surprised that no <hi>Index Expurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi> no authentick Censure, has ever taken notice of so dangerous a Prevarication. But contrary-wise, these are the great Authors of their Party, approved, embraced, and almost adored, by the Greatest and most Learned of that Communion.</p>
                           <p>These are the Principles which we suppose to have been an unwarrantable derogation to the Grace of God, and directly opposite to the nature of Justification by Faith in Christ, before established. And tho this point was far from being the only cause of our Separation from their Communion, yet let Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> himself please to say, whether such a Doctrine of Merits as this were not sufficient, if not to engage us wholly to leave a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36811:36"/>
Church that taught such things, yet at least to dissent from her in these Particulars.</p>

                           <p>THE whole of this Point we think to be the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Doctrine <hi>grounded upon no Authority of Holy Scripture,</hi> but on the contrary, derogatory to God's Mercy in Jesus Christ, and, as the Doctrine of Merits before considered, inconsistent with the nature of that <hi>Justification</hi> we before establish'd.</p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> was pleased there to tell us, <hi>of God's justifying us freely for Christ's Merits: That our Sins are not only covered, but entirely done away by his Mercy; and the Sinner not only reputed, but made just by his Grace.</hi> We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be troubled to see our selves so soon deprived of this excellent Hope; and required our selves to satisfy God's Justice here, which he assured us was entirely done for us by Christ before.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>When Christ, says Monsieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> who alone was able to make a sufficient Satisfaction for our Sins, died for us; having by his Death abundantly satisfied for <note place="margin">See aboue <hi>p.</hi> 66.</note> them, he became capable of applying that Satisfaction to us after two very different manners; Either by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us an entire Forgiveness of our Sins, without reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Pains for us to undergo for them; or in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a greater Pain into a lesser, the Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell into a Temporal Punishment.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>The former of these being the more <hi>entire,</hi> and the <hi>more agreeable to the Divine Goodness,</hi> he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly makes use of it at our Baptism: </q>But <hi>we suppose</hi> he gives the second only to them who after
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36811:36"/>
Baptism fall again into sin; being in a manner forced to it through the Ingratitude whereby they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused his former Gifts, so that they are to suffer some <hi>Temporal pain,</hi> tho <hi>the eternal</hi> be remitted to them.</p>
                           <p>This is a very great Doctrine, and ought certainly to have some better Proof of it, than barely <hi>We sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi> However it be, our Church has declared its self of an opinion directly contrary: That since the absolute forgiving of sin is <hi>Confessed</hi> to be the more perfect way, and more becoming the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and that God has never, that we know of, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed any other; but rather has constantly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged us to expect his Pardon after the largest and most ample manner that it is possible for words to set forth; We are persuaded that accordingly whenever God do's pardon, it is in that way which is the most suitable to his Divine goodness, and which alone he hath declared to us, that he do's it <hi>intirely for Christs merits, not for any Works or Sufferings of our own.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In vain therefore does Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> labour to reconcile this Doctrine with Christ's absolute Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. We confess <q>that we ought not to dispute with God the manner of his Dispensations; Nor think it at all strange if he who shews himself so easie at our Baptism, is afterwards more difficult for those sins which we commit being Baptized.</q> There is nothing in all this but what we could most readily allow of, were there but any tollerable Arguments to establish the Doctrine that requires it.</p>
                           <p>But whilst this is so destitute of all Proof, that it is acknowledged to introduce a manner of forgiveness neither so <hi>intire,</hi> nor so <hi>befitting Gods mercy</hi> as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal remission of the Punishment, together with the Guilt; whilst we have the Sufferings of Christ to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36811:37"/>
upon, which are so far from needing any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own, that they <hi>are Confessed to</hi> have been <hi>Super-abundant</hi> to whatever the divine Justice could require of us; Tho we can and do practice the same Discipline for the other benefits of it, <hi>viz.</hi> To shew our Indignation against our selves that we have offended, and to keep us from sinning for the future; yet we cannot be so forgetful of our dear Master, as to pretend to any part in that Redemption, but only to enjoy the benefits of that forgiveness, which by his alone Merits he has intirely purchased for us; nor do we see any reason to believe that Gods Justice will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any more, than what has been <hi>Super-abundantly paid</hi> upon the Cross for the Iniquities of mankind.</p>
                           <p>'Tis true, Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> tells us, <q>That the necessity of this Payment does not arise from any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Christ's Satisfaction, but from a certain Order which God has establish'd for a salutary Discipline, and to keep us from offending.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>This indeed were something, would either Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> have been pleased to shew us <hi>this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablistment,</hi> or had not the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more, <hi>viz.</hi>

                              </q> From whence Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> concludes, <q>That it is <note place="margin">

                           </p>
                           <p>Upon the whole it appears, 1. That these Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

are not only <hi>a Salutary discipline,</hi> but a <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> too. 2. They change the Mercy of God into a forgiveness, that is confessed neither to be in its self <hi>Perfect,</hi> nor so <hi>becoming the Divine goodness</hi> as an intire remission of sin, the Punishment as well as Guilt, would be. 3.

It was the discipline of the Primitive Church, when the Bishops imposed severe Penances on the Offenders, and that they were almost quite performed, if some great cause of pity chanced to arrive, or an excellent Repentance, or danger of death, or that some Martyr pleaded in behalf of the Penitent, the Bishop did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Indulge</hi> him, that is, <hi>Did relax the remaining part of his Penance, and give him Absolution.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> having this Pattern before his Eyes, frames the Indulgences now used in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> exactly according to it. <q>When the Church, <hi>says he,</hi> imposes upon sinners hard and laborious Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and that with Humility they undergo them, this we call satisfaction; and when having regard either to the fervour of the Penitents, or to some other good works which she prescribes, she relaxes some part of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment yet remaining; This is called Indulgence.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>But to pass by for the present those abuses that are every day made of these Indulgences, and which both the Council and Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> seem willing to have redressed; such essential differences we conceive there are between the Indulgences of the Primitive, and those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that tho we readily enough embrace the One, yet we cannot but renounce and condemn the Other.</p>
                           <p>In the Primitive Church these Indulgences were matters of <hi>meer discipline,</hi> as <hi>the Penances</hi> also were; the One to correct the sinner, and to give others cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they might not easily offend; the Other to encourage the Penitent to honour the Martyr that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed for his Forgiveness, or to prevent his dying without <hi>Absolution.</hi> In the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> they are founded upon an Errour in Doctrine; that as their Penance is not matter of Discipline, only to correct
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36811:38"/>
the sinner, but to be undergone as a satisfaction to be made to God for the sin; so their Indulgence is not given as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> expounds it, upon any consideration had <hi>of the fervour of the Penitent,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to Absolution which he has already received, but by the application of the <hi>Merits of</hi> their Saints who they suppose have undergone more temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments than their sins have deserved, to take off that <hi>pain,</hi> which notwithstanding their <hi>Absolution,</hi> the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner should otherwise have remained liable to.</p>
                           <p>In the Primitive Church the Bishop received the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent to Absolution, and the exemplariness of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or the intercession of the Martyr that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated for him, was the only consideration they had for the Indulgence. In the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is to be had from the Pope only, in <hi>whose hands the merits of their Saints lye,</hi> the overplus of which are, they say, <hi>the Treasure of the Church,</hi> to be dispensed upon all occasions to such as want, and upon such terms as his Holiness shall think fit to propose.</p>
                           <p>In the Primitive Church these Indulgences were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare, given only upon some special occasions, and the Bishop never relaxed the remainder of the Penance he had imposed, till the Penitent had performed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable part of it, and shew'd by his contrition that it had obtained the effect of bringing him to a sense of his sin, and a hearty repentance for it, which was the end they designed by all. In the <hi>Roman</hi> Church they are cry'd about the Streets, hung up in Tables over every Church Door, prostituted for Money, offer'd to all Customers, for themselves or for their Friends; for the dead as well as the living; and to visit three Churches, say a Prayer before this Altar, at the other Saints Monument, in a third Chappel, is without more
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36811:39"/>
ado, through the extraordinary Charity that Church hath for sinners, declared sufficient to take off what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever such Punishment is due for all the sins of a whole Life.</p>
                           <p>And here then let Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> in conscience tell us; <q>
                                 <hi>Is all this no more than to release some part of the remaining Penance, in consideration of the fervour of the Penitent</hi> in performing the rest? </q>Such Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons as these we do certainly with Reason conclude, <q>
                                 <hi>To be fond things, vainly invented, and grounded upon no Authority of Holy Scripture, but indeed repugnant</hi>

                                 <hi>to Gods Word.</hi> 
                              </q>But for the rest, We profess our selves so far from being enemies to the Ancient Discipline of the Church, that we heartily wish to see it revived; And <hi>whenever the Penances shall be reduced to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practice, we shall be ready to give or receive such an Indulgence as</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>has described, and as the Primitive Ages of the Church allow'd of.</hi>

                           </head>
                           <p>BUT the Temporal Pains which they suppose due to sin, has yet another Error consequent upon it. That since every man must undergo them according to the proportion of his sins, if any one chance to dye before he has so done, he cannot pass directly into Heaven, but must undergo these punishments first in the other Life, and the place where these Punishments are undergone, they call <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="31" facs="tcp:36811:39"/>
So that the Doctrine then of Purgatory, relies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Satisfaction which we our selves are to make for our sins, besides what Christ has done for us: And according to the measure that that is either true or false, certain or uncertain, this must be so too: Since therefore Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> tells us only, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> supposes the former to be true, they can only suppose the latter in like manner; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till they are able certainly to assure us of that, we shall still have reason to doubt of this.</p>
                           <p>That the Primitive Church from the very second Century, made <hi>Prayers for the dead,</hi> we do not deny; But that these Prayers were to deliver them out of Purgatory, this we suppose Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will not avow; it being certain that they were made for the best Men, for the Holy Apostles, the Martyrs and Confessors of the Church, nay for the Blessed Virgin her self, all which at the same time they thought in happiness, and who the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves tell us never toucht at Purgatory.</p>
                           <p>Many were the private Opinions which the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Christians of old had concerning the Reason and Benefit of <hi>Praying for the dead.</hi> Some then, as we do at this day, only gave thanks to God for their Faith and their Examples. Others prayed for them, either for the Bodies Resurrection, or for their acquitting at the final Judgment, as supposing it to be no way unfit to pray to God for those very Blessings which he has absolutely promised and resolved to give. Some thought an Increase of Glory might be obtained to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous by their Prayers. All believed this, that it testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their hope of them, and manifested their Faith of that Future Resurrection which they waited for; and in the mean time maintained a kind of Fellowship
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36811:40"/>
and Communion between the Members of Christ yet alive, and those who were departed only, not lost by death.</p>
                           <p>But then it is to be observed, that when they most ordinarily prayed for the dead, yet was there nothing <hi>determined</hi> as to this Point; all was left to the Piety and Opinion of <hi>particular men,</hi> nor durst they abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely resolve whether the dead received any benefit by them; as both the learned of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> themselves Confess, and the Writings of Primitive Antiquity, even to St. <hi>Augustine</hi> himself, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew.</p>
                           <p>Now as there is none of us that will condemn the Charity of any man, to pray, or fast, or afflict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the Pardon and Forgiveness of his Friends, his Country, or his Church, so it be done without any fond Opinion of <hi>Merit</hi> or <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and to hope too by such Prayers to obtain God's mercy for them: So if any one will put up his particular Requests for the dead too, for any of those ends for which the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians did, we shall not condemn him. Only let not that be made an <hi>Article of our Faith</hi> which we can never be assured of, and which when it was most Practised, was received only as a <hi>private Opinion,</hi> and in a Sense far different from what is now asserted; And for the rest <hi>We shall not refuse to Consent to any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty whereby Peace may be obtained, and our free Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Faith in Christ not injured.</hi>

                              <hi>ARTICLE IX.</hi> Of the Sacraments in General.</head>
                           <p>THE Doctrine of the Sacraments has always been esteemed one of the most considerable obstacles to our union with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> We cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine why Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> should insinuate as if our disputes about these, except it be in the point of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, <hi>were not so great as about other matters,</hi> unless it be to serve for an excuse for his own passing so lightly over them, or to make us less careful in examining their Doctrine.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the New Testament, in that <hi>proper sense</hi> in which we now take the word, we have always look'd upon to be not only <q>Holy <hi>Signs</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present and confirm to us the Grace of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so effectual Tokens of his good Will to us, by which he does work invisibly in us, and strengthen and confirm our Faith in him.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>To obtain the benefit of the Holy Sacraments, we cannot believe it to be enough that we have <hi>no ill
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36811:41"/>
disposition,</hi> but do suppose that it is a sufficient Obstacle if we have not a <hi>good one.</hi> We confess that the Faith <note place="margin">Artic. 25. of the Ch. of <hi>En.</hi>
                              </note> of the Church, and those who present them to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, is all that is required to prepare Infants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the spiritual Regeneration which that Sacrament confers. But for those who by age are capable of it, we suppose both in Baptism and in the holy Eucharist, an actual faith of Gods Promise annexed to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signs which we receive, to be indispensably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the partaking of their effects.</p>
                           <p>And tho if the rest be agreed, we shall not desire to determine any mans belief, as to the <hi>manner</hi> how the Sacraments confer that Grace which God has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them; yet we judg it more agreeable to the Analogy of our Faith to say, That upon the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the outward Ceremony, God bestows the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Blessing; than that the Blessing is conferr'd <hi>by Virtue of the Words which are pronounced, and the action which is done to us,</hi> as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                           <p>We do not by this at all take off from the necessity of the outward signs. We confess, <q>That besides the inward Preparation, there is required for our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <hi>a special operation of the holy Spirit, and an application of Christs Merits by the means of the holy Sacraments.</hi>
                              </q>  This we are so perswaded of, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess them to be <note n="‖" place="margin">So our Chu. Catechism.</note> 
                              <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> insomuch that whosoever either carelesly neglects, or presumptuously despises the use of them, will in vain expect it by any other means.</p>
                           <p>For the number of the Sacraments, we acknowledg <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two as generally necessary to Salvation;</hi> and are surpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> damning all such as will not receive a number, which neither has the Scripture

                           <p>The special consideration of their <hi>five pretended Sacraments,</hi> will give us an opportunity more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to establish that number we our selves propose.</p>
                           <p>This presumption of the truth we must not omit here, That not only the Ancient Fathers of the Church when they speak of the Sacraments <hi>properly</hi> as we now do, mention only <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>the Lords Supper;</hi> but even the Papists themselves who establish more, yet confess these to be so far the Principal, that our own <hi>Article</hi> says but little more, than what their greatest <hi>Schoolmen</hi> have voluntarily confessed.</p>

                           <p>HOW strict our Church is in maintaining the necessity of Baptism, the very Office by which we do administer it, sufficiently shews. We declare that <q>all men are conceived and born in sin, and that <note place="margin">See our Office Of Pub. Bapt</note>
                                 <pb n="36" facs="tcp:36811:42"/>
none can enter into the Kingdom of God, except he be regenerate and born anew of Water, and of the Spirit.</q> This is the Law of Christ which the Eternal Truth has established; and whosoever shall presume to oppose it, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But now as all other Laws, so this of Christ, must, we think, be interpreted according to the rules of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Equity. The Ancient Church constantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed her belief, that Martyrdom excused the defect of Baptism. Many of the Papists themselves suppose, that <hi>the desire of it,</hi> when by some unavoidable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity the Sacrament its self cannot be obtained, shall be reputed for it. Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> insinuates that <hi>the Acts of Faith, Hope, and Charity,</hi> may supply the want of it. <note n="⸫" place="margin">Ep. 70. if it be indeed his.</note> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> plainly concludes the same, <q>If, says he, a man <hi>desirous</hi> of Baptism be sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cut off by Death, in whom there wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found <hi>Faith,</hi> nor devout <hi>Hope,</hi> nor sincere <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> God be Merciful unto me, and pardon me if I err, but verily <hi>of such a Ones Salvation in whom there is no other defect but his faultless lack of Baptism, despair I cannot,</hi> nor induce my mind to think his <hi>Faith</hi> void, his <hi>Hope</hi> confounded, and his <hi>Charity</hi> fallen to nothing, only because he hath not that which <hi>not contempt, but impossibility</hi> with-holdeth.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>When therefore so many ways have been allowed to excuse the defect of Baptism, tho our Church has rather taken all imaginable care that Infants shall not die without it, than presumed rashly to determine what shall become of them if they do; yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but condemn the uncharitableness of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in <q>Excluding them from all Part in Jesus <hi>Christ,</hi>
                              </q>  and denying that Mercy to a tender and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Age, which they so liberally extend to those of Riper years.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="37" facs="tcp:36811:42"/>
If not the <hi>Want</hi> but the <hi>Contempt</hi> of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be the only thing that is damnable, to be sure no Contempt of Baptism can be in them. If the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Baptism in those that are capable of it, is by many of the Church confessed to be reputed for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; why shall we not hope that God who is all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, will accept the <hi>Desire</hi> of the Church and of their Parents in their behalf, who by their Age are not capable to have any of their own. <note n="‖" place="margin">By Monsieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> see before.</note> If <hi>Faith, Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> himself implies, may excuse them who actually have these Graces, tho they want this Sacrament; why may not that Faith, that Hope, that Charity of the Church, which being imputed to them renders them capable of Baptism, be as effectual to stand instead of it to them, as their own proper Faith for Others, if a necessity which could not be avoided prevents it?</p>
                           <p>In a word, Since such is the Mercy of God, that to things altogether impossible he bindeth no man; but where what he Commands cannot be performed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth of our Will to do it instead of the Deed. 2. Seeing God's Grace is not so absolutely tyed to the Sacraments, but that many exceptions have been, and are still Confessed to be sufficient to obtain it, without the external Application of them: Seeing, 3. St. <hi>Paul</hi> has told us that <hi>the Seed of faithfull Parentage is Holy</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> 
                              <hi>from the very Birth,</hi> as being born within the Covenant of Grace; Tho we determine nothing, yet we think it the part of Charity, not only to take all the Care we can to Present our Infants to Baptism whilst they live, but if by any unavoidable necessity they should die without it, <note n="‖" place="margin">See <hi>Cassan. Consult. Art. 9. &amp; de Bapt.

                           <p>A necessity therefore of Baptism we constantly maintain; but absolutely to determine that all those who die without it, are excluded from the Grace of Christ, neither will Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> presume to do of Men, nor dare we much less to affirm it of Infants.

                           <p>TO clear our way to that particular Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is necessary of the following <hi>pretended Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, it will be necessary to observe, that by their own Confession these three things are absolutely required to the <hi>Essence</hi> of a <hi>true Sacrament. 1. Christ's Institution. 2. An outward and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Sign. 3. An inward and spiritual Grace</hi> by Christ's promise annexed to that Sign.</p>
                           <p>We cannot but admire, that neither in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or in the Catechism made by its Order, is there any Attempt to prove either of these from the Holy Scripture as to the Point of Confirmation. It was so much the more necessary to have done this, in that <hi>Many</hi> of the greatest Note in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>had denied the Divine Institution of it;</hi> and some of them were approved by the <hi>Holy See</hi> its self that did it. <hi>The outward Sign</hi> had been none of the least Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies that have exercised their own Pens: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed since they have laid aside that of <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> which they confess the Apostles used; it was but reasonable to have shewn us some Authority for that other they have established in its stead. What Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> expounds, is a clear Vindication of our Practice, but defends nothing of their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                           <p>That we think it to have been an Ancient custom in the Church, and which the very Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36811:44"/>
Practised, to <hi>lay hands</hi> on those that had been Baptized; and in imitation whereof we our selves at this day do the like, the Practise of our Church suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declares.</p>
                           <p>We Confess that the use of <hi>Chrism</hi> in Confirmation was very Ancient, yet such as we deny to have been <hi>Apostolical.</hi> We do not our selves use it, yet were that all the difference between us, we should be far from judging those that did.</p>
                           <p>The Discipline of our Church allows none that is not of the Episcopal Order to Confirm. And for the benefit of it, as the Bishop prays to God for his Holy Spirit to assist us in the way of Virtue and Religion, to Arm us against Temptation, and to enable us to keep our <hi>Baptismal Covenant which we then</hi> (our selves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, and) <hi>in the Presence of the Church-openly ratifie and confirm:</hi> So we Piously hope that the Blessing of the Holy Spirit descends upon us, through his Prayer, for all these great Ends; both to strengthen the Grace we already have, and to increase it in us to a more plentiful degree.</p>

                              <hi>ARTICLE XII.</hi> Of Penance and Confession.</head>
                           <p>FOR <hi>Penance</hi> and <hi>Confession,</hi> we wish our Discipline were both more strictly required, and more duly observed than it is. The <hi>Canons of our Church</hi> do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps require as much as the Primitive Christians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did: and it is more <hi>the decay of Piety</hi> in the People, than any want of Care in her, that they are not as well and regularly Practised.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="41" facs="tcp:36811:44"/>
We do not believe <hi>Penance</hi> to be a Sacrament after the same manner that Baptism and the Holy Eucharist are; because neither do we find any Divine Command for it, nor is there any Sign in it established by Christ, to which his Grace is annexed. We suppose that if the Ancient Church had esteemed it any thing more than a part of Christian Discipline, they would not have presumed to make such changes in it, as in the several Ages it is evident they did.</p>
                           <p>The Primitive Christians interpreting those places of <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 18. 18. John 20. 23.</note> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> which Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> mentions, of publick Discipine, and to which we suppose with them they principally at least, if not only refer, <hi>at first</hi> Practised no other. For private faults, they exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Penitents to Confess them to God, and unless some particular Circumstances required the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to the Priest, plainly signified that that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession was not only in its self sufficient, but in effect was more agreeable to Holy Scripture, than any other.</p>
                           <p>If the Conscience indeed were too much burdened by some <hi>Great fault;</hi> or that the Crime committed was <hi>notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Scandalous,</hi> then they advised a Confession to the Priest too. But this was not to every Priest, nor for him just to hear the Confession, and then without more ado to say <hi>I absolve thee;</hi> They prescribed in every Church some Wise Physician of the Soul on purpose for this great Charge, that might pray with the Penitent; might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him what to do to obtain Gods favour; might assist him in it; and finally, after a long Experience, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judgment, give him Absolution.</p>
                           <p>This was the Practise of the <hi>Eastern Church;</hi> till upon occasion of a <hi>certain scandal, Nectarius</hi> first began to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it in his Church at <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and St. <hi>J. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> his Successor seconded him in it. They reduced the Practise to what it had been in the Beginning; that open and scandalous Sins should be openly punished by the publick Discipline of the Church, and the private be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed only to God Almighty.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="42" facs="tcp:36811:45"/>
Yet still the publick Confession remained in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the <hi>Western Church. Pope Leo</hi> I. to take away the occasions of Fear and Shame that kept many from the exercise of it, first ordered, that it should be sufficient to Confess to God and the Priest only; which is the first plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Pretence offered by them for Auricular Confession.</p>
                           <p>Thus this Practise, now set up for a Sacrament insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by our Saviour, and absolutely necessary to obtain God's pardon, first began. But the Performance of it was yet left to every Mans liberty. About 1215 Years after Christ, the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> first Commanded it to be of necessary observance: But we do not find that till the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in the last Age, it was ever required to be received absolutely <hi>as a Sacrament of Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> and <hi>necessary to Salvation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This short View of the Practise of Antiquity in this point, may be sufficient to shew, that unless it were the publick power of the Church to censure open and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Offenders, which was the Key of Discipline our Blessed Saviour left to it; for the rest, several Churches and Ages had their several Practises. They advised pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Confession as upon many accounts which Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> Remarks, and which we willingly allow, very useful to the Penitent: but it was not for above a 1000 Years ever looked upon as <hi>absolutely necessary,</hi> nor by Consequence as <hi>Sacramental.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Church of England</hi> refuses no sort of Confession ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publick or private, which may be any way necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the quieting of mens Consciences; or to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising of that <hi>Power of binding and loosing,</hi> which our Saviour Christ has left to his Church.</p>
                           <p>We have our Penitential Canons for publick Offenders: We exhort men if they have any the least doubt or scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nay sometimes tho they have none, but especially before they receive the Holy Sacrament, to Confess their sins. We propose to them the benefit not only of Ghostly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36811:45"/>
Advice how to manage their Repentance, but the great comfort of <hi>Absolution</hi> too, as soon as they shall have compleated it.</p>
                           <p>Our form of Absolution after the manner of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Church at this day, and of the Universal Church for above 1200 Years, is <hi>Declarative</hi> rather than <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</hi> Whilst we are unable to search the Hearts of men, and thereby infallibly to discern the sincerely contrite, from those that are not; we think it Rashness to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a <hi>definitive Sentence in God's Name, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sure that God will always confirm.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When we visit our Sick, we never fail to exhort them to make a <hi>special Confession</hi> of their sins to him that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to them: And when they have done it, the <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> is so full, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> its self could not desire to add any thing to it.</p>
                           <p>For the rest; We think it an <hi>unnecessary Rack to mens Consciences</hi> to oblige them where there is no scruple, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal to their Confessor every the most secret fault, even of Wish or Desire, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> exacts: Nor dare we pronounce this Discipline <hi>Sacramental,</hi> and <hi>necessary to Salvation;</hi> so that a contrite Sinner, who has made his Confession to God Almighty, shall not receive a Pardon, unless he repeat it to the Priest too.</p>
                           <p>This we must beg leave with assurance to say is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Tradition of the Church, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plain and undoubted places of Holy Scripture. And if this be all our Reformation be guilty of, That we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise not that which may Torment and Distract, but is no way apt to settle mens Consciences; nor require that as indispensably necessary to Salvation, which we find no where commanded by God as such, we assure Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> we see no cause at all either to <hi>regret the Loss,</hi> or to be <hi>ashamed of the Change.</hi>

                           <p>OF all those <hi>pretended Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church that have no foundation in holy Scripture, this seems to stand the fairest for it. Here is both an outward and visible Sign, and an inward and spiritual Grace tied to it. Insomuch that Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> himself, who never attempted to say any thing of it in the two foregoing Instances, yet fails not to put us in mind of it in this.</p>
                           <p>To interpret rightly that place of St. <hi>James</hi> which is <note place="margin">1 James 5. 6, 14. 13.</note> alledged to prove it, we must remark, that <hi>anointing with Oyl</hi> was one of those <hi>Ceremonies</hi> used by the Apostles in working their miraculous Cures, Mark 6. 13. <hi>They cast out devils,</hi> says the Evangelist, <hi>and anointed many sick persons with Oyl, and cured them.</hi> Sometimes they used only <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands,</hi> and sometimes they did it without either.</p>
                           <p>Together with these <hi>outward signs</hi> they usually added <hi>Prayer</hi> too, some Invocation at least in the name of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as the more substantial and more effectual Assistance.</p>
                           <p>So that St. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Direction there, <q>If any man be sick let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with Oyl in the name of the Lord, and the Prayer of Faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; </q>
                              <hi>referring as is evident to those</hi> mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <hi>cures</hi> which the Apostles and their Successors in the Primitive Church wrought by such anointing: We look upon it, that the advice, in as much as it belonged to that, could neither have been the Institution of a Sacrament at all; and that together with the miraculous power of healing, it is now long since ceased in the Church.</p>

                           <p>Our Saviour and his Apostles, when they thus miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously healed the infirmity of the Body, at the same time forgave the sin of the soul too; For this cause St <hi>James</hi> adds, <q>And if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven <hi>him.</hi>

                           <p>Tho this extraordinary Power be now ceased both in the One and the other kind, yet we still endeavour to perform whatever we are capable of on these occasions; We send for the Elders of the Church when we are sick, they pray over us; if we stand charged with any private sins, or publick Censures, we confess them to them, and they fail not by their Absolution, as far as in them lies, to forgive us.</p>
                           <p>This is all, we think, is now remaining for us to fulfil of what this Text requires; We <hi>anoint not</hi> our sick for the recovery of their <hi>bodily health,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> here prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, because the miraculous power of healing, to which that Ceremony ministred, is ceased in the Church. We pray over them if it please God for the recovery of their present Health, but especially for their Eternal Salvation: We exercise <hi>the power of the Keys</hi> to the forgiveness of their sins, because the benefit of this is the same now that ever it was; Christ's Promise remains, and whilst we piously make use of the same means, we doubt not but it shall be to the like Effect.</p>

                              <hi>THE Imposition of Hands</hi> in holy Orders, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a Blessing of the Holy Spirit, may perhaps upon that account be called a kind of <hi>Particular Sacrament.</hi> Yet since that Grace which is thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, whatever it be, is not common to all Christians, nor by consequence any part of that foederal Blessing which our Blessed Saviour has purchased for us; but only a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of him who receives it to a special Employ; we think it ought not to be esteemed a common Sacrament of the whole Church, as <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> are.</p>
                           <p>The outward sign of it we confess to have been usually <hi>Imposition of hands,</hi> and as such we our selves observe it; Yet as we do not read that Christ himself instituted that sign, much less tied the promise of any certain Grace to it; so Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> may please to consider, that there are many of his <hi>own Communion,</hi> that do not think it to be essential to <hi>holy Orders,</hi> nor by consequence the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sign</hi> of a Sacrament in them.</p>
                           <p>We confess that no man ought to exercise the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office till he be first consecrated to it.

in this, Whether our Saviour Christ when he said, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> meant any thing else to be his <hi>Body,</hi> than that <hi>Bread</hi> which was before him.</p>
                           <p>Now for this, the Connexion of his discourse seems to us an evident Demonstration. <q>Our Saviour Christ took Bread, and gave Thanks, and brake it, and gave it to his Disciples, saying, Take, Eat, This is my Body which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>for you; do this in Remembrance of me.</hi>

                           <p>For what did he demonstrate here, and say was his <hi>Body,</hi> but that which he <hi>gave to his Disciples?</hi> What did he <hi>give to his Disciples,</hi> but that which <hi>He brake?</hi> What <hi>brake he,</hi> but that <hi>which he took?</hi> And St. <hi>Luke</hi> says ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly <hi>he took Bread.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>What Jesus <hi>took in his hands,</hi> that <hi>He blessed:</hi> what <hi>He blessed,</hi> the same <hi>He brake and gave to his Disciples:</hi> What he <hi>gave to his Disciples,</hi> of that he said, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> But Jesus, says the Text, <hi>took Bread; of the Bread</hi> therefore he said, <hi>This is my Body.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In a word; Forasmuch as the Papists themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Bread</hi> to be turned into the substance of <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> because Christ said <hi>This is my Body:</hi> Either those words refer to the <hi>Bread,</hi> and then by their own Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they will require our Interpretation; or if they do not, it is evident that then from these words they can have no Grounds to conclude their own pretended change.</p>
                           <p>So necessarily do both the words themselves and their own Confession, lead us to the Exposition which we make of them. And what these prepare us to receive, the same, 2dly. <q>The Intention of our Saviour in this Holy Sacrament, do's yet more strongly confirm to us.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>When God delivered the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he instituted the Passover to be a continual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance <note place="margin">Exod 12.</note> of that great deliverance. In like manner our Blessed Saviour being now about to work out a much greater deliverance for us, by offering up himself upon the Cross for our Redemption, he design'd by this Sacrament
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36811:48"/>
to continue the memory of this Blessing, That <q>as often <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 26</note> as we eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, we might shew forth the Lords Death till his Coming.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>That this Sacrament instituted for the like end which the Passover had been, and now for ever to succeed in its place, might be both the better understood, and the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier received by them, it pleased our Blessed Lord to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate himself as near as was possible to the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> and <hi>Phrases</hi> they had before been used to. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the <hi>Symbols,</hi> and even the <hi>Expressions</hi> they had so long been acquainted with; only he changed the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them to a new and more excellent <hi>Remembrance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the <hi>Jewish</hi> Passover, the Master of the House took Bread, and brake it, and gave it to them, saying, <q>This is the Bread of Affliction, which our Fathers eat in Egypt.</q> In this holy Sacrament, our Saviour after the very same manner, took Bread, and brake it, and gave it to them, saying, <q>This is my Body which is broken for you; Do this <hi>in remembrance of Me.</hi>
                              </q> 
                           </p>
                           <p>Now as it is evident, that that <hi>Bread</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> every Year took, and brake, and said, <q>This is the Bread of Affliction which our Fathers eat in Egypt,</q> was not that very Bread which their Ancestors so many Generations before had eaten there; but was design'd only to be the <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of it: so neither could our Saviours Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples to whom he spake, and who, as being <hi>Jews,</hi> had so long been acquainted with that Phrase, ever believe, That <hi>the Bread</hi> which he held in his hand, which <hi>he brake</hi> and <hi>gave</hi> them, saying, <q>This is my Body which is broken for you, Do this in remembrance of me, </q>was the very, actual, real Body of Christ which they saw before them at the Table. They understood it, no doubt, to be the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of that <hi>Body</hi> which was now about to be broken for them; as that <hi>Bread</hi> which the Master of the Feast, after the very same manner, was wont <hi>to break</hi> to them, was the <hi>Type</hi> of that <hi>Bread of Affliction</hi> which their Fathers had eaten in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="50" facs="tcp:36811:49"/>
Nor does the Phrase, <hi>My Body,</hi> at all weaken, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm this <hi>Idea,</hi> as being the ordinary expression among the <hi>Jews,</hi> whereby they called the Passover, <hi>The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Passover, The body of the Paschal Lamb.</hi> It was therefore used here by our Saviour with that allusion, the more expresly to signifie, that he was the <hi>true Passover</hi> now to be sacrificed for us, by whose Blood we were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7.</note> from the destroying Angel, and for the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance whereof, we were therefore to keep this Ceremony, as the <hi>Jews</hi> had done their Passover for the other.</p>
                           <p>This we suppose to be the undoubted Interpretation of this place. Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> ought the less to except against it, in that it was the original remark, not of any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi> or of any other Party of Christians differing from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this matter, but was objected to them by the verv <hi>Jews</hi> themselves long before the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> upon the same account. They shew'd by it, that in the Doctrine of this pretended Change, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had evidently opposed the design of our Saviours Institution, and advanced an <hi>Interpretation,</hi> which no one accustomed to the <hi>Jewish Notions,</hi> as the Apostles were, could ever have understood to be his meaning.</p>
                           <p>The design of this discourse permits me not to proceed to any more particular vindication of this Exposition, nor to mention many other Arguments more usually proposed; and wherein it has clearly been shewn, that they have not only the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>design of our Blessed Saviour</hi> in this Sacrament, but <hi>Sense, Reason, Antiquity,</hi> whatsoever is able to furnish an Argument, all unanimously against them: It remains only to examine whether what Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has proposed, be any thing more reasonable, that so we may go on to the Consequences established upon this foundation.</p>
                           <p>Where first we cannot conceive why Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> designing to establish the Exposition of the holy Eucharist upon the Analogy which it has to the <hi>Jewish Sacrifices,</hi> should flie off to the natureof their <hi>Sacrifices in general,</hi> where
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36811:49"/>
the parallel is neither so clear, nor so uncontroverted, as to produce any necessary consequence from the allusion. It would certainly have been more reasonable to compare it, as we have done, with that particular <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> to which it succeeded, and from which therefore, if any, must be shewed the design of it. But we will clear the whole difficulty in a reflection or two, and prove, that what has been offered to us as a <hi>convincing Argument,</hi> is, upon a nearer view, <hi>a meer fallacy.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And 1. We desire it may be observed, That the <hi>Peace-Offerings</hi> under the Law were designed as an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the peoples part, for those temporal blessings which it pleased God to bestow upon them. And because after the <hi>sacrifice of Isaac,</hi> God first entred into the <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and promised him his Blessing, and to be his God, <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </note> and the God of his Seed after him; it seems to have been further their intention in all these Sacrifices, to call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance <hi>that Offering of Isaac</hi> as the foundation of all those blessings for which these Sacrifices were appointed as a testimony of their Gratitude.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That tho the <hi>Passover,</hi> like the <hi>Sacrifice of the Cross,</hi> was first offered as a <hi>sin-offering</hi> for the delivery of the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born in the land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet that yearly remembrance of it, which God afterwards establish'd, was always esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Peace-offering;</hi> and indeed, the perpetual order of their Sacrifices clearly demonstrates that it could be no other.</p>
                           <p>So that the Parallel therefore, for the explaining the nature of the holy Eucharist, must be this:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That as the Jews ate of their <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to call to mind the <hi>Sacrifice of Isaac,</hi> and give God thanks for those blessings which they received by it, and of that of the <hi>Passover</hi> in particular, in memory of <hi>Gods deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them out of Egypt;</hi> So the Christians partake of this <hi>blessed Sacrament,</hi> in memory of that deliverance which the <hi>Sacrifice of the Cross of Christ,</hi> whom both <hi>Isaac</hi> and the <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> slain in <hi>Egypt</hi> typified, has purchased for them.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That as the <hi>Peace-offering</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> eat, was not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36811:50"/>
changed into the <hi>Substance</hi> of that first Sacrifice whereof it was the remembrance, but was eaten as a <hi>figure</hi> or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration</hi> of it; so the Christians in their Sacrament are not to think the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> which Christ has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be our <hi>Peace-offering,</hi> should be changed into the very <hi>substance of that Body which was offered for us upon the Cross,</hi> but to be received only as <hi>Types</hi> of it. For thus was the <hi>Peace-offering</hi> in general, a <hi>Type of Isaac,</hi> and the <hi>Passover</hi> in particular, the <hi>Type</hi> of that first <hi>Lamb,</hi> which was slain for their deliverance in the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When therefore Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ate the <hi>proper flesh</hi> of their <hi>Peace-offering;</hi> we answer, that so do we the <hi>proper substance</hi> of ours; we eat the <hi>Bread</hi> which Christ appointed to be the <hi>remembrance</hi> of that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance which he has purchased for us, as <hi>the body of the Lamb</hi> was commanded by God to be the remembrance of theirs.</p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> adds, That the <hi>Jews</hi> were forbidden to partake of the proper flesh of their <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> and of <hi>the Blood,</hi> because that a <hi>perfect Remission was not then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,</hi> and that therefore by <hi>the rule of contraries,</hi> we ought now to eat of Ours, because a full satisfaction is now made by Christ.</p>
                           <p>For Reply to which, it might suffice to say, that this <hi>rule of contraries,</hi> should we follow it according to the Letter, would lead Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> into so many absurdities, that he would be forced himself to abjure his own Principle. According to this rule, the Apostles could not have eaten the flesh of Christ before his Resurrection; the Priests un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law being commanded not to eat of the Sin-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>after the third day,</hi> and therefore by <hi>the rule of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> they could not partake of it <hi>before.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> may please to consider how far he will approve of this Conclusion: In the mean time as to his Objection, we have before said, that the remembrance we make in the holy Eucharist, like that of the <hi>Paschal Feast</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> shews it to be a <hi>Peace-offering;</hi> and for the rest, if, as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> pretends, this <hi>Blood</hi>
                              <pb n="53" facs="tcp:36811:50"/>
was mystically forbid under the Law, to shew that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect remission of sins was not then obtain'd; It will follow, that for the contrary reason, Christ appointed <hi>the Cup to be received in this holy Sacrament, to testifie that full remission which his blood has purchased for us.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in refusing the Cup to the people, not only violates the express command of our Blessed Saviour; but according to Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Principles, teaches them by it, that a full remission of sins is not yet obtain'd, even by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of Christ himself.</p>
                           <p>It may by this appear what little advantage Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> can get to justifie their Doctrine of the corporeal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ in the Eucharist, from the <hi>Analogie</hi> of the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Sacrifices,</hi> which do clearly and necessarily establish the contrary. For what remains of this discourse we are but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle concerned in it.</p>
                           <p>We Confess this Sacrament to be somewhat more than a <hi>meer Figure;</hi> but we deny that therefore it must be his <hi>very Body.</hi> We acknowledge <hi>the power of God, to do whatever he pleases:</hi> Yet Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> may please to consider, that <hi>Contradictions,</hi> such as to be and not to be at the same time, are even in their own Schools usually excepted. Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> supposes, that because Christ did not explain his words in the <hi>figurative Sense,</hi> the Apostles must needs have understood them in the <hi>Literal.</hi> But we have before shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>the Jews,</hi> who are certainly the best Judges, are of a quite contrary opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Apostles knowing his allusion, could never have understood them otherwise than in a Figure. In a word, for his last Remark, <q>That the Laws of discourse, which perm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                    <desc>•…</desc>
                                 </gap>, that where there is a just Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Sign and the thing signified, the one may be put for the other; Yet suffer it not to be so, when a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Bread, for instance, is set to represent the Body of a Man: </q>We must beg leave to say, that neither is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion so small betwixt <hi>the Bread broken</hi> and <hi>Christs Body broken,</hi> as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> would suggest; Or, that if there were, yet since our Saviours institution has set the one
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36811:51"/>
to represent to us the other; we think that designation ought to be of more Authority with us, than all their new Laws of Discourse; invented purposely only to set the fairer Gloss upon so great and apparent an Error.</p>

                           <p>THE Explication of the preceding Article, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged us to a length extraordinary, we will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to recompence it by our shortness in this.</p>
                           <p>We are entirely agreed, that the Intention of the Son of God was to oblige us by these words to commemorate that death which he underwent for our Salvation. We Confess, that that real Presence which we suppose in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, do's not at all contradict the Nature of this Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration. We are persuaded, that as <hi>the Jews</hi> eating of their <hi>Peace-Offering,</hi> which was the remembrance of God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and particularly of <hi>the Passover,</hi> the Type of that <hi>Paschal Lamb that was offered for them in</hi> Egypt, called to mind the <hi>Sacrifice of</hi> Isaac, and that great <hi>Deliverance</hi> God had wrought for them, in bringing them up out of the Land of Bondage: So whilst we Eat of those Holy Elements which our Saviour Christ has instituted like the Peace-Offering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to perpetuate the Memory of his death, We call to mind the more lively, that great deliverance which He has wrought for us, and render thanks for it, and by faith and repentance apply to our selves the Merits of it.</p>
                           <p>Thus whilst we receive these Holy signs which he has instituted for our Memorial, we need no real descent of the Son of God from Heaven; no new Crucifying of the Lord of Glory to raise in our Souls those just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments we ought to have of so excellent a Blessing. But as a Child cannot but recollect the kindness and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a dear Father, as often as he beholds the Monument where his dead Body lies interred: So we much more, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but excite our Love to our blessed Redeemer, as often as we see before our eyes these <hi>Sacred Elements</hi> under which he is vailed. Nor is it necessary for this, that this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36811:51"/>
                              <hi>Mystick Tomb,</hi> as Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> phrases it, should any more be changed into the <hi>very real Body</hi> of our Saviour to raise this remembrance, than that natural One into the dead Corps of the Father, to recall the tender Affections of his Child at the sight of it.</p>
                           <p>In a word; As we will not now move any Argument from the nature of this <hi>remembrance,</hi> to oppose that <hi>substantial change,</hi> which we have before combated on more solid grounds; so we suppose muchless ought Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> from the sole opinion of that more <hi>lively remembrance,</hi> which he imagines the actual eating of the very Flesh of Christ would raise in us, then only to do it in a figure, to conclude him to be substantially there. It is evident, that they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this change, and they who believe it not, receive him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely alike. They see, and taste, and feel the same thing: It is <hi>Faith</hi> alone which works in both, and makes the one belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him <hi>spirituarlly</hi> present, to remember him with the same love, to honour him with the same reverence, and embrace him with the same hope, as the other, who thinks him <hi>corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>really,</hi> but yet after a manner altogether unperceivable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd under the sacred Elements that are presented to him.</p>

                           <p>This is our Faith of this holy Eucharist: And in this Faith we are confirmed not only by those unanswerable proofs, which our Writers have given, and some of which we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touch'd upon; but also from those irreconcilable differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which this Error has thrown the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> into.

And here who can chuse but admire the Power of Truth? That after so many Outcries against us, for Opposing a Doctrine which they would make the World believe it is as clear as if it were written with a Ray of the Sun; after so many <hi>Anathema</hi>'s against us for Hereticks, and Schismaticks, and ten thousand repetitions of their great <hi>Scriptum est,</hi> 
                              <q>This is my <hi>Body:</hi>
                              </q>  they should at last be forced to confess, <q>That they are not, cannot, nor are ever like to be agreed in the Explication of them. That they contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them necessary to prove this change. That had not the Church declared its self for the Litteral meaning; the Figurative interpretation might with as good Reason have been received. That for 1200 years this Doctrine was no matter of Faith, and but for the Council of Lateran <hi>had not been then.</hi> In short, <hi>that if the words of Institution refer to the Bread, then are we doubtless in the right;</hi>
                              </q> and if they do not, how will they ever prove the change which they pretend is made of the <hi>Bread</hi> into the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> by them?</p>
                           <p>Certainly confessions, such as these, ought to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake every Papist careful of his own Salvation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an unprejudiced Examination at least of these things. To consider what Foundation there really is for this Doctrine, and what desperate Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, unknown to Antiquity, contrary to the formal words of Holy Scripture, and without Gods infinite Mercy, absolutely destructive of their eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have been built upon it.</p>
                           <p>As we hope that these declarations have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by God to fall from the greatest, and most E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed of their Church, not only to confirm us in our Faith, but also to prepare the way for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36811:53"/>
to that <hi>Catholick truth,</hi> from which they have so long erred; so we doubt not, by Gods blessing, but that they will in time attain to it, when being sensible of that Tyrannical usurpation that has been made over their Consciences, and resolved to use that Knowledg God has given them, to search the Scriptures, and examine their Faith, and not servily follow every Guide that will but pretend to lead them: They shall seriously and indifferently weigh all these things, and find that therefore only they have thought us in darkness, because their own Eyes were shut that they might not discern the light.</p>

                           <p>WHat remains of this Subject of the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, being wholly consequent upon the foregoing mistaken interpretation of the Words of our Blessed Saviour before considered; we should have passed them over as things we have in effect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> receives not; but that we are perswaded the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of them will yet more fully shew the fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Foundation upon which they are built.</p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> in proving the Corporeal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist, from the Words of institution, <q>This is my Body:</q> had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that at least seemed to favour his mistake; but to produce them here for <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> that is, not only to argue the presence of Christ's substance, but
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36811:53"/>
also the change of the substance of the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> into it, he has not the least appearance of the Text for him.</p>
                           <p>Indeed were there no other way for Christ to be present in the Eucharist, but only by this change; it might then be allowed that having, as he imagines, proved the one, he had in effect established the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the number of those who interpret the Words in like manner according to the Letter, yet are as great enemies as our selves to this change; and suppose Christs Body to be present by a <hi>Union of it to the Bread,</hi> rather then by a <hi>Conversion of the Bread into it;</hi> not only shews that there is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequence at all between the <hi>real presence,</hi> and <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> but that there is another manner of Christs presence, both more agreeable to Holy Scripture, than that which they advance; and that takes off infinite difficulties which their <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> involves them in.</p>
                           <p>That the Substance of the Sacred Figures remains in this Sacrament after the <hi>Consecration,</hi> those clear expressions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> wherein he so often calls them <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 16. &amp;c.—11. 26.</note> 
                              <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> after it, seem to us plainly to shew: <note n="†" place="margin">Acts 2. 46. &amp;c.</note> 
                              <hi>To break Bread,</hi> the Holy Scripture tells us was the usual Phrase all the time of the Apostles, for <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Holy Communion;</hi> and which the Blessed Spirit himself dictated. These passages Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> certainly ought not to put off with a Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive meaning, unless he can give us some good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he follows <hi>the High road</hi> of the Literal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation in the one, to establish the Substance of Christs Body in the Sacrament; and forsakes it in the other, to take away the Presence of the Bread from it.</p>

For the <hi>Adoration of the Host,</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> consequently to her Principles of the Bread and Wine's remaining in their natural substances, professes that she thinks it <q>to be Idolatry, and to be <note place="margin">See her Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick at the end of the Communion Office.</note> abhorred of all faithful Christians.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> in Conformity to theirs, tells us, <q>That the presence of Christs Body in the Eucharist ought to carry all such as believe it without all scruple to the Adoration of it.</q> This therefore being taken as a Principle acknowledged by them; it may not be amiss to observe, that since it is certain, that neither Christ nor his Apostles appointed or practised, nor the Church for above 1000 Years required or taught <hi>any Adoration of this Holy Sacrament;</hi> neither could they, according to Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Principles, have believed the <hi>Corporeal Presence</hi> of our Blessed Saviour in it.</p>
                           <p>Is there any of the Evangelists that mentions it? They all tell us, <hi>Take, Eat; Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> But does any one add, <hi>This is my Body, fall down and Worship it?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproved the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 20, &amp;c.</note> this Holy Sacrament; is it possible he could have omitted so obvious a Remark, and so much to his purpose; That in profaning this Holy Sacrament, they were not only guilty of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of Christ, which it was instituted to represent to us; but even directly affronted their Blessed Master cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally present there; and whom instead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning, they ought, as they had been taught, <hi>to Adore in it?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>With what simplicity do the Ancient Fathers speak of this Communion in all their Writings? <hi>The Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Sacred Symbols was not heard of till the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36811:54"/>
Seventh Century; and then used only to represent the lifting up of Christ upon the Cross, not to expose it to the People to adore it. <hi>The Bell, the Feast of the St. Sacrament, the Pomp of carrying it through the Streets,</hi> all the other Circumstances of this Worship, are inventions of yesterday. The exposing of it upon the Altar to make their Prayers before it; their Addresses to it in times and cases of Necessity; their performing the chiefest acts of Religion in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, never mentioned in Antiquity.</p>
                           <p>Nay, instead of this Worship, they did many things utterly inconsistent with it. They disputed with the Heathens for <hi>worshipping Gods their own Hands had made.</hi> Was it ever objected to them, that they themselves did the same: Worship a Deity whose substance they first formed, and then spoke it into a God? They <hi>burnt</hi> in some Churches <hi>what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained of the Holy Sacrament. They permitted the People to carry it home,</hi> that had Communicated: <hi>They sent it abroad</hi> by Sea, by Land, without any the least regard that we can find had to its <hi>Worship: They buried it</hi> with their Dead; they made <hi>Plaisters</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> they mix'd <hi>the Wine</hi> with their <hi>Ink.</hi> These certainly were no instances of <hi>Adoration:</hi> Nor can we ever suppose that they who did such things as these, ever believed that it was the very <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Bloud</hi> of their dear Master, whom they so much loved; and whom doubtless they would have been as ready to have worshipped, had they so believed; as both Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> supposes they ought to have been, and as we see others for the rest no more pious than those Primitive Christians were, now to do it.</p>

                              <hi>ARTICLE XX.</hi> Of the Sacrifice of the Mass.</head>
                           <p>A Third Consequence of the <hi>Corporeal Presence</hi> of Christ in the Holy Eucharist, is the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Mass:</hi> In which we ought to proceed with all the Caution such a Point requires, as both makes up the chiefest part of the Popish Worship, and is justly esteem'd one of the greatest and most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Errors that offends us.</p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has represented it to us with so much tenderness, that except perhaps it be his Foundation of the <hi>Corporeal Presence,</hi> on which he builds, and his Consequence that this Service is <hi>a true and real Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> which his manner of expounding it we are perswaded will never bear; there is little in it besides but what we could readily assent to.</p>
                           <p>We distinguish the two Acts, which he mentions, from one another. By the <hi>Consecration</hi> we apply the <hi>Elements,</hi> before common, to a Sacred use; by the <hi>Manducation,</hi> we fulfil our Saviour's Command; <q>We <hi>take,</hi> and <hi>eat,</hi> and <hi>Do this in remembrance of Him.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>This <hi>Consecration</hi> being separately made of his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy broken,</hi> his <hi>Blood spilt</hi> for our Redemption, we suppose represents to us our Blessed Lord in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of his Death, which these holy Symbols were instituted to continue the memory of. And whilst thus with Faith we represent to God the Death of his Son, for the pardon of our sins; we are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36811:55"/>
that we incline his Mercy the more readily to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them.</p>
                           <p>We do not therefore doubt, but that this present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God Almighty the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Blessed Lord, is a most effectual manner of applying his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> to us. Were this all the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> meant by her <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> there is not certainly any Protestant that would oppose her in it.</p>
                           <p>Where is that Christian that does not by <hi>Faith u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite himself to his Saviour</hi> in this holy Communion? That does not present him to God as his <hi>only Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Propitiation?</hi> That does not protest that he has nothing to offer him but <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Merits of his Death?</hi> That consecrates not all his prayers by this Divine Offering; and whilst he thus presents to God the Sacrifice of his Son, does not learn thereby to present also himself a lively Sacrifice, holy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in his sight?</p>
                           <p>This is, no doubt, a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> worthy a Christian, infinitely exceeding all the Sacrifices of the Law. Where the Knife is the Word, the <hi>Blood shed not but in a figure, nor is there any Death but in Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation.</hi> A Sacrifice so far from taking us off from that of the Cross, that it unites us the more closely to it; represents it to us, and derives all its Vertue and Efficacy from it.</p>
                           <p>This is, if any other, truly <hi>The Doctrine of the Catholick Church,</hi> and such as <hi>the Church of England</hi> has never refused: and except it be our doubt of the <hi>Corporeal Presence,</hi> Monsieur de <hi>Meaux</hi> had certainly reason to expect, that there was nothing in this we could justly except against.</p>
                           <p>But now that all this is sufficient to prove the <hi>Mass</hi> to be a <q>True and Proper Sacrifice, truly and properly <note place="margin">Concil. Trident. Sess. 22.</note>
                                 <pb n="64" facs="tcp:36811:56"/>
propitiatory for the sins and punishments, the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and necessities of the dead and the living; and that to offer this true and proper Sacrifice, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ instituted a true and proper Priesthood, when he said, Do this in Remembrance of Me: </q>This is what we cannot yet understand, and what we think we ought not ever to allow of.</p>
                           <p>We know indeed, that the Primitive Church, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in that large extent of the Expression, whereby the holy Scripture stiles every religious performance, our <hi>Prayers,</hi> our <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings,</hi> our <hi>Vertues,</hi> our <hi>very Selves, Sacrifices</hi> to God: And accordingly in our own <hi>Liturgy,</hi> we do, without all scruple, do the same. But when it comes to be set in Opposition to a Sacrament, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in the true and proper signification of the Word; we must, with all Antiquity, needs profess, That we neither have, nor can we after that of Christ admit of any.</p>
                           <p>Hence it is, that our Church following the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Holy Apostles and Primitive Christians, teaches, <q>That the Offering of Christ once made, is <note place="margin">See Article 31.</note> that proper Redemption, Propitiation, and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for all the sins of the whole World; and that there is no other Satisfaction for sin but that alone.</q> That the <hi>Application</hi> of Christs Death by <hi>Faith</hi> in the Holy Eucharist, is made to all such as with true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance receive the same, we undoubtedly believe. We are perswaded, that by our Prayers, which in this holy Solemnity we never fail to offer for the wants and necessities, the pardon and forgiveness not of our selves only, but of all Mankind; of those who have not yet known the Faith of Christ; or that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, have prevaricated from the right way, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36811:56"/>
Gods Mercy to become <hi>propitious</hi> unto them. Only we deny, that by this holy Eucharist, as by a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> we can appease Gods Wrath for the sins of the whole World; can fulfil the satisfactions, and supply the necessities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; of the <hi>dead</hi> and the <hi>living;</hi> of them that are absent, and partake not of it. This we attribute to the Sacrifice of the Cross only; and are perswaded that it cannot, without derogation to the Merits of that most absolute Redemption which was there pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for us, be applied to any other.</p>
                           <p>When we examine the first <hi>Institution</hi> of this holy Communion, we cannot perceive either in the words or action of our Blessed Saviour, any <hi>Sacrifical Act</hi> or <hi>Expression.</hi>

                              <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is positive, that either Christ sacrificed <hi>in Eating,</hi> or there is no other action in which he can <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> be said to have done it. Yet even this the greatest part of that Communion reject; because <hi>Eating</hi> is not <hi>Offering:</hi> and in the Ordination where the Priest receives the power of <hi>Sacrificing,</hi> not any mention is made of it. In Effect, Reason will tell us, That this is to <hi>partake of the Offering,</hi> not <hi>to offer it;</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36811:57"/>
                              <hi>de Meaux</hi> himself accordingly distinguishes the Two Acts of <hi>Consecration</hi> and <hi>Manducation</hi> from one another, and refers the Sacrifice wholly to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
                           <p>If we consider the Nature of <hi>a true and proper Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> they universally agree, that these Four Things are necessarily required to it: 1. That what is Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be something that is <hi>Visible:</hi> 2. That <hi>of prophane,</hi> which it was before, it be now made <hi>sacred:</hi> 3. That it be <hi>offered to God:</hi> And 4. by that <hi>offering</hi> suffer an <hi>essential destruction.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now we suppose, that the greatest part of these Conditions are evidently wanting to this pretended Sacrifice of Christs Body in the <hi>Mass.</hi> 1. It is <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:</hi> They confess it. 2. It was never <hi>prophane,</hi> that it should be made <hi>sacred:</hi> They will not presume to say that it was. 3. It suffers no <hi>Essential destruction:</hi> 
                              <q>The Blood is not spilt but in a Mystery, <hi>says Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur</hi> de Meaux, nor is there any Death but in Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>As therefore none of these things <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> agree to this holy Eucharist, so we suppose, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly a Sacrifice.</hi> We are perswaded, that the <hi>Offering</hi> its self, like the <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>essential Properties</hi> of it, must be only in <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Representation.</hi> This is what we willingly allow Monsieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and what their own Principles do undoubtedly prove.</p>
                           <p>For what our Saviour adds, <q>Do this in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Me:</q> However the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has Canonically resolved it to be the Institution of a true and proper <hi>Priesthood,</hi> to offer this Sacrifice; yet that it has no such Proof, the preceding Discourse <note place="margin">

                              <hi>ARTICLE XXI.</hi> Of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>THE Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> so clearly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes our Doctrine, in Opposition to the pretended Sacrifice of <hi>the Mass,</hi> that Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> had certainly reason to enter on a particular consideration of it. We will, after his Example, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the same Method, and shew the whole Design of that Sacred Book to be directly contrary to the Principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> observes, that the Author of this Epistle concludes, that there ought not only <hi>no other Victim to be offered for sin after that of Christ, but that even Christ himself ought not to be any more Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</hi> Now, the reason which the Apostle gives, is this; Because that otherwise, says he, <hi>Christ must of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 25, 26.</note> 
                              <hi>have suffered:</hi> Plainly implying, that there can be no <hi>true Offering</hi> without <hi>Suffering.</hi> So that in the <hi>Mass</hi> then, either Christ must <hi>Suffer,</hi> which Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> denies, or he is not <hi>Offered,</hi> which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
                           <p>This is so evidently the meaning of that place, and so often repeated, <q>That without Bloud, there is <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> no Remission;</q> that Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is forced
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36811:58"/>
freely to declare, that if we take the word <hi>Offer</hi> as it is used in that Epistle, they must profess to the whole World, that Christ is no more <hi>Offered,</hi> either in the Mass, or any other way. Now, how these things can stand together, that the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> contradicts not the Offering of the Mass, and yet that the same Epistle absolutely declares, that Christ can no more be <hi>Offered,</hi> because he can no more <hi>Suffer;</hi> nor any more become <hi>a Propitiatory Sacrifice,</hi> because <hi>without Bloud there is no Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> All which Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> allows, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to the whole World, that in the Notion of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews, Christ is not offered</hi> in the Mass, nor can be any where else, we are not very well able to comprehend.</p>
                           <p>But that Epistle goes yet further. It tells us, that Christ ought to be but once offered, because <q>
                                 <hi>by that one Offering he has fully satisfied for our sins,</hi> and <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14.</note> 
                                 <hi>has perfected for ever them that are Sanctified.</hi>
                              </q> If therefore by that <hi>first Offering</hi> he hath fully satisfied for our sins, there is then <q>
                                 <hi>no more need of any Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for sin:</hi> If by that <hi>first Sacrifice he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Ibid.</hi> v. 18.</note> 
                                 <hi>for ever them that are Sanctified,</hi> 
                              </q>the Mass cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly must be altogether needless to make any addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that which is already perfect. In a word, if <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Ibid.</hi> v. 2.</note> the Sacrifices of the Law were therefore repeated, as this Epistle tells us, because they were <hi>imperfect;</hi> and had they been otherwise, they should have ceased to have been offered. What can we conclude, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then, in every Mass she Offers, does violence to the <hi>Cross of Christ;</hi> and in more than one sense, <hi>Crucifies to her self the Lord of Glory.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Lastly, The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is a new and proper <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to be offered,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36811:58"/>
it was necessary that our Saviour Christ should insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a new and proper <hi>Priesthood</hi> to offer it. And so they say he did, after the <hi>Order of Melchisedeck,</hi> in <note place="margin">Hebr. 7. 3.</note> opposition to that after the <hi>order of Aaron</hi> under the Law. Now certainly nothing can be more contrary to this Epistle than such an assertion: Both whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of this Priesthood shews it can agree only to our Blessed Lord; and which indeed in express terms declares it to be peculiar to him. It calls it <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeble</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">

                              <hi>Priesthood,</hi> that passes not to any other, as that of <hi>Aaron</hi> did from Father to Son, but continues in him only, because that he also himself continues for evermore.</p>

                           <p>ANd here then let us conjure our Brethren of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> seriously to consider these things; and into what desperate consequences that great Errour of the <hi>Corporeal presence</hi> has insensibly led them.</p>
                           <p>Can any thing be more rash or more uncharitable, even the Literal interpretation of this Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist being allow'd, than their <hi>Canon of Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>substantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> To cut off from their Communion the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most Orthodox part of the Christian Church, only for a Nicety; <hi>a manner of presence,</hi> which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has the Scripture any where revealed, and which they themselves never understood.</p>

                              <pb n="70" facs="tcp:36811:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Is it possible for men to fall into a grosser or more dangerous Error, than to set up a <hi>Wafer</hi> for their <hi>God,</hi> and pay a divine Worship <hi>to a Morsel of Bread?</hi> Shall their good Intentions secure them? Had not the <hi>Israelites</hi> a good Intention to <q>hold a feast unto <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 5.</note> 
                                 <hi>the Lord,</hi>
                              </q>  when they Worshipped the Molten Calf? Were they therefore not <hi>Idolaters</hi> for it? Had this been a sufficient excuse, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> had not been punished: Their intention was certainly good <hi>to burn Incence to the Lord.</hi> The Jews had a good <note place="margin">Lev. 10.</note> intention even in <hi>Crucifying the Lord of glory:</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it Zeal to presecute his Disciples. Our Blessed Saviour has foretold, and we live to see it accomplished, that the time should come when Men should <hi>kill their Brethren, and think they did God good service.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may do well to <note place="margin">Joh. 16. 2.</note> consider whether their good intention will justifie them that do it; and whether both in this, and that, they do not run a desperate hazard, if it appear that they have no other plea than a well meant mistake to excuse them.</p>
                           <p>For our parts we must needs profess that these things give us not only a scandal but a horrour for their Religion. Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> had certainly reason to say, that this is the <hi>Chiefest</hi> and <hi>most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> of all our controversies, and wherein we are at the farthest distance from one another. And would to God they had only offended us by these Errours; and had not exposed our common Name to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the very Heathen; who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by them in their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and thought it more rational to adore a Stock or a Stone, than with the Christians to Worship this moment what they Eat the very next.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="71" facs="tcp:36811:59"/>
But Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> thinks we have no reason to appear so obstinate against them, who declare our selves so favourably towards the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who yet are involved in the same Error. Tis true we believe the <hi>Lutherans</hi> mistaken in their Literal interpretation of this Holy Sacrament. But we are perswaded they are infinitely less so, and less dangerously than the Papists.</p>
                           <p>They confess that there is no change made in the <hi>Substance of the Sacred Elements.</hi> They believe that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> continue in their proper Natures, and that Christs Body is present only when he is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. They <hi>adore not the Holy Eucharist:</hi> They <hi>found no Propitiatory Sacrifices upon it:</hi> They <hi>say no Masses for the sins and satisfactions, for the wants and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Dead and the Living:</hi> They <hi>deny not the Cup to the People;</hi> their Errour in one word, whatsoever it be, is only a matter of simple belief; has no ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences attending it, nor do they damn us for not receiving it.</p>
                           <p>Let the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do all this: Let them raze their <hi>Anathema</hi>'s out of their Councils, and banish their Masses and Adorations out of their Churches; Let them no longer scandalize us with any unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table practices, nor desire to enslave our Consciences by submitting them to their own inventions; and though we shall still think <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to be the greater Error, yet will we receive them with the same charity we do the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> We will pray to God to give them a better understanding, but will not drive them from our Communion, for matters of simple belief, and which are only to themselves, tho' they be wrong.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="72" facs="tcp:36811:60"/>
But till then, in vain do's Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us to consider the ways of providence to bring us to a Union, which God knows we could be glad to have on any terms but the loss of truth. In the mean time if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in good earnest thinks, that as we tolerate the foundation of all these Errours, <hi>the Corporeal presence</hi> in the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> so we ought to bear the consequences of it in them: Let them at least do what the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have done; let them embrace our Communion; let them leave off to persecute us where they have power, and damn us where they have not; let them receive us as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, not Lord it over us as our Masters. This will make us hope that they are sincere when they conjure us to be at peace with them, and they may justly then accuse us of partiality, if we continue to repute them as Enemies, when they will be thus content to love, and receive, and deal with us as friends.</p>

                           <p>Had Christ esteemed it sufficient for us to receive <hi>the Blood in the body,</hi> we suppose he would not have consecrated <hi>the Cup afterwards.</hi> But if it was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's pleasure, that to commemorate the more lively his Passion, we should take his <hi>Blood</hi> as it was spilt for our Redemption, separate from his <hi>Body;</hi> we think

                           <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> therefore ought not to charge us as Enemies to Tradition, or obstinate, to receive what is so delivered. Our Church rejects not <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but only <hi>those things which they pretend to have received by it:</hi> But which we suppose to be so far from being the Doctrine of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or of <hi>All Churches</hi> in <hi>All Ages,</hi> that we are perswaded they are many of them directly contrary to the <hi>Written Word,</hi> which is by Themselves confessed to be the Apostles Doctrine, and which the best and purest Ages of the Church adhered to.</p>

                              <hi>ARTICLE XXV.</hi> Of the Churches Authority.</head>
                           <p>THE Church; <hi>i. e. The Universal Church in All Ages,</hi> having been Establish'd by God, the Guardian of the Holy Scriptures, and of Tradition, we receive from her the <hi>Canonical Books of Scripture.</hi> It is upon this Authority, that we receive principally the <hi>Song of Solomon</hi> as Canonical, and reject other Books as Apochryphal, which we might perhaps with as much readiness otherwise receive. By this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36811:62"/>
we reverence these Books, <hi>even before by our own reading of them, we perceive the Spirit of God in them:</hi> And when by our reading them, we find all things conformable to so Excellent a <hi>Spirit,</hi> we are yet more confirmed in the belief and reverence we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had of them.</p>
                           <p>This Authority therefore we freely allow the Church, that by her hands in the succession of the several Ages, we have received the Holy Scriptures. And if as <hi>universal and uncontroverted a Tradition</hi> had descended for the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the Scriptures, as for the <hi>receiving</hi> of them, we should have been as ready to accept of that too. Such a declaration of the sense of Holy Scripture as had been received by <hi>all Churches,</hi> and in <hi>all Ages,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> would never refuse: But then as we profess not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Scriptures themselves <hi>only,</hi> or perhaps <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally</hi> upon the <hi>Authority of the Roman Church,</hi> which has in all Ages made up but <hi>a part,</hi> and that not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>the greatest</hi> neither, of this <hi>Tradition;</hi> so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we think it reasonable to receive the sense of them only from her, though she profess never so much, to invent nothing of her self, but only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, the <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> made to her by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which she supposes has been given to her for her direction: Whilst we are perswaded, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has any Promise at all been made to any <hi>particular Church</hi> of such an infallible direction; and have such good cause to believe that this particular Church too often, instead of the divine Revelations, declares only her own Inventions.</p>
                           <p>When the dispute arose about the <hi>Ceremonies of the Law,</hi> Acts 15. the Apostles assembled at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for the determination of it. When any Doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36811:63"/>
in the Church now, we always esteem it the best Method to decide them after the same manner. That the Church has Authority not only in matters of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Discipline,</hi> but even of <hi>Faith</hi> too, we never deny'd: But that therefore any Church so assembled, can with the same Authority say now, as the Apostles did then, <q>It has seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to <note place="margin">Acts 15. 28.</note> Us:</q> This we think not only an unwarrantable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, for which there is not any sufficient ground in Holy Scripture, but evidently in its self untrue, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many such Councils are by the Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confessed to have erred.</p>
                           <p>Hence it is that we cannot suppose it reasonable to forbid Men the Examination of the <hi>Churches Decisions,</hi> which <hi>may err,</hi> when the <hi>Holy Apostles,</hi> nay <hi>our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ</hi> himself, not only permitted, but exhorted their Disciples to search the Truth of their Doctrine, which was certainly <hi>Infallible.</hi> Yet if the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be matter of Order or Government, as <hi>not to Eat of things offered to Idols,</hi> &amp;c. or of plain and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Precept, as <q>to abstain from Fornication,</q> and the like: Here we fail not after the Example of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> to declare to the faithful what her decision has been; and instead of permitting them to judg of what has been so resolved, teach them throughout all places <q>to keep the Ordinances of the Apostles.</q> 
                              <note place="margin">Acts 16. 4.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus is it that we acquiesce in the judgment of the Church; and professing in our Creed a <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> we profess to believe not only that there was a Church planted by our Saviour at the beginning, that has hitherto been preserved by him, and ever shall be to the end of the World; but do by consequence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly believe too, that this <hi>Universal Church</hi> is so secured by the Promises of Christ, that there shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36811:63"/>
be retain'd so much Truth in it, the want of which would argue that there could be no such Church. We do not fear that ever the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> should fall into this <hi>entire Infidelity:</hi> But that any <hi>particular Church,</hi> such as that of <hi>Rome,</hi> may not either by Error lose, or by other means prevaricate the Faith, even in the <hi>necessary Points</hi> of it; this we suppose not to be at all contrary to the Promise of God Almighty, and we wish we had not too great cause to fear, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has in effect done both.</p>
                           <p>It is not therefore of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such, that we either fear this <hi>infidelity,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that she hath endeavoured to render her self <hi>Mistress of our Faith.</hi> But for that particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to which Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is pleased to give the Name, tho she professes never so much to submit her self to the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and to follow the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Fathers in <hi>all Ages;</hi> yet whilst she usurps the absolute Interpretation both of Scripture and Fathers, and forbids us to examine whether she does it rightly or no, we must needs complain that her Protestations are invalid, whilst her Actions speak the contrary: For that if this be not to render her self <hi>Mistress of our Faith,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive what is.</p>
                           <p>In a word, tho we suppose the Scriptures are so clearly written, that it can very hardly happen, that in the <hi>necessary Articles of Faith</hi> any one man should be found opposite to the whole Church in his Opinion: Yet if such a one were <hi>evidently convinced</hi> that his Belief was founded upon the undoubted Authority of Gods Holy Word, so far would it be from any <hi>Horror</hi> to support it, that it is at this day the greatest
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36811:64"/>
glory of S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that he stood up alone against <hi>the whole World</hi> in defence of <hi>Christs Divinity,</hi> when the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Councils,</hi> the <hi>whole Church</hi> fell away.</p>
                           <p>Conclude we therefore, that God, who has made us, and knows what is best and most proper for us, as he has subjected us to the Government and Direction of his <hi>Church</hi> for our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Welfare,</hi> so to secure our <hi>Faith,</hi> he has given us his Holy Word, to be the <hi>last resort,</hi> the <hi>final, infallible Rule,</hi> by which both we and the Church its self must be directed: And from this therefore if any one shall endeavour to turn us aside, or preach any other Gospel unto us than what we have therein received, tho he were an <hi>Apostle</hi> from <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 8, 9.</note> the Grave, or even an <hi>Angel</hi> from Heaven, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi>

                           <p>FOR the two last Articles of Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Exposition, I might very well have pass'd them by. The Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose Doctrine I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to explain, is but very little concerned in them. Therefore only in a word, That we allow the Church a just <hi>Authority</hi> in matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> both the declaration of our <hi>xxth. Article,</hi> and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription we make to the whole 39 shew: Such a deference we allow to her decisions, that we make them our directions what Doctrine we may, or may

not, publickly maintain and teach in her Communion: In effect, we shew whatever Submission we can to her <hi>Authority,</hi> without violating <hi>that of God,</hi> declared to us in his <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Whatsoever deference we allow to a <hi>National Church or Council,</hi> the same we think in a much greater degree due to a <hi>General.</hi> And whensoever such a one, which we much desire, shall be freely and lawfully assembled, to determine the Differences of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> none shall be more ready both to assist in it, and submit to it.</p>

                           <p>We firmly believe <hi>the Holy Scriptures,</hi> and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they teach or command, we receive and submit to, as to the Word of God.

                           <p>You command us <hi>to pray to Saints and Angels:</hi> Does <note place="margin">Article 3. Col. 2. v. 18. Rev. 19. 10.—22. 9.</note> not St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbid it?

Men and Brethren: Consider, we conjure you, these things: And if you please, consider us too, what we are, and what our Manners and Conversation among you has been: Believe us, at least, that we have no other End but Truth in these Enquiries: No other Interest but to save our souls, and go the surest and directest way to Heaven.</p>
                           <p>The Proofs we offer, they are not vain Conjectures; they are clear, we think, convincing Arguments. And though the design of this little Treatise has been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shew you what our Doctrine is, than to give a just account of those Reasons that detain us in it: Yet perhaps even in this there may be somewhat to shew, that we do not altogether build in the Air; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve certainly to have our <hi>Articles</hi> and our <hi>Canons,</hi> both better understood, and better answer'd, if it may be, than they have ever hitherto been.</p>
                           <p>For to resume yet once more some few of our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
                           <p>You think you ought <hi>to invocate the Blessed Virgin and the Holy Saints.</hi> Now not to repeat what we have <note place="margin">Article 3.</note> before said of the <hi>Unlawfulness</hi> of it, This we suppose to be first <hi>needless,</hi> because we know we have a more excellent and powerful Media or, that has commanded us to come to him; and next <hi>Uncertain,</hi> because you are not able to tell us how, nay, not to secure us that by whatever way it be, our Prayers do always and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come up to them. If we are mistaken, at least we run no hazard in it: We address our selves continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Throne of Grace, where we are secure that we shall be both heard and answer'd. But now should you err, consider we beseech you how many Prayers you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day lose, and what a dishonour you put upon your divine Mediator. And if you please, consider too how
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36811:66"/>
unjust you are to damn us for not joyning with you in a practice, that has <hi>so great danger, so little assurance, and not any advantage.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>You suppose we ought <hi>to fall down before your Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Article 4.</note> Not to do this is to be sure no sin, you dare not say it is. To do it may be, and you can never secure us it is not abominable <hi>Idolatry,</hi> odious to God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that holy Faith into which we have been Baptized.</p>
                           <p>You damn us for <hi>doubting of the number of your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

                              <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Has God revealed it to you? Have the Holy Scriptures defined it? Or even Tradition its self delivered it to you. If it be true; Can you yet escape the charge of rashness and uncharitableness, to damn whole Churches for so needless a matter? should it be false, how will you escape that <hi>Anathema</hi> your selves; you have then so falsely as well as uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly denounced against us?</p>
                           <p>You require us to believe <hi>that children dying unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi>

Were it as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident as it is indeed uncertain, and we are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded false; our modesty is safe in <hi>deciding nothing;</hi> the Errour of such among us as believe it not is charitable; founded upon the sure Mercies and Goodness of God, who never inflicts any punishment where there is no fault; and in a word, has not any the least ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence upon it. We take as great care to Baptize our Infants, as you can do who most believe it. But now if your Opinion should be false; What answer will you ever be able to make to God, for <hi>peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining</hi> what was <hi>so uncertain and uncharitable?</hi> and for damning us, only because we dare not venture to cut off those from Christ for whom he died, and whom we hope he will in mercy receive to him?</p>

Lastly, You deny us <hi>the entire Communion;</hi> you <note place="margin">Article 23.</note> pronounce an <hi>Anathema</hi> against us, because we will not confess that one part alone is sufficient. Is it not certain that if we err, we have yet both Christs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and the practice and Opinion of many Ages to absolve us? But have you any thing to excuse you, if you are mistaken? To take it as we do, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess can have no danger, are you sure that to deny it as you do, may not be a Sacriledge?</p>
                           <p>And what shall I say more? For the time would fail me to speak of every one of those <hi>other points</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> mentions, much more to add <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others,</hi> and of no less consequence, which he has thought fit to pass by. In all which we have at least this undenyable advantage over you; that besides the clearest Arguments that we are in the right, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard we run is not very great if we should not be: Whereas for you, neither is there any tolerable proof of the contrary Errours, and an infinite danger should you chance to be mistaken.</p>
                           <p>These things, as both the Character of the Book we have now examined, and the Style of many other your latter most considerable Authors, give us cause to hope, begin to be no longer totally hid from your Eyes; so shall we never cease in all our Prayers to make mention of you, that you may be perfectly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned to discern, and impartially disposed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and to embrace the Truth.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, whilst both you and we mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly address our selves to the <hi>Eternal Truth</hi> for his assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; whilst as we ought, we implore his mercy, that he would give us a right understanding in all things; remembring this that we are all but Men, and that it is not therefore impossible for either of us to err: That it may be strength of Passion, or prejudice of Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

or even vehemency of affection, more than the light of Reason, has hitherto kept us in a too fond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality for our own Opinions: Let us at least, we beseech you, agree in that mutual Charity which alone can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us amidst all our Errours; which will both best dispose Gods mercy to shew us what is right, and will best incline our Minds to that sincerity which we all pretend to, and I hope all really have to embrace it.</p>
                           <p>If we cannot yet agree in all the points of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; let us consider, that neither are the dearest friends entirely of the same opinion in every thing. Let us wait Gods pleasure; if it be his will to <q>reveal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this also unto us: Nevertheless whereunto we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <note place="margin">Philip. 3. 15, 16.</note> attain'd, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.</q> 
                           </p>
                           <p>We believe in the same God; we rely on the same Redeemer; we embrace the same Creeds; we attend the same hopes of an Everlasting Salvation: And in all these, amidst all our other Differences, have at least an entire agreement in what is <hi>most necessary,</hi> and shall we hope to the Honest and sincere among us, <hi>be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our Eternal Security.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Let these things engage us to have the same love too: to be more sparing in our <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, and more zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in our <hi>Prayers</hi> for one another, to seek and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Truth, but to do it so as not to violate our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In a word, whether we write, or speak, to do both as Men who in a little time expect to be brought before a divine Tribunal, where we must render a severe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for all these things; and one Word spoken with this excellent spirit, to close those Divisions that so long have seperated us, shall be preferred to ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Volumes of endless and uncharitable controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, that serve only to widen our breaches, and heigthen our Animosities.</p>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>MY former Treatise of</hi> the Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of England, <hi>has given so full an account of the Occasion and Design of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Meaux'<hi>s Book, as might supersede the Necessity of adding any more upon that subject. But being called to a necessary justification of what I there advanced, not so much by the weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his</hi> Vindicator, <hi>embarqued with him in the same Cause; as by the flat denial of</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>himself, of the principal foundation on which that Account was built; I hope I shall need no great Apologie, if upon this Occasion I enter somewhat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon a</hi> new History <hi>than might otherwise seem absolutely necessary for my defence, and by comparing this</hi> method of Expounding <hi>with some others of a different Nature, which have of late been sent abroad by those of the</hi> Roman <hi>Communion, endeavour to shew what the real intent of them all has been; and what the design of those who now pursue the same</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod <hi>among us, may reasonably be supposed to be.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>It is I presume at this time not unknown to any, what great Endeavours have been used in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nation, for the reducing of those of the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion <hi>to the</hi> Roman Communion. <hi>And
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:36811:72"/>
it must be confess'd indeed, they have omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that</hi> Language <hi>and</hi> Sophistry <hi>could be made to do, for the Attainment of so great an End.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>The</hi> Jansenists <hi>were some of the first who began this work: and it is not to be doubted but that Persons of their avow'd reputation in point of Learning, and who seem'd to have had this means only left them to regain the favour of their King, whose design they pursu'd; would be sure to offer something worthy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and proportionable at once both to the</hi> Work <hi>it self, and to their</hi> Engagements <hi>to it.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>The first Attempt they made was a little piece, that has since given Occasion to a very long Controversie between</hi> Monsieur Arnauld <hi>and</hi> Monsieur Claude; <note place="margin">La perpetuité de la foy de l'Eglise Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, touchant l'Eucharistie. Ann. 1664.</note> of the Perpetuity of the Faith as to the real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist. <hi>A Tract which if we regard only the neatness and subtilty of the composure, it must be avow'd scarce any thing ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd more worthy that Applause it met with in the World: And the design, though express'd in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular only, yet so applicable to all the rest; that were the Argument good, the</hi> Church of Rome <hi>would have needed no other defence for all the corruptions that had, or could possibly creep into it.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>But the</hi> Sophistry <hi>of this</hi> method <hi>has been suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently exposed in the Volumes composed on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And indeed without entring on a particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, any Mans own reason will tell him at first sight, that a</hi> Logical subtilty <hi>advanced against</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, <hi>may be worth the considering for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity of the undertaking, but like the Philosopher's Argument against Motion, will never be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any, but such as want<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                                 <hi>In effect, the design of this first</hi> Method <hi>amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thus much; That</hi> Transubstantiation <hi>(and the same might have been said of any other point in dispute) was visibly once the common Doctrine of the Church: And 'tis impossible it should have been so then, had it ever been otherwise before.

                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>And the same is the design of the late</hi> peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able method <hi>set forth by</hi> Monsieur Maimbourg; <hi>in which from the</hi> Authority <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>in</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, <hi>confess'd, as he says, by us, he proves, That the</hi> Church, <hi>in which both parties once were, must then have had this</hi> Authority <hi>over us all; and to whose decision in</hi> the Council of Trent, <hi>we all by consequence ought to submit.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>

                                 <hi>It is not necessary that I should here say any thing to shew the</hi> Weakness <hi>and</hi> Sophistry <hi>of these several</hi> Methods: <hi>That has been the business of those particular Examinations, that have with success enough been made of them. This I suppose may at first sight appear upon the bare proposal of them, That they have more of</hi> Ingenuity <hi>than of</hi> Solidity <hi>in them; and were, no doubt, designed by their</hi> Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>to catch the</hi> unwary <hi>with a plausible shew of that Reason, which the</hi> Wise <hi>and</hi> Judicious <hi>know them to be defective in.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>How far we may conclude from hence, as to the</hi> Nature <hi>and</hi> Design <hi>of</hi> Monsieur de Meaux's Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I shall leave it to others to consider. This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable, That as it came out at a time when these kind of</hi> Methods <hi>were all in repute, and with a design to help forward the same great business of Conversion then in agitation; so has it been cry'd up by those of that Communion as exceeding all others in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that End; and if we may believe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, been above all others the most happy and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful in it.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>It is not easie to conceive that a Person of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Meaux'<hi>s Learning, should seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That a bare</hi> Exposition <hi>of their</hi> Doctrine <hi>should be sufficient to convince us of the truth of it. He could not but know that our first</hi> Reformers <hi>were Persons abundantly qualified to understand the real profession of a</hi> Church <hi>in which they had been born and bred; and in which many of them were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to</hi> holy Orders, Priests <hi>and</hi> professors of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Nor is the</hi> Council of Trent <hi>so rare or so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure, that a meer</hi> Exposition <hi>of its</hi> Doctrine <hi>should work such effects, as neither the</hi> Council <hi>nor its</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:36811:74"/>
                                 <hi>were able to do. In a word</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>himself confesses, His design was to represent his</hi> Church <hi>as favourably as he could; to take off that</hi> 
                                 <q>hideous and terrible form in which the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, <hi>he says,</hi> were wont to represent Popery <note place="margin">Advertisment Pag. 2, 4.</note> in their Pulpits, and expose it in its natural dress, free from those frightful Idea's, <hi>in which it had so long been disguised by them.</hi>
                                 </q> 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>One would imagine by this discourse that the whole business of the</hi> Ministers <hi>of the</hi> Reformed Religion, <hi>was to do nothing but invent new</hi> Monsters <hi>every day, and lay them to the</hi> Church of Rome: <hi>And that after all our pretences to</hi> Peace <hi>and</hi> Union, <hi>we were really such Enemies to it, that we did all we could, even by</hi> Lies <hi>and</hi> Calumnies, <hi>to keep both our selves and the people from it. But indeed these</hi> hideous Idea's Monsieur de Meaux <hi>speaks of, if they are such false representations as he pretends, they are not the</hi> Ministers <hi>that invent them; but their own greatest</hi> Zealots, <hi>their</hi> Schoolmen, <hi>their</hi> Bishops, <hi>their</hi> Cardinals; <hi>nay their very</hi> Popes <hi>themselves that have been the</hi> Authors <hi>of them.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>How far</hi> Monsieur de Meaux's Exposition <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from what they have delivered us as the</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>of their</hi> pretended Catholick Church, <hi>has been in some measure shewn already, and shall in the following Discourse be more fully evidenced. And whosoever shall please to consider the</hi> Elogies <hi>and</hi> Approbations, <hi>which these Men have received, no less than</hi> Monsieur de Meaux, <hi>will be forced to confess it to be at least a disputable point, Whether the</hi> Ministers, <hi>from these</hi> Authors, <hi>have represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their</hi> Church <hi>in a</hi> hideous <hi>and</hi> terrible form; <hi>or whether</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>rather has not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:36811:74"/>
of</hi> removing the Visor <hi>to shew her in her</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural dress, <hi>a little varnish'd over her Face to hide her</hi> defects, <hi>and make her appear more</hi> charming <hi>and</hi> attractive <hi>than her own</hi> natural deformity <hi>would otherwise permit her to do.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Now of this a more convincing proof cannot, I think, be desired, than what I before advanced, and see no reason yet to retract; viz.</hi> 
                                 <q>That out of an <note place="margin">Exposit. Pag. 3.</note> extraordinary desire of palliating, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded so far, as in several points wholly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Doctrine of his Church. Insomuch that when his Book was sent to some of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> for their approbation, they corrected so many places in it, that <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> was forced to suppress the whole Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and change those places that had been mark'd by them, and put out a new and more correct Impression, as the first that had ever been made of it.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>This</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>is pleased to deny as an utter falsity;</hi> 
                                 <q>For that he never sent his Book <note place="margin">Vindicat. Pag. 8, 9.</note> to the <hi>Sorbonne;</hi> that their custom is not to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense Books in Body; and that that Venerable company knows better what is due to Bishops, who are naturally and by their Character the true Doctors of the Church, than to think they have need of the Approbation of her <hi>Doctors. In a word,</hi> that it is a manifest falsity to say that a first <hi>Edition</hi> of his Book was suppress'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> had something to say against it. That he never did publish, nor cause to be printed, any other <hi>Edition</hi> than that which is in the hands of every one, to which he never added nor diminish'd one syllable;
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:36811:75"/>
nor ever fear'd that any Catholick Doctor could find any thing in it worthy of reprehension.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>This is indeed a severe charge against me, and such, as, if true, it cannot be doubted, but that I have been as great a</hi> Calumniator <hi>as his</hi> Vindicator <hi>has thought fit to represent me; or, as for ought I know,</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>himself will be in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputed if it should be false. And therefore to satisfie the World in this</hi> main, fundamental point <hi>between us, I do hereby solemnly declare,</hi> 
                                 <q>That there was an Impression of the Exposition, such as I spake of; That out of it I transcribed with my own hand, the several Changes and Alterations that are placed at the end of my <hi>Preface;</hi> That this <hi>Book,</hi> with these differences is at this time in the hands of the Reverend <hi>Editor</hi> of my former <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,</hi> and that whosoever of either <hi>Communion</hi> is pleased to Examine them, may when ever he will have free liberty so to do.</q>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>This I the rather declare, because</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>is so positive in it, as to charge me with no less than the pure</hi> Invention <hi>of those</hi> passages <hi>I have cited from it.</hi> 
                                 <q>As for those passages, <hi>says he,</hi> which <note place="margin">Vindicat. Pag. 12, 13.</note> they pretend I have corrected in a second <hi>Edition</hi> for fear of offending the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> it is as you see a <hi>Chimerical Invention;</hi> and I do here once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, That I neither publish'd, nor connived at, nor caused to be made, any <hi>Edition</hi> of my Book, but that which is well known, in which I never altered any thing.</q>
                                 <hi>For answer to which I must beg leave once more to repeat it too;</hi>  
                                 <q>
                                    <hi>That these</hi> passages <hi>are for the most part</hi> Chimerical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions <hi>indeed, but yet such as He once hoped to have put off as</hi> the Doctrine of his Church, <hi>and as
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:36811:75"/>
such sent them into the World, in that</hi> first Edition <hi>we are speaking of; out of which I have transcribed them in as just and proper terms as I was able to put them in; and I appeal to any one, that shall please to examine them, for the truth and sincerity that I have used in it.</hi>
                                 </q> 
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>But here</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>has got an</hi> Evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>which, if not prevented, may in some Mens Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion take off this seeming</hi> contradiction <hi>betwixt us, and leave us both at last for the main in the right!</hi> 
                                 <q>'Tis true, <hi>says he,</hi> this little Treatise being at first given in Writing to some particular Persons for their Instruction, many Copies of it were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, and IT WAS PRINTED with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my Order or Knowledge. No body found fault with the Doctrine contain'd in it; and I my self without changing any thing in it of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and that only as to the Order, and for the greater neatness of the Discourse and Stile, caused it to be printed as you now see.</q> 
                                 <hi>So that now then it is at last confess'd that an</hi> Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>there was, such as I charged them with, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent very much from what we now have.</hi> 
                                 <q>
                                    <hi>But that it was an</hi> Edition <hi>printed without</hi> Monsieur de Meaux'<hi>s Knowledge; and the</hi> changes <hi>which he made afterwards were only as to the</hi> Order, <hi>and</hi> for the greater neatness of the Discourse and Stile.</q>

                                 <hi>If to strike out totally in several places, Positions that were absolutely of</hi> Doctrine, <hi>or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise very material to the</hi> Points <hi>that were so; as in several instances it appears he has done; If this were indeed only for the</hi> advantage of the Order, <hi>and for</hi> the greater neatness of the Discourse and Stile, <hi>I am contented.

                                 <hi>And thus far we can go certainly in Reply to his Allegations, beyond a possibility of denial: For what remains, though I do not pretend to the like Evidence of</hi> Fact, <hi>yet I will offer some Reasons why I cannot assent to his pretences even there neither.</hi>

                                 <hi>That the</hi> Impression <hi>was made with</hi> Monsieur de Meaux'<hi>s Knowledge, if not by his express</hi> Order, <hi>whoever shall consider the circumstances of</hi> Monsieur Cramoisy <hi>who printed it, either as a Person of his</hi> Reputation <hi>and</hi> Estate; <hi>or as</hi> Directour of the King's Imprimerie; <hi>or finally as</hi> Monsieur de Meaux'<hi>s own</hi> Bookseller; <hi>will hardly believe that he would so far affront a</hi> Bishop <hi>of his</hi> Church, <hi>and one especially of</hi> Monsieur de Meaux'<hi>s interest and authority at that time at</hi> Court; <hi>as to make a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitious</hi> Edition <hi>of a Book, which he might have had the</hi> Author's <hi>leave to publish only for the asking.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>But further: This pretended surreptitious</hi> Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>had the</hi> Kings Permission <hi>to it, which could hardly
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:36811:76"/>
have been obtain'd without</hi> Monsieur de Meaux'<hi>s knowledge. It was</hi> approved <hi>by the</hi> Bishops of France <hi>in the very same terms that the other</hi> Editions <hi>have been since; which seems more natural to have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>himself, than by a</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>underhand, and without his knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance. In a word, so far was</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>from resenting this injury, of setting out his Book so uncorrectly, and without his leave; that the very same</hi> Cramoisy, <hi>the same Year, Printed</hi> the Exposition <hi>with his leave, and has continued to Print all his other Books ever since; and was never that I could hear of, censured, for such fraudulent dealing, till this time, by the</hi> Bishop <hi>or</hi> any other. <hi>All which put together, I must beg leave still to believe as I did before; that there was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> a first impression, <hi>which is at length allow'd; but that this</hi> first impression <hi>was not made without</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Meaux's Order <hi>or</hi> Knowledge.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>As for the other</hi> Point, <hi>and I think the only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this matter, concerning the</hi> occasion <hi>I mentioned for the</hi> suppressing <hi>that</hi> first Edition; <hi>the</hi> Reader <hi>may please to know, That a Person by many relations very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with one of the</hi> Mareshal de Turenne'<hi>s Family, upon the publishing of the</hi> pretended first Edition <hi>of</hi> Monsieur de Meaux's Exposition, <hi>first discover'd to him the mystery of the former, and shew'd him out of the</hi> Mareshal's Library <hi>the</hi> very Book <hi>which, as he then assured him, had been mark'd by some of the</hi> Doctors of the Sorbonne, <hi>and lent it him for some time as a great</hi> Curiosity. <hi>The knowledge of this raised the desire of endeavouring, if it were possible, to retrieve a</hi> Copy <hi>of it: But the</hi> Edition <hi>was so carefully dispatch'd, that the most that could be done was to get so many scatter'd Sheets of it, as to make at last a perfect Book, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:36811:77"/>
in some few places in which it was transcribed from the</hi> Original <hi>of the</hi> Mareshal, <hi>word for word, page for page, and examined by the Person himself, who was so kind as to bestow it on me.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>This is the</hi> Book <hi>to which I refer the</hi> Reader; <hi>and for this I have the</hi> Attestation <hi>of the same Person un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, at the beginning of the Book; that it is in every part a perfect Copy of</hi> Monsieur de Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne'<hi>s mark'd by the</hi> Sorbonne Doctors; <hi>and I have been besides so just to</hi> Monsieur de Meaux, <hi>as to cite scarce any thing out of those places that were in the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript <hi>part, but have chosen such rather where the printed</hi> Copy <hi>gave me full</hi> Assurance <hi>and</hi> Authority <hi>to do it.</hi>

                                 <hi>or</hi> omitted <hi>in the following</hi> Impressions: <hi>viz.</hi> 
                                 <q>That the Bishop in that Edition had been so far from proposing the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> loosely and favourably, as I pretend; that on the contrary he rather proposed it with too much strictness: <hi>In a word,</hi> that he had been so far from perverting the Doctrine of the Church, that I was not able to propose one Doctrine so perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without a forced interpretation of my own, according to my wonted way of turning all things to a wrong intention.</q>

                                 <hi>As to the first of which, no one ever charged the</hi> Bishop <hi>with proposing the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Church of Rome <hi>loosely and favourably</hi> in every point. <hi>We know well enough that in some, he has kept to the

plain</hi> Doctrine <hi>of his</hi> Church, <hi>as in that of the</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist: <hi>in others proposed it rather with too much strictness, as</hi> in the case of Infants dying unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: <hi>All we say is, that in some other</hi> Articles, <hi>such as the</hi> Invocation of Saints, Worshipping of Images, Sacrifice of the Mass, <hi>&amp;c. he had expounded it more</hi> loosely <hi>and favourably than he ought to have done, and that without any</hi> gloss <hi>or</hi> interpretation <hi>of mine to</hi> turn things to a wrong intention.</p>

                                 <p>But <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Unsincerity</hi> are now the <hi>Catholick cry:</hi> And to make it good against me, I am charged in this one <hi>Article</hi> to have been guilty of both. <q>My <note place="margin">Vindicat. pag. 23.</note> Introduction is Calumny in a high degree, and my state of the Question, drawn from thence, as unsincere.</q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>

                                       <hi>I tell them,</hi> he says, <hi>of adoring Men and Women, Crosses, Images,</hi> and <hi>Reliques; of setting up their own Merits, and making other propitiatory sacrifices for sin than that of the Cross: And that these are all contrary to their pretended principles, that Religious worship is due to God only; That we are to be saved only by Christ's Merits, and that the death of Christ was a perfect sacrifice.</hi> 
                                    </q>The <hi>Logick</hi> of which he is content to own, that the <hi>Consequence</hi> is <hi>good,</hi> but the <hi>Accusation,</hi> he says, is <hi>false,</hi> and the <hi>charge, Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatory.</hi>

                                    <hi>the Question,</hi> which I propose in these terms; <q>
                                       <hi>That we who have been so often charged by the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>as Innovators in Religion, are at last by their own confession allow'd to hold the antient and undoubted foundation of the Christian Faith; And that the Question therefore between us is not,</hi> Whether what we hold, be true? <hi>But whether those things which the Roman Church has added as superstructures to it, and which as such we reject, be not so far from being necessary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, as they pretend, that they do indeed overthrow that truth which is on both sides allowed to be divine, and upon that account ought to be forsaken by them?</hi>
                                    </q>

                                    <q>This the <hi>Vindicator</hi> says, <hi>is to state the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>

                                    </q>Let us see therefore what the  <hi>Old way of stating</hi> it is, and wherein the <hi>insincerity</hi> he charges me with, consists.</p>
                                 <p>The true state of the Question betwixt us, he <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 25.</note> says, is, <q>
                                       <hi>Whether the Protestants or Papists do</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novate? <hi>The Protestants in refusing to believe those Doctrines which the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to have received with the grounds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, or the</hi> Papists <hi>in maintaining their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session: And the dispute is,</hi> Whether <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36811:86"/>
ought to maintain their possession, for which,</hi> he says, <hi>many Protestants themselves grant they have a prescription of above 1000 Years? Or whether the Authorities brought by Protestants</hi> 
                                       <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 26.</note> 
                                       <hi>against the Roman Catholick Doctrine be so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that every</hi> Roman Catholick <hi>is obliged to renounce the communion of that Church in which he was bred up, and quit his prescription and possession.</hi>
                                    </q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>In all which the only difference that I can find is this; That He presumes for his <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Question,</hi> I for <hi>mine:</hi> I suppose the <hi>points</hi> in <hi>Controversie</hi> to be <hi>Superstructures</hi> which they have <hi>added</hi> to the <hi>Faith;</hi> He, that they are <hi>Doctrines re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the grounds of Christianity.</hi> In short, the <hi>point</hi> we both put upon the <hi>issue</hi> is precisely the same; <hi>viz. Whether the Roman Catholicks ought to maintain their possessions of these Doctrines, or to quit them as Erroneous? Whether Protestants to embrace the belief and practice of them as true and lawful, or to continue, as they are, separate from the Roman Communion upon the account of them?</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But where then is my <hi>unsincerity?</hi> In this I suppose, that I seem to insinuate as if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> granted that we held the <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>undoubted foundation of the Christian Faith.</hi> What others of that <hi>Communion</hi> will grant, I cannot tell; but whoso shall please to consider <hi>Monsieur de Meaux's</hi> arguing from <hi>Monsieur Daillè</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions as to this Point, will find it clear enough <note place="margin">See his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos. §. 2. p. 2.</note> that he did; if the <hi>Foundation</hi> consists of <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles,</hi> and that we are on both sides agreed in these, as his discourse manifestly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. But the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> jealous for the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> and to have whatever she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36811:86"/>
pass for <hi>Fundamental,</hi> confesses that we do indeed hold a <hi>part,</hi> but not all those <hi>Articles</hi> that are <hi>Fundamental.</hi> This therefore we must put upon the issue, in which we shall not doubt to shew them, that those <hi>Articles</hi> their <hi>Church</hi> has added, are so far from being <hi>Fundamental Truths,</hi> that indeed they are <hi>no Truths at all;</hi> but do by <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>undoubted consequence,</hi> as I before said, and as the <hi>Vindicator</hi> himself confesses, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy those Truths that are on both sides agreed <note place="margin">Vindicat. Pag. 23.</note> to be <hi>Fundamental.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But if I have not mistaken the <hi>Question</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> I am sure the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has that between <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Me.</hi> 
                                    <q>He <note place="margin">Vindicat. pag. 26.</note> tells us our present <hi>Question,</hi> which we are to examine in the following <hi>Articles,</hi> is, <hi>Whether</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>has faithfully proposed the sense of the Church declared in the Council of</hi> Trent? And thereupon asks me, <hi>What it do's avail me to tell them, That I will in the following</hi> Articles <hi>endeavour to give a clear and free Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what we can approve, and what we dislike in their Doctrine?</hi>
                                    </q> To which I reply, That it avails very much to the end I propounded in my Book, <hi>viz.</hi> To give a true <q>
                                       <hi>Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Points proposed by</hi> Monsieur de Meaux.</q> So that in reality the <hi>Question</hi> between us is this, Not whether <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> has given a true <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome, which it has been the business of others to examine; but whether I have given a just account of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church of</hi> England. This was what I undertook to do, and what this <hi>Author</hi> ought, if he could, to have shewn I had not done.</p>

                                       <hi>By what Authority does he condemn these Prayers, these innocent Wishes and holy Raptures, as he calls them, as fond things, vainly invented?</hi> &amp;c.</q>

                                 <p>And now that I have satisfied his <hi>demand,</hi> may I in my turn ask him, Where it is that <hi>I condemn those innocent Wishes, and holy Raptures, of these Fathers, as fond things, vainly invented?</hi> That I do, with our <hi>Church,</hi> censure their <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> as such, is confess'd; but that I pretend to pass any judgment at all upon these <hi>holy Men,</hi> is <hi>false;</hi> nor was it any way <hi>necessary</hi> that I should do it.</p>
                                 <p>As for the <hi>Authority</hi> he requires for our refusal <note place="margin">Vindicat. <hi>p.</hi> 30.</note> of this <hi>Invocation,</hi> it were very easy to shew it, had I nothing to do but to repeat things, that have been so often said already, that the World grows weary of them; and is abundantly satisfied <hi>that they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reply to them.</hi> Every Text of <hi>Scripture</hi> that <hi>appropriates Divine Worship</hi> to <hi>God alone,</hi> is a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi> against them; and that one Passage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10. 14. <hi>How shall they call upon him
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36811:89"/>
in whom they have not believed?</hi> were not Men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be contentious, might end the <hi>Controversy.</hi> And for the <hi>Antiquity</hi> which he speaks of, What can be more ridiculous, than to pretend <hi>prescription</hi> for that which has not the least <hi>foundation,</hi> neither in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> nor <hi>Primitive Christianity;</hi> of which not one Instance appears for the first three hundred Years after <hi>Christ,</hi> but much to the contrary.</p>
                                 <p>He that desires a fuller satisfaction in these Points, may please to recur to that excellent <hi>Treatise</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd, and which may well excuse me that I say no more about it.

upon the Cross for us; and the Honour which we there shew, precisely speaking, and according to the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Stile, is not properly to the</hi> Cross, <hi>but to</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>represented by that Cross.</hi>

In short, He concludes the Doctrine of St.</hi> Thomas <hi>to be in effect the same with Monsieur</hi> de Meaux'<hi>s Exposition, That it is an</hi> Adoration <hi>of</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>represented by the Crucifix, but not an</hi> Adoration <hi>of the</hi> Crucifix <hi>it self.</hi> And the same is the account he gives of the <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical, which he confesses admits of an</hi> Adoration <hi>in the same sense.</hi>

                                       <hi>They,</hi> says the <hi>Council, are to be condemned, who affirm that no Veneration or Honour is due to the Reliques of Saints.</hi>
                                    </q> To this I replied, that <hi>honour</hi> them we do; but that the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> requires more, not only to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> but <hi>worship</hi> them too: so I render their <hi>Venerari,</hi> whether well or ill is now the question.</p>

And again, In his second Objection against this <hi>Conclusion,</hi> he argues against the <hi>Adoration of Reliques</hi> thus; <q>

                                    <p>That both <note n="*" place="margin">As to the Point of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>Belar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to <hi>Friendship:</hi> And then concludes; Cum homines peccant in Deum, <hi>Amicitiam</hi> simul &amp; <hi>Justitiam</hi> Violant. As to the former, Non potest homo Deo satisfacere, &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 1675. the Question is, De satisfactione <hi>quâ Justitiae restauretur Aequalitas.</hi> And because he supposes that the Guilt being remitted, and we received into Friendship with God, the Eternity is thereby taken from the <hi>Pain,</hi> the Question amounts to thus much; An satisfacere possint homines pro expiando reatu illius Poenae qui interdum remanet post remissionem culpae? And whether those Works by which it is done; Sint dicenda <hi>propriè satisfactoria</hi> ita ut nos dicamur <hi>Verè ac propriè</hi> domino <hi>satisfacere.</hi> Now both these he affirms, and explicates the latter from the Council thus, <hi>C. 7. de poenit. lib. 4. p. 1694. l.

But now, Secondly, God's Grace being supposed, he concludes as to <hi>Mortal</hi> Sins, <hi>c. 6. p. 22. n. 58. Nos reipsa nunc satisfacere Deo pro nostro Peccato &amp; Offensâ.</hi> He tells us, that some indeed allow that our <hi>Contrition</hi> may be called a <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> tho not a <hi>sufficient One,</hi> n. 59. Nam qui pro compensatione exhibet id quod potest; licet minus sufficiens illud sit, dicitur <hi>aliquo modo satisfacere.</hi> This Reason <hi>Vasqutz</hi> dislikes; he is content this <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> should be called <hi>Minus sufficiens;</hi> but then only upon the account before mentioned, of its proceeding from the <hi>Grace of God:</hi> So that, Si Contritio praecederet infusionem Gratiae habitualis ex parte Efficientis, non solùm satisfaceret pro maculâ peccati condignè, sed etiam condignè mereretur Gratiae habitualis infusionem. And this he Expounds as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> N. 62, 63, p. 23. As for <hi>Venial Sins,</hi> Disp. 3. c. 3. p. 27.

                                 <p>He adds, lastly, <q>

From which put together, I think we may frame this Argument:</p>
                                 <p>If the Relative <hi>THIS,</hi> in that Proposition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> belong to the <hi>Bread,</hi> so that the meaning is, <hi>This Bread is my Body,</hi> then it must be understood <hi>Figuratively,</hi> or 'tis plainly <hi>absurd and impossible:</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But the <hi>relative This</hi> in that proposition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> does belong to the <hi>Bread,</hi> forasmuch as Christ took <hi>Bread,</hi> and blessed <hi>Bread,</hi> and gave <hi>Bread</hi> to his Disciples, and therefore said of <hi>Bread, This is my Body:</hi> Therefore</p>
                                 <p>That proposition, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <hi>figuratively,</hi> or 'tis plainly <hi>absurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>How far the <hi>Vindicator</hi> will approve this <hi>Logick,</hi> I cannot tell; but the first <hi>proposition</hi> is their common concession, and he himself seems contented with it. The second is <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s own grant, nay what he contends for, and indeed what the connexion of the Words do evidently require: And then for the <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> I believe a very little <hi>Logick</hi> will be enough at any time to make good the sequel of it.</p>
                                 <p>But the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has an Exception against all this, and tells us, <q>
                                       <hi>That it will all argue nothing</hi> 
                                       <note place="margin">Vind. p. 75.</note> 
                                       <hi>against them, unless I beg the Question, and suppose that no real change was made by those words.</hi> 
                                    </q>I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it is as much <hi>a begging of the Question</hi> for him to suppose there was, as for me that there was not. We do not now enquire how to expound the <hi>Proposition,</hi> supposing there were such a change made as they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; but the Question is, <hi>Whether these Words do necessarily imply any such change,</hi> nay, rather do not <hi>oblige</hi> us to take them in a <hi>figurative sense</hi> to shew that there is none?</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="59" facs="tcp:36811:113"/>
However he is resolved he will <hi>suppose</hi> the Question first, and then prove it, tho' I must not. <q>
                                       <hi>We will suppose,</hi> says he, <hi>and that not incongruously, That our Blessed Saviour in changing the Water into Wine, might have made use of these words THIS IS WINE,</hi> or <hi>LET THIS BE WINE.</hi>
                                    </q>  I hope he does not look upon these two to be one and the same. But in short, If our Saviour had said <hi>Let this be Wine,</hi> the meaning must have been, <hi>Let this which is now Water become Wine.</hi> If he had said, <hi>This is Wine,</hi> and the conversion not yet made, it would have been false: If after the conversion, no more than this, <hi>This that is contained in these Pots is Wine;</hi> or, <hi>This which before was Water, now is Wine.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>And so in the point before us; Had our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our said, <hi>LET THIS BE MY BODY,</hi> and a conversion had been thereupon as truly made, as of the <hi>Water</hi> into <hi>Wine,</hi> we should have made no doubt, but that it was a command for that which before was <hi>Bread</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>his Body.</hi> If we take the Words as they are, <hi>THIS IS MY BODY,</hi> and no conversion made before they were pronounced, the Proposition in the literal sense must plainly be false. If a real conversion had first been made, as when the <hi>Water</hi> was turned into <hi>Wine,</hi> then would it signifie no more than this, <hi>This which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was Bread, is now my Body.</hi> So that all this will as little avail him, as he says the other did us, unless he also <hi>beg the Question,</hi> and suppose <hi>a real change</hi> made by these words, which he knows is the very thing which we deny; as we shall have reason to do, till they can prove that what, we are sure, was <hi>Bread,</hi> is converted into the <hi>Body of Christ.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>And thus much for his <hi>disputing;</hi> Before he enters <note place="margin">Vindicat. p. 77, 78, 79, 80.</note> on an Examination of those Authorities I produced to

                                       <hi>Christ is not Corporeally present in this Sacrament:</hi> Or <hi>how that which is not the thing it self, is yet more than a meer figure of it.</hi>
                                    </q> In answer to which, I shall need seek no farther than those Testimonies I before alledged out of the publick Acts of our <hi>Church</hi> to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him. Our <hi>Catechism</hi> affirms, <q>That the inward part, or thing signified in this Holy Supper, is the BODY <note place="margin">See the Church Catechism.</note> AND BLOOD OF CHRIST, which are VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RILY AND INDEED taken and received by the faithful in the Lords-Supper:</q> And the meaning of it our 28th <note n="‖" place="margin">Article 28.</note> 
                                    <hi>Article</hi> expounds thus; <q>
                                       <hi>The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Lord's Supper, ONLY AFTER A SPIRITUAL AND HEAVEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY MANNER; and the means by which this is done, is FAITH. So that to such as rightly, and worthily, and with Faith receive the same, The Bread which we break, is, as St.</hi> Paul <hi>declares it, The Communion of the Body of Christ, and the Cup of Blessing which we bless, The Communion of the Blood of Christ.</hi>
                                    </q> In a word; We say, that the <hi>faithful</hi> do <hi>really partake of Christs Body</hi> after such a manner, as those who are <hi>void of Faith cannot,</hi> tho' they may participate the <hi>Outward Elements</hi> alike; Whom therefore our Church declares, <note n="*" place="margin">Article 29.</note>

                                 <p>How little the Doctrine of the <hi>real Presence,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <note place="margin">Vindicat. ib.</note> by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> will serve to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this Innovation, is at first sight evident from the Exposition I before gave of it. That those who are ordained <hi>Priests,</hi> ought to have power given them to Consecrate the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and make them present in that holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> after such a manner as our Saviour appointed, and as at the first Institution of this Sacred Mystery they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were, this we have always confessed; and our <note n="†" place="margin">In the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Priests, when the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop imposes his hands, be bids him be a faithful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenser of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and of his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacraments:</hi> And again, when he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers him the Bible, Take thou Authority to Preach the Word of God, and to <hi>minister the Holy Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c.

                                 <p>It was indeed the singular Providence of God, That in the 2d year of that Excellent Prince, things were so far Reformed from those long and inveterate Errors, in which the Ignorance and Superstition of Several Ages had involved the Church, That they had allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nay, commanded the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> to be given under <hi>both kinds,</hi> when for so many years it had been received only under <hi>one.</hi> But that labouring still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their former prejudices, they should <hi>in case of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> permit that, which had been the universal pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church, without <hi>any necessity at all</hi> before; this is neither to be admired in them then, nor is it <hi>reasonable</hi> to urge it against us now.</p>

His 3d Argument is not only <hi>Unreasonable</hi> upon the account we have now said; but were it never so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, is absolutely <hi>nothing to the purpose.</hi> In the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> at the end of the same <hi>Order of the Communion,</hi> there is this Remark:</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <q>Note that the Bread that shall be consecrated, shall be such as heretofore hath been accustomed; <note place="margin">Sparrow'<hi>s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi> p. 24.</note> and every of the said consecrated Breads shall be broken in two pieces at the least, or more by the discretion of the Minister, and so distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

                                 <p>The meaning of which <hi>Rubrick</hi> is very plain; That whereas the people who had hitherto been accustomed to receive the Wafer <hi>entire,</hi> were now to have but a <hi>part</hi> of it given to them; to prevent any mis-conceits upon that account, as if because they did not receive <hi>the whole Wafer</hi> as they were wont to do, they did not receive <hi>the whole Body,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Flesh of Christ,</hi> (for as to the <hi>Blood,</hi> that they received afterwards in the <hi>Cup:)</hi> It was thought fit for the prevention of this scruple, to tell them, <q>That they must not think less to be received in part than in the whole, but in each of them <hi>the whole Body of Jesus Christ;</hi>
                                    </q> which what it makes for their <hi>denyal of the Cup to the Laity,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not very well apprehend.</p>

that the Church had power to do this; How will this excuse them, who without any <hi>necessary</hi> or but <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> cause deny it to the people altogether; and damn all those that will not believe <q>they had not <note place="margin">Concil.

Because whether there were any such particular Doctrine or Practice received by the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> is a <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and as such is in many cases di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly set down by such Writers as lived in or near that <hi>first Age of the Church.</hi> Now where the case is thus, the Accounts that are given by these Writers, are certainly to those who are able to search into them, a <hi>better Rule</hi> whereby to judge what was an <hi>Ancient Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> than either <hi>the Decree of a Council of a latter Age,</hi> or the <hi>Voice and Practice of its Pastors and People.</hi> For let these agree as much as they will in voting any <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Practice</hi> to have been <hi>Primitive,</hi> yet they can never make it pass for such among wise and knowing Men, if the <hi>authentick Histories</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> of those times shew it to have been otherwise. And this being plainly the case as to several instances decreed by the <hi>Councils,</hi> and practised by the <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>People</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> we cannot look upon her late Decrees and Practices to be a good or a safe Rule for judging of the <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or <hi>Universality</hi> of <hi>Church-Traditions.</hi> But</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. There is yet a more cogent Reason against this <hi>Method,</hi> which is, that it is apt to set up <hi>Tradition</hi> in competition with the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and to give this <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word</hi> the upper hand of the <hi>Written.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>For, according to this <hi>Method,</hi> if the <hi>Church</hi> in any Age, does but decree in <hi>Council,</hi> or does generally <hi>Teach and Practice</hi> any thing as an ancient <hi>Tradition,</hi> then this must obtain and be of force with all its Members, tho' many of them should be perswaded that they cannot find it in, nay, that it is contrary to the Written Word of God.</p>
                                 <p>Now this we cannot but look upon as an high af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the <hi>Holy Scriptures:</hi> And let them attribute as much as they please to the <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of their

                                    <hi>of the Church,</hi> I was willing to allow as much, and come up as near to Mons. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> as Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would permit. This it seems made the <hi>Vindicator</hi> to conceive some great hopes from my Concessions. But these his hopes are soon dasht, when he finds me putting in some Exceptions, and not willing to swallow the whole Doctrine, as it is laid down in the <hi>Exposition.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Now the Exceptions that seem most to offend him, are these,</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome should be taken for a <hi>particular,</hi> and not the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>

                                 <p n="2">2. That She should be supposed as such, either <hi>by Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to have</hi> lost, or <hi>by other means</hi> to have <hi>prevaricated</hi> the <hi>Faith, even in the necessary points of it.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p n="3">3. That any other <hi>Church</hi> should be allow'd to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and judg of the <hi>Decisions</hi> of <hi>that Church.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p n="4">4. That it should be left to <hi>private</hi> or <hi>individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> to examine and oppose the Decisions of the whole

                                    <hi>Church,</hi> if they are evidently convinced that their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate belief is founded upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>These are the Exceptions, at which he is the most offended: The 1. of these, he calls an Argument to <note place="margin">Vind. p. 103.</note> 
                                    <hi>elude the Authority of the Church of</hi> Rome; and to shew the Fallacy of it, he thinks it sufficient to say, <q>That they do not take the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>as it is the Suburbican Diocess, to be the Catholick Church, but all the Christian Churches in Communion with the Bishop of</hi> Rome.</q> Now if this, in truth, be that which they mean, when they stile the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> then surely every other <hi>National Church</hi> which is of that Communion, has as good a title to the name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> as that of <hi>Rome</hi> it self. For seeing it is the Purity or Orthodoxness of the Faith, which is the bond of this Communion, this renders every <hi>distinct Church</hi> professing this Faith, equally <hi>Catholick</hi> with the rest; and reduces the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, as well as others, within its own <hi>Suburbican Diocess,</hi> and so makes it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>particular,</hi> not the <hi>Universal Church.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But now, should we allow the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome as great an extent as the <hi>Vindicator</hi> speaks of, and that it were proper to understand by that name, all those <hi>other Churches</hi> which are in <hi>Communion</hi> with her; yet all this would not make her the <hi>whole</hi> or <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it could be proved, that there was no other <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church</hi> in the World besides those in <hi>Communion with her;</hi> and that all <hi>Christian Churches</hi> have in all Ages profess'd just the same Faith, and continued just in the same Worship as She hath done. And this we conceive will not easily be made out with reference to the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, Armenian, Abassine Churches;</hi> all which have plainly for several Ages differed from the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, and those in her <hi>Communion,</hi> in points relating
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36811:123"/>
both to Faith and Worship: So that in respect of these and the like <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> which were not of her <hi>Communion,</hi> She could not be looked upon as a <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,</hi> but only as a <hi>Particular Church.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Now if this be so, then the <hi>Vindicator</hi> himself allows, <note place="margin">Vind. p. 102</note> 
                                    <hi>2dly,</hi> That a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> may either by <hi>Error lose,</hi> or by <hi>other means prevaricate</hi> the <hi>Faith,</hi> even in the <hi>necessary points of it.</hi> Indeed that promise of our Saviour, <hi>That the gates of Hell should not prevail against</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">Matt. 16. 18.</note> 
                                    <hi>his Church;</hi> seems on all hands acknowledged, to refer to his <hi>whole Church,</hi> not to any one <hi>particular Branch</hi> or <hi>Portion.</hi> And therefore, tho' the <hi>particular Church of</hi> Rome should have fallen into gross Errors both in matters of Faith and Practice; yet <hi>the Catholick Church of Christ</hi> may still, as to other of its members, retain so much Truth and Purity, as to keep it from falling away, or being guilty of an intire Infidelity. And then for the</p>

                                    <hi>3d.</hi> Exception, The allowing any other <hi>Particular Church</hi> to examine and judg of the Decisions of this <hi>Church of</hi> Rome: If She her self be but a <hi>particular Church,</hi> and has no more Command or Jurisdiction o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Faith of other <hi>Churches,</hi> than they have over hers; then every other <hi>National Church</hi> is as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pow'red to judg for her self, as She is, and has an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual right to examine <hi>her Decisions,</hi> as those of <hi>other Churches;</hi> and may either receive, or reject what by Gods Grace directing her, She Judges to agree or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with his <hi>Holy Word.</hi> Nor do's one Branch of <hi>Christ's Church</hi> in this respect invade the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of another; since they do herein only follow the Apostles Rule, in trying all things, and holding fast that which is good.</p>
                                 <p>But the <hi>4th</hi> Exception, he says, <q>is <hi>yet more intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable than all the rest: That it should be left to every</hi>

                                       <hi>individual Person, not only to examine the Decisions of the whole Church, but also to glory in opposing them, if he be but evidently convinced that his own belief is founded upon the undoubted Authority of God's Holy Word. This,</hi> 
                                       <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 103.</note> he says, <hi>is a Doctrine, which if admitted, will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all Dissenters that are, or can be from a Church, and establish as many Religions as there are Persons in the World.</hi>
                                    </q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>These indeed, are very ill Consequences, but such as do not directly follow from this Doctrine as laid down in my <hi>Exposition.</hi> For <hi>1st,</hi> I allow of this Dissent or Opposition, only <hi>in necessary Articles of Faith,</hi> where it is every Mans concern and duty, both to judg for himself, and to make as sound and sincere a Judgment as he is able: And <hi>2dly,</hi> As I take the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> for the <hi>Rule,</hi> according to which this Judgment is to be made, so do I suppose these <hi>Scriptures</hi> to be <hi>so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written,</hi> as to what concerns <hi>those necessary Articles,</hi> that it can hardly happen that any one man, any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and impartial Enquirer, <q>should be found opposite to the whole Church in his Opinion.</q> 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Now these two things being supposed, that <hi>in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, a man is to judg for himself,</hi> and that <hi>the Scriptures are a clear and sufficient rule for him to judg by;</hi> it will plainly follow, That if a man be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently convinced, upon the best Enquiry he can make, that his particular Belief is founded upon <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and that of the <hi>Church</hi> is not; he is obliged to support and adhere to his own belief in Opposition to that of the <hi>Church.</hi> And the Reason of this must be very evident to all those who own, not the <hi>Church,</hi> but the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to be the ultimate <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> of their <hi>Faith.</hi> For if this be so, then <hi>individual Persons,</hi> as well as <hi>Churches,</hi> must judg of their <hi>Faith,</hi> according to what they find in <hi>Scripture.</hi> And tho it be highly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36811:124"/>
useful to them, to be assisted in the making of this Judgment by that <hi>Church,</hi> of which they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; yet, if after this Instruction, they are still evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently convinced that there is a disagreement in any <hi>necessary point of Faith,</hi> between the Voice of the <hi>Church</hi> and that of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> they must stick to the latter rather than the former, they must follow the superior, not inferior Guide.</p>
                                 <p>And however this method may through the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Malice of some men, be liable to some Abuse; yet certainly, in the main, it is most Just and Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and most agreeable to the <hi>Constitutions of the Church of</hi> England, which do's not take upon her to be <hi>Absolute Mistress</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> of her Members, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows <note place="margin">See Article 20.</note> a higher Place and Authority to the guidance of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> than to that of her own Decisions.</p>
                                 <p>As to the Authority, by which I back'd this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> that of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> tho' it is not doubted but that that Expression, of <hi>his being against the whole World, and the whole World against him,</hi> did refer chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Eastern Bishops;</hi> and was not so literally true as to those of the <hi>West;</hi> yet, if we consider what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances there were even of the <hi>Western Bishops,</hi> at <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum</hi> and <hi>Sirmium,</hi> and how Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> himself, tho' he refused to subscribe the form of Faith, sent to him from <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and was for that reason deposed from his Bishoprick, and banished out of <hi>Italy;</hi> yet afterwards, when the Emperor <hi>Constantius</hi> sent for him to <hi>Sirmium,</hi> and required his assent to a form of Faith, in which the word <gap reason="foreign">

And we should be glad he would direct us to those places, either in the first <hi>Councils</hi> or the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> where the <hi>Pope</hi> is stiled <hi>the Universal Bishop,</hi> or <hi>the Supreme Head on Earth of the whole Christian Church;</hi> where it is said, That he is <hi>Christs immediate Vicar;</hi> and <hi>that all other Bishops must derive their Authority from him.</hi> These are things which he do's now pretend to, but we can find no Footsteps of them in the first <hi>Councils</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> On the contrary, we find innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable passages which plainly shew, that no such <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> was anciently claimed by, or allow'd to the <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome: And therefore we say, That

these new and groundless pretences must be laid aside, before we can be content to yield him that Honour, which has been sometimes given to his Predecessors.</p>

                                    <hi>1st,</hi> It was not so <hi>General,</hi> because it was not call'd by so great and just an <hi>Authority</hi> as those were: That was an <hi>Authority</hi> to which Christians of all Places, and all Ranks, acknowledged themselves bound to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and attend where they were summon'd by it; whereas this was a meer <hi>Usurpation,</hi> and being so, was not regarded by a great part of the Christian World, who were sensible that they ow'd no Subjection to it.</p>

                                    <hi>2dly,</hi> It was not so <hi>Free,</hi> because those who had most to say in defence of the Truth, durst not appear at <hi>Trent,</hi> being sufficiently forewarn'd by what others had lately suffered in a like case at <hi>Constance:</hi> Add to this, That those who being present, did set themselves most to oppose Error and Corruption, were perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally run down, and outvoted by Shoals of new made Bishops, sent out of <hi>Italy</hi> for that purpose.

Shall I complain of his Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or rather shall I yet again beseech him to consider the little grounds he had for them; and see whether he has been able in any one Instance, to make good that <hi>infamous Character,</hi> which he has told the World, I have deserved in almost every <hi>Article</hi> of my <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi>

Some words now and then I omitted, because I thought them impertinent, and was unwilling to burden a short Treatise with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Citations. And I am still perswaded that they were not material, and that he might as well have found fault with me for not Transcribing the whole Books, from whence they were produced, as for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out those Passages which he pretends ought to have been inserted.

                                 <p>I never had the vanity to fancy my <hi>Exposition</hi> to be <hi>Infiallible,</hi> or that the sight of an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> should make me pass for an <hi>Oracle.</hi> But yet I was willing to hope, that amidst the late pretences to Moderation,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36811:126"/>
such a peaceable <hi>Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of England</hi> might at least have been received with the same civility by them, as that of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> was by us; and that our new <hi>Methodists</hi> had not so wholly studied the <hi>palliating</hi> part of their Master, as not to have learnt something of his <hi>fairness</hi> and <hi>civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> also.</p>
                                 <p>This I had so much the greater reason to expect, for that it has been esteemed not the least part of the <hi>artifice</hi> of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux,</hi> not only to mollifie the <hi>Errors</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> but to moderate that passion and heat that for the most part occurs in the defenders of it: And by the temper and candidness of his Stile, insinuate into his Reader a good Opinion of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                                 <p>But this is an <hi>Artifice</hi> that our late Controvertists seem resolved we shall have no great cause to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. Who therefore have not only wholly laid aside the <hi>Moderation</hi> of this <hi>Prelate;</hi> but have in some of their last Pieces fallen into such a vein of <hi>lightness</hi> and <hi>scurrility,</hi> as if their Zeal for their Church had made them forget <hi>that Religion is the Subject, and Christians and Scholars,</hi> to say no more of them, <hi>their Antagonists.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>I am ashamed to say, what <hi>mean Reflections,</hi> and <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial Jestings</hi> make up almost the sum of their latest attempts. <hi>The Papist Represented,</hi> which seemed to promise something of seriousness and moderation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring in a <hi>FANATICK Sermon;</hi> done indeed so naturally, as if the once Protestant Author had dropt not out of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> but a <hi>Conventicle</hi> into <hi>Popery.</hi> His late <hi>Majesties Papers</hi> Answered with <hi>Reason,</hi> and (whatever is pretended) with <hi>respect</hi> too by Us; instead of being <hi>Vindicated, ridiculed</hi> in the <hi>Reply:</hi> In which it is hard to say, whether the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has least shewn his <hi>charity</hi> to us, or his <hi>respect</hi> to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36811:127"/>
the <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> that he defends. These are the new <hi>Methods</hi> that are now taken up; but sure such as neither <hi>Church</hi> I suppose will be very well satisfied with: And which seem more accommodated to the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of those <hi>Sceptics</hi> who divert themselves at the expence of <hi>All Religion</hi> on both sides, than designed to satisfie the <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>conscientious</hi> of either.</p>
                                 <p>It is not improbable but that some such ingenious Piece may in a little time come forth against what I have now publish'd; to call me a few ill names, pass a droll or two upon the Cause, tell the World how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sheets there were in my Defence, and put the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to <hi>another Shilling expence,</hi> as a late Author has <note place="margin">Amicable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.</note> very gravely observed. If this be the Case, I hope I shall need no Apology to men of sense and sobriety, if I here end both their trouble and my own together. Let those who have been always used to it, rally on still with Holy things if they think good; for my part I esteem the <hi>Salvation of mens Souls,</hi> and the <hi>Truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> to be a more <hi>serious</hi> Subject than to be exposed to the levity of a <hi>Jest,</hi> and made the subject of a <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versial Lampoon.</hi> And if <hi>an account shall</hi> hereafter <hi>be given for every idle word</hi> that we now speak, I profess I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but tremble to think what shall be the judgment of those men, who in the midst of such unhappy dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as the Church now labours under; whilst our common Mother lies almost dissolved in tears for the divisions of her Children, and her dutiful Sons on both sides are praying and endeavouring with all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry to close them; like an unnatural off-spring, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert themselves in the quarrel, find a harmony in her groans, and make a <hi>droll</hi> of that, which had they indeed any true <hi>zeal for Religion,</hi> they ought to wish rather they could with their dearest Blood be so happy as to redress.</p>

                                    </q> And 'tis no hard matter when men so well disposed, as this Author seems to be, to speak evil of us, are to draw our <hi>Character,</hi> to make it appear as <hi>odious</hi> and <hi>deformed</hi> as they desire.</p>
                                 <p>Were I minded to recriminate, I need not tell those who are but very little acquainted with the true Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of these things, what a fair field I should have for a requital.

                                    <hi>loaded them with;</hi> we are not concerned in them. It is well known that the <hi>Church of England</hi> was no less, if not more, struck at in those times than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: <hi>If their present change of fortune makes them</hi> indeed <hi>neither remember those injuries, nor desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge them,</hi> it shews only that the favour of Providence has not made them forgetful of their duty; nor their <hi>present prosperity</hi> unmindful of their <hi>future Interest.</hi> This is not our concern, who have never that we know of injured them, unless to take all fair and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ways <hi>to defend our Religion as by Law established,</hi> may possibly, in some mens apprehensions, be esteemed an injury.</p>
                                 <p>The peace and liberty which we enjoy, we do not ascribe to their Civility; it is Gods Providence and our Soveraign's bounty, whom the <hi>Church of</hi> England has ever so Loyally served; whose Rights She asserted in the worst of times, when to use our Authors own words, <q>Perjury and Faction for this very cause, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with all the injuries Hell it self could invent.</q> But we gloried to suffer for our duty to Him then, and shall not fail, should there ever be occasion, to do it

again. And we have this testimony from our <hi>King,</hi> which no time or malice shall be able to obliterate, That <hi>the Church of</hi> England <hi>is by principle a Friend to Monarchy,</hi> and I think cannot be charged to have ever been defective in any thing that might serve to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and support it.</p>
                                 <p>For what remains with reference to the <hi>Points</hi> in <hi>Controversie,</hi> the foregoing Articles are but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued confutation of his vain pretences: And I shall only add this more to them, that whenever he will undertake to make good any one thing that he has advanced against us, either in his <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>Conclusion;</hi> I will not fail to <hi>prove</hi> what I now <hi>affirm,</hi> That there is not a word of truth in either of them.</p>
                                 <p>In the mean time, before I close this, I cannot but take notice, how much <hi>the state of our controversie</hi> with these men has of late been changed; and what hopes we are willing to conceive from thence, as to the sober part of their Communion, that those <hi>Errors</hi> shall in time be <hi>reformed,</hi> which they already seem not only to have <hi>discovered,</hi> but to be <hi>ashamed</hi> of.</p>
                                 <p>When our Fathers disputed against <hi>Popery,</hi> the <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> then was, Whether it were lawful to <hi>Worship I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages; to Invocate Saints; to Adore Reliques; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon our own Merits for Salvation; and satisfie for the pain of our own Sins.</hi> This was their task; and they abundantly discharged it, in proving these things to be unlawful, contrary to our duty towards God, and to the Authority of Holy Scripture.</p>
                                 <p>But now in these our days, there is started up a new Generation of men, too wise to be imposed upon with those illusions, that in blind and barbarous Ages had led the <hi>Church</hi> into so much <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Superstition.</hi> These see too clearly, that such things as these must, if possible, be deny'd, for that they cannot be maintain'd.

                                 <p>Such is the difference of the present <hi>Controversies</hi> between us from what they were, when it pleased God to discover to our <hi>Fathers</hi> the Errors they had so long been involved in. Were I minded to shew the division yet greater, there want not <hi>Authors</hi> among them, and those approved ones too, from whence to collect more desperate <hi>Conclusions</hi> in most of these <hi>Points,</hi>
                                    <pb n="102" facs="tcp:36811:136"/>
than any I have now remark'd. And the Practice and Opinion of the people, in those <hi>Countries</hi> where these <hi>Errors</hi> still prevail, is yet more <hi>Extravagant</hi> than any thing that either the One or Other have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                                 <p>What now remains, but that I earnestly beseech all sober and unprejudiced Persons of that <hi>Communion,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to weigh these things; And consider what just reason we had to quit those <hi>Errors,</hi> which even their own <hi>Teachers</hi> are ashamed to confess, and yet cannot honestly disavow.</p>
                                 <p>It has been the great business of these new <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dists</hi> for some years past, to draw over ignorant men to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> by pretending to them that their Doctrines are by no means such as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly mis-apprehended to be. This is popular, and may I believe have prevailed with some weak persons to their <hi>seduction;</hi> tho' we know well enough that all those abroad who pretend to be <hi>Monsieur de Meaux's Proselytes</hi> were not so upon the conviction of his Book, but for the <hi>advantages</hi> of the <hi>Change,</hi> and the <hi>Patronage</hi> of his <hi>Person and Authority.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But surely would men seriously weigh this <hi>Method,</hi> there could be nothing more strong for our <hi>Reformation</hi> than this one thing, That the wisest and best men of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> esteem it the greatest honour and advantage they can do to their <hi>Religion, to represent it as like ours as is possible;</hi> and that their strongest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make Proselytes is this, That were things but rightly understood, there is but very little or no difference at all betwixt us.</p>
                                 <p>And would to God indeed this were truly so! that these <hi>differences</hi> were not only as <hi>small</hi> as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, but <hi>wholly taken away:</hi> With what joy should we
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36811:136"/>
embrace the happy return of so many of our lost Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren into the Arms of their <hi>Mother?</hi> How should we go forth with the highest transports to welcome them into our Communion? And celebrate the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful festival on Earth, which would create an Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation even among the blessed <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven.</p>
                                 <p>And why shall we not hope that this in time shall be the issue? The good work is already begun; The <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> are many of them <hi>discover'd,</hi> and, what is more, <hi>disavow'd:</hi> And wherefore should we then distrust the Mercy of Heaven to hear our Prayers, which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make with more real zeal and fervour than in their behalf; to shew them the Truth, and open their Eyes to a perfect Conviction?</p>
                                 <p>Till this be accomplish'd, Let us, who by God's Grace are already Members of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that is, of the best <hi>reform'd,</hi> and best <hi>establish'd Church</hi> in the <hi>Christian World,</hi> so seriously weigh these things, as not only to <hi>stand stedfast in that Faith</hi> which has been delivered to us, but to use our utmost endeavours to convince others also of the Excellence of it.</p>
                                 <p>Let not any fond pretences of <hi>Antiquity</hi> or <hi>Possession</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">Vindic. p. 112, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                                 </p>
                                 <p>Let no prospect or temptation, whether of <hi>worldly evils</hi> on the one hand, or <hi>worldly advantages</hi> on the other, draw us from our <hi>stedfastness. God is faithful</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
                                    <hi>who will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able:</hi> And he who for any of these things <hi>denies Christ</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">Matt. 10. 33.</note> 
                                    <hi>or his Religion on Earth, shall be denied by Christ before his Father which is in Heaven.</hi>

But let us be firm and sincere to God and our own Souls; careful to search out, and ready to embrace the Truth whereever we find it.

I have prefix'd to every one of them such particular Accounts as may serve to satisfie the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Curiosity concerning them; and shall, I hope, be a sufficient Apology for me, that I have so largely insisted upon them.</p>

                                 <p>ANSWER 1. As to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> 'tis certain that the <hi>Virgin</hi> has brought several <hi>Souls</hi> from thence, as well as refreshed them whilst they were there. 2. 'Tis certain she has fetcht many out of <hi>Hell,</hi> i. e. <note place="margin">Page 100.</note> from a State of <hi>Damnation</hi> before they were <hi>dead.</hi> 3. The <hi>Virgin</hi> can, and has fetcht men that were dead in <hi>mortal Sin</hi> out of <hi>Hell,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing them to Life again, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; which the Father proves at large, <hi>for the Establishment of our</hi> FAITH <hi>and of our</hi> HOPE. <note place="margin">Page 102.</note>

                              <p>IN my Preface to my former Treatise, to shew with how little Sincerity many times those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> will <hi>approve Books, whose Principles they dislike;</hi> I observed that Cardinal <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisucchi</hi> had in his <hi>Controversies</hi> plainly contradicted, in the point of <hi>worshipping Images,</hi> what he <hi>approved</hi> in <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi>'s <hi>Exposition.</hi> This, <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> saies, cannot be, for this admirable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <q>qu'on trouvera son approbation expresse parmi celles que j'ai rapportées; </q>

                              <p>I have already said what I thought sufficient to the <hi>Consequence</hi> of this <hi>Answer:</hi> But now to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Reader</hi> that Cardinal <hi>Capisucchi</hi> is not the only Person that has thus complemented <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> contrary to his own Principles and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, I will here offer another plain Instance in <hi>M. de Meaux's learned and holy Cardinal</hi> BONA, <note place="margin">Avertissement de l' 5 Edit.

                              <p>For <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi>'s Doctrine, I shall not need say any thing here, after what I have so fully accounted above: The <hi>Reader</hi> may please to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the Extract I shall now offer him out of Cardinal <hi>Bona</hi>'s Works.</p>
                              <p>In his <hi>Dedication</hi> which he makes of his Book <note place="margin">Oper. Tom. 2.</note> of DIVINE PSALMODY to the Blessed Virgin, thus he concludes to her:</p>

                              <p>Such is the Entrance he makes upon this Book, and indeed the work that follows is all of a piece. In his 16. Chapter, Page 551.

                                    <p>YOur Lordship, without doubt, will better call to mind my Name, when I shall have told you, that I am the Person for whom you had the goodness, about 16 years since, to speak to <hi>Madam de Chaune,</hi> to obtain her consent, as Tutress to <hi>Monsieur de</hi>—for a certain Chappel; since which I have had the honour to see you several times at St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> with my Lords of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueux</hi> and <hi>Xainte.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Since that I have suffered <hi>Persecution,</hi> and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly since the time that your Lordship has published <hi>your Exposition of the Faith.</hi> Your Enemies, who dare not declare themselves against your Lordship, declare themselves against those who say the same things. And at this instant, the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> has caused a Process to be made against me for having explain'd upon <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> 
                                       <q>
                                          <hi>That we adore</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>crucified in presence of the Cross, and that we do not adore any thing of what we see.</hi>
                                       </q>  And forasmuch as the <hi>Curé</hi> replied upon the place aloud, <q>
                                          <hi>The</hi> WOOD, <hi>the</hi> WOOD; I added, <hi>No, no, 'tis</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and not the</hi> WOOD. And when he added, <hi>Ecce Lignum, venite, adoremus;</hi> I took him up, saying, <hi>On which the Saviour of the World
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36811:147"/>
hung, come let us adore this Saviour of the World.</hi>
                                       </q> 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I said further, that the Doctrine of the Church was, That if by an impossible Supposition we could separate the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the Son of God from his <hi>Humanity,</hi> we should not adore his <hi>Humanity;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as 'tis certain, that <hi>there is nothing adorable but God;</hi> and that therefore we ought to think, that we are now going out of Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> to <hi>adore</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>without stopping at the Crucifix.</hi> That the <hi>Church,</hi> like a good Mother, had given that to us by a holy Invention, to assist our Faith, and make the livelier Impression upon our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not to be the <hi>Object of our Worship,</hi> which must <hi>terminate upon</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                                    <p>Behold, my Lord, all my Crime, and what I am reproached with, I have writ to the <hi>Promoter,</hi> and to the <hi>Vicar General,</hi> and to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> himself. I have offered, if I have spoken any thing amiss, that I will recant it: I have offered to justifie my self: Notwithstanding all this, his <hi>Grace</hi> still persists in the <hi>verbal Interdict,</hi> which he immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against me. I have transferr'd my Cause by <hi>Appeal,</hi> as of Abuse, to the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Guienne:</hi> I have caused the <hi>Proctor</hi> to be summon'd; and though I have used all imaginable fairness, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction,</hi> paid them all possible deference, nevertheless the said <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> threatens me, as I am informed by those who gave him my Letter, with perpetual Imprisonment and Chains, for my Offence.</p>
                                    <p>Your Lordship may see by this Proceeding, how many there are that hinder our <hi>separating Brethren</hi> from returning to our Communion. They object to me, <hi>that which is also said against your Lordship's
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36811:148"/>
Book,</hi> That I do <hi>mollifie,</hi> but that <hi>the Doctrine of the Church is quite the contrary.</hi> This will more plainly appear by the Process against me; for I defie my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to reproach me for my Life and Manners, or for any other <hi>Doctrine</hi> than that of your Lordship, which I endeavour to express <hi>in the self same Terms,</hi> as finding them most agreeable to the Sentiments of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> so that <hi>if I am convicted of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, I am bold to say, your Lordship must be my Surety.</hi> But I dare assure you, my Lord, that I have Knowledge enough to defend this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and destroy the <note n="*" place="margin">

But since the main thing I charge <hi>M. de Meaux</hi> with, is, That a first <hi>Edition</hi> of his Book was <hi>suppress'd</hi> for containing some Assertions not so suitable to the Sentiments of the <hi>Sorbonne Doctors,</hi> to whom it was sent for their <hi>Approbation,</hi> to shew the undistinguishing Justice of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and that <hi>M. de Meaux</hi> is not the only <hi>Bishop</hi> they have dealt thus rudely with on these Occasions; I was willing to communicate to the World one Instance more of the like nature, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since the Original Leaves, rased out, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd by them, have here also fallen into my Hands, and may at any time be seen with the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd <hi>Edition</hi> of <hi>M. de Meaux's Exposition.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>It may be some Satisfaction to <hi>M. de Meaux</hi> to consider, that in this Case, he has run no other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune than what is common to him with the great St. <hi>Chrysostome:</hi> And possibly the <hi>Reader</hi> too will from hence begin to find it no difficult matter to believe, that those who made no scruple to <hi>suppress</hi> a whole <hi>Epistle</hi> of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> a <hi>Patriarch</hi> and a <hi>Saint,</hi> for contradicting their <hi>Doctrine</hi> in <hi>one</hi> only <hi>Point,</hi> may indeed have made as little of correcting <hi>M. de Meaux's Exposition,</hi> tho' a <hi>Bishop's,</hi> that had <hi>prevaricated</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> in so many.</p>
                              <p>Nor was I less engaged on the <hi>Vindicator</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to this Publication; 'tis one of his greatest difficulties, and which he seems the most desirous to be resolv'd in, how there can be such a thing as the <hi>Real Presence</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> without <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation?</hi> I have before told him what I suppose suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to explain this matter. But because I cannot expect that either my <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Book</hi> should pass
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36811:149"/>
pass with him for an <hi>Oracle,</hi> it may be some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the <hi>Idea</hi> to shew him one of their pretended <hi>Patrons</hi> concurring with me in the <hi>Exposition,</hi> and manifestly supposing a Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Christ's Body</hi> in the holy <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> and yet stifly contending at the same time, that the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> is not <hi>changed</hi> in it.</p>
                              <p>All the danger is, that this holy Father, who, as Monsieur <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got's</hi> Preface below.</note> 
                                 <hi>Bigot</hi> observes, has hitherto pass'd for the great <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> may possibly by this run the hazard of losing his Credit amongst them; and as it has fared but very lately with <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon the <hi>same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> that they will henceforth begin to <hi>lessen his Reputation,</hi> since they cannot any longer <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his Doctrine.</hi>

                              <p>But before I offer the <hi>Epistle</hi> it self, it is fit that I premise something for the better understanding of it. It was written to <hi>Caesarius,</hi> a <hi>Monk,</hi> that had a little before fallen into the <hi>Apollinarian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, to reduce him to the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> I shall therefore beg leave to begin my <hi>Reflections</hi> with a short account of that, as far as may serve to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the way to what we are to read of it in this.</p>

                                    <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi> could not bear, he neither thought fit to rely upon an <hi>Evasion,</hi> which he saw would not do their business, nor could he endure to allow so antient an Author as either of the two <hi>Johns,</hi> to have been so directly opposite to their Sentiments in this matter.

Thus stood this Passage, and the whole <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> for its sake; till about six years since the learned <hi>Bigotius,</hi> who had twelve years before brought a <hi>Copy</hi> of it from <hi>Florence,</hi> resolved to ruine all the Endeavours of these Men, by publishing the very <hi>Epistle,</hi> which the <hi>Cardinal</hi> had so loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to be a <hi>Forgery,</hi> and proving it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>Genuine Off-Spring</hi> of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the rest had in vain pretended.</p>
                                 <p n="7">VII. And this he accordingly, with great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity performed, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1680. For in his <hi>Edition</hi> of <hi>Palladius</hi> that year, among the other Pieces which he added to it, this Epistle of St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> had
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36811:158"/>
one of the first places, and was strengthned by him with such <hi>Attestations,</hi> as shew it to be beyond all doubt <hi>authentick.</hi> In his <hi>Preface</hi> he declared how he came by it, and made a short <hi>Apology</hi> for that passage of it that had caused so great a Contest; but such as it seems, he was either conscious to himself, not to have been very strong, or fear'd at least that his <hi>Censors</hi> would not esteem it to be so.</p>
                                 <p n="8">VIII. And in this I speak no more than what he himself declared to his Friends, insomuch that he <note place="margin">Expostulatio. pag. iii.</note> resolved to reserve privately some few Copies, for fear the rest should run that risque, which indeed they accordingly did. For being now quite finish'd, and just ready to come abroad, some of the <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> whereof <hi>Monsieur Grandin</hi> and <hi>Mr. Faure</hi> have been charged as the Principal, caused it to be <hi>suppressed,</hi> and the <hi>printed Leaves</hi> cut out of the <hi>Book,</hi> without any thing to supply the place of them.</p>
                                 <p n="9">IX. And of this the Edition of <hi>Palladius</hi> of that year remains a standing Monument, both in the <hi>Preface,</hi> and in the <hi>Book;</hi> and it was publickly <note place="margin">

XI. I hope the learned World, whom I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally design to gratifie in this matter, will accept this never the worse, for that <hi>Mr. le Moyne</hi> the last year published this Epistle among his <hi>Varia Sacra:</hi> That learned Man having neither given <note place="margin">Tom. 1.</note> the <hi>Greek Fragments,</hi> which I now publish from Monsieur <hi>Bigots</hi> own <hi>Impression;</hi> nor Monsieur <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots</hi> account of it, in the part of the <hi>Preface</hi> which was <hi>suppress'd.</hi> Not to add, that the <hi>Latine Copy</hi> of <hi>Mr. le Moyne</hi> is so very false, that it renders the <hi>Epistle</hi> utterly unintelligible. I do not pretend to anticipate his design, which he appears so jealous of: that is too <hi>vast</hi> to be injured by any thing I can offer; and I shall be glad if what I now publish may be any way serviceable to it.</p>
                                 <p n="12">XII. As to the <hi>Authority</hi> of this Piece, I shall need say no more than what Monsieur <hi>Bigot</hi> has already done to prove it to be <hi>Genuine.</hi> So many ancient <hi>Authors</hi> have cited it, as St. <hi>Chrysostom's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> to <hi>Caesarius;</hi> such <hi>Fragments</hi> of it remain in the most antient Writers as <hi>Authentick,</hi> that he who after all these shall call this Piece in question, may with the same reasonableness doubt of all the rest of his works, which, perhaps upon less grounds, are on all sides allow'd as true and undoubted.</p>
                                 <p>But it is time now to see what account Monsieur <hi>Bigot</hi> himself gives of it.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:36811:179"/>
notice of them, you draw them up into a <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> at the beginning of your <hi>Reply,</hi> and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <note place="margin">Reply at the end of the Preface.</note> in your <hi>Margin</hi> you put him in mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark them: But yet, Sir, after all this, I cannot but own to you, that your Books have done more to secure my <hi>Reputation</hi> among all those whose Esteem I value, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> than any thing my best Friends could have done for Me.</p>
                              <p>I need not, Sir, tell you, that my <hi>Exposition</hi> first, and then my <hi>Defence,</hi> made some noise among very great numbers of both <hi>Churches.</hi> I had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered such Secrets as perhaps few could have done besides; such as startled many worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of your <hi>own Communion;</hi> and which some even of our own side, who did not know what <hi>Evidence</hi> I had ready to produce for them, could hardly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most believe. Whilst great enquiry was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, some of <hi>your Religion</hi> knew not what to think, others flatly deny'd all that had been said; you, Sir, more kind, procure Me a Letter from that worthy Person the <hi>Bishop of Meaux</hi> himself; pretending indeed to disavow, but really acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging all that I had said with reference to his <hi>Exposition.</hi> A Favour for which, now I am discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these kind of Debts, I shall not fail to publish to the World my Engagements to him.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb facs="tcp:36811:180"/>
It was not long before my <hi>Defence</hi> made a new noise, and but little inferiour to that of my <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi> For besides that, it confirm'd all my former Allegations with new Proofs; it gave me opportunity moreover to make some <hi>further Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,</hi> both of <hi>your Church's Worship,</hi> and of <hi>your own Sincerity.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And this, Sir, you tell me <q>did induce many others <note place="margin">Reply, p. 173.</note> to an imitation of those Calumnies</q> I there threw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; but I must beg leave to mind you of another <hi>Inducement</hi> too, and that is, That it did <hi>induce</hi> the Generality of your side to <hi>calumniate</hi> Me, as one who had uttered nothing but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Untruths, and charged you with such things as were not to be found either <hi>in your Books,</hi> or <hi>in your Practice.</hi> But I may now reasonably presume that they will from henceforth retract this <hi>Calumny</hi> too, (if at least you will allow it to be a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny</hi> to <hi>accuse falsely one of our Religion;)</hi> since you have here satisfied the World, that these things you do <hi>write</hi> and <hi>practise,</hi> tho' indeed for want of an <hi>Infallible Interpreter,</hi> we who <hi>judge</hi> according to the <hi>Principles of Reason,</hi> are not able rightly to <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the meaning</hi> of them. And therefore, Sir, tho' your Words still stile me Criminal, yet your <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> every where <hi>protest against</hi> them; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire no other <hi>Advocate</hi> than your self to plead my <hi>Innocence.</hi>
                              </p>

                                 <pb facs="tcp:36811:180"/>
There is, Sir, yet a <hi>Favour</hi> which I ought not to pass by, tho' I could not a long time divine the meaning of it; and it is your great <hi>Self-denial,</hi> which prompted you, I suppose, through all your Book, as well as in that single place, where you your self have been pleased to remark it, not <q>to <note place="margin">Reply, p. 172.</note> take too much satisfaction in having your Adversary at an Advantage. </q>It was indeed generously done of you; tho' some (considering the Nature of your <hi>Church,)</hi> will be apt to think it was not merely an <hi>Excess of Charity</hi> that made you treat your <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> with so much <hi>Favour,</hi> but either the insuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ilness of the <hi>Cause</hi> you had to maintain, or some other <hi>Defect,</hi> which I shall beg leave not to name. However it puts me in mind of the <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errogating Merits</hi> of many of your <hi>Saints,</hi> to whose Honour the <hi>prudent VVriters</hi> of their <hi>Lives,</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd it, that they were wont to counterfeit themselves <hi>mad</hi> or <hi>foolish,</hi> and do a <hi>thousand ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> and <hi>extravagant things,</hi> that being laught at, and despised by all the World for them, they might thereby have the better Opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising their <hi>Christian Humility</hi> and <hi>Self-denial.</hi> But, Sir, I fear by this time my <hi>Civility</hi> may begin to grow more troublesome to you than my <hi>Rudeness</hi> would have been, should I have dispensed with my self, as to this Point of <hi>Ceremony.</hi> And indeed

                                 <hi>Were I minded to indulge my self the liberty of</hi> comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>upon this</hi> Letter, <hi>I should not want Occasions from a piece so very extraordinary, to make some rare and useful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks. But I shall confine my self to the particular for which I alledged it.</hi> Monsieur Ranchin <hi>was one of the</hi> Counsellors <hi>of the</hi> Chamber of the Edict of Languedoc, <hi>whilst it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted. The King having suppress'd that</hi> Chamber, <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated the</hi> Officers <hi>into the</hi> Parliament, Monsieur Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin <hi>soon perceived that things would not stop there, but that those of the</hi> reform'd Religion <hi>must expect in a little time to be turn'd out of all their Places. He had a great Family, and but a small Estate for a Person of his Quality. And now it was that the</hi> Exposition of the Bishop of Meaux <hi>began first to open his Eyes: He perceived the</hi> Roman Religion <hi>to be quite different from what he had hitherto thought it; insomuch that from henceforth he became disposed to embrace it, not by way of</hi> ABJURATION <hi>of what he held before, but by way of</hi> ADDITION, i. e. <hi>by adding the</hi> Roman Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions <hi>to it.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>This was easily consented to by those of the other</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>he insisted upon having the</hi> Communion in both
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:36811:186"/>
kinds, <hi>but that was deny'd him; but the principal matters were agreed to,</hi> viz. <hi>That for the Change he was to make, he should have</hi> 10000 Crowns <hi>in hand, and a</hi> Pension <hi>of a 1000 more</hi> per Annum, <hi>together with</hi> the assurance of his Place <hi>to himself and his Son after him, besides the</hi> hopes <hi>of higher</hi> Advancement.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>And thus our new</hi> Convert <hi>enters into the Bosom of the</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>not that the disliked his own</hi> Religion, <hi>or thought the other better; no, his Letter evidently implies the contrary; but he thought that by the help of the</hi> Bishop of Meaux's Exposition <hi>he might make a shift to be saved in it. He saw the</hi> Abuses <hi>that were in that</hi> Church, <hi>and he loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares against them: He professes he was so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the</hi> Religion <hi>of the</hi> People, <hi>and of the</hi> Tartuffes <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome, <hi>that nothing, no not</hi> ready money in hand, <hi>and a</hi> good Place <hi>and</hi> Pension <hi>for the</hi> future, <hi>should have been able to carry him to it. He advises his</hi> Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>to read those</hi> golden Books <hi>(He had indeed reason to call them so, for so they were to Him) that had so well</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctrine of the Catholick Church; <hi>and were no less necessary for the</hi> Roman Catholicks <hi>than for the</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants <hi>instruction: that according to these he did hope he</hi> might <hi>be saved in the</hi> Church of Rome; <hi>but for the</hi> People <hi>and the</hi> Tartuffes, <hi>that are not yet so happy as to understand these</hi> Expositions, <hi>there is</hi> no Salvation to be had for them.</p>

                                 <hi>And here at least I think it cannot be deny'd, but that we have two sorts of</hi> Popery <hi>very openly and freely avow'd: One such as that a man</hi> may be saved in <hi>the</hi> profession <hi>of it,</hi> viz. <hi>That of the</hi> Bishops <hi>of</hi> Meaux <hi>and</hi> Tournay, <hi>and of the</hi> wholesome Advices of the blessed Virgin to her indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screet Worshippers: <hi>the other of the</hi> People <hi>and the</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuffes, <hi>or Zealots of that</hi> Church, <hi>and for whom</hi> Monsieur Ranchin <hi>it seems had no great</hi> hopes. <hi>Nor let it be thought so very extraordinary in this Person that he entred into the</hi>

                                 <hi>And indeed after all,</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>himself must acknowledge this to be most reasonable: so that if his</hi> Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition <hi>does differ from what is</hi> generally practis'd <hi>in his</hi> Church, <hi>all his Pretences of its agreement with the</hi> Council of Trent, <hi>will not suffice to justifie his</hi> sincerity. <hi>It is upon this very Principle, that himself in his</hi> Discourse of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal History <hi>attacks the</hi> Heathens. <hi>He presses them with the</hi> publick Practice <hi>of the</hi> People <hi>towards their</hi> Gods, <hi>and values not what the</hi> Poets <hi>or</hi> Philosophers <hi>said with great pomp of words concerning the</hi> Divine Nature, <hi>whilst he saw the others involved in such</hi> gross Superstitions. <hi>Nor is this my</hi> Reflection, <hi>it was made by one of his</hi> own Communion, <hi>not long since, upon this very Occasion.

                                    <hi>He has reason</hi> (continues our Author) <hi>so to do; but yet this shews, that the</hi> Method <hi>which himself has taken to render the</hi> Catholick Religion <hi>fair and agreeable to the</hi> Protestants, <hi>is not to be maintain'd. For what is it to us, may they say, whether the</hi> Abuses <hi>and</hi> Superstitions <hi>that offend us in the</hi> Church of Rome, <hi>be to be found in the</hi> Decisions <hi>of their</hi> Councils, <hi>or not? As long as we see them publickly and solemnly authorized by it, and that their</hi> Worship <hi>consists in them, it is enough for us to keep our selves from its</hi> Communion. <hi>For might not the</hi> Heathens <hi>have defended themselves the very same way? Might they not have said, that those things which we reproach'd them with, were indeed</hi> Abuses <hi>into which the People was insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fallen by the connivance of the</hi> Magistrates, <hi>and by the</hi> Ignorance <hi>or</hi> Avarice <hi>of the</hi> Priests; <hi>but that we could never be able to prove, that the</hi> College of Pontifs, <hi>and of the</hi> Church <hi>duly assembled, had</hi> decided <hi>these things?</hi>

Monsieur de Condom, <hi>But what should we have answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? that certainly they must take us to be very</hi> Fools <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves after</hi> such a manner. <hi>Suppose a man should invite another to settle himself in a City where</hi> Robbery <hi>and</hi> Murder <hi>should be evidently and publickly</hi> tolerated, <hi>by shewing him that there was not to be found among all the</hi> Laws <hi>of that</hi> City, <hi>any one</hi> Statute <hi>that</hi> order'd <hi>men either to</hi> kill <hi>or</hi> rob, <hi>would he not have reason to laugh at him?

'Tis sufficient to me to keep me from dwelling there, that they do without Contradiction</hi> rob <hi>and</hi> kill. <hi>Confess we then</hi> (says he) <hi>that the</hi> Hereticks <hi>may make the same answer to</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Condom, <hi>and that therefore the true and only means to free our</hi> Religion <hi>from their</hi> Exceptions, <hi>is to shew that it does not</hi> tolerate any thing but what is good: <hi>And that not only the</hi> Decisions <hi>of its</hi> Councils <hi>are</hi> ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, <hi>but also that the</hi> publick Worship, <hi>the</hi> Customs <hi>and</hi> Doctrines authorized <hi>in it, are</hi> just <hi>and</hi> holy.</p>

                              <head>A SECOND DEFENCE OF THE EXPOSITION of the DOCTRINE OF THE CHURCH of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> AGAINST The <hi>New Exceptions of Monsieur de Meaux</hi> and his <hi>VINDICATOR.</hi> Addressed to the <hi>Reverend Vindicator.</hi>
                              </head>
                              <p>AND thus far have I cleared the way to my <hi>Defence,</hi> and shewn both that there is at this day an <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Popery</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and how we are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in order to the finding out which is the true and genuine <hi>Sense</hi> of that <hi>Church.</hi> I must now remember the <hi>Method</hi> I before laid down, and shall from henceforth carefully pursue.</p>
                              <p>Two things there are, which I shall chiefly aim at in this Undertaking, <hi>viz. Clearness</hi> and <hi>Sincerity;</hi> and in either of which, but especially in the latter, if I prove defective, I shall neither be able to satisfie my <hi>own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> nor my <hi>Reader's Expectation.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>As for the <hi>former</hi> of these, I have made such a <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of my <hi>Discourse,</hi> as seem'd to me most proper for this end. I have resolved to give every thing its due
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36811:194"/>
weight, by separating what belongs to <hi>my self alone,</hi> from what concerns <hi>the Cause</hi> I am to maintain. And to the end that nothing of Passion or Frowardness may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise to hinder me from weighing all things with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference I desire, I shall first distinctly consider what is fit to be replied to those <hi>severe,</hi> for I will not yet call them <hi>unjust, Reflections</hi> you have so industriously made upon me, that so I may afterwards have nothing to do, but freely to examine the force of your <hi>Arguments;</hi> without being diverted by the <hi>Reproaches</hi> that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them.</p>
                              <p>And for the <hi>latter,</hi> I do here promise you to make it sincerely my Endeavour, not only that what I defend be the <hi>Truth,</hi> but to defend it only with <hi>Truth.</hi> You may think of me as hardly as you please, or as <hi>your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Zeal</hi> shall prompt you to do; but I assure you I never will endeavour <hi>to perswade that to others, of Truth, of which I am not first my self convinced.</hi> So that, if then you have indeed discover'd in my <hi>Book</hi> any of those <hi>ill Things</hi> you charge me with in your <hi>Reply,</hi> you shall not fail to find me as ready to acknowledge my Faults, as, I bless <hi>God,</hi> I always have been; and if I may be allow'd to know my own Heart, still am unwilling to commit them: Or if this will not satisfie you, I will add, As <hi>you have been to discover them.</hi> Believe me, good Sir, my desire is to go the right way to <hi>Eternal Happiness:</hi> but whether this Way lie on the <hi>right-hand,</hi> or on the <hi>left,</hi> or <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Chill.</hi> Pref.</note> 
                                 <hi>straight-forward,</hi> to me it is indifferent. And however you have thought fit, according to your usual <hi>Charity</hi> towards those that differ from you, to assume to your self the <hi>Prerogative of God</hi> in judging the <hi>Secrets</hi> of my <hi>Soul,</hi> and to affirm, as you most rashly and unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly do, what you can never be sure is true, and what I am sure is undoubtedly otherwise, <q>
                                    <hi>That if I would</hi>

                                 </q> yet give me leave to tell you that my <hi>Conscience</hi> is so far from accusing me in this matter, that I have hitherto felt no other motions at the reading of these bitter <hi>Reproaches,</hi> than what fill me with Wonder and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at your Presumption; at the same time that they engage me not only to forgive you my self, but earnestly to beseech <hi>God</hi> to forgive you too.</p>
                              <p>And for your other <hi>Reflections,</hi> wherein you seem to have taken a particular satisfaction to blacken me all you can; (you being, as I shall hereafter shew, much more sollicitous about your <hi>Calumnies</hi> than your <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments:)</hi> Tho' you have been so scrupulously care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to allow, no, not for the smallest <hi>Errors,</hi> that you have often taken the liberty to invent there where you could not otherwise find whereof to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me; yet so far shall I be from returning any thing of this upon you, that on the contrary, I will shew you that your <hi>Example</hi> is not contagious where your <hi>Principles</hi> do not prevail; and that I am therefore as far from being <hi>moved by your Calumnies,</hi> as I hitherto see any reason to be <hi>convinced by your Arguments.</hi>

                              <p>But of these things more particularly hereafter. I must now pass to the first thing I proposed to do which was <hi>to discharge my Obligations to the Bishop of</hi> Meaux, whom, you tell me, <q>
                                    <hi>I have endeavoured to</hi>

                                 </q>To which all that I shall say at present, is, That for the <hi>contemptible Raillery</hi> you speak of, it is none of my <hi>Talent.</hi> I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore shewn you some of your <hi>own Friends,</hi> who have <note place="margin">Defence, p. 85, 86.</note> indeed attain'd to a Perfection in it, and 'tis pity they should lose that <hi>Reputation,</hi> seeing they have so very little to pretend to besides. I have treated the <hi>Bishop

of Meaux,</hi> and by the help of <hi>God</hi> always will treat him as his <hi>Character</hi> requires me to do. I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>laugh'd</hi> at him, nor <hi>mocked</hi> him, nor <hi>sharpened</hi> what I have said with any <hi>light, Satyrical Pleasantry,</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either his <hi>Person,</hi> or his <hi>Exposition ridiculous:</hi> And these are the only Notions of <hi>Raillery</hi> that I know of, or that I believe your better Attainments in the <hi>French</hi> Language will be able to discover. No, Sir, be assured that what I have said, was <hi>serious Truth,</hi> and deliver'd in such a manner, as I believe no one but your self ever mistook it for <hi>Raillery.</hi> And if from what I shall now further remark it does appear, that even by that <hi>Bishop</hi>'s own Confession I have spoken nothing without good grounds for it, I shall then leave it to any of your <hi>thinking Men,</hi> be their <hi>Faith</hi> what it will, freely to judge where the <hi>Confusion</hi> ought to <hi>lie.</hi>

                                 <p>Your <hi>Vindicator</hi> accuses me in his <hi>Reply</hi> to my <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi>

                                    <q>of having endeavour'd to expose you by my contemptible Raillery. </q>It is not improbable but that he who has the Confidence to lay so unseemly a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to my charge, in the face of so many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36811:196"/>
as have read my <hi>Books,</hi> and must therefore know it to be a <hi>false</hi> and <hi>groundless Imputation,</hi> may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so have <hi>represented</hi> my Demeanour to your <hi>Lordship</hi> much otherwise than indeed it has been. But, <hi>my Lord,</hi> I know better what I owe to your <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,</hi> than to fail in any due Reverence towards it; and if I may be permitted to add it, am too sensible how you ought to have respected it your self, to be guilty of any Rudeness that may seem <hi>farther to lessen it.</hi> I believe indeed, I may have said things that have been very <hi>ungrateful</hi> to you, but I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded I have done it in such a manner, that you your self cannot justly complain of any want of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility</hi> in me. And I will now, as I have hitherto done, be by so much the more careful not to offend you in my <hi>Expressions,</hi> by how much the more I apprehend that I must displease you in my <hi>Allegations.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>It is indeed a thing to be lamented, that one, whom <hi>God</hi> has called to so high a <hi>Dignity</hi> in his <hi>Church;</hi> whom he has endow'd with all the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments of Nature and Art, that might fit him to do some eminent Good in his Generation; to whom he has given Favour in the sight of one of the greatest <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and whose Eyes he has opened to see <hi>many</hi> of those <hi>Errors,</hi> to which others of his <hi>Communion</hi> are still blind, should not attempt something worthy both his own <hi>Character,</hi> and all these <hi>great Opportunities:</hi> That the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he has of some at least of those Superstitions which his <hi>Church</hi> is involved in, should not yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his <hi>Zeal</hi> to do somewhat that might effectually deliver it from them.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36811:196"/>
I have heard, <hi>my Lord,</hi> of the Endeavours you use to <hi>reform</hi> these things in your own <hi>Diocess;</hi> and I am perswaded you would be glad to see your <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> establish'd, not by a few <hi>vain Complements,</hi> which you know signifie nothing; but by the effectual <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> and <hi>Decision</hi> of your <hi>Church</hi> to become indeed an <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> of it. And though, were it as <hi>Authentically ratified</hi> as it is now <hi>pompously approved,</hi> we should not even so be in a Condition of returning to you; yet we should then despair, but that being once sensible you <hi>could Err, God Almighty</hi> who disposed you to go thus far, He would not suffer you to stop there; but would incline your Hearts totally to embrace that truly <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> from whence you have departed, and to which you now seem willing again to return.</p>
                                 <p>Think I beseech you what an Honour it would be to your <hi>See,</hi> if as the last <hi>Reformation</hi> in <hi>France</hi> began there, so now a new and more lasting One might spring up, not from a <hi>poor Trades-man</hi> as before, but from whence it ought to come; the <hi>supream Pastour</hi> of it. And if any secular <hi>Hopes</hi> or <hi>Fears</hi> have hitherto kept you from employing those <hi>Advantages,</hi> I before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to this <hi>great End;</hi> and for which perhaps it was that <hi>God</hi> has given them to you; be perswaded at least yet to consider your <hi>Dignity;</hi> and what your <hi>People,</hi> your <hi>Religion,</hi> your <hi>own Soul</hi> requires of you? 'Tis <hi>yet</hi> in your power to redeem all, and by your Courage and sincerity now at the last, not only to blot out all that <hi>Scandal</hi> you have hitherto given us; but if it shall please <hi>God</hi> to bless your Endeavours, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your <hi>Name</hi> Honourable to the <hi>present,</hi> and your <hi>Memory</hi> precious to <hi>all future Generations.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But if none of these <hi>Considerations</hi> shall be able to stir you up to so glorious an enterprize; If you are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36811:197"/>
still so tender of the Credit of your <hi>Exposition,</hi> that you will not be perswaded to pursue any <hi>Reformation,</hi> but by a <hi>Method</hi> which you ought by this time to see will never accomplish it: You must then excuse us if we endeavour to lay open your <hi>Designs</hi> to the <hi>World;</hi> and keep you from doing any <hi>hurt,</hi> if you will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to do all the <hi>Good</hi> that you ought.</p>
                                 <p>The first thing I said concerning your <hi>Exposition</hi> was, <q>
                                       <hi>That it was designed either to satisfie or to seduce the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal <note place="margin">

And though when I consider how many Points <note place="margin">Reply, pref.</note> were wanting to that first draught which appear'd of it, I must still believe that either <q>

                                    </q>yet I will not doubt, but that it was the <hi>Exposition</hi> that prepared the way to it.

But it may be the <hi>Vindicator</hi> judges of your <hi>Lordship</hi>'s pains in <hi>converting Hereticks,</hi> by the little <hi>they take</hi> who now labour in this design among us: and which I cannot more nearly compare with any thing than that <hi>Method</hi>

                                 <p>And what has your <hi>Lordship</hi> now to except against this? Can you say that these <hi>Presumptions</hi> are not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable against you? No, that you do not pretend. Can you deny the Fact? Neither dare you put it upon that issue.

that cannot be doubted to be <hi>Authentick; attested</hi> by the <hi>person</hi> that <hi>compared them,</hi> to be the very same; and if this be so, the <hi>Bishop of Meaux</hi> remains actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of being privy to the <hi>Impression</hi> which he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses</hi> was made, but, as he pretends, <hi>without his Order or Knowledge;</hi> and to all this, he has only this to say, That <hi>it may be some body has tack'd</hi> Cramoisy'<hi>s name, and the</hi> King's Approbation <hi>to an</hi> Edition <hi>that they do not of right belong to.</hi>

                                 <p>Judge, <hi>my Lord,</hi> your self, if you can but for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sequester your thoughts from your own concern in this matter, whether so <hi>poor a supposal</hi> be sufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw such <hi>positive evidence</hi> against you: and do not force me to appeal to any other to judge betwixt us. I shall be thought perhaps to undervalue my better <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities</hi> in this matter, should I say that those who are acquainted with <hi>Monsieur Cramoisy</hi>'s Letter, will soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern whether my <hi>Book</hi> came not out of his <hi>Imprimerie.</hi> But if it be not sufficient to confound your <hi>supposal,</hi> that it was gathered up from your own <hi>Printers; Collated</hi> with <hi>Monsieur de Turenne</hi>'s <hi>Copy;</hi> to which I am sure you will not say these things were <hi>falsly tack'd;</hi> and <hi>Attested</hi> to be the <hi>same:</hi> I will then add only this more; <q>

                                 <p>O, <hi>my Lord!</hi> may I not here at least beg leave to think, that <hi>out of the abundance of your heart, your hand wrote this?</hi> Would <hi>your Lordship</hi> have made such <hi>supposals</hi> in our favour, had not your <hi>Conscience</hi> here got the better of your <hi>Reason?</hi> 
                                    <q>
                                       <hi>Suppose,</hi> you say, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Book was publish'd, some Leaves had been cut out, and you had corrected what you thought fit,</hi> or <hi>it may be altogether changed it.</hi> 
                                    </q>Is not this the very thing we charge you with, and which you have been so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavouring to perswade the World you did not do? And if I may be allow'd to answer one <hi>supposal</hi> with another; <q>
                                       <hi>What if you did do this upon the</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections <hi>that were made by those</hi> Sorbonne Doctors, <hi>to whom it was sent for their</hi> Approbation?

                                    </q>I reply, That then 'tis very possible, that the <hi>person</hi> from whom I obtain'd my <hi>Copy</hi> was <hi>One</hi> of these; and if so, then both <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur Cramoisy's</hi> name, and the <hi>King's Priviledge</hi> may honestly belong to it; and my <hi>Book</hi> be one of those that was FIRST PRINTED, and that with your <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Approbation;</hi> before these <hi>Leaves</hi> you speak of were <hi>changed</hi> in it.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="13" facs="tcp:36811:199"/>
You see, <hi>my Lord,</hi> of what advantage these <hi>supposals</hi> are to us; and I doubt not but this will make you hereafter assure us that they were only <hi>Cases</hi> put, for discourse sake, not that you really did this. And to this you may be sure there is no <hi>Reply;</hi> all I shall desire is, that if you intended no more by them than so, why you could not have as well made the <hi>supposal</hi> in the very terms of our <hi>Charge;</hi> which would have been much more proper than to alter them to another very like it; For my part I cannot but think, that as I said before, your <hi>Heart</hi> here guided your <hi>Hand,</hi> and the <hi>conscience</hi> of what you knew you <hi>had done,</hi> led you to make this <hi>supposal</hi> of it.</p>
                                 <p>But here the <hi>Vindicator</hi> desires to come in with his <hi>supposal</hi> too; and that is yet nearer to what we say. <q>
                                       <hi>Suppose,</hi> says he, <hi>the</hi> Bishop <hi>had permitted an</hi> Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">Reply, Pref.</note> 
                                       <hi>to be made, or</hi> (WHICH IT MAY BE WAS ALL HE DID) <hi>had caused a</hi> dozen <hi>or</hi> fourteen Copies <hi>to be</hi> printed <hi>off; to shew them to his Friends, before he would put the last hand to his Book: nay (if you will) let us suppose, that some of the</hi> Doctors of the Sorbonne <hi>were of the number of those</hi> Friends <hi>to whom he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated these</hi> Copies, <hi>and that they had made some</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, Observations, <hi>or</hi> Additions. </q>Why truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I say then, that <hi>supposing</hi> you had the <hi>Bishop's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to write this, you have fairly given away his <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> together; by confessing that there was, as we affirm, a <hi>private Edition made,</hi> that it was <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated</hi> to some of the <hi>Doctors of the Sorbonne;</hi> that these <hi>Doctors</hi> did <hi>Correct</hi> it, and that then it was <hi>reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> as we now see it.</p>
                                 <p>But I have more to observe from this passage, and it may be that which will <hi>unriddle</hi> this whole <hi>Intrigue.</hi> 1. Whereas the <hi>Vindicator</hi> having <hi>supposed</hi> that the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
                                    <pb n="14" facs="tcp:36811:200"/>
caused a few <hi>Copies</hi> to be <hi>printed</hi> for his <hi>Friends,</hi> he then immediately changes his stile from a <hi>supposal</hi> to a kind of <hi>affirmation</hi> of it; <q>
                                       <hi>Which,</hi> says he, <hi>it may be</hi> WAS ALL THAT THE BISHOP DID. </q>2. He <hi>supposes</hi> that some of the <hi>Sorbonne Doctors</hi> might be of the number of those <hi>Friends,</hi> and might have made some <hi>Corrections</hi> and <hi>Observations</hi> in it. 3. He doubts, <q>
                                       <hi>whether a few such Copies could be</hi> PROPERLY CALLED AN IMPRESSION: </q>And now to add my <hi>supposal</hi> to all the rest, What if this were the <hi>Case?</hi> The <hi>Bishop</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> prints a few <hi>Copies</hi> of his <hi>Book;</hi> but they being but a very few, and designed only for his <hi>Friends,</hi> not the <hi>publick;</hi> He does not think that this could PROPERLY <hi>be called an</hi> IMPRESSION: And therefore whereas we charge him with a <hi>private Impression,</hi> he readily denys that he had made any. For so <hi>few Copies</hi> cannot PROPERLY BE CALLED AN IMPRESSION.</p>
                                 <p>He sends it to some <hi>Doctors of the Sorbonne,</hi> and they make <hi>Corrections</hi> in it. But these <hi>Doctors</hi> he sent it to as <hi>Friends</hi> not <hi>Doctors,</hi> and therefore when we charge him with <hi>sending it to the</hi> Sorbonne <hi>for their</hi> Approbation; He assures us he never did any such thing, because he designed only their <hi>private judgment</hi> as his <hi>Friends,</hi> not to prefix their publick <hi>Approbation</hi> as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> to it.</p>
                                 <p>I do not say that this <hi>is the Case;</hi> but however I thought I might make such a <hi>supposal</hi> of it upon the grounds that were so fairly offered to me; and I shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the <hi>Reader</hi> to think what <hi>probability</hi> there may be in it.</p>
                                 <p>But to return from this <hi>digression,</hi> to the <hi>Vindicator:</hi> You will tell me, it may be, that you did not intend I should make this Use of your <hi>Suppositions;</hi> that which you would know, is, <q>

                                       <hi>Editions;</hi> for I know not whether the <hi>Vindicator</hi> has <hi>corrupted the</hi> One, or <hi>false-translated the</hi> Other;) <hi>which you did not approve, some things not agreeing word for word with the true</hi> One: <hi>But that a little justice must needs make us acknowledge the difference to regard only the</hi> Beauty <hi>or</hi> Conciseness <hi>of the</hi> stile, <hi>and not at all the</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <hi>of the</hi> Faith.</q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>In all which I find nothing more than what you had before said, in your <hi>former Letter;</hi> and the Examples of some of your <hi>Changes</hi> which I offered in answer to this <note place="margin">Defence, <hi>p.</hi> IX, X.</note> pretence then, may still serve to satisfie the World what <hi>Credit</hi> is to be given to the <hi>same Assertion</hi> now.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="16" facs="tcp:36811:201"/>
But because you desire your <hi>Reverend Father</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the <hi>Occasion of this Difference,</hi> we ought not by any means to forget it: Viz. <q>
                                       <hi>That it was made for the instruction of some particular Persons, and</hi> NOT TO <note place="margin">Reply, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                                       </note> BE PRINTED: </q>I shall take it for granted, that these <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons</hi> for whom <hi>it was made,</hi> were either your <hi>new Converts,</hi> or such as you desired to have so. Now the Exposition being framed for <hi>their Instruction, and</hi> NOT TO BE PRINTED; is it not very natural to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that you might have <hi>soften'd</hi> things in it to serve that <hi>design,</hi> somewhat more than you could afterwards justifie when you came to <hi>publish</hi> it; and that the <hi>Alterations</hi> therefore might be such as our <hi>Copy</hi> shews in things that <q>
                                       <hi>concern the substance of the Faith</hi> as well as the <hi>Beauty and Conciseness of the stile?</hi>
                                    </q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>And for this I have yet another presumption. The † MS. <hi>Copy</hi> which at first went abroad, and was that <note place="margin">Rep. de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de la B—Avertissement, <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> which I suppose you drew up for the <hi>particular Persons</hi> you speak of, ended at the <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> Now. I cannot but observe that the most considerable <hi>Alterations</hi> do end there too: For however indeed in the point of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> you had omitted the name of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> yet in effect you asserted the thing; In the <hi>Adoration of the Host, Communion in One kind,</hi> and the following <hi>Articles,</hi> we find <hi>Changes</hi> indeed, but rather in the <hi>stile,</hi> than, as you say, <hi>in the substance of the Faith:</hi> The business of the <hi>Mass</hi> was the only considerable instance in which you <hi>prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</hi> From whence I conclude, that those first <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> were written, as you say, <hi>for the instruction of particular Persons, and</hi> NOT TO BE PRINTED; and therefore you thought you might take the liberty to write them as you pleased, and as your <hi>design</hi> led you to do: but when you came to add the others in order
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36811:201"/>
to the publishing your <hi>Exposition,</hi> though you were still exceedingly careful to <hi>mollifie</hi> things all you could, and sometimes more than was thought fitting, yet you were forced to proceed with <hi>greater Circumspection.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>But your Lordship desires to have our <q>pretended <note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 186.</note> Edition put into the hands of some Person of Credit; where you may have it seen by some of your Friends; and you do then engage your self either to shew the manifest falsity of it, or if it has been truly printed after your MS. to make appear as clear as the day, that the differences we so much magnisie deserve not even to be thought upon.</q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>This indeed, <hi>my Lord,</hi> is an extraordinary favour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that you have suffered an <hi>Extract</hi> made out of this very Book by <hi>Monsieur de la B—</hi>of <hi>twenty Changes</hi> to pass now almost this <hi>xv.</hi> years without any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi> And because I would not be too importunate, be pleased only at your leisure to shew us <hi>in them,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be worth our while to put you to the trouble of <hi>Considering any more.</hi> But if you succeed no better in the other <hi>xix.</hi> than you have done in this <hi>One,</hi> wherein you have first made the <hi>Experiment,</hi> it will be neither for <hi>your Credit</hi> nor <hi>our Satisfaction</hi> to disturb your self about it. The point is, concerning the <hi>Honouring the Blessed Virgin and the Saints:</hi> The <hi>Case</hi> lies thus,</p>
                                 <p>In both your <hi>Editions</hi> you lay down this <hi>Principle;</hi> 
                                    <q>
                                       <hi>That</hi> all Religious Worship <hi>ought to</hi> terminate <hi>upon</hi> God, <hi>as its necessary</hi> End.—</q>From this you infer:</p>
                                 <p>I. Edit. <q>Therefore <hi>the Honour which the</hi> Church <note place="margin">Expos. <hi>C. E.</hi> p. XXII.</note> 
                                       <hi>gives to the</hi> Blessed Virgin <hi>and the</hi> Saints I S RELIGIOUS, <hi>because it gives them that</hi> Honour <hi>with relation to</hi> God, and <hi>for the love of</hi> Him;</q>
                                 </p>

And therefore again,</p>

                                       <hi>So far ought one to be from blaming the</hi>

                                 </p>
                                 <p>I am not now to question the reasonableness of this <hi>Consequence;</hi> but to observe the <hi>New turn</hi> that you give it in your <hi>Second Edition:</hi> where the <hi>Principle</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, you infer thus, directly <hi>Opposite</hi> to the former <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>II. Edit. <q>
                                       <hi>Therefore</hi> IF <hi>the</hi> Honour <hi>which it</hi> (the Church) <hi>renders to the</hi> Blessed Virgin <hi>and the</hi> Saints <hi>may in some sense be called</hi> RELIGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS, <hi>it is for its necessary Relation to</hi> God.</q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>This is the <hi>Case;</hi> let us see how you <hi>Answer</hi> it. You tell us <q>
                                       <hi>that at the bottom what you said at first was true:</hi> 
                                    </q>Very likely, but that is not our <hi>Question:</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 186.</note> that which we expect is that you shew us, <hi>as clear as the day,</hi> that the <hi>difference</hi> is only in the <hi>Stile,</hi> not the <hi>Substance of Faith.</hi> You add therefore; <q>
                                       <hi>That if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you gave it</hi> Another turn, <hi>it was only that you might speak with more</hi> Brevity, <hi>and avoid the pittiful Equivocations which are every day made upon the Word</hi> Religious. And this is all you have to say to it.</q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>To which I answer: First, Though it be not <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> yet that it is not <hi>true,</hi> that your <hi>New turn</hi> was that you might speak with <hi>more Brevity;</hi> for whereas you had before said, that this <hi>Honour was Religious,</hi> you now put in a few other words, which do not indeed add much to the <hi>length,</hi> but makes a great deal of difference
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36811:202"/>
as to the <hi>Sense, If it may in some Sense be called Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</hi> But, <hi>2dly,</hi> The <hi>reason</hi> you give do's not at all <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie</hi> us: We come not now to hear the <hi>distinctions</hi> of the <hi>Schools,</hi> but to read an <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>necessary Doctrine of the Church;</hi> and in which you tell us, that <hi>One word ill rendred would spoil all.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>What then is the <hi>Churches sense</hi> concerning that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> 
                                    <note place="margin">Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your Expos. <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6.</note> which it renders to the <hi>Saints departed?</hi> You pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Dogmatically:</hi> First, <hi>It is</hi> A RELIGIOUS HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOUR, <hi>and were to</hi> BE BLAMED <hi>if it were</hi> NOT RELIGIOUS. Then comes out a <hi>new Edition,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving considered better of the matter, you <hi>doubt</hi> whether it may even in SOME SENSE <hi>be called a</hi> RELIGIOUS HONOUR. <note n="†" place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note> Your <hi>Vindicator</hi> comes after you, and with <hi>another Turn</hi> sets all right again, that it cannot be called a <hi>Civil Honour,</hi> and therefore it <hi>must be a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> And which of these, or whether they be all of them the <hi>Churches sense,</hi> we are yet to learn.</p>
                                 <p>Had you, <hi>my Lord,</hi> distinguish'd in your <hi>Exposition</hi> as you would be thought to do now: Had you told us, that this <hi>Honour</hi> as it refers to <hi>God,</hi> and is done <hi>out of Love to Him,</hi> is <hi>Religious,</hi> but in any <hi>Other respect</hi> (if there be any other) you could not well tell what it was; we had then understood <hi>yours,</hi> if we had not the <hi>Churches sense</hi> of it. But to tell us without <hi>any distinction</hi> in <hi>One Edition</hi> that it <hi>is Religious,</hi> and in <hi>Another</hi> to doubt, <hi>whether it may in any Sense be called Religious,</hi> this is such a kind of <hi>turn</hi> as He once gave to the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> who being to <hi>Expound</hi> a certain Decree which began WE COMMAND; that is, says the Gloss, WE FORBID: and I think plainly shews, that either here you did not well know <hi>the Sense of your Church,</hi> or you did not care that <hi>we should.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>

so <hi>contrary</hi> to your <hi>Exposition.</hi> At least you should have given us some Evidence to let us see that he had been convinced by his <hi>Superiour</hi> of having abused your <hi>Authority;</hi> that your <hi>Exposition</hi> did by no means favour any such <hi>Extravagancies</hi> as he alledged it for, and that it was a <hi>daring presumption</hi> in him by such pretences to abuse so <hi>Catholick an Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Churches Faith.</hi> That he produced your <hi>Exposition</hi> for his Warrant of what he had taught, you do not, cannot deny.

                                    </q> And in this you had certainly reason: For it is not easily to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that so great a <hi>Prelate,</hi> who, as you observe, had not very long before himself <hi>Approved your Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> should now prosecute a <hi>poor Man</hi> with such <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence</hi> only for <hi>teaching the</hi> Doctrine of it.</p>

                                 <p>And though I am an utter stranger to his Conduct; yet if this matter did pass so as it appears to have done, I will be bold to say the worst of his <hi>Irregularities</hi> was a <hi>Venial Sin</hi> in comparison of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> his <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan's insincerity;</hi> to prosecute one of his <hi>Clergy</hi> for teaching that <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which in the <hi>General Assembly of</hi> 1682. he had, as you tell us, <hi>himself Approved.</hi>

I could wish that not only for the sake of your <hi>Old Casuists,</hi> but of some at least of your <hi>New Converts,</hi> you had not been so very positive in this particular. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, <hi>Sir,</hi> I could tell you the <hi>Men</hi> who are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed at this day <hi>publickly</hi> to own what you so <hi>confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> deny. And indeed it were better that you your self believed it too, unless you would resolve to leave off to practise it. It being more tolerable to <hi>do evil</hi> by following the guidance of an <hi>Erroneous Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> than to <hi>know</hi> a thing to be <hi>sinful,</hi> and yet to <hi>commit</hi> it.</p>
                                    <p>But you deny that any of your <hi>Church</hi> have ever held any such <hi>Doctrine?</hi> I pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> of what <hi>Church</hi> were those who in their solemn <hi>Theses</hi> publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, (and that in the most formal terms;) <q>
                                          <hi>That it is but</hi> a venial Sin <hi>by false Accusations to lessen</hi> the Authority <hi>of one that detracts from us, if it be like to prove hurtful to us.</hi>
                                       </q> This was openly maintained in the University of <hi>Louvain,</hi> in the Year 1645.

You tell me often that I have <hi>detracted from you,</hi> and my <hi>Authority</hi> therefore, if it be not lessened, <hi>may be hurtful to you;</hi> And how shall I be sure that you esteem it more than a <hi>venial Sin,</hi> by <hi>false Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to <hi>detract</hi> from me?

                                    <p>Thus in the <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Satisfactions,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Meaux</hi> distinguishes between two sorts of <hi>Remission of sins;</hi> the One, wherein <hi>God intirely forgives us,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reserving <hi>any punishment;</hi> the Other a <hi>partial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>

                                       <q>This first manner, <hi>says the Bishop,</hi> being more compleat, and <hi>more conformable</hi> to his GOODNESS, he makes use of it immediately in <hi>Baptism:</hi> but WE SUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSE He makes use of the second in the <hi>Pardon</hi> he grants to those that fall <hi>after Baptism.</hi>

                                    <p>Upon this you make a <hi>Tragical Out-cry</hi> against me <note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 54.</note> for an <hi>incorrigible</hi> FALSIFIER, that though you had before told me of my prevaricating, yet I still <hi>take no Notice of it;</hi> for that the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Meaux</hi> says no such thing. What not as WE SUPPOSE? No; But what then do's He say; Consider, <hi>Reader,</hi> the FALSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICATION; and be astonished at His <hi>Cavil;</hi> He says only, WE BELIEVE. And now let any One from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth trust me that can: that am so plainly caught in so <hi>important</hi> a <hi>Cheat.</hi>

                                    <p>But pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> bating that it serves to fill up your <hi>Catalogue</hi> and <hi>Margin</hi> with a <hi>hard word</hi> against me; what is the great difference now between saying WE SUPPOSE that God does not remit the whole punishment, and WE BELIEVE that he does not. You tell us <q>
                                          <hi>this latter phrase was conformable to his design of an</hi> Exposition, <hi>not a</hi>

Proof.</q> And is not, WE SUPPOSE, as <hi>conformable</hi> to the design of an Exposition, and as little fit <hi>for a proof,</hi> as WE BELIEVE? Really, <hi>Sir,</hi> I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Reader</hi> will think that had you marked this <hi>observation</hi> with A CAVIL in your <hi>Margin,</hi> you would have expressed your self more <hi>properly,</hi> than by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a FALSIFICATION to it. And yet, though it be hardly worth the while, I will tell you what I presume might be the occasion of this little difference; for real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am not yet convinced that it deserves to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a mistake.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In my <hi>Edition</hi> of <hi>Monsieur de Meaux's Exposition,</hi> which I have so often had occasion to speak of, the <hi>word</hi> is neither exactly as you, or I, render it; but another to the same sense, WE ESTEEM. Now this being no very proper <hi>English phrase,</hi> and having not yet set Eyes on your <hi>Translation,</hi> when I wrote my <hi>Exposition,</hi> I chose rather the word WE SUPPOSE, as bearing the <hi>same sense,</hi> and being on this <hi>Occasion</hi> more <hi>generally used</hi> amongst us. This, <hi>Sir,</hi> I believe was the grounds of our difference; and one that had not a huge mind to find faults, would have been ashamed to inscribe so great a <hi>Crime</hi> as FALSIFICATION, to a <hi>trifle</hi> that all Men of sense will despise, and that I ought to <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize</hi> but only for taking notice of.

                                    <p>Another opportunity of clamor that you lay hold on is this; and for meaness Cousin German to the foregoing.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36811:224"/>
                                          <hi>Victims</hi> after <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> but that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self ought to be but <hi>once offered</hi> up to <hi>Death</hi> for us.</q>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In my <hi>Exposition</hi> I thus quote him: <q>
                                          <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> observes, that the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Epistle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <note place="margin">Pag. 67. Art. xxi.</note> That there ought not only no <hi>other victim</hi> to be <hi>offered</hi> for <hi>sin</hi> after that of <hi>Christ,</hi> but that even <hi>Christ himself</hi> ought not to be any more <hi>offered.</hi> Now the reason which the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives is this, <hi>Because that otherwise</hi> (says he) <hi>Christ must often have suffered,</hi> Hebr. IX. 25. Plainly implying that there can be <hi>no</hi> TRUE OFFERING without SUFFERING; so that in the <hi>Mass</hi> then, either <hi>Christ</hi> must SUFFER, which <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Meaux</hi> denys, or he is not OFFER'D, which we affirm.</q>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>But where now is the FALSIFICATION; <q>why I make advantage, you say, of the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s words by <note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 126.</note> an <hi>imperfect Quotation;</hi> For had I added but the <hi>next words,</hi> that would have solved the difficulty.</q> The next words you mean are these; <q>
                                          <hi>That Christ ought to be but once</hi> OFFER'D UP TO DEATH FOR US.</q> The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty was this; <hi>Christ</hi> can be but ONCE OFFER'D, <hi>because</hi> he can no more SUFFER: <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses that <hi>Christ</hi> can <hi>no</hi> MORE SUFFER; (which I think is the meaning of his words, that <hi>he can be but once offered up</hi> TO DEATH FOR US;) therefore he ought to confess, that he can be no more OFFER'D. Good <hi>Sir,</hi> enlighten us a little in this matter: for I assure you By OFFERING I meant OFFERING TO DEATH, the only kind of <hi>offering</hi> that I know of a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Sacrifice;</hi> and the interposing of those words are so far from <hi>clearing the difficulty,</hi> as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that without either them, or some other equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to them, my <hi>Argument</hi> is utterly lost. And
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36811:224"/>
now, let the <hi>Reader</hi> judge, whether that Man be not fond of <hi>Calumniating</hi> his <hi>Adversary,</hi> that can have the face to call this A FALSIFICATION.</p>
                                    <p>And hitherto I have offered some <hi>presumptions</hi> to shew with what <hi>Spirit</hi> you write against us: I will now come to such proofs as shall put it beyond all doubt; and shew you to be, what I am sure ought to lessen your <hi>Credit</hi> against us, a most false and unjust <hi>Accuser</hi> of your <hi>Brethren.</hi> For,</p>

And though I think <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> no more than <hi>Miracles</hi> is not yet ceased in your <hi>Church,</hi> yet you tell me that you do <note place="margin">Reply, Pref. <hi>p.</hi> 24.</note> not your self <hi>pretend</hi> to be <hi>inspired,</hi> and I do not hear that you have at this time any <hi>Hypochondriack La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> amongst you, to deliver <hi>Oracles</hi> to you upon these Occasions.</p>
                                    <p>You reflect upon Me as one, <q>
                                          <hi>who am conscious that I cannot defend my</hi> Cause, <hi>yet have not the</hi> sincerity <hi>to</hi> REPENT: <hi>That I speak such things, as would I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my</hi> Conscience <hi>I</hi> KNOW <hi>to be</hi> FALSE: <hi>that I am</hi> willful <hi>in my</hi> mistakes, <hi>and do not my self</hi> believe <hi>what I</hi> write, <hi>though I am willing that others should.</hi>
                                       </q> Thus you charge me with a sin somewhat like the <hi>sin</hi> against <hi>the Holy Ghost;</hi> that <hi>knowing</hi> the way of <hi>Truth,</hi> I not only refuse to <hi>embrace</hi> it my <hi>self,</hi> but (as you sometimes insinuate too) <hi>keep</hi> as <hi>many others as I</hi> can <hi>out of it.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>But this, <hi>Sir,</hi> I take it, is to <hi>divine,</hi> not to <hi>reason;</hi> should I tell you in return, that I have some cause to believe, that if you do indeed credit your own <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,</hi> it is because you measure my <hi>insincerity</hi> by the <hi>sense</hi> you have of your <hi>own Hypocrisie,</hi> I should
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36811:225"/>
not perhaps be altogether out in my <hi>conjecture.</hi> But, <hi>Sir,</hi> I shall leave you rather to the <hi>Judgment</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to whom <hi>alone these secrets</hi> are known: And to return to my own <hi>Defence;</hi> Tell me I beseech you, <hi>Sir,</hi> (if you can) what occasion my <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> have given you for such <hi>reflections?</hi> Are my <hi>interests</hi> in the <hi>Church of England</hi> so great, or my <hi>expectations</hi> otherwise so low in the World; as to prompt me to such <hi>Villany?</hi> Is <hi>Conversion</hi> so certain a way to ruine, that a Man should rather <hi>damn</hi> himself for ever, than follow the <hi>Dictates</hi> of his <hi>Conscience,</hi> at <hi>this time of day</hi> especially, to embrace your <hi>Religion?</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>It is well known to several of your own <hi>Church</hi> (and whose <hi>Civilities</hi> to me I shall always most <hi>thankfully acknowledge)</hi> with what readiness I have at all times pursued the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>Instruction.</hi> Let them tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> if ever they found me inclined to such <hi>Perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> as you here most <hi>unchristianly</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest against me. They know my <hi>Conduct</hi> whilst I was amongst them; and from what some of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honourably <hi>have done,</hi> I ought not to doubt but that the rest <hi>will</hi> at any time <hi>justifie</hi> Me against such <hi>scandalous insinuations.</hi> So free I was in my <hi>enquiries,</hi> so desirous of understanding both your <hi>Religion</hi> and your <hi>Reasons</hi> to the bottom; that many of your <hi>Church</hi> were inclined to think, what I hear others did not stick confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to report, <hi>That I designed to come over to you.</hi> And though after a most impartial <hi>examination</hi> of your <hi>Arguments</hi> I remained more convinced than ever, both of the <hi>purity</hi> of my <hi>own,</hi> and of the <hi>dangerous corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of your <hi>Church;</hi> yet I assure you, <hi>Sir,</hi> I am the same <hi>indifferent person</hi> I ever was. Not willing indeed to be <hi>deluded</hi> with <hi>Sophistry,</hi> nor to follow every Guide that will without any reason <hi>pretend</hi> to <hi>lead me;</hi>
                                       <pb n="61" facs="tcp:36811:225"/>
but most willing to <hi>yield</hi> to <hi>Truth</hi> whereever I find it. And however you may uncharitably <hi>represent</hi> me to the World; yet I faithfully promise you that if even in this <hi>reproachful Book</hi> of yours, there should be any thing to <hi>convince</hi> me that I have been mistaken, I will not fail ingenuously to acknowledge it; and where I am not convinced, you may suddainly expect to receive my <hi>reasons</hi> of it.</p>
                                    <p>There is now but one <hi>thing</hi> more remaining to make a Demonstrative proof of a <hi>calumniating Spirit</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> in you; and that is,</p>
                                    <p>Lastly; To shew, that you <hi>accuse</hi> me not only of such things as you can never be sure are <hi>True;</hi> but of such as you <hi>know</hi> to be evidently <hi>false;</hi> nay of such as I have shewn you already to be so, and that so clearly, that you have nothing to return to it, and yet still you persist in your <hi>Calumny</hi> against Me.</p>
                                    <p>This I think is the last <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>proof;</hi> and I shall leave it to your self to judge whether I do not make it good against you.</p>
                                    <p>In the Article of <hi>Extreme Unction,</hi> I expounded those words of St. <hi>James,</hi> c. v. 14, 15. Of the <hi>Miraculous Cures</hi> which were in those days common in the <hi>Church;</hi> and added in confirmation of it <q>That Card. Cajetane <note place="margin">Expos. <hi>C. E. p.</hi> 44.

                                          <hi>himself freely confess'd they could belong to no</hi> other.—To this you reply in your <hi>Vindication,</hi> that <hi>Had I said that</hi> Card. Cajetane <hi>thought it could not be proved nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the</hi> Words, <hi>nor from the</hi> effect, <hi>that the Words of St.</hi> James <hi>speak of the</hi> Sacramental Unction <hi>of</hi> Extreme Unction, <hi>but rather of that</hi> Unction <hi>which our</hi> Lord Jesus <hi>instituted in the Gospel to be exercised by his Disciples upon the</hi> sick; <hi>I had been a faithful</hi> Quoter <hi>of his sense; But to say that he freely confesses it can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to no other, is to impose upon my</hi> Readers.</q>
                                    </p>

In my <hi>Defence</hi> I shew the Vanity of this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> That seeing there were but two <hi>interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> proposed of these Words, either to refer them to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Unction,</hi> or to <hi>Miraculous Cures,</hi> for the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> utterly to exclude the <hi>former,</hi> and apply them to the <hi>latter,</hi> was certainly in <hi>effect</hi> (for I pretended not to give his words) to confess that they <hi>could belong to no Other.</hi>

                                    <p>Instead of answering this, you again charge me both in your <hi>Catalogue</hi> and in your <hi>Margin</hi> with FALSIFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION as to this Point. <q>
                                          <hi>I told Him,</hi> say you, <hi>that</hi> Cardinal Cajetane <hi>did not positively say as He affirmed He did:</hi>
                                       </q> And then presently, as if your <hi>Conscience</hi> had given your <hi>Reflection</hi> the <hi>Lie;</hi> you go on, <q>

                                       <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For those <hi>Reflections</hi> which have no relation to the Cause in Hand, but are drawn in meerly to <hi>defame</hi> Me without the least provocation; tho I might pass them by as foreign to my present design, yet I will stop so long as to give some Answer to them. Two of these especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally there are; and of neither of which (excuse me, <hi>Sir,</hi> this little vanity which your <hi>Reflections</hi> force me to) I think I need to be ashamed.

                                          <hi>I speak many things ad faciendum Populum, and my</hi> LEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NED AUDITORS <hi>admire my Learning, and applaud my Eloquence.</hi>
                                       </q> Other <hi>Reflections</hi> of this kind you have, and to which I shall only say, That I have never deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing on those <hi>Occasions,</hi> but what I have firmly believed to be the <hi>Truth;</hi> and which, had I not been so perswaded, I should never have durst to utter in that <hi>Holy place.</hi> And if this be all the <hi>effect</hi> of those <hi>Critical Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-nights
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36811:235"/>
Conferences,</hi> in which (if I am rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) my <hi>Sermons</hi> have sometimes been <hi>put</hi> upon the <hi>rack</hi> by you; I may now conclude that I have not much trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress'd, in those few things I have therein spoken against you.</p>
                                    <p n="2">2. The other thing for which you sometimes reflect upon Me, is <hi>Popularity.</hi> You call me a <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Populacy,</hi> p. 31. you tell the World, <q>
                                          <hi>That I court the</hi> Applause <hi>of the</hi> Vulgar, <hi>p.</hi> 25.</q> And it seems have had the good fortune to obtain it, <hi>p.</hi> 36. Now this, <hi>Sir,</hi> may be a <hi>fault,</hi> if you can say that I have done any thing that is <hi>ill</hi> for it; or that in any of my <hi>Actions</hi> I have managed my self otherwise than I ought to have done in <hi>considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it. But if it should chance to be only your <hi>Envy</hi> or <hi>Concern</hi> at any thing of a <hi>Reputation</hi> you may think I have got in the World, that prompts you to give it so invidious a <hi>Name,</hi> I must then tell you that whilst I know my <hi>Innocence</hi> of any wicked <hi>designs in it,</hi> or <hi>Endeavours after it;</hi> I shall be no more ashamed of, that I pretend to what you call <hi>Popularity;</hi> and I will endeavour, <hi>Sir,</hi> if I can, to be still more <hi>Popular;</hi> that so I may have the greater <hi>influence</hi> upon mens Minds, to perswade them to their <hi>Duty,</hi> and confirm them in that <hi>steadiness,</hi> from which such <hi>false Teachers</hi> as you are, would endeavour to draw them off. But for the rest, I have neither <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> any ones <hi>applanse,</hi> nor gone one step out of the way in which my <hi>Duty</hi> and my <hi>Conscience</hi> have led me, to gain an esteem or interest in the World. In this <hi>Method</hi> by <hi>Gods Grace</hi> I shall always walk; and I make no doubt but my <hi>Learned Auditors,</hi> and my <hi>Friends the Vulgar,</hi> will approve my resolutions. And as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this <hi>Integrity</hi> whereby to deserve their <hi>Regard,</hi> so whilst I keep firm to it, I shall not fear to lose their <hi>Esteem.</hi> The <hi>approbation</hi> that is founded on any other

That in my <hi>whole Defence</hi> there is but <hi>one</hi> thing that can any ways be call'd an <hi>Error</hi> in the TRANSLATION of all those numerous passages I have brought against you, and that such as no one else would, and you (who are so obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to such mistakes as to commit above a <hi>dozen</hi> in the <hi>Translation</hi> of a short <hi>Letter)</hi> ought certainly the least of any to have <hi>censured.</hi> There you shall see the UNSINCERITIES shewn to lie at your own door: The UNCHARITABLE ACCUSATIONS, proved to be, if not the <hi>New,</hi> yet the <hi>Old Doctrine</hi> of your <hi>Church.</hi> The WILFUL MISTAKES, and AFFECTED MIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>APPLICATIONS of EQUIVOCAL WORDS to be no <hi>Mistakes,</hi> nor <hi>Misapplications</hi> at all: What you call a FALSE IMPOSITION in Me, to be indeed a <hi>bold deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> of your own Words: The AUTHORS you pretend to be MISAPPLIED, if there be any such, (for I have yet found them no where but in your <hi>Catalogue)</hi> speaking properly what they were brought for: And the PLAIN CONTRADICTIONS no where to be found but in your own <hi>undistinguishing Brain.</hi> In the mean time I have this only with you to intreat the <q>

                                    <p>There is now only one <hi>Charge</hi> more remaining, and from which I ought, before I proceed farther, to <hi>defend</hi> my self against your <hi>Reflections;</hi> and that is,</p>
                                    <p n="5">V. Concerning the <hi>Ill Language</hi> you pretend I have used in my <hi>Defence;</hi> a fault which I assure you no man more disapproves, nor is more scrupulously careful to avoid than my self; but then I must confess that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I do not think all to be <hi>Ill Language</hi> that you shall please to call so; for tho I esteem it generally the best to use the <hi>softest Expressions</hi> that may be, yet there is a necessity in some cases of speaking plain, and of calling <hi>evil things</hi> by their <hi>proper names;</hi> and really <hi>Sir,</hi> when we have to do with such a <hi>Cause</hi> as yours, and such <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicators</hi> of it as your self, let us do what we can, we must appear to write a <hi>Satyr.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>You are, for instance, very much offended that I should charge your <hi>Church</hi> with <hi>Idolatry;</hi> that I should represent some of your <hi>Saints</hi> as speaking <hi>Horrid Blasphemies;</hi> that I call St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Notions in defence of <hi>Image-Worship, Reveries;</hi> and the <hi>Addresses</hi> with which you <hi>consecrate</hi> them, rather <hi>Magical Incantations,</hi> than <hi>Christian Prayers;</hi> These, <hi>Sir,</hi> are hard words, I do confess; and if I have no <hi>Grounds</hi> for them, <hi>Unjust Reproaches, Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> or what else you please of the like kind; but yet till you answer my <hi>Reasons,</hi> and convince me of my Error, that these things are indeed not such as I suppose, I cannot imagine how I should change my stile; or what other words to find out that might express <hi>my sense,</hi> and yet not offend <hi>your Ears.</hi>
                                    </p>

Again: 'Tis possible, you will hereafter say, that in these very <hi>Reflections</hi> wherein I complain of you for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us <hi>Falsifiers, Calumniatars, Cavillers, Misrepresenters,</hi> and the like, I do yet sometimes my self return the very <hi>same language</hi> upon you; this indeed is true, but then here is the difference, you accuse us of these things <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reason,</hi> often <hi>without</hi> any <hi>Occasion,</hi> and therefore do CALUMNIATE, whereas I never (that I know of) return them upon you, till I have first shewn a just <hi>Cause</hi> for the doing it; and tho it be <hi>Calumny</hi> to call an <hi>Honest man,</hi> a <hi>Knave,</hi> or a <hi>dishonest man,</hi> yet I know not what other kind of <hi>Name</hi> we can give to <hi>him</hi> that is <hi>truly so.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This, <hi>Sir,</hi> is my <hi>Notion</hi> of these things; and if I am out, I shall be most willing to stand corrected by you; in the mean time let us see whereon it is that you ground this <hi>Charge</hi> against me.

                                    <p n="1">I. Refers to the <hi>Rishop of Meaux,</hi> whom as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, <q>
                                          <hi>I have endeavoured to expose by my</hi> Contemptible <note place="margin">Reply, Pref.</note> Raillery.</q> To this I have already replied, That I know not wherein I have been guilty of any thing that looks like <hi>Raillery</hi> in all my treatment of that Bishop, having always been mindful of his <hi>Character</hi> in every thing I have written against him: That I am sorry the necessary <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> has forced me to speak what I have done concerning him; and if after all, I should chance in my pursuit of his <hi>Unsincerities,</hi> (let not that <hi>word</hi> offend you, I have proved before, what I now say, and much more) to have dropt any <hi>Expression</hi> that looks like <hi>Raillery,</hi> as I cannot yet find upon a diligent Examination, that I have done it, so neither will I justifie my self in it, whenever you shall be able to prove your Allegation: But, <hi>Sir,</hi> this is not the only <hi>Instance</hi> in which you give me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36811:237"/>
to complain (in a very mild <hi>Word),</hi> of your <hi>Groundless Accusations.</hi>

                                    <p n="2">II. The other place in which you charge me with this <hi>Fault,</hi> is more considerable, because there you do (what you have seldom done any where else) bring some <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> of it; and out of respect to so extraordinary a piece of <hi>Justice,</hi> I will neither call them by any <hi>hard name,</hi> nor any further insist upon your undue <hi>Repetition</hi> of them.

                                    <p n="1">I. It displeases you that I should call some of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi>'s Notions, REVERIES.</p>
                                    <p>It was indeed a bold thing in me to fail in my Respects to a <hi>Doctor,</hi> who as you tell me <hi>former times</hi> have stiled <hi>Angelical;</hi> I wonder you did not add out of your <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary,</hi> that he was one too who attained to all his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, not by Study and Labour, but by Divine <hi>Inspiration;</hi>

                                    <p>These are <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s Notions on this Point; and these I called his <hi>Reveries,</hi> i. e. His <hi>vain Fancies</hi> and <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and so I still esteem them to be; if you think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and that these <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> are indeed <hi>Conclusive Proofs,</hi> why then do you reject this <hi>Doctrine,</hi>

                                    <p>To conclude; I am perswaded that no one among you has a juster respect for St. <hi>Thomas</hi> than I have; I have always esteemed him an excellent <hi>Doctor,</hi> and profited by his Works; but what can the best man do, when he has not <hi>Truth</hi> on his side? <hi>Error</hi> may be <hi>palliated,</hi> and a greatdeal of Thought be spent, and Wit shewn to give it the <hi>Appearance of Truth,</hi> but when all is done 'tis <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> still; and the <hi>Arguments</hi> that are brought to support it, how <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>subtil</hi> soever they may seem, are yet but <hi>Reveries,</hi> i. e. <hi>Visions, Shadows of Reason,</hi> not <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Conclusive Proofs;</hi> and upon this Ground, tho not only

an <hi>Angelical Doctor,</hi> or a <hi>Crucifix</hi> from a <hi>Wall,</hi> but even an <hi>Angel from Heaven,</hi> should argue in this sort, I should not be ashamed of the Expression, if I had called it <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                                    <p>But if my <hi>Expression</hi> still offends you, consider then, how much more justly these <hi>Practices</hi> scandalize us. Do not tell the World that I reproach Christs <hi>Holy Catholick Church,</hi> as guilty of <hi>Magical Incantations:</hi> No, 'tis <hi>your Church,</hi> the <hi>corrupted</hi> Roman <hi>Church</hi> alone, that I charge as coming in these things too nearly to the <hi>Practices</hi> of the <hi>Heathens: God</hi> be thanked, Christ has other <hi>Churches</hi> that are freed from such Abuses, as all his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <hi>lament</hi> in you, and earnestly desire you would your selves learn at last to be <hi>ashamed</hi> of.</p>
                                    <p>I will add but <hi>one Word</hi> more, and it is this: That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you Censure me any farther for this <hi>Expression,</hi> you will please to remember, that there is another <hi>Practice</hi>
                                       <pb n="94" facs="tcp:36811:243"/>
in your Church, which I might have mentioned in my <hi>Defence,</hi> called <hi>Exorcizing;</hi> but far distant from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ceremony</hi> designed by that <hi>word.</hi> This your <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Authorizes; and for the fuller <hi>Practice</hi> of it, directs us to your <hi>approved Authors;</hi> such as <hi>Mengus,</hi> and some others. The plain <hi>English</hi> of that hard word, you know is <hi>Conjuring,</hi> and the thing does not at all belie the <hi>Name.</hi> You may force me to speak of this if you think fit; and to add to this, your other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Christening of Bells, Consecrating Water; Agnus Dei</hi>'s, and the like; and what wonderful <hi>Benefits</hi> you pretend to derive from thence. But I had rather if you please be prevented in this <hi>design,</hi> than <hi>vindicate</hi> my self so much to your <hi>Churches scandal.</hi>

                              <list>

                              <p n="2">2. Ad pag. 1.] The <hi>former</hi> of these you introduce with a short harangue of <q>
                                    <hi>the Mischief which</hi> Heresie <hi>and</hi> Schism <hi>bring along with them, not only to the individual Persons that are guilty of them, but also to the Nations in which they are propagated.</hi> You represent to us <hi>the miserable Broils, and other worse Consequences that have attended these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies of Religion in this and the last Age:</hi>
                                 </q> And from thence you conclude, <q>
                                    <hi>how much they are to be commended who labour to establish Truth and Unity, and those to be condemned, who seek all means possible to obscure the one and obstruct the other.</hi>

the <hi>Church,</hi> or would more heartily contribute, what in us lies, to the <hi>closing</hi> of them. But then as we have good cause to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve both from the Authority of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and from the Nature of Mankind, that whilst there is a Devil in Hell, and Men of Interest and Designs upon Earth, there shall also be <hi>Heresies,</hi> that <hi>they who are approved may be made manifest:</hi> So we <note place="margin">1 Cor. xi. 19.</note> cannot but complain that those should be the most forward to charge us both with the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Mischief</hi> of them, at whose doors the <hi>Crime,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Evil</hi> Consequences of it, will one day be found to lie. The <hi>former</hi> of these, it will be the business of the following Discourse to make good: And for the <hi>latter,</hi> whosoever shall impartially consider the <hi>Origen</hi> of those Broils with which the World has, you say, been agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated <hi>in this and the last Age upon the account of Religion;</hi> not to mention those other <hi>Mischiefs</hi> of <hi>Treasons, Plots, Massacres, Persecutions,</hi> and the like, will soon be convinced who they are that have cause to complain of <hi>these Evils.</hi> For what you add,</p>

                                    <hi>That they who will but impartially consider mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will find that</hi> Catholicks <hi>have upon all occasions sought the most</hi> Advantageous Means <hi>to procure this</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Peace; <hi>tho to their grief they have still been hindred from effecting this Good Work.</hi>
                                 </q>

                                 <hi>Answ.]</hi> I do not well know what you design by it. If by <hi>the most Advantageous Means,</hi> you understand those <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> which God has given us whereby to come to discern the Truth of Religion; such as, 1. <hi>A diligent reading of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>using</hi> of all imaginable <hi>Assistances</hi> for the understanding <hi>the sense of them,</hi> by studying the <hi>Original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> in which they were written, <hi>searching of Antiquity, colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting parallel places,</hi> and the like. 2. The <hi>divesting</hi> of our selves of our <hi>Prejudices,</hi> and forming in our Minds an <hi>impartial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> to <hi>find out</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> with an honest <hi>readiness</hi> to <hi>embrace it,</hi> on what side soever it lies. And lastly, to all this add our earnest <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for his Grace to bless and prosper our Endeavours; these I confess are the best <hi>Means</hi> to discover <hi>Christian Truth;</hi> and to exhort all others to the use of them, the most <hi>advantageous way</hi> to promote it. But then I cannot imagine why you should seem to appropriate <hi>these Means</hi> to your
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36811:256"/>
selves, as if you only sought <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> by them; seeing it cannot be deny'd but that <hi>We</hi> have employ'd all these with as great diligence as <hi>you can</hi> pretend to have done it. But now some <hi>other Means</hi> indeed there are, which you have pursu'd, and which it may be you understand by this Expression: and then We neither <hi>deny</hi> your <hi>Assertion,</hi> nor <hi>envy</hi> you the <hi>Glory</hi> of being singular in your Endeavours of procuring Peace by them. Such are, 1. The <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence;</hi> your <hi>Holy Leagues,</hi> and <hi>private Treacheries,</hi> your <hi>Inquisitions, Plots, Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions,</hi> and such like. 2. The <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Deceit,</hi> your <hi>false Expositions</hi> and <hi>Misrepresentations</hi> of your Doctrine to deceive the ignorant and unwary, till you get them into your Nets. 3. The <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Uncharitableness,</hi> your bold <hi>Anathema's</hi> and <hi>vain thundrings</hi> of <hi>Damnation</hi> against all that differ from you, your assuming the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> to your <hi>single Communion,</hi> and excluding all others out of it, as <hi>Schismaticks</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And lastly, to mention no more, the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>gross Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> by depriving Men of their liberty of <hi>reading</hi> the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> by keeping your <hi>Service</hi> in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to depend intirely upon your <hi>Churches Dictates,</hi> and not to depart from them, tho <hi>Sense, Reason, Scripture, all</hi> be contrary to them. These are, I confess, some of those <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Means</hi> whereby you have sought to procure <hi>Christian Peace;</hi> and Experience tells you, that they are indeed the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous of any to the <hi>Cause</hi> you have to defend. And if these be the <hi>Means</hi> which you say we have <hi>opposed,</hi> I hope we shall always continue so to do, and rather bear all the <hi>Evils</hi> of these Divisions, than either <hi>buy Peace</hi> upon <hi>such Terms,</hi> or <hi>pursue it</hi> by <hi>such Means</hi> as these.</p>

                                    <hi>That there have been</hi> three <hi>sorts of</hi> Protestants <hi>since the</hi> Reformation; 1. <hi>Some who appealed to</hi> Scripture only, <hi>neither would they admit of</hi> Primitive Fathers <hi>nor</hi> Councils. 2. <hi>Others who perceived that they could not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain several Tenets and Practices of their own by the bare words of</hi> Scripture, <hi>and despairing of Fathers and Councils of latter Ages, pretended at least to admit of the</hi> first four General Councils, <hi>and of the</hi> Fathers <hi>of the first three or four hundred Years. 3. Others finally who ventured to name</hi> Tradition <hi>as a useful Means to arrive at the true Faith.</hi>
                                 </q> And all these you say you have convinced of their Errors.</p>
                              <p n="7">7. <hi>Answ.]</hi> It has always been your way to multiply <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> among <hi>Protestants</hi> as much as ever you were able, and then to complain against us upon the account of them; and here you have given us a notable Instance of it. The <hi>three Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> you have drawn out as so many different Parties amongst us, do all resolve into the very same Principle: <q>
                                    <hi>That the</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture <hi>is the only, perfect, and sufficient Rule of Faith:</hi>
                                 </q> So that all other Authorities, whether of <hi>Fathers,</hi> or <hi>Councils,</hi> or <hi>unwritten Tradition,</hi> are to be examined by it, and no farther to be admitted by us than they agree with it. This is in effect the common belief of all <hi>Protestants</hi> whatsoever, as appears from their several <hi>Confessions,</hi> and might easily be shewn out of the Writings of our <hi>first Reformers,</hi> and the most eminent of those who have lived since, and built their Faith upon the same Foundation. It is true indeed, there have been some who, the better to maintain their <hi>Separation</hi> from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> have from this sound <hi>Principle, That nothing is to be received by us as a Matter of Faith, but what is either plainly expressed in the Holy Scripture,</hi> or can <hi>Evidently be proved by it,</hi> drawn a very <hi>ill Consequence,</hi> viz. <hi>That nothing might lawfully be done or used in the Worship of God, unless there were some Command or Example for it in Scripture;</hi> and have by this means run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into great Inconveniences. But the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which an uninterrupted <hi>Tradition,</hi> by the common consent of all Parties of Christians; however otherwise disagreeing in other Points, has brought down to us, and delivered into our hands as the <hi>Word of God,</hi> this has among <hi>all Protestants</hi> been ever the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36811:257"/>
same, <hi>viz. The Holy Scripture.</hi> And if for the farther proof of the Truth of our Doctrine, we have at any time put the issue of our Cause to the decision of the <hi>Church of the first three or four hundred Years,</hi> it is not because we suppose that those <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> who then lived; have any more right to judg us, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our Faith, than those that follow'd after; but because up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination we find them to have yet continued (at least as to the <hi>common Belief</hi> received and establish'd amongst them) in their <hi>Purity;</hi> and that what was generally establish'd and practised by them, was indeed conformable both to <hi>their</hi> and <hi>our Rule,</hi> the <hi>Word of God.</hi>

                              <p n="32">32.

I speak not now of the great Opposition that was made to it by <hi>Wickleffe,</hi> tho supported by the <hi>Duke of Lancaster,</hi> the <hi>Lord Marshall of England,</hi> and divers others of chiefest note in this Kingdom, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second. I need not say in how many Points he stood up against the Doctrine of your <hi>Church;</hi> what a mighty Interest he had to support him against the Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Rage of the <hi>Bishop of London</hi> and his other Enemies on that account; so as both freely to preach against your Errors, and yet die in Peace in a good old Age. The number of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers was almost infinite, and tho severe Laws were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made against them, yet could they hardly ever be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted out. But yet, least you should say that <hi>Wickleffe</hi> was only a <hi>Schismatick</hi> from your <hi>Church,</hi> which constantly held against him; I will rather shew you in a few <hi>Instances,</hi> that even the <hi>Church of England</hi> it self, which you suppose to have been so conformable to your present <hi>Tenets,</hi> was in truth ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly opposite to your Sentiments in many Particulars. And because I may not run out into too great a length, I will insist only upon two, but those very <hi>considerable Points.</hi>

For the <hi>Scots,</hi> they were <note place="margin">Ibid. l. 1. c. 13.</note> establish'd <hi>Christians</hi> before <hi>Austin's</hi> Time, under <hi>Palladius</hi> their <hi>Bishop;</hi> and your own <hi>Annalist</hi> carries their Conversion yet <note place="margin">

The <hi>Picts</hi> embraced our Faith at the preaching of <hi>Columbanus,</hi> who came hither out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> 32 Years before <hi>Austin's</hi> arrival.

in your <hi>Church</hi> who live in a more excusable <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the Truth, and that these holding still the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and being ready to submit to any Conviction that should be offer'd, may by God's Grace, and a general Repentance, even for their very <hi>Errors</hi> among the rest of their <hi>unknown Sins,</hi> be saved through <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> But yet that you may not <hi>mistake</hi> our <hi>Charity,</hi> give me leave to tell you,</p>
                              <p n="1">(1.) That we think it much more difficult for any one to be saved in your <hi>Church</hi> now, than it was before the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> because that then your <hi>Errors</hi> were neither so well known, nor so fully refuted as they have been since: and therefore <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> was in <hi>those Days</hi> much more <hi>invincible,</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence more fit to <hi>excuse</hi> than it is now.</p>
                              <p n="2">(2.) That for those who live, as you do, in a <hi>Country</hi> where you might, would you sincerely apply your selves to it, find sufficient means of <hi>Instruction,</hi> it is yet <hi>more dangerous</hi> than in those Parts where these Helps are wanting.</p>
                              <p>But especially (3.) will this hold good against <hi>you</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> has call'd to be the <hi>Pastors of his Church,</hi> and whose <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> engages them to be in an especial manner, sedulous and inquisitive; Earnest in their Prayers, and unprejudiced in their Desires to know the <hi>Truth,</hi> more than against the <hi>Lay-members</hi> of your <hi>Church.</hi> So that however we will not judg you, yet neither can we with any comfort say that God will acquit you.</p>
                              <p>And (4.) for those whom by this <hi>Argument</hi> you endeavour to draw away from us; That we confess that Men in <hi>your Church</hi> may be saved, but that you utterly deny that they can be in <hi>Ours,</hi> and therefore it is best for them to be on <hi>Yours,</hi> that is, the <hi>safer Side.</hi> If they do indeed use all possible means to be satisfied in the <hi>Points</hi> in debate betwixt us; if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently apply themselves to the examination of them; and after a diligent trial, remain at last convinced in their <hi>Consciences</hi> that yours is the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>purest Church;</hi> we shall then be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to <hi>hope well</hi> of them, as we do of others of <hi>your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> notwithstanding such a <hi>change.</hi> But now, should <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi> or <hi>Prejudice,</hi> or any <hi>Humane Motives</hi> chance to have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to byass their <hi>Judgments;</hi> if they chuse your <hi>Religion,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this <hi>diligent, and impartial Examination,</hi> and suffer themselves <hi>without Reason</hi> to be <hi>seduced</hi> by you: We must freely profess

our <hi>Charity</hi> in this Assertion is not meant for them; nor do we think your <hi>Church</hi> in this <hi>Case</hi> any way of Salvation at all to such <hi>Converts,</hi> much less a <hi>safer</hi> than that of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> In short, the Sum of this Matter is; We hope <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Men</hi> may be <hi>saved</hi> in your <hi>Communion;</hi> but we are sure they <hi>shall be</hi> in <hi>Ours.</hi> Whether God will condemn you for professing <hi>Errors</hi> that you do not know to be such, we cannot tell, we believe he will not; Sure we are he would damn us, should we who are convinced of your <hi>Corruptions,</hi> be seduced by any base Motives to go over to you.

                                 <hi>Answ.]</hi> And here you think you have found out somewhat to boast of: A <hi>Wonder</hi> indeed not every day to be seen; a <hi>Book</hi> never yet <hi>answered</hi> by us. 'Tis true, I do not know of any one here at home, that has taken the pains to examine the <hi>Clergy's Quotations,</hi> as the <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>Papists protesting against Protestant Popery</hi> has done, for the Instances there offer'd by their <hi>Humble Imitator</hi> the <hi>Representer.</hi> But then the discovery that was made by that <hi>worthy Author</hi> of the whole Cheat, by distinguishing <hi>Matters of Dispute,</hi> from <hi>Matters of Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> has abundantly confuted all their Pretences. We charge you (for Instance) with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for <hi>worshipping of Images, Praying to Saints,</hi> and for <hi>adoring the Host.</hi> If you do not <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Images,</hi> nor <hi>pray to Saints,</hi> nor <hi>adore the Host,</hi> then indeed we <hi>Misrepresent</hi> you.

If our <hi>Reasons</hi> be good, our <hi>Conclusion</hi> will be so too: If they are not, we are then <hi>mistaken</hi> in our Opinion, and you may say we are in an <hi>Error,</hi> but we do not therefore <hi>misrepresent</hi> you. We never yet pretended that you <hi>thought Idolatry</hi> to be <hi>lawful;</hi> or that you <hi>confess'd</hi> that you <hi>committed it:</hi> We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse you of it only as a thing which upon the <hi>Premises</hi> before mention'd, we <hi>conclude</hi> you to be <hi>guilty of;</hi> and in that certainly, if <hi>we misrepresent</hi> any Body, it must be <hi>our selves,</hi> not <hi>you.</hi>

You tell them that you will <q>
                                    <hi>lay down the true State of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt us, and that whatever they find written by us that does not immediately oppose some of those Tenets, they should pass it over, tho never so plausible or pleasing.</hi>

Is not this think you fit to be considered by him? Or is the <hi>Bishop of Meaux's Exposition</hi> become so far the <hi>Guide in Controversie</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> that all other <hi>Expositions</hi> are to be look'd upon as <hi>superannuated,</hi> and this only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>true Interpretation</hi> of your <hi>pretended Catholick Faith.</hi>

                              <p n="66">66. As to Monsieur <hi>Arnaud's Perpetuité,</hi> I do still say that <hi>Diogenes's Demonstration</hi> is the best <hi>Confutation</hi> of it. The Case in short is this; Monsieur <hi>Aubertine</hi> has shewn in the first <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that the Doctrine which we now embrace of the <hi>Holy Eucharist</hi> contrary to <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> was the ancient <hi>Catholick Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> This he confirms by a multitude of clear <hi>Testimonies</hi> drawn out of the Writings
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36811:273"/>
of those <hi>Fathers</hi> who lived in those Times. Now for <hi>Monsieur Arnaud</hi> after this to think to confute this <hi>Evidence</hi> by a <hi>Logical Argument,</hi> that had not the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> been the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> at the beginning, it could never have become so afterwards; and that such a little shift is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to overthrow all those Testimonies, this must certainly be a meer <hi>Reverie,</hi> (you will I hope excuse me that Expression, now you know the meaning of it) and needs no other <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> than to shew him that the <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> is evidently opposite to his Pretences.</p>

You tell us for instance, that the <hi>Holy Cross is upon no account whatsoever to be worshipped;</hi> And yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly your <hi>Good-friday Service</hi> directly leads you to it. But then if your new <hi>Proselyte</hi> begins to enquire what this means; presently you tell him a Story of <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Relative Worship;</hi> and he who knows nothing more of the Matter than you are pleased to let him, humbly submits himself to <hi>yours</hi> and the <hi>Church's Judgment.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="69">69. If we urge your <hi>Expressions</hi> against you, and he fortunes to get something of this by the end; Either you confidently <hi>deny</hi> that you have any <hi>such words,</hi> (a Case which has happen'd to my self in <hi>this very Allegation)</hi> or if you are <hi>baffled there;</hi> then 'tis not (for instance) <hi>Come, let us Adore the Cross;</hi> but, <hi>Come, let us adore Christ who suffered on it:</hi> concerning which we must discourse a little by and by.</p>
                              <p n="70">70. If this too fails, and we shew you plainly that you say, <hi>We adore thy Cross, O Lord:</hi> So that our <hi>Saviour</hi> is himself <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd</hi> from his <hi>Cross</hi> which you worship; then the <hi>Cross</hi> there is put to signify <hi>Christ's Passion;</hi> though I am afraid the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36811:274"/>
                                 <hi>Adoring of Christ's Passion</hi> is something like that which you call <hi>Jargon,</hi> and we in plain <hi>English, Nonsence.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="71">71. If even this be beaten off, and other <hi>Hymns</hi> produced in which that <hi>Cross</hi> is plainly specified which <hi>bore Christ's Sacred Members; the Tree upon whose Arms the Price of the World hung:</hi> then you have your <hi>Figures</hi> ready, 'tis a <hi>Metonymie</hi> in <hi>one line,</hi> a <hi>Prosopopaeia</hi> in the <hi>next;</hi> in the <hi>third</hi> a <hi>conjunction of both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> And with these <hi>Quirks</hi> the poor <hi>Implicite Proselyte</hi>'s Head is turn'd round. He believes there is something meant by all these <hi>hard words,</hi> though he knows nothing of the Matter; and his Opinion of your Integrity, joined with the good assurance with which you pronounce your <hi>Oracles,</hi> and thunder out your <hi>Anathema's</hi> against us as <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks; Calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Falsifiers, Misrepresenters,</hi> and what not? makes him that he no longer questions your Pretences.</p>
                              <p n="72">72. As for your <hi>Authors</hi> he knows nothing of them; or if he did, yet those who have so many <hi>tricks</hi> to elude such <hi>clear Expressions</hi> of their <hi>publick Rituals,</hi> could not want <hi>distinctions</hi> enough to <hi>expound</hi> them. Or however a general out-cry against them as <hi>private Men,</hi> and for whose Opinions <hi>the Church is not to Answer,</hi> will at once silence all such <hi>Allegations</hi> that they shall not make any the least <hi>impression</hi> upon them. By all which it appears that you may (as we affirm you do) <hi>palliate your Doctrine,</hi> and yet your Proselyte be never the wiser for it.</p>
                              <p n="73">73. But now, <hi>2dly,</hi> if he should <hi>discover something of this kind,</hi> yet is it not necessary, that he should therefore present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>return and expose your Villany.</hi> I will suppose that those <hi>few Proselytes</hi> you have made, may all be reduced to these two kinds; <hi>Men of Conscience,</hi> or <hi>Men of Interest and Design.</hi> For the <hi>latter of these,</hi> whilst they serve their <hi>Interests</hi> by the <hi>Change,</hi> there is no great <hi>fear</hi> of their making any such <hi>dangerous Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries.</hi> Religion is not their Concern; and whether it be <hi>New Popery</hi> or <hi>Old</hi> that they embrace, they neither know, nor care: it is to them indifferent; and they understand, as well as value, both alike. As to the <hi>Conscientious Converts,</hi> (allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their <hi>Capacities,</hi> and that they are able to overcome all the foremention'd Difficulties, and to discover the Cheat, which I fear is what the much greatest part of these are not able to do): It is indeed hard to say what a <hi>terrible Conflict</hi>
                                 <pb n="40" facs="tcp:36811:275"/>
this will be apt to make in them. But yet the Point of <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the <hi>Opinion of the World, shame of Return.</hi> and the <hi>dangers</hi> those commonly run who venture to <hi>reveal such Sacred Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> these Considerations have sometimes kept <hi>good Men</hi> a longer time in suspense, than any of your <hi>Proselytes</hi> have yet had to resolve upon a <hi>return</hi> to us. And who can tell, what <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Changes</hi> may one day bring forth?</p>
                              <p n="74">74. Again: We know there have been many in your <hi>Church,</hi> who though they have <hi>discover'd</hi> these <hi>Prevarications,</hi> yet have thought, that as long as they did not themselves <hi>join</hi> in your <hi>Errors,</hi> they might hold their Tongues, and live quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in an <hi>External Communion</hi> with you: and their Eyes have been so dazled with the <hi>Splendor, Succession, Extent,</hi> &amp;c. of your <hi>Church,</hi> that they have preferr'd it with all <hi>its Faults</hi> to Others who seem to them to want these <hi>Advantages.</hi> Such were the famous <hi>George Cassander,</hi> Father <hi>Barnes,</hi> and others that I might mention. Nay, it is no very long time, since a Person yet living, <hi>Monsieur Ferrand,</hi> has publish'd a Book to shew, that were the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> as <hi>corrupt</hi> as we <hi>pretend</hi> it to be, yet we ought not nevertheless to <hi>separate from it.</hi> And should any of your <hi>Converts</hi> be of this <hi>Perswasion,</hi> they may still continue to all appearance in your <hi>Church,</hi> though they see the <hi>Errors,</hi> and your <hi>falsifications</hi> of the <hi>true Doctrine</hi> of it.</p>
                              <p n="75">75. But, <hi>3dly,</hi> though I do affirm that what you publish is not the <hi>Ancient Doctrine</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> yet I do not deny but it is that which you endeavour to make pass with your <hi>Converts</hi> as such. This you teach your <hi>Proselytes,</hi> the <hi>Bishop of Meaux</hi> his <hi>Dioces;</hi> and they rarely meet with any one that maintains the <hi>contrary.</hi> But this do's not hinder, that because this is the <hi>Popery</hi> of a few English <hi>Missionaries,</hi> and <hi>French Expositors;</hi> that therefore it has been all along the <hi>Common Doctrine</hi> of your <hi>Church;</hi> or is conformable to the practice of other Countries at this day. And all Men have not the leisure to go into <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spain;</hi> or the ability to read over your <hi>several Authors</hi> for satisfaction in it.</p>
                              <p n="76">76. But, <hi>4thly,</hi> to quit all these <hi>Suppositions;</hi> yet since you make it no less than a <hi>Mortal Sin</hi> to have any <hi>Doubts</hi> of your <hi>Religion;</hi> you are sure, as soon as any such arise in their Minds to hear of it in <hi>Confession</hi> from them. Being thus acquainted with the <hi>first Motions</hi> of this kind, you presently take all the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36811:275"/>
ways imaginable to <hi>stifle them,</hi> and hinder them from coming to an <hi>open defection</hi> from you. So that though your <hi>Proselyte</hi> should begin to stagger; yet unless he utterly abandon your Party without ever consulting you in it, (which <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> will never do) he is almost under an <hi>Impossibility</hi> of ever doing it at all.</p>
                              <p n="77">77. To all which I will add but this farther: Which well may, and I am perswaded do's keep many from <hi>telling of Tales,</hi> and exposing (as you call it) your <hi>Villany;</hi> and that is, that when you receive a <hi>new Convert</hi> into your <hi>Church,</hi> you require a <hi>terrible Oath</hi> from him, never by <hi>any Argument</hi> to <hi>leave</hi> or to <hi>forsake</hi> you, upon pain of <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> if he do's. And to the end the <hi>Reader</hi> may know, what is the <hi>last step</hi> he is to <hi>make,</hi> if he has any <hi>thoughts</hi> that <hi>way;</hi> and to convince him what little force there is in your <hi>Suggestion,</hi> I will here transcribe it from your <hi>Pontifical,</hi> in its full <hi>length.</hi>

                                    <hi>Thorndyke</hi> spoke the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> in every one of those <hi>Particulars</hi> mention'd by you in Order thereunto, yet I will not enter into any <hi>Controversie</hi> with you about them.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. And first, Be it allow'd that the Words <hi>Prayer, Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Calling upon, Address, &amp;c.</hi> are or may be <hi>Equivocal; i. e.</hi> (as that Learned Man phrases it) <hi>that we may make use of the same</hi> Expressions <hi>in signifying our</hi> Requests <hi>to God and to Man;</hi> tho yet for the two first of these, <hi>viz. Prayer</hi> and <hi>Invocation,</hi> they are seldom Applied to any Other than a <hi>Religious Sense.</hi> This <hi>T.

                                 <p n="2">2. We do not deny but that we ought to <hi>Honour</hi> the <hi>Saints departed,</hi> as well as <hi>Holy Men</hi> upon <hi>Earth;</hi> Only we desire that that <hi>Honour</hi> be such as becomes <hi>them</hi> to <hi>receive,</hi> and <hi>us</hi> to <hi>pay.</hi> We honour them when we <hi>praise,</hi> and much more when we <hi>follow</hi> their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> And because the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of this <hi>Honour</hi> is <hi>Religious,</hi> you may without being contradicted by me call the <hi>Honour</hi> it self <hi>Religious</hi> too; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Nor will I dispute with you, lastly, Whether the <hi>Saints</hi> in Happiness do not in General pray for the <hi>Church Militant:</hi> For 'tis to as little purpose to deny what cannot be disproved, as to affirm what one cannot prove. I have as great an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as any Man for Mr. <hi>Thorndyke</hi>'s Memory; but yet I cannot see the Proof even of this in those <hi>Scriptures</hi> which (as you say) He <hi>proves</hi> it by. Some <hi>Fathers</hi> I know have said <note place="margin">Reply, P. 11.</note> so; but their saying it is not to Me a sufficient Proof of a <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Doctrine.</hi> When all is done, the <hi>Congruity</hi> of the thing is the <hi>best</hi> that can be brought for it. And if upon this account you are resolved to call them <hi>Advocates</hi> or <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors between God and us,</hi> you will I hope excuse me if I do <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> not comply with you in it. That they are full of <hi>Charity</hi> towards us who are Members of the same Body with them, I make not the least Question: But <hi>how</hi> they <hi>express</hi> it I do not certainly know, because many Particulars there are from whence such a Matter is to be concluded, which are all hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from my Knowledge. One thing I know, That we have a <hi>Mediator</hi> at the Right Hand of <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>knows all our Wants,</hi> which I see no reason to believe the greatest <hi>Saint</hi> in Heaven does. I am likewise assured that his <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede</hi> for us is founded upon the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of his <hi>Death.</hi> And since the <hi>Gospel</hi> gives this <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> to <hi>Him ONLY, to appear in the Presence of God for us,</hi> I shall never whilst I live help forward an Ambiguity in those <hi>Titles,</hi> of a <hi>Mediator with God,</hi> or an <hi>Advocate with the Father,</hi> or an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercessor in Heaven,</hi> by attributing of them to any <hi>Saint</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. These <hi>Expressions</hi> so applied are <hi>dangerous,</hi> and <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous;</hi> and 'tis but a frivolous Pretence for the doing of it, that possibly the <hi>Saints</hi> may do something for us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> upon the account of which the <hi>Titles</hi> of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> may in <hi>some sense</hi> be given to them.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. As for the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Question</hi> which you next pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, you should know by this time that we are by no Means <note place="margin">Reply, p. 11.</note> agreed that the only thing in dispute betwixt us is, <hi>Whether it be lawful for us to</hi> Pray <hi>to the</hi> Saints <hi>that they would</hi> Pray for us? and, <hi>Whether such kind of Addresses as these are of

And I shall now offer some Reasons, that may perhaps <hi>convince others,</hi> as they have fully <hi>satisfied my self</hi> about it.</p>
                                    <p n="8">8. For 1. If the Nature of that <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Invoking</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> be the same with that of desiring my <hi>Christian Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to pray for me upon <hi>Earth,</hi> then on the other hand this is also of the <hi>same Nature</hi> with that. And by consequence, I may as well fall down upon my Knees here in <hi>London,</hi> and desire my Christian Brother, who is now, it may be, in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> or somewhere in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> or perhaps on his <hi>return homewards,</hi> to <hi>pray for me,</hi> as do the like to S. <hi>Peter</hi> or S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who, for any thing I can tell, are at a vastly greater distance from me, than my <hi>Friend</hi> upon <hi>Earth</hi> is. But if there be something more than a <hi>Spirit of Charity,</hi> or an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> in <hi>calling</hi> upon my <hi>living friend,</hi> who is out of all <hi>natural distance</hi> of <hi>hearing,</hi> there is also something
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36811:288"/>
more than this in <hi>calling</hi> upon the <hi>dead,</hi> who it may be are a thousand times farther from me, than the living can be from one another. Would not such an <hi>Invocation</hi> of my <hi>Friend,</hi> think you, suppose him to be more than a <hi>Brother,</hi> or a <hi>Man?</hi> Would not the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Act</hi> ascribe to him not only the praise of <hi>Charity,</hi> but likewise the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> all that is said upon Earth, at any distance whatsoever? I grant, that if this were indeed no more than according to the Order of <hi>Fraternal Society;</hi> neither would it be any more than so for you to call upon the <hi>Saints deceased</hi> to pray for you. But if the <hi>former</hi> would be more, when you have said all that you can, the latter must necessarily be so too: And you do thereby <hi>Elevate</hi> the <hi>Saints above the condition of Creatures.</hi> For whether you believe them to be <hi>Omnipresent</hi> or not, the very <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking</hi> them indifferently in <hi>any place,</hi> and their being called upon in <hi>several places</hi> at the same time, does imply their <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence,</hi> unless you could give us some other ground of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that they hear you, besides this, that wherever <hi>they are</hi> when they are <hi>spoken</hi> to, and wherever <hi>you are</hi> when <hi>you speak</hi> to them, 'tis all one, they do as surely know what you say, as if they stood within the <hi>common distance of hearing.</hi> Now that <hi>Action,</hi> which in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of it ascribes an <hi>Immensity</hi> of <hi>presence</hi> to the <hi>Object,</hi> about which it is conversant, is <hi>religious</hi> in the <hi>very Nature</hi> of the <hi>Act.</hi> And then I leave it to you to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether it be <hi>Idolatrous</hi> or not, if it be paid to any thing that is not <hi>God.</hi> But,</p>
                                    <p n="9">9. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you are not yet satisfied, I would desire to know, whether <hi>prayer</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> which you will not deny to be in its <hi>own Nature</hi> a <hi>religious Act,</hi> be not so upon this account as well as others, that 'tis an <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of his <hi>Immense Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi> But how is it such an acknowledgment, otherwise than as we do in <hi>all places,</hi> and at <hi>all times call</hi> upon him. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you do in <hi>all places,</hi> and at <hi>all times call</hi> upon the <hi>Saints</hi> as well as upon <hi>God,</hi> I pray tell us why this <hi>Invocation</hi> should not also be in its <hi>own Nature religious Worship.</hi> If you allow this, then you have already pass'd sentence upon your self: If you do not, I should be glad you would find a little leisure to shew us the difference. This is an <hi>Argument</hi> that has been often enough urged to be taken notice of; and if you shall still go on to say nothing to it, we shall conclude the reason to be, that indeed you have nothing to <hi>object</hi> against it.</p>

10. And what I have now said of this <hi>Invocation,</hi> upon the account of the <hi>distance</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> from us, that they are now out of the compass of all <hi>Civil Commerce;</hi> and therefore to <hi>pray</hi> to them must be properly a <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> will be yet further confirm'd, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by another of your practises; in that your <hi>Church</hi> allows not only <hi>Vocal,</hi> but even <hi>Mental Prayer</hi> to be made to them. Now this can be no <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Civil Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> seeing no <hi>creature,</hi> such as Man (the <hi>Object</hi> of all <hi>Civil Honour)</hi> is, can be capable of searching the Heart, so as to find out the <hi>secrets</hi> of it.

                                       <q>That by addressing <hi>Prayers</hi> to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">Expos. Sect.

                                       </q> Thus he doubles, and treads with fear, like a Man that has lost his Way in a dark Night, and is afraid of a Ditch every Step he takes. To say that the <hi>Saints</hi> know

All our <hi>Wants</hi> and <hi>Desires,</hi> and the <hi>Secrets of our Hearts,</hi> is to give them <hi>a certain kind of Immensity</hi> which He dares not say they have; and therefore those Words are slipt in, that <q>

                                       </q> Now <hi>a certain Degree of Knowledge,</hi> seems not to be <hi>a certain kind of Immensity;</hi> and so you are for a while safe on that side.

So that now the <hi>Prayers</hi> are <hi>profitable</hi> again; but then what shall we do to keep off <hi>Immensity</hi> from being <hi>attributed</hi> to the <hi>Creature?</hi> He has a Trick for that, and it is this; <hi>viz.</hi> That this kind of <hi>Immensity</hi> or Knowledge of <hi>all Prayers</hi> that are or can be any where offer'd to them, is <hi>communicated to them by God,</hi> and as long as <hi>God</hi> has made them thus <hi>immense,</hi> we may do so too.</p>

                                    <p>Now, not to enter on an Enquiry, how far these <hi>Expressions</hi> will in some measure apply the very <hi>Sacrifice</hi> it self to those <hi>Saints;</hi> it being hardly intelligible otherwise what <hi>Honour</hi> can be done to the <hi>Saints,</hi> by a Sacrifice offer'd solely to God; it cannot be doubted, but that this being confessedly a <hi>proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Act,</hi> whatever <hi>Honour</hi> is hereby done the <hi>Saints,</hi> must be <hi>strictly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> a <hi>Religious Honour;</hi> not meerly in <hi>denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but in the very Nature of the thing it self. And I desire Monsieur de <hi>Meaux</hi> to tell us, whether this too <hi>be done with the same Spirit of</hi> Charity, <hi>and in the same Order of</hi> Brotherly Society <hi>with which we intreat our Brethren upon Earth to pray for us.</hi> And what would be thought of him, that out of <hi>kindness</hi> or <hi>respect</hi> to his <hi>fellow Christian,</hi> should offer up the <hi>Son of God</hi> for his <hi>Honour,</hi> or (as the last <hi>Prayer</hi> has it) in his <hi>Veneration.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

I do not pretend that this is properly an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> to <hi>Saints;</hi> and therefore I propose it only as a <hi>Circumstance</hi> from whence to conclude what the true <hi>Nature</hi> of your <hi>Invocation</hi> of them is. For if it appear, that the other parts of that <hi>Worship</hi> you pay to the <hi>Saints,</hi> are <hi>properly Religious Acts,</hi> it will not be doubted but that your <hi>praying</hi> to them is certainly so too. And tho you have restrain'd the <hi>terms</hi> of our <hi>Question</hi> to this one particular <hi>Instance,</hi> of <hi>calling upon them,</hi> yet it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces me in general to conclude against you, that you do give proper <hi>Religious Honour</hi> to others besides <hi>God,</hi> if it appear, that any part of that <hi>Worship</hi> you pay to the <hi>Saints</hi> is such.</p>

                                          <p>Ibid.] And first you say, <q>My <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Centurists</hi> of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> acknowledg that <hi>Origen</hi> prayed to <hi>Job,</hi> and admitted the <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Angels.</hi>

But now did you never hear in your Life, that your <hi>Brethren, Erasmus, Sixtus Senensis, Possevin, Bellarmine, Baronius, Labbé, Du Pin,</hi> &amp;c. have all confess'd, that neither the <hi>Tracts,</hi> nor <hi>Comments</hi> upon <hi>Job</hi> were <hi>Origen</hi>'s?

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36811:305"/>
Secondly, that another of your Brethren <hi>Card.</hi> du <hi>Perron,</hi> has <note place="margin">Replique au roy de la Grande Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne liv. v. c. 13. p. 982.</note> utterly rejected the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Origen,</hi> as an incompetent Witness in <hi>matter of fact,</hi> and that especially in the very <hi>Point</hi> before us? Were you indeed so ignorant, Thirdly, as not to know how opposite this <hi>Father</hi> is to you (as I shall presently shew) in his undoubtedly <hi>genuine</hi> Works as to this matter? As for the other Passages you quote, Fourthly, out of his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> besides that He there supposes the <hi>Angel present with Him:</hi> Could you look upon this <hi>place</hi> and not see that <hi>another</hi> of your <hi>Brethren,</hi> your own <hi>Editor,</hi> calls it an <hi>Apostrophe to His Guardian Angel;</hi> and I desire you to try if you can make any more of it. And Lastly, for what you <hi>finally</hi> alledge out of his <hi>Lamentations;</hi> did you in good earnest not know that it was a <hi>Book</hi> mark'd, not by your <hi>Brethren</hi> only, but by your <hi>Holy Father Pope Gelasius</hi> as <hi>Apchryphal;</hi> and rejected as such by all the <hi>Learned Men</hi> of your own <hi>Communion?</hi> So <hi>unfortunate,</hi> or rather <hi>unfaithful</hi> have you been in your first <hi>Entry</hi> upon <hi>Antiquity.</hi> It may be you will go on a little better.</p>
                                          <p>Reply.] You tell us in the next place a story of one <hi>Justina,</hi>

Answer.] If by this Story you design to prove the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints</hi> to have been the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> within the first 300 Years, (and indeed it is for this you do produce it,) I must then again complain of your <hi>Unsincerity;</hi> seeing it is both acknowledged by your own <hi>Authors,</hi> and indeed <note place="margin">Reply p. 17.</note> confess'd by your own self, that <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken in the relation, and attributed that to the great St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which could not belong to Him.

                                          <p n="61">61. But Secondly, Had there been any truth in this <hi>Story,</hi> even with reference to this other <hi>Cyprian,</hi> how comes it to pass that none of the ancient <hi>Martyrologies,</hi> no not your own

                                             <hi>Breviary,</hi> since the <hi>Reformation</hi> of it, makes the least mention of any such thing: Would all these have omitted so Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a <hi>Passage</hi> had there been any grounds of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it.</p>
                                          <p n="62">62. To Reply therefore to this Instance, I say, It is more than probable that St. <hi>Gregory</hi> took up this <hi>Story</hi> either from some <hi>flying report,</hi> or out of some <hi>Counterfeit Acts:</hi> For one part of it, at least that which relates to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> you confess your <note n="†" place="margin">

And if any other <hi>Cyprian</hi> we hear nothing either in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> or any other <hi>Historian</hi> or <hi>Writer</hi> of that Age.

They tell us that the <hi>Cyprian</hi> here meant was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and suffer'd Martyrdom at <hi>Nicomedia</hi> with St. <hi>Justina:</hi> And thus it stood in your own <hi>Breviary</hi> too till the <hi>Reformation</hi> of it by the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> But now it is beyond dispute e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident <note place="margin">Vid in Brev.

                                          <p n="81">81. But I will go yet farther with you as to this <hi>Instance;</hi> and to that end I must tell you, that your <hi>Authors</hi> have very much deceived you in their Accounts of it. For first, It was not the <hi>Synod,</hi> but only a <hi>Party</hi> in that <hi>Synod,</hi> that cry'd out, <hi>Let</hi> Flavian <hi>the</hi> Martyr <hi>pray for us.</hi> And secondly, Even they that did cry out thus, were as far from designing to <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>Flavian</hi> at all, as you were from understanding the meaning of their <hi>Exclamation.</hi> The Occasion of those Words in short <note place="margin">Labbé Conc. Tom. iv. Act. xi. p. 697. B.</note> was this: In the Eleventh and Twelfth <hi>Actions</hi> of that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> there arose a difficult Debate concerning <hi>Bassianus</hi> and <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi> whether of the two was lawful <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus. Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> had this Plea, That he had held it quietly Four years; that <hi>Proclus</hi> and his <hi>Successors, Bishops</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had communicated with him as lawful <hi>Bishop</hi> of that <hi>See;</hi> among whom was <hi>Flavianus</hi> but lately deceased. Upon this the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were of <hi>Bassianus</hi> Party urged to the <hi>Synod,</hi> that <hi>Flavian</hi> by communicating with him, had acknowledged him to be lawful <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> And thereupon press the <hi>Holy Bishops</hi> to have this respect to <hi>Flavian a Catholick</hi> and <hi>Martyr,</hi>
                                             <pb n="112" facs="tcp:36811:309"/>
as to acknowledge <hi>Bassianus</hi> to be the true <hi>Bishop,</hi> seeing he had <hi>Communicated</hi> with him as such. And here comes in among other <hi>Expressions,</hi> this that is the Subject of our present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. The <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> cry out, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their late <hi>Martyr,</hi> 
                                             <q>This is the truth; this we all say: Let the Memory of <hi>Flavian</hi> be eternal; let the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the <hi>Orthodox Flavian</hi> be <hi>eternal: Flavian</hi> lives after his Death; <hi>Let the Martyr pray</hi> (or entreat) <hi>for us; Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> judges with us. </q>This was the Occasion of those words; and it plainly shews, that all they meant by them was, That the Judgment of <hi>Flavian,</hi> a Holy <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Martyr,</hi> should prevail with the <hi>Synod</hi> to judge of <hi>Bassianus</hi> side, with whom <hi>He</hi> had <hi>Communicated.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p n="82">82. As for your Argument, That had this <hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>Praying</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> been introduced in the <hi>Fourth Age,</hi> it would certainly have been condemned in the following: I reply, First, That this is at most but a meer <hi>Presumption,</hi> against plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> and such as not only this, but too many other Corruptions which have crept into the <hi>Church,</hi> without any notable Opposition for some time made to them, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly overthrows. But, Secondly, Tho your <hi>Argument</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (if we should allow it) would be good for little; yet it has another Misfortune too, which most of your <hi>Proofs</hi> labour under, that it is as <hi>false</hi> as it is <hi>unconclusive.</hi> For, Good Sir, did you never, in your Enquiry into these Matters, hear of such a Canon as the Thirty fifth of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Laodicea, Anno</hi> 364. expresly condemning the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Angels?</hi> Did you never meet with such an <hi>Order</hi> as that of the Third <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> in S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time, commanding <q>all the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>

Nor was he alone in this Quarrel: S. <hi>Jerome</hi> speaks of several <hi>Bishops</hi> that were of his <hi>Party,</hi> and join'd with him in his Endeavours against this growing Evil. Even S. <hi>Austin</hi> himself, as appears from many Places of his Works, spoke not a little contrary to it, and plainly insinuates he <note place="margin">Vid. Epist. ad Januar.

Whether it were that they could not so soon forget their <hi>ancient Rites;</hi> or that they thought it a <hi>religious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy</hi> to extend the <hi>pale</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> by suiting <hi>Christianity</hi> as much to the <hi>Heathen Ceremonies</hi> as it was possible, and to <hi>dispose</hi> men thereby the more <hi>readily to embrace</hi> it; Or whether finally, that <hi>simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> which suited well enough with a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>persecution,</hi> was now thought too mean for an <hi>Establish'd Church,</hi> the <hi>Religion of the Emperour,</hi> and they were therefore willing to render it more <hi>pompous,</hi> and set it off with <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lustre</hi> in the Eyes of Men, tho in so doing they a little depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>purity</hi> of their lower and better State.</p>
                                          <p n="90">90. Let us add to this, the <hi>Opinion</hi> which then began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail among those <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> of the <hi>particular intercession of the Saints for us;</hi> and which both the <hi>prayers</hi> that were made in those days at the memories of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and the <hi>Miracles</hi> God was sometimes pleased to work there; not to say any thing of the <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Apparitions</hi> that were sometimes thought to be seen there, very much confirm'd them in. Now this naturally prepared the way for the <hi>Invocation</hi> which follow'd upon it. For now the <hi>Poets</hi> began instead of their <hi>Muses,</hi> to call (more <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly)</hi> upon the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> to assist them. The <hi>Orators,</hi> following the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Age,</hi> indulged themselves all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their <hi>Eloquence,</hi> in <hi>Apostrophe's</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> at their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories. And as things seldome stop in their <hi>first beginnings,</hi> by degrees through the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of some, and <hi>superstition</hi> of more; they fell into a formal <hi>Invocation,</hi> about the beginning of the Vth. <hi>Century.</hi>

But here another <hi>accident</hi> fell out for the <hi>carrying on</hi> of this <hi>Service.</hi> For about this time <hi>Nestorius</hi> began to teach that men ought not to call the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> the <hi>Mother of God.</hi> Now this made some think his design was secretly to revive the <hi>Heresie</hi> of <hi>Arrius</hi> or <hi>Sabellius</hi> under a new Cover; and their Zeal for the <hi>Divinity of Christ</hi> made them in the <hi>Council of Ephesus, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>

Can all their <hi>Expressions</hi> be fairly reduced to such <hi>Apostrophe's?</hi> To this I have already said, that We do acknowledge that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the latter end of this <hi>Century,</hi> S. <hi>Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory Nyssen,</hi> amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and their great Imitator S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> among the <hi>Latins,</hi> did begin to <hi>Invocate</hi> the <hi>Saints.</hi> And had you thought fit to consult that Excellent <hi>Treatise</hi> to <note place="margin">Discourse of Worship of Saints in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Mr. de Meaux's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the IV.

                                          <p n="96">96. But then that you may not put any more such <hi>Crude notes</hi> upon your <hi>Reader</hi> as you have done here, where you say, <q>That <hi>Protestants grant</hi> Praying to Saints <hi>to have been</hi> establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in the IVth.</hi> Age:</q> I will very briefly <hi>transcribe</hi> from two Learned Men of our <hi>Church</hi> some considerable <hi>differences</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                                             <hi>Fathers</hi> of this <hi>Century</hi> did, and what you do now; and of which if you will not yet be perswaded to take any <hi>notice,</hi> I hope at least all indifferent persons will see by them how <hi>impertinently</hi> you alledge their <hi>Authority</hi> for your <hi>Excuse.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>First, That in your <hi>Church, Prayer</hi> to <hi>Saints</hi> is look'd upon <note place="margin">Ushers answer to a challenge. P. 409.</note> as a part of <hi>Worship</hi> that is <hi>due</hi> to them; insomuch that (as I have shewn) <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine</hi> places it among one of those <hi>Advantages</hi> that accrues to them upon their <hi>Canonization:</hi> But this those Holy <hi>Fathers</hi> never believed; on the contrary they absolutely <hi>define prayer,</hi> as a <hi>service proper to God only,</hi> and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against the <hi>Arrians</hi> upon this very <hi>Topick,</hi> that Christ must needs be <hi>God,</hi> because the <hi>Church</hi> prayed to him.</p>
                                          <p>
                                             <pb n="118" facs="tcp:36811:312"/>
If you pretend that there are two sorts of <hi>Prayers,</hi> one <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> another that is not: I reply, 1. That this is <hi>false,</hi> because (as we have seen) all <hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> and therefore <hi>proper</hi> to <hi>God only.</hi> Secondly, It concludes nothing; because you offer the most <hi>proper sort</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> for <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> to the <hi>Saints,</hi> that you can do to <hi>God</hi> himself.</p>
                                          <p>Secondly, In your <hi>Church</hi> you allow <hi>mental Prayer</hi> as well as <hi>Vocal</hi> to be made to the <hi>Saints:</hi> But in the <hi>Primitive,</hi> this <note place="margin">P. 401.</note> was reserved as peculiar to Him who <hi>searcheth the Heart,</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone knoweth</hi> the <hi>Secrets</hi> of all the <hi>Children of Men.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Thirdly, In your <hi>Church</hi> it is resolved that the <hi>Saints</hi> are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> your <hi>requests:</hi> In the <hi>Primitive</hi> this <note place="margin">P. Ibid. &amp;c.</note> was never <hi>determined,</hi> and the contrary seems to have been the most generally received.</p>
                                          <p>Fourthly, In your <hi>Church</hi> formal Prayers are made to the <hi>Saints;</hi> But the <hi>Addresses</hi> of these <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> were either <hi>wishes</hi> 
                                             <note place="margin">P. 405.</note> 
                                             <hi>only, or requests</hi> of the same nature with those which are in this <hi>kind</hi> usually made to the <hi>living;</hi> where they who are requested, be evermore accounted in the Number of those that <hi>pray for us,</hi> but none of those that are <hi>prayed unto by us.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Fifthly, In your <hi>Church</hi> the Saints are made not only <hi>joynt Petitioners</hi> with us, but <hi>Advocates</hi> too; and that to plead not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">P. 408.</note> 
                                             <hi>Christs Merits,</hi> but their own likewise. But against this these <hi>Fathers</hi> openly protested as an open derogation to the high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of our <hi>Saviors meritorious Intercession,</hi> and a manifest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon his Great <hi>Office of Mediation.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Sixthly, In your <hi>Church</hi> it is thought a more <hi>proper way of access,</hi> and a <hi>surer</hi> means of <hi>obtaining</hi> your <hi>requests</hi> to address by <note place="margin">P. 410: 416.</note> some <hi>Saint</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> than to go immediately to the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Grace, through</hi> our <hi>Saviour Christ.</hi> But this those Fathers earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposed, exhorting all men to go directly to <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>Son Jesus Christ.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Seventhly, In your <hi>Church</hi> the Saints are indifferently called upon all the World over; which does in effect attribute a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> 
                                             <note place="margin">Discourse in Answer to Mr. de Meaux's Appeal to the IVth. Age. p. 82. &amp;c.</note> 
                                             <hi>perfection, viz.</hi> That of <hi>Omnipresence</hi> to them: But in the Primitive <hi>Church,</hi> those who sought the <hi>Intercession</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> limited their <hi>presence</hi> to some <hi>determinate places,</hi> as particularly to their <hi>Memories,</hi> where they thought them within <hi>Hearing;</hi> and did not call upon them <hi>indifferently every where.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p>Eightly, This in your <hi>Church</hi> is an <hi>establish'd practice;</hi> they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36811:312"/>
who oppose it are declared to <hi>do wickedly,</hi> and an <hi>Anathema</hi> is pronounced against them on that account. But in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive there was no <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Order</hi> for it; it was the effect of a <hi>private</hi> and <hi>voluntary Zeal,</hi> encouraged it may be by the <hi>Guides</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> but no part of the <hi>established</hi> Service of it.</p>
                                          <p n="97">97. And this may suffice to shew how vain your pretences to the <hi>Antiquity</hi> even of <hi>this Age</hi> are to warrant your <hi>Superstition;</hi> and upon what slender grounds you affirm, after your <hi>Master</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> that this <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> was <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd,</hi> nay that <hi>we grant</hi> it was <hi>Establish'd in the Fourth Age.</hi> But to convince you yet more with what little reason you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boast of this, or tax us with receding from our <hi>old prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of being <hi>tryed</hi> by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the First <hi>Four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils;</hi> upon this account I will now make you a more Liberal offer; and that is to prove if you can any Authentick <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment</hi> of this <hi>Service</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> I do not say now in the <hi>Sixth Century;</hi> but in the <hi>Seventh:</hi> Nay or even before the latter end of the <hi>Eighth:</hi> In <hi>short,</hi> I do affirm that the <hi>first solemn Establishment</hi> of it was in the Second <hi>Council of Nice</hi> 787. and indeed that <hi>Synod</hi> which decreed the <hi>Worship of Images</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> was the most <hi>proper</hi> to define the <hi>Religious Invocation of Saints</hi> contrary to the First: And because there is something almost as bad in the <hi>manner</hi> of the <hi>Establishment,</hi> as in the <hi>thing</hi> it self, I will <hi>close</hi> all with a brief account of it.</p>

any such thing charged by any of the Ancients upon <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> as is pretended; had S. <hi>Paul</hi> designed only to forbid one particular <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Religious Worship</hi> being paid to them, would he in General have said that they were not to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped?

                                             </q> And from whence therefore we may warrantably infer, that in those <hi>first Ages praying</hi> TO <hi>Saints</hi> was not establish'd, seeing it was then the general Custom to <hi>pray</hi> FOR <hi>them.</hi>

                                             </q> In what doubt is your Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi> still in his <hi>Exposition,</hi> and you know he was once in a great deall more? All he has to say is that you teach <q>
                                                <hi>That your prayers to the</hi> Saints <hi>are very</hi> profitable, <hi>Whether it be that they know them by the</hi> Ministry <hi>and</hi> Communication <hi>of the</hi> Angels; <hi>or whether it be that</hi> God <hi>himself makes known to them our desires by a</hi> particular Revelation; <hi>or whether it be that he discovers the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to them in his</hi> Divine Essence <hi>in which all truth is Comprised.</hi>
                                             </q> If we enquire of your more Ancient <hi>Authors,</hi> we shall find all full of <hi>Uncertainty.

In short, how the <hi>Saints</hi> hear your <hi>prayers</hi> you do not pretend to know; and I desire you to give Me but one rational Argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me that (by whatever means it is) they do <hi>ordinarily,</hi> and <hi>constantly,</hi> and <hi>certainly,</hi> and <hi>particularly,</hi> understand the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses</hi> that you make to them. For to deal freely with you, I never yet met with any thing that but inclined me to believe this, but much to the contrary.</p>

Now this I the rather desire to be satisfied in because here again I find your <hi>Authors</hi> very much unresolved what to say.</p>
                                          <p>First, It is but the <hi>common Opinion,</hi> (no matter of <hi>Faith)</hi>

(He means those of your <hi>Communion)</hi> who do not think it without doubt that all whom your Church has <hi>Canonized</hi> are indeed <hi>Saints:</hi> And he mentions no less a man than <hi>Cardinal</hi>

                                             <hi>Cajetane</hi> for one. And that <hi>Cardinal</hi> in the book to which <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez</hi> refers, alledges the great Doctour of your <hi>Schools</hi> S. <hi>Thomas</hi> for another.

                                          <p>Thirdly, It is confessed by those of your own <hi>Church</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your <hi>Canonized Saints,</hi> some there have been whose <hi>Lives</hi> were not to be <hi>commended:</hi> Others whose <hi>Opinions</hi> have been condemned as <hi>Heretical;</hi> and for my part, when I consider the <hi>Character</hi> of some to whom you <hi>pray,</hi> such as <hi>Thomas a Becket, Dominick,</hi> &amp;c. I cannot but say, that if these be the men whom you place in <hi>Heaven,</hi> what the poor <hi>Indians</hi> did of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> that then the other is certainly the more desirable portion. For, and I am perswaded that were but S. <hi>Martin</hi> again alive to summon their <hi>Souls</hi> before him, as he once did that of a <hi>suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saint</hi> in his time, they would make the same <hi>Confession</hi> that <note place="margin">Vid Bellar. de beat. SS. l. 1. cap. 7.</note> wretched <hi>Spirit</hi> is reported to have done, and prove much more worthy your <hi>Compassion</hi> than your <hi>Adoration.</hi> Now that which the more encreases this danger is</p>
                                          <p>Fourthly, The almost infinite <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> that have been received amongst you, and whose <hi>Consecration</hi> depending whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> in which you do not pretend the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> it can hardly be supposed but that he must have very often proved mistaken. For to keep only to your own <hi>Order;</hi> a late <hi>Author</hi> of yours tells us, that your <hi>Domestick Saints</hi>

Now to consider all the Arts and Intrigues that are used to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure these <hi>Canonizations;</hi> by what <hi>Popes</hi> many of them have been placed in Heaven; what Characters several among them have in your own <hi>Histories</hi> of their Lives; these and many other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections</hi> would I confess prompt me, were I otherwise as well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the <hi>Innocence</hi> of this <hi>Worship,</hi> as I am fully convinced of the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of it, yet to <hi>pray</hi> to the greatest part of your <hi>Saints,</hi> as he once did to <hi>Saint Cutbert; Si Sanctus sis, Ora pro me:</hi> IF THOU ART A SAINT, pray for me.</p>
                                          <p n="129">129.

Thirdly, That which is the worst of all, is, that you have not only <hi>no certainty</hi> of the Happiness of those <hi>Saints</hi> whom you <hi>Canonize,</hi> but you <hi>pray</hi> to some who (for ought appears) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any <hi>Being</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi>

No Man can <hi>reasonably</hi> pray in Faith to such Persons, as he can never be sure are able either to <hi>hear</hi> his <hi>Prayers,</hi> or to <hi>answer</hi> his <hi>desires:</hi> But you can never be sure that your <hi>Saints</hi> are able to do either of these; and therefore you cannot <hi>reasonably</hi> pray with any good assurance to them. 2. It is <hi>unreasonable</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> to those as <hi>Saints,</hi> who, it may be, are not in <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor ever shall be there: But this is very probably the <hi>Case</hi> of many of your <hi>Saints,</hi> and you cannot be sure it is otherwise, when you address to them; and therefore it is <hi>unreasonable</hi> in you to <hi>pray</hi> to them. 3. To pray to those who never were in the World, is the most <hi>unreasonable</hi> thing that can be imagined; but in your <hi>Prayers</hi> to many of your <hi>Saints,</hi> you address to those that never were in the World; and therefore upon this, and upon all the foregoing Accounts, I conclude it very <hi>unreasonable</hi> to pray to the <hi>Saints</hi> at all.</p>
                                          <p>There is yet one thing more remaining to finish this whole <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> viz.</p>

the greatest Charity imaginable for us, yet they have withal their</hi> Wills <hi>so intirely conformed to the</hi> Will of God, <hi>as not to lend any assistance to us, but according to what they see the</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>and</hi> Will of God <hi>disposed towards us.</hi>
                                             </q> An excellent <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion</hi> certainly; and which no one can doubt to be most true. But then it will follow from it, that you do in vain sollicite the <hi>Saints,</hi> who cannot lend you any assistance, till <hi>God</hi> is pleased to permit himself to be <hi>intreated</hi> for you. Whilst our <hi>Heavenly Father</hi> is our <hi>Enemy,</hi> all the <hi>Host of Heaven</hi> are so too. We must first be reconciled to him, before ever we can expect any <hi>favour</hi> or <hi>acceptance</hi> with them. In short, it was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of an antient <hi>Father,</hi> whom I before mentioned, <q>That the only way to make the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> our Friends, is to make <hi>God</hi> so first:</q> And tho' we know little of what those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Spirits</hi> above do for us, yet we have all the reason in the World to <hi>believe</hi> that they <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hate</hi> according to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Pleasure;</hi> and if they do <hi>pray</hi> for us, the most ready way to obtain their <hi>Prayers,</hi> is to be constant, and zealous, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing both in our <hi>Prayers</hi> and Piety towards <hi>God,</hi> through his <hi>Son Jesus Christ</hi> our Lord.</p>

                                                <hi>be any matter of Religion to us to</hi> Worship dead Men; <hi>because if they have lived well, they desire no such Honour, but rather that we should</hi> Worship him; <hi>by whose Illumination they rejoyce, that we are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of their Piety. They are therefore to be</hi> Honoured <hi>for our</hi> Imitation, <hi>not to be</hi> Worshipped <hi>out of</hi> Religion—<hi>And the same let us think of</hi> Angels; <hi>that they above all things, desire that we should, together with them,</hi> Worship God only, <hi>in whose Vision they are happy—Tying our Souls to</hi> him alone, <hi>from which</hi> Religion <hi>derives its very Name, let us lay aside all Superstition. Behold I Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> one God, <hi>the One principle of all things—Whatsoever</hi> Angel <hi>loves this</hi> God, <hi>I am sure that he</hi> loves me <hi>too. Whosoever remains in him, and can understand the</hi> Prayers <hi>of Men, in him he hears me. Whosoever has</hi> God <hi>for his Good, do's in him help me—Let the</hi> Adorers <hi>of the parts of the Universe tell me: What good person is there that he does not reconcile to himself, who Worships him only whom every good person loves, and in whose knowledge he rejoyces, and by recurring to which principle, he becomes good. Let therefore</hi> Religion <hi>bind us to the</hi> One God Almighty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                             </q> But I insist too long on these Reflections: I add only,</p>
                                          <p>
                                             <pb n="142" facs="tcp:36811:323"/>
Secondly, To <hi>close</hi> all, That this <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints departed,</hi> is as <hi>Impious,</hi> as it is <hi>Unprofitable.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p n="143">143. For First, To take this Practice in the most Moderate <hi>Sense</hi> that may be, yet to <hi>pray</hi> to any Creature after the manner that you do to the <hi>Saints departed,</hi> is to make them the <hi>Objects</hi> of a proper <hi>Religious Worship,</hi> and to pay that Service to the Creature, which is due only to the Creator; and this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cannot be done without a very great <hi>Impiety.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p n="144">144. Secondly, To <hi>pray</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> but only as <hi>Intercessors,</hi> even this do's usurp upon the peculiar Prerogative of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> who is our <hi>only Mediator,</hi> and whose singular Priviledge it is <hi>to appear in the presence of God for us.</hi> And to joyn others with Christ in his great Office and Employment, to make to our selves <hi>new Mediators;</hi> what is this but tacitely (at least) to imply, that we dare not trust either his <hi>Mercy,</hi> or his <hi>Interest;</hi> in the concern of our <hi>Everlasting Salvation.</hi> But then</p>
                                          <p n="145">145. Thirdly, To <hi>pray,</hi> as you evidently do, not only that the <hi>Saints</hi> would <hi>intercede</hi> for you, but that God would be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you, not only through the <hi>Merits</hi> of Christ, but of the <hi>Saint</hi> whose Memory you celebrate; this is a downright under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of our Saviour's <hi>Bloud, and do's despight unto the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p n="146">146. Fourthly, To pray to the <hi>Saints,</hi> (as if we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to understand the meaning of plain words you do) as the Arbitrary Dispensers of Benefits to you, that they would them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves grant you those things which you ask of them; this makes your <hi>Service</hi> yet more <hi>intollerable.</hi> And tho' you seek to evade the justice of this <hi>Censure</hi> by those unreasonable <hi>Expositions</hi> of your <hi>prayers,</hi> I have before refuted, yet I am sure it ought to be more than enough to make us avoid that <hi>practice</hi> which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused but by such forced Interpretations, as should men use the like on other Occasions, all <hi>Society</hi> must be overthrown, and Mens <hi>Words</hi> be no longer relied upon as sufficient to declare the <hi>Sense</hi> of their <hi>Minds.</hi>
                                          </p>
                                          <p n="147">147. Fifthly, As to what concerns the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> in this point, it cannot be deny'd; nay, it is by some of your own <hi>Church</hi> openly complain'd of, how much their <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>confidence,</hi> their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> are hereby lessen'd towards <hi>God;</hi> and what greater signs of <hi>Zeal</hi> appear in them towards the Blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> than towards our Saviour Christ himself.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:36811:323"/>
you who ought to have better inform'd them, are the very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have especially help'd to mislead them. 'Tis from you they have learnt, as a great <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>piety,</hi> to <hi>salute</hi> her ten times, for <hi>God</hi>'s once. 'Tis you that have taught them to joyn <hi>Mary</hi> still with <hi>Jesus</hi> in their Mouths: Insomuch, as if it be possible, to let her Name be the last Expression of their dying Breath. 'Tis you that have told them, that to <hi>list</hi> themselves into her <hi>Frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> is one of the surest means in the World to ascertain their <hi>Salvation.</hi> From you they learn in all their <hi>prayers</hi> to call upon her: at the <hi>sound</hi> of a <hi>Bell</hi> thrice every day wherever they are, or whatever they are about, to fall down upon their Knees and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute her. Your <hi>Confessions, Absolutions, Excommunications, Vows, Thanksgivings, Visitations, Commendations, Conjurations,</hi> are all transacted in <hi>her Name,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity.</hi> Whilst our Saviour Christ is represented by you either as still in the state of <hi>Pupillage,</hi> an <hi>Infant</hi> in her Arms, or <hi>expiring</hi> upon his <hi>Cross,</hi> she has her <hi>Crown,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> about her Head; sometimes the <hi>Moon</hi> under her feet, and not seldom the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to set forth her <hi>Honour.</hi> Her <hi>Titles</hi> in all your <hi>Offices</hi> are <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive:</hi> The <hi>Queen of Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Mother of Divine Grace,</hi> the <hi>Mirrour of Righteousness,</hi> the <hi>Seat of Wisdom,</hi> the <hi>Cause of our joy,</hi> the <hi>Tower of</hi> David, the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Gate of Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Refuge of Sinners,</hi> the <hi>Help of Christians,</hi> the <hi>Queen of Angels, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, and all Saints:</hi> These are the common Names you give her, in your <hi>Hymns,</hi> your <hi>Litanies</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> to her. And what Impression all this must make upon untutor'd minds; how much greater value they will be hereby apt to set upon her than upon Christ himself, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans <hi>reason</hi> will soon tell him, and a sad <hi>experience</hi> confirms it to us.</p>
                                          <p n="148">148. But indeed Sixthly, It is here (in the Words of the <note place="margin">Isaia XXIV. 2.</note>

                                    <p n="26">26. Having thus rejected all those several Opinions, he finally concludes, <q>That the <hi>true Opinion,</hi> and which <hi>ought to be held,</hi> is, <note place="margin">Card. Capis. contr. par.

And this may suffice by the way to answer your Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Authority of <hi>Aquinas;</hi> who as you see allow'd a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper worship</hi> to be paid to the <hi>Cross</hi> as well as to <note place="margin">Reply, p. 29, 30, 31.</note> Christ. And that you may not shift off this REPLY (as you have done my former Answer) only with <hi>scorn</hi> and <hi>derision,</hi> I must mind you, that 'tis not now <hi>a Doctor of the Populace</hi> whom you think uncapable of penetrating into the <hi>profound Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Scholastick Niceties,</hi> that says this; but <hi>Card.

                                          <hi>Christ is</hi> absolutely <hi>and</hi> simply <hi>to be adored with the same</hi> Adoration <hi>with which</hi> Christ <hi>is adored.—And that therefore the same</hi> Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>which is given to Christ, ought to be given to his Image also.</hi>

                                    <p n="28">28. <hi>First,</hi> It may not be amiss to observe what great diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Opinions</hi> there has been in stating of that <hi>Worship</hi> which is paid by you to <hi>Images,</hi> and what difficulty you have found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your <hi>practice</hi> against that Charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> we have so just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought against you upon the account of it. How the <hi>Caution</hi> of some, and the <hi>distinctions</hi> of others amongst you, have been branded by the rest as <hi>Scandalous</hi> and <hi>Erroneous;</hi> and one forced to <hi>abjure</hi> as <hi>Heretical,</hi> what others have set up as the only <hi>true Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> and <hi>Representation</hi> of the <hi>Churches sense.</hi> And this you will give me leave the rather to remark, because you are so often pleased to reflect upon our <hi>divisions,</hi> which yet are neither so <hi>frequent</hi> nor <hi>dangerous,</hi> as among you who pretend not only to <hi>Truth,</hi> but <hi>Infallibility</hi> in all you believe. And if the <hi>consequence</hi> you are wont from thence to draw against us, That because we differ in some things, therefore we have no certainty in any, be good, (as you say it is) you may now see that it will equally fall upon your selves too; and by so much the more heavily, by how much your pretences in this matter are greater than ours. But,</p>
                                    <p n="29">29. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tho there be then such a diversity of <hi>Opinions</hi> amongst you as to this <hi>Worship;</hi> yet it is to be remarked that they who have allow'd the least <hi>Honour</hi> to <hi>Images,</hi> have yet still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that <hi>some Honour</hi> was due to them. <q>

meant ONLY to the <hi>persons</hi> whom they <hi>represent,</hi> but NOT to the <hi>Images themselves,</hi> which can claim NOTHING <hi>of that</hi> KIND from us.

                                    <p n="30">30. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may from hence farther appear, that the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> which this <hi>Cardinal</hi> thought due to <hi>Inages,</hi> was not an <hi>improper, accidental, abusive Worship,</hi> but a <hi>true, proper,</hi> and <hi>real Adoration;</hi> the <hi>Image</hi> being to be <hi>adored</hi> in the very <hi>same act</hi> with which the <hi>Exemplar</hi> was.

                                    <p n="31">31. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are to look upon, not as a <hi>private opinion,</hi> or a meer <hi>Scholastick Nicety,</hi> but as the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper sense</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to be <hi>held of all.</hi> So the <hi>Cardinal</hi> expresly declares; as being the Doctrine of the Councils both of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Trent;</hi> and for denying of which, <hi>Aegidius Magistralis</hi> was by the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> forced to <hi>recant,</hi> and renounce his Doctrine contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as <hi>Heretical.</hi>

39. <hi>First,</hi> If we enquire into the design of this <hi>Ceremony;</hi> it is to <hi>Consecrate</hi> a piece of <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> that it may become a fit <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Adoration:</hi> which being directy contrary to the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> cannot be done without a very great <hi>Sin.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p n="40">40. <hi>2dly.</hi> To this End, secondly, you pray that several benefits may proceed from this <hi>Wood of the Cross;</hi> and if those words sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify any thing, whereby you beseech <hi>God,</hi> that it may be <hi>a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some remedy to Mankind, a strengthner of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. We must then look upon it, that you do believe, that by this <hi>Consecration</hi> there is a <hi>Virtue,</hi> if not residing in it for all these purposes, yet at least proceeding from it; which your <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> confesses was one of the things that made the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> among the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> to be <hi>Idolatrous.</hi> Nor will your little Evasion here stand you in any stead; that <q>
                                          <hi>you pray only that the Cross may be a means for</hi>

                                          <hi>the obtaining all these Benefits; and that this is no more than a Preacher may desire for his Sermon, or the Author of a good Book for what he is about to publish:</hi>
                                       </q> For, 1. A piece of <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> carve it into what <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Shape</hi> you please, is not certainly so proper a <hi>means</hi> for the conveying of such <hi>Benefits</hi> to men, as a good <hi>Book</hi> or a good <hi>Sermon</hi> are: And therefore what may be very <hi>naturally</hi> desired for the <hi>One,</hi> cannot without great <hi>Superstition</hi> be <hi>applied</hi> to the <hi>Other.</hi> I may, and I heartily do <hi>pray,</hi> that what I am now writing may be <hi>a saving remedy to you,</hi> by <hi>correcting</hi> your <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>encreasing</hi> your <hi>Charity;</hi> because I am perswaded here are <hi>Arguments</hi> proper to such an End, if it shall please <hi>God</hi> to dispose you impartially to consider them; but now, I believe, you would think me very <hi>Extravagant,</hi> should I pray to <hi>God</hi> to <hi>sanctify</hi> the <hi>Paper</hi> on which 'tis <hi>printed,</hi> or my <hi>Bookseller's Sign</hi> that sells it, as you <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>God</hi> to sanctify the WOOD of the <hi>Cross;</hi> that as often as you see the <hi>leaves</hi> of this <hi>Book,</hi> or look upon the <hi>Rose and Crown</hi> in St. <hi>Paul's Church-yard,</hi> these good <hi>effects</hi> may be wrought in you.</p>
                                    <p n="41">41. Again, 2. As the thing it self is not a proper <hi>means</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing these <hi>Effects</hi> in us; so the <hi>manner</hi> by which you pray it may be done, renders it yet more <hi>Superstitious.</hi> To get <hi>instruction</hi> by <hi>hearing</hi> or <hi>reading;</hi> to have ones <hi>Faith confirm'd,</hi> or <hi>Charity enlarged,</hi> or <hi>Zeal heightned,</hi> by <hi>pious Considerations,</hi> or <hi>powerful Motives,</hi> all this is very natural; and we may therefore lawfully pray to <hi>God</hi> for to bless them to us in order to these Ends. But to <hi>pray</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> that by <hi>bowing</hi> our selves down before a <hi>Cross,</hi> we may find <hi>health</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> to <hi>sanctify</hi> a <hi>piece</hi> of <hi>Wood,</hi> that by ITS
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36811:335"/>
MERITS it may <hi>free men</hi> from all the <hi>Sins</hi> they have <hi>committed,</hi> this must be more than a <hi>natural Effect,</hi> neither the thing nor action being proper to produce it; and whether such <hi>Requests</hi> be not more like <hi>Magical Incantations</hi> than <hi>Christian Prayers,</hi> I shall leave it to any indifferent person to consider.</p>
                                    <p n="42">42. But <hi>3dly,</hi> That this which you pretend, is not all that your <hi>Church</hi> designs by those <hi>Prayers,</hi> is evident, in that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position cannot possibly be applied to several of those things which you ask of <hi>God</hi> in those Addresses. For instance, you pray, <q>
                                          <hi>That the blessing of the</hi> Wood <hi>upon which our Saviour hung, may be in the</hi> Wood <hi>of the</hi> Cross <hi>which you consecrate; and that by the</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness <hi>of that, he would</hi> Sanctify <hi>this; that as by that</hi> Cross, <hi>the World was delivered from</hi> Guilt, <hi>so by the</hi> Merits of this, <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Souls who offer it, may be free from all the</hi> Sins <hi>they have</hi> committed.</q> Now tell me in Conscience, if you dare speak the truth; Is not all this somewhat more, than to <hi>pray that the Cross may accidentally become a means of working good Effects in you, by putting you in mind of the price of your Redemption?</hi> Do you not <note place="margin">Reply p. 32, 33.</note> here see somewhat, which your <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> calls the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles? viz.</hi> an encouragement to <hi>Worship</hi> the <hi>Cross,</hi> as if some <hi>Divine Virtue</hi> were in it, for which it ought to be <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> For, so certainly he must do, who believes that by these <hi>Prayers,</hi> the <hi>blessing of that Cross, on which our Saviour hung, is in this which he Worships; and that bowing down before it, he shall find Health both of Soul and Body.</hi> Nay, but</p>
                                    <p n="43">43. <hi>4thly,</hi> I must once more ask you that <hi>Question,</hi> I before proposed on this Occasion; and which, tho you heartily <hi>rail</hi> at, yet you <hi>shift</hi> it off without answering one wise word to it. If you design no <hi>real Virtue</hi> to proceed from the <hi>Cross</hi> which you thus <hi>consecrate,</hi> nor allow any <hi>Adoration</hi> to be <hi>paid</hi> to it, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it meerly for a <hi>memorative Sign,</hi> and no more: To what purpose all these <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Sprinklings,</hi> and <hi>Smokings,</hi> and <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,</hi> and other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> for the <hi>Consecration</hi> of it? As to your <hi>Question,</hi> why we dedicate our <hi>Churches to God?</hi> I will then allow it to be a <hi>Parallel,</hi> when you can prove that we pray that <hi>God</hi> would <hi>Sanctify</hi> the <hi>Walls</hi> or <hi>Seats</hi> of them, <hi>That they may become a wholesome Remedy to Mankind, and by their Merits free us from all the Sins we have committed.</hi> In the mean time it shall suffice to tell you, that as all we design in those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> is no more than a solemn setting of it apart for <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> to <hi>God only;</hi>
                                       <pb n="159" facs="tcp:36811:335"/>
so all we desire, is, that <hi>God</hi> would vouchsafe favourably to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our Offering of <hi>that Place</hi> to his <hi>Service,</hi> and give a <hi>blessing</hi> to those <hi>Holy Offices</hi> that are from thenceforth to be peformed in it.</p>
                                    <p n="44">44. But <hi>5thly;</hi> and to conclude this <hi>Point;</hi> He that would know what your Intention in <hi>these Prayers</hi> is, need only consider what <hi>Prayers</hi> you make in behalf of other things of the <hi>same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> And in which you so evidently desire a <hi>Divine Virtue</hi> may proceed from the very things themselves which you <hi>Sanctify,</hi> that there is no doubt to be made of it. I shall give but one <hi>Instance</hi> of this, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Prayer</hi> you make at the <hi>Consecration</hi> of your <hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s; in which you thus Address your selves to <hi>God.</hi>

But whether the Relation be <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Fable;</hi> The Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is put, and must be Answer'd: <hi>Would I not have thought that these</hi> Jews <hi>hereby intended to affront our</hi> Saviour Christ? I answer, Yes; No doubt they did. And <q>
                                          <hi>why then</hi> (say you) <hi>should I not in like manner interpret this Service of yours to terminate not upon the Crucifix, but to tend to him who suffer'd upon the Cross?</hi>
                                       </q> I answer, 1. That had you put your Question as you ought, you should have ask'd, Why then we do not look upon <hi>your Intention</hi> to be to <hi>Honour,</hi> not the <hi>Cross,</hi> but <hi>Him</hi> that suffered upon it. Now there is a very great Difference between these two. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Friend <hi>T. G.</hi> supposes, <hi>That Actions must necessarily go whither they are intended;</hi> yet I think both he and you ought by this time, to be satisfied of the falseness of that <hi>Maxim?</hi> And therefore should we allow your <hi>Intention</hi> to be only to <hi>worship</hi> Christ, and not the <hi>Cross,</hi> yet it do's not thence follow that all your worship must by the Interpretation of <hi>Gods Law terminate</hi> upon him. But now, 2. I have shown, that for all your Pretences, it is not your Intention that your <hi>Worship</hi> should so <hi>terminate upon Christ,</hi> as not to <hi>terminate</hi> also upon the <hi>Cross</hi> together with him. 3. If it were, yet for all your intention you would nevertheless be far from Honouring Christ: seeing that to <hi>worship Christ</hi> by an <hi>Image</hi> is a <hi>prohibited Act;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> cannot be <hi>Honour'd</hi> in the very same <hi>Act</hi> in which he is <hi>disobey'd.</hi> And though an <hi>intention</hi> to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour

So far have you hitherto been from producing the least shadow of an <hi>Answer</hi> to overthrow the force of my <hi>Allegations.</hi> My Last Instance was:</p>
                                    <p n="65">65. <hi>Fourthly;</hi> From the <hi>Hymns</hi> of your <hi>Church.</hi> In which I <note place="margin">Reply, p. 39.</note> shewed that you address your selves to the <hi>Cross,</hi> and beg <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Graces</hi> of it; and that you could not say the <hi>Cross</hi> was here put by a <hi>Figure</hi> to signify <hi>Christ crucified</hi> upon it; because the very words of the <hi>Hymns</hi> shew, that 'tis the <hi>Material Cross</hi> as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd from <hi>Christ,</hi> of which they speak.</p>
                                    <p n="66">66. And here you are in a great distress; you catch at every thing that comes near you; but for the most part without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering whether it be to any purpose or no. As for instance: You observe, <hi>First,</hi> That I am <hi>brisk and confident,</hi> and have a mind to <q>
                                          <hi>expose your</hi> Literature <hi>as well as your</hi> Idolatry.</q> But, Sir, may I beg leave to ask you on this Occasion the very same <hi>Question</hi> that <note place="margin">Ib. p. 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                                       </note> you do Me. Who is it you mean, when you say, I have a mind to expose <hi>YOUR Literature?</hi> If you understand that of your <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> I must tell you I am so far from <hi>exposing</hi> it, that I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently shew you that they are the most Learned Men of your <hi>Church</hi> whom I follow in the <hi>Application</hi> of that <hi>Hymn</hi> I alledged. But if by <hi>YOUR Literature</hi> you meant your own, you have then made a most unlucky piece of Work of it, in joining <hi>your Literature</hi> and <hi>your Churches Idolatry</hi> together; and I doubt your Brethren will have but little cause to applaud the Comparison. For do but grant it to be as easie to <hi>Prove</hi> the <hi>One,</hi> as it is to <hi>Expose</hi> the <hi>Other,</hi> and I will never desire a fairer Advantage against both, than you have here offer'd to Me. For,</p>
                                    <p n="67">67. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You say I must confess that your <hi>Churches Hymns</hi> were made by <hi>Poets,</hi> unless I will be so great a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> as to deny that <hi>Prudentius</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> were Poets. I suppose <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus</hi> clubb'd together to make the <hi>Hymn</hi> that I refer to: Only the mischef is, that the One lived in the End of the <hi>IVth,</hi> the other not till about the middle of the <hi>Vth Century.</hi>
                                       <pb n="168" facs="tcp:36811:340"/>
Nay, but what now if neither of these were Author of that <hi>Hymn?</hi> I am sure <hi>Gretser,</hi> a very inquisitive Man in these matters, speaks very doubtfully of it, and leaves it in Question, whether <hi>Venantius</hi> 
                                       <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de Cruce, c. 35.</note> 
                                       <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> or <hi>Theodulphus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Orleans,</hi> was the Author of it; and He lived yet later, about the beginning of the <hi>IXth Century.</hi> But to let this pass; and consider,</p>
                                    <p n="68">68. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How you prove these Men to be <hi>Poets,</hi> for indeed it is very remarkable. You tell me, that if I will but look into the <hi>Corpus Poetarum,</hi> I shall find them to have had a place among the <hi>Poets.</hi> A most undoubted way this, to find out whether an <hi>Author</hi> were a <hi>Poet</hi> or a <hi>Schoolman;</hi> And I dare say you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to no man's <hi>Literature</hi> but your own for this Remark.</p>
                                    <p n="69">69. Well, but to grant that which I perceive you do not know very well how to go about to prove, that the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Hymn,</hi> whoever he was, was a <hi>Poet;</hi> what will follow? Why then you say, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I shall presently find the <hi>Figure</hi> he there uses; his <hi>Title</hi> being not <q>
                                          <hi>Of the</hi> CROSS, but of the PASSION <hi>of our</hi> LORD.</q> And then you take a great deal of pains to prove, what no man ever deni'd, <q>that the <hi>Cross</hi> in Holy Scripture is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentime put to signify, the <hi>Force, Effects,</hi> and <hi>Merits</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion.</hi>
                                       </q> Now if this be any thing to the purpose, as all that drops from a Person of your <hi>Literature</hi> must be supposed to be; then I must conclude, that seeing the <hi>Title</hi> of that <hi>Hymn</hi> is <q>Of the <hi>Passion</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi>
                                       </q> whereever I meet the word CROSS in it, I am to understand it not of the <hi>Material Cross,</hi> but of <hi>Christ</hi>'s PASSION. This you must mean, or else all this ado is meer <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie,</hi> and <hi>Impertinence.</hi> Now then let us see what mad work we shall according to this new <hi>Exposition</hi> make of that <hi>Hymn.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <q>
                                       <p>
                                          <hi>The</hi> PASSION <hi>of our King comes forth; The mystery of the</hi> PASSION <hi>shines; upon which</hi> PASSION <hi>the Maker of our Flesh was hanged in the Flesh.</hi>
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                          <hi>Beautiful and bright</hi> PASSION! <hi>Adorned with the purple of a King. Chosen of a fit</hi> Stock <hi>to</hi> touch <hi>such sacred Members.</hi>
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                          <hi>Blessed</hi> PASSION! <hi>upon whose</hi> Arms <hi>the price of the World</hi> hung. <hi>Hail, O</hi> Passion! <hi>our only Hope; In this time of the</hi> PASSION, <hi>increase righteousness in the Godly, and give pardon to the Guilty.</hi>
                                       </p>
                                    </q>
                                    <p n="70">70. Now this I am confident a man of so much <hi>Literature</hi> as you are, will not allow to be a proper <hi>paraphrase</hi> of this <hi>Hymn:</hi> And if instead of the <hi>Passion,</hi> you put <hi>Christ</hi> for the <hi>Cross,</hi> this will yet
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:36811:340"/>
more increase the <hi>Nonsense</hi> and <hi>Confusion.</hi> In short; If all the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Poetarum</hi> were alive, and should lay their <hi>Heads</hi> together with you, they could not find out any of their <hi>Figures</hi> that would do the business; but must have some new <hi>Ecclesiastical Figure</hi> found out to make the <hi>Cross</hi> signify <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>his Passion,</hi> at the <hi>same time,</hi> and in the <hi>same place</hi> in which it distinguishes <hi>both</hi> from the <hi>Cross.</hi> And such a Figure I do say would be as Great a <hi>Mystery,</hi> in <hi>Verse,</hi> as <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is in <hi>Prose.</hi> And I desire you, if you can, to give me but one parallel <hi>Text</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> in which the <hi>Cross</hi> is at once taken both <hi>literally</hi> for that <hi>Cross</hi> on which <hi>Christ suffer'd;</hi> and <hi>figuratively,</hi> for <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Sufferings</hi> upon it.</p>
                                    <p n="71">71. In the mean time it shall suffice me Once more to mind you of what I perceive you have nothing to say to; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his <hi>Followers,</hi> who have been sometimes reckon'd men of <hi>Literature</hi> in your <hi>Church,</hi> have understood this <hi>Hymn</hi> according to the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>literal</hi> meaning of it: and that so confidently as to conclude from it, that your <hi>Church</hi> holds <hi>Divine Honour</hi> to be due to the Cross. <q>

And now tho this might suffice to shew how consistent the guilt of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is with the acknowledgment of <hi>one true God,</hi> yet will I add a reflection or two more, for the farther confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it. For,</p>
                                       <p>
                                          <hi>First,</hi> Were such a <hi>Notion</hi> as this of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be admitted, it would serve no less to excuse the Heathens than those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> of the guilt of it. For however they worshipp'd
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:36811:344"/>
other <hi>inferior Deities,</hi> as these do <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> with a lower degree of <hi>Religious Honour;</hi> yet even they too acknowledged <hi>one supreme God,</hi> who was over all, and to whom the highest <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> alone was due. This has been so largely proved <note place="margin">Defence of the Disc. of Idolatry, par. 1</note> by <hi>T. G</hi>'s <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>learned Antagonist,</hi> not to mention any others who have occasionally treated of this Argument, that I shall not need to enter on any particular induction in order to the asserting of it.</p>
                                       <p n="94">94. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It cannot be question'd but that this new <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> set up on purpose to excuse you from that Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is utterly repugnant to the Principles of the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> who certainly charged those with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> who yet believed and worshipp'd the very same <hi>God</hi> with themselves. Thus St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> charges the <hi>Arrians</hi> with <hi>Idolatry</hi> for <hi>adoring Christ,</hi> 
                                          <q>whom they <note place="margin">Athanas contr. Arrian. Orat. 1. p. 286.</note> esteem'd to be a <hi>Creature.</hi> He tells them, that no <hi>supposition of any Excellencies whatever in him, altho derived from God, would excuse them. But that if they thought him a meer man, and yet adored him, they would be found worshippers of men for all that.</hi>
                                          </q> Nay he doubts <note place="margin">Ib. 387.</note> not to parallel them with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to compare the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they paid to <hi>our Saviour</hi> upon this supposition, with that which the other gave to their <hi>inferior Deities.</hi> And the same was the opinion of all the rest of those great men, <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Nyssen, Epiphanius,</hi> &amp;c. and whose words are so well known, that I shall not need to transcribe them.</p>
                                       <p n="95">95. But now that I have mentioned <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> I may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get another sort of <hi>Idolatry</hi> exploded by him, and yet more near our purpose than the foregoing. I mean that <hi>Worship</hi> which some <hi>Superstitious Women</hi> in his time paid to the Blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Cake</hi> to her. Now this that <hi>Holy Father</hi> condemns as down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the device of the <hi>Devil.</hi> And to shew how consistent the charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is with the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>one God,</hi> he gives us a similitude that would almost imply a necessity of acknowledging the <hi>one true God</hi> to compleat the nature of it: <q>
                                             <hi>Idolatry</hi> (says he) <hi>comes into the world through an Adulterous inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, which cannot be contented with</hi> one God alone: <hi>Like an</hi> Adulterous Woman <hi>that is not satisfied with the chast em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of</hi> one Husband, <hi>but wanders in her lust after</hi> many lovers.</q> So possible did those <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> think it to be for Men in the <hi>clear light of Christianity,</hi> and retaining the <hi>acknowledgment of the true God,</hi> nevertheless to commit <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                                       </p>
                                       <p n="96">

96. I might add here the <hi>Exhortations</hi> of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where both S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> among other Cautions to the Christians of their Times, place that of <hi>fleeing</hi> from <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry;</hi> and this in such a manner, as evidently supposes them very capable of continuing the Profession of Christianity, and the <hi>Knowledg</hi> and <hi>Worship of God,</hi> and yet of falling into it. But I shall content my self, lastly, to <hi>close</hi> up this with the <hi>Confessions</hi> of Learned <hi>Romanists</hi> themselves, who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be consistent with the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>true God.</hi>

                                          </q> doubts not to say this is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> And therefore argues in this manner against it: <q>
                                             <hi>That this Worship is either given to the Image for it self, or for the sake of another. If for it self, it is plainly IDOLATRY; if for another, it is not proper Divine Worship, because the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that is to be given for it self. Again; Either the Divine Worship</hi> (says he) <hi>which is given to the Image relatively for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, is the same with that which is given to God, or it is an inferior Worship. If it be the same, then the Creature is equally
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:36811:345"/>
worshipped with God, which CERTAINLY IS IDOLATRY. For</hi> Idolatry <hi>is not only when GOD IS FORSAKEN, and an</hi> Idol <hi>worshipped, but when an</hi> Idol <hi>is worshipped</hi> together with God. <hi>If it be an Inferior Worship, then it is not the proper Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship.</hi>

Either we must pay the <hi>same Adoration</hi> to the <hi>Image</hi> that we do to the <hi>Original,</hi> and then <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> pronounces us <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters;</hi> Or we must give it only an <hi>Inferior Honour,</hi> and then <hi>Card. Capisucchi,</hi> and the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> damn us as <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Nay, but there is <hi>Idolatry</hi> committed go which way you will. For <hi>Vasquez,</hi> another Learned <hi>Jesuit,</hi> and whose Works have been <note place="margin">In 3. T. 1. p. 778.</note> no less approved than <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi>'s, tells us; <q>
                                             <hi>That if a Man give</hi> inferior Worship <hi>to an</hi> Image, <hi>distinct from that which is given to the Thing represented by it, he thereby incurs the guilt of IDOLATRY, because he expresses his submission to a meer</hi> inanimate Thing, <hi>that hath no kind of Excellency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it from him.</hi>
                                          </q> And now seeing there is so much danger of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> whatever the <hi>Honour</hi> be that is given to <hi>Images,</hi> I hope we may be the easier excused, if admonished by these <hi>Confessions,</hi> and directed by <hi>God's Commandments,</hi> we refuse to give them any <hi>Honour</hi> at all. And thus much be said to the first Point, <q>That a Man may be capable of falling into <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> though he continues both to know and worship the <hi>One true God.</hi>

is none to worship <hi>God</hi> by an <hi>Image,</hi> or to worship an <hi>Image</hi> together with <hi>God.</hi> But yet since he confesses that <hi>Images</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd as <hi>Images,</hi> in their <hi>Representative</hi> Natures, are still but <hi>Creatures,</hi> and to worship any <hi>Creature</hi> with the Worship due <hi>only to God</hi> (whatever the pretence be for the so doing) is in effect to set up another <hi>God,</hi> which must needs be <hi>Idolatry;</hi> It will remain that no pretence of <hi>Scholastick Niceties</hi> will be able to excuse this great Man from <hi>Card.

                        <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>THE nature of the Holy</hi> Eucharist <hi>is a subject that hath been both so frequently insisted upon, and so fully explain'd in our own and other Languages, that it may well be thought a very needless undertaking for any one to trouble the World with any farther</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections <hi>upon it. For not to mention now those Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Men who have heretofore labour'd in this work, nor to run beyond the points that are here designed to be examined; What can be said more evidently to shew the impossibility of the pretended</hi> substantial change <hi>of the</hi> Bread <hi>and</hi> Wine <hi>into the</hi> Body <hi>and</hi> Blood <hi>of Christ in this Holy Sacrament, than has been done in the late excellent</hi> Discourse against Transubstantiation? <hi>It is but a very little time since the Adoration of the Host has been shewn not only to be a novel invention, contrary to the practice of all Antiquity, but the danger of it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonstrated, notwithstanding whatever pretences can be made of a</hi> good intention <hi>to excuse them from the charge and danger of Idolatry, who continue the practice of it. And both these not only still remain unanswer'd; but if we may be allow'd to judge either
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:36811:380"/>
by their own strength, or by our Adversaries silence, are truly and indeed unanswerable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It is not therefore out of any the least Opinion that any thing more need be said to confirm our cause, much less that I esteem my self able to undertake it with the same success that those other Champions of our Faith have done it, that I venture these</hi> Discourses <hi>to a publick view. But since our</hi> Adversaries <hi>still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, without taking notice of any of these things, to cry up their Great</hi> Diana <hi>no less than if she had never at all been shewn to be but an</hi> Idol, <hi>I thought it might not be amiss to revive our Instances against it: And that we ought not to appear less sollicitous by a frequent repetition of our Reasons, to keep men in the</hi> Truth, <hi>than others are by a continual insisting upon their so often baffled</hi> Sophistry, <hi>to lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Error.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>'Twas an ingenious Apology that</hi> Seneca <hi>once made, for his often repeating the same things;</hi> 
                           <q>That he did but inculcate over and over the same Counsels, to those that over and over committed the same faults:</q> 
                           <hi>And I remember an antient</hi> Father <hi>has left it as his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that it was useful for the same truths to be vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by many,</hi> 
                           <q>because that one Man's Writings might possibly chance to come where the others did not; and what was less fully or clearly explain'd by one, might be supplied and enlarged by the other.</q> 
                           <hi>And a greater than either of these, S.</hi> Paul, <hi>has at once left us both an example and a warrant for this sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude; Phil.</hi> 3. 1. <q>To write the same things to you, to me <hi>(says he)</hi> is not grievous, but for you it is safe.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Indeed I think if there be any need of an excuse for this undertaking, it ought to be rather to</hi> Apologize <hi>for a
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:36811:380"/>
far greater absurdity which we all commit in writing at all against those Men, who in these Disputes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Holy Sacrament, have most evidently shewn that to be true of Christians, which was once said of the antient Philosophers,</hi> That there can be nothing so absurd which some Men will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to maintain.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In most of our other Controversies with those of the</hi> Church of Rome, <hi>we shew them to be</hi> Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; <hi>in this they are</hi> Extravagant; <hi>And as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Pen has very justly express'd it,</hi> 
                           <q>The business <note place="margin">Discourse against Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, Pag. 2.</note> of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is not a Controversie of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> against <hi>Scripture,</hi> or of <hi>Reason</hi> against <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> but of downright <hi>Impudence</hi> against the plain meaning of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and all the <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of mankind.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The truth is, as the same Person goes on,</hi> 
                           <q>It is a <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> most self-evident falshood: and there is no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Proposition in the World that is of it self more evidently true, than Transubstantiation is evidently false.</q> 
                           <hi>And if such things as these must be disputed, and this Evidence,</hi> 
                           <q>That what we see and handle, and taste to be Bread is Bread, and not the Body of a Man; and what we see and taste to be Wine is Wine, and not Blood, may not pass for sufficient without any farther Proof, I cannot discern why any Man that hath but confidence enough to do so, may not deny any thing to be what all the World sees it is, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it to be what all the World sees it is not, and this without all possibility of being further confuted.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:36811:381"/>
                           <hi>But yet since it has pleased God so far to give over some Men to a spirit of delusion, as not only seriously to believe this themselves, but also vashly to damn all those that cannot believe it with them, we ought as well for the security of those who have not yet abandoned their</hi> own sense <hi>and</hi> reason, <hi>in compliance only with others who in this matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to have laid aside</hi> theirs; <hi>as in charity to such deluded Persons as are unhappily led away with these Errors, to shew them their unreasonableness: To convince them that Christianity is a</hi> wise <hi>and</hi> rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Religion: <hi>that 'tis a mistaken Piety to suppose that Men ought to believe</hi> Contradictions; <hi>or that their</hi> Faith <hi>is ever the more perfect, because the Object of it is impossible: That our</hi> Senses <hi>ought to be trusted in judging aright of their proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; that to deny this is to overthrow the greatest external Evidence we have for our Religion, which is founded upon their judgment; or if that will be more considerable, is to take away all the grounds that even themselves can pretend to, wherefore they should disbelieve them in favour of</hi> Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And this I perswade my self I have in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Discourse sufficiently shewn, and I shall not need to repeat it again here. For the</hi> words <hi>themselves, which are the grounds of this great Error, I have taken that</hi> Method <hi>which seemed to me the most proper to find out the true meaning of them; and, as far as the nature of the Enquiry would permit, have endeavour'd to render it plain and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble even to the meanest Capacity. And I have some cause to hope that the most learned will not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with the design, what ever they may be with
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:36811:381"/>
the performance; it being from such that I have taken the greatest part of my</hi> Reflections, <hi>and in which I pretend to little of my own besides the care of putting together here, what I had observed scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down in parts elsewhere.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It was so much the more fit at this time to insist upon this manner of arguing, in that a late disturber of the Fathers, the better to shew the Antiquity of his new Religion, has pretended to search no less than into the secrets of the Jewish</hi> Cabala <hi>after it, and to have found out</hi> Transubstantiation <hi>there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest of the</hi> Rabbinical Follies: <hi>Now</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Consensus Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum p. 21, &amp;c.</note> 
                           <hi>however the very name of</hi> Galatinus <hi>be sufficient to Learned Men to make them esteem his Judgment in his</hi> Jewish <hi>to be much the same as in his</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Antiquity <hi>which follows after, in those eminent pieces of S.</hi> Peter'<hi>s and S.</hi> Matthew'<hi>s</hi> Liturgies, <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 27.</note> 
                           <hi>S.</hi> Andrew'<hi>s work of</hi> the Passion of our Lord; Dionysius'<hi>s</hi> Ecclesiast. Hierarch. <hi>&amp;c. yet because such stuff as this may serve to amuse those who are not acquainted with the emptiness of it, I was so much the rather inclined to shew what the</hi> true <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the</hi> Jewish <hi>Rites would furnish us with to overthrow their pretences; and that the</hi> Rabbins Visions <hi>are of as little moment to confirm this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit as</hi> their own Miracles.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But whatever those of the</hi> other Communion <hi>shall please to judge of my Arguments, yet at least the Opinions of those eminent Men of their own</hi> Church <hi>may certainly deserve to be consider'd by them, who have freely declared that there is not in Scripture any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof of</hi> Transubstantiation; <hi>nay some of whom have thought so little engagement upon them either from that or any other Authority to believe it,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:36811:382"/>
that they have lived and died in their Church without ever embracing of it.</hi>

                                    <p>I Cannot but exceedingly wonder that a certain Preacher, who reads the Holy Scriptures, and will maintain nothing but by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, should nevertheless undertake to defend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Opposers by the Scriptures, the Real Presence in the Eucharist out of the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving; and think himself so sure to overcome in this Occasion, as to talk of it as a thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and in which he knows he cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.</p>
                                    <p>It would certainly be more safe not to be too much prepossessed with anything.

Which makes me think it very probable, that our Saviour intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to sanctifie this Profane custom, as he did some others, which I have remarked in the same place.</p>
                                    <p>When Men undertake to prove too much, they very often prove nothing at all: To maintain that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is intire in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> with all his Bodily extension, and all his Dignity, so as he is in Heaven; so that under the <hi>Roundness</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> there is nothing that is <hi>Round;</hi>
                                       <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:36811:389"/>
under the <hi>Whiteness</hi> there is nothing <hi>White;</hi> this is what the Scripture has not said one word of, They are indeed meer <hi>Visions,</hi> and which are not so easie to maintain as Men may think. The Priest who celebrates breaks the <hi>Host</hi> in three pieces; One of these he puts into the Cup, of the two others he communicates, in memory as 'tis plain of what we read, That <hi>Jesus the night in which he was betray'd took Bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it, and said, Take, Eat, This is my Body which is broken for you, Do this in Remembrance of Me.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 23, 24. In the <hi>Mass</hi> there is here no more <hi>Bread,</hi> they are only the <hi>appearances of Bread,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi> and which are not tied to any <hi>Substance.</hi> And yet so long as there is but one <hi>Atom</hi> of those <hi>Accidents</hi> which they call <hi>Eucharistical species</hi> in the <hi>Consecration</hi> that has been made, the <hi>true Flesh</hi> of the Lord Jesus is so annex'd to them, that it remains there whole and intire, without the least confusion, and may be so in diverse places at the same time. I doubt not but those who teach us this Doctrine have thought of it more than once; but have they well consider'd it? for there is not one word of it in all the <hi>Sacred Writings.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Is it nothing that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> said to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles but a little while before his <hi>Passion,</hi> when he was now about to celebrate his Holy Supper with them, <hi>You shall have the Poor always with you, but me ye shall not have always, Matth.</hi> 26. 11. His <hi>Real Presence</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> out of the act of communicating, not excepted?</p>
                                    <p>
                                       <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:36811:389"/>
They say to the People, Behold your Creator that made Heaven and Earth: And the People see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the consecrated Bread in the <hi>Ciboire</hi> wherein 'tis carry'd abroad, says, Behold the <hi>good God</hi> going in procession to confound the <hi>Hereticks:</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their natural inclination, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore with all their Hearts they know not what, because so they have been instructed; and the better to maintain their prejudice intire in this matter, they become mad: But alas! they know not what they do, and we ought to pity their Excess.</p>
                                    <p>On the other side, who can tell whether the Priest has <hi>consecrated,</hi> or indeed whether he be capable of <hi>consecrating?</hi> Is it a point of Faith to believe, that among so many Priests, not one of them is a <hi>Cheat</hi> and an <hi>Impostor?</hi> This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cannot be of Faith; and if this be not, neither is that which exposed with so much Pomp, to carry the true Body of the Lord through the Streets, of Faith. Thus the belief is at best but <hi>Conjecture;</hi> and then whatsoever in such cases is not of Faith is sin, according to the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
                                    <p>I know not what colour can be sufficient to excuse so strong an Objection, unless Men will absolutely resist the Holy Scripture, and right Reason founded upon it.</p>
                                    <p>'Tis further said, that Jesus Christ is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places at the same time, in the <hi>Hosts</hi> which are carried in very different manners; But neither for this is there any Text of Scripture. You will say, this may be; I answer, the Question here is not of the Infinite power of Jesus Christ, but
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:36811:390"/>
of his Will, and which we must obey when it is known to us; and of this as to the present point we read nothing in the Holy Scripture. The shorter way then would be to say, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of one Parish is not the same with that of another, although both the one and the other concur in the same design to worship God; as the Paschal Lamb of one Family, was not the Lamb of another, although both the one and the other were to accomplish the same Mystery. Thus for instance, on <hi>Corpus Christi-day,</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of S. <hi>Germain d' Auxerrois,</hi> where the perpetual Vicar consecrates the Host, and <hi>Monsieur</hi> the Dean, the first <hi>Curé,</hi> carrys it the Procession under a rich Canopy crown'd with Flowers, this Host is not the same with that of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s which is carried after another manner, <hi>viz.</hi> the Image of that Apostle made of Silver gilt, falling from his Horse at his Conversion, under the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jesus Christ hung up in rays of Gold, and carried under the covering of another state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canopy; and so of all the other Churches.</p>
                                    <p>As for the stories of several <hi>Hosts</hi> that have been stabb'd with Penknives, and have bled, they serve only to bring in some superstition contrary to the word of God, which never pretended that there was material <hi>Blood</hi> in the consecrated <hi>Bread,</hi> because it is the <hi>Body</hi> of Jesus Christ in <hi>a mystery of Faith.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>For what is said of an <hi>Infant</hi> that was seen in the stead of the <hi>Host,</hi> and of the figure of Christ sitting upon a <hi>Sepulchre</hi> instead of the same <hi>Host,</hi> are meer <hi>Fables</hi> suggested by the <hi>Father of Lies.</hi>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:36811:390"/>
It is further reported of certain Robbers that carrying away the Vessel in which the <hi>Host</hi> is kept, they have thrown the <hi>Host</hi> it self upon the ground, and trampled it under foot, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have cast it into nasty places, without any fear that it should avenge it self; This is a most horrible thought, and of which we ought not to open our mouths, but only to detest so dreadful a profanation.</p>
                                    <p>The same must be said of those <hi>Hosts</hi> which have been cast up, as soon as received, whether by sick persons, or sometimes by debauched Priests, disordered with the last nights intemperance; both which have sometimes happened, not to say any thing of those other terrible inconveniences, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd in the Cautions concerning the <hi>Mass.</hi> All which shew that Men have carry'd things too far, without any warrant from the Word of God.</p>
                                    <p>It is not therefore so easie, as some imagine, to maintain the Doctrine of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> out of the Use, against the Opinions of any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser.</p>
                                    <p>In the mean time the Truth is terribly obscured, and few give themselves the trouble to clear it. On the contrary it seems that among the many Writers of the Age, there are some who make it their whole business to hide it, and to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from finding it out, as if they desired never to be wiser than they are. The vanity of lying flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters them but too much in all the Humane passions which sway them.</p>
                                    <p>There are nevertheless some faithful Disciples, and Apostolick Souls who are exempted, to obey
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:36811:391"/>

                           </q> 
                           <hi>So that then the</hi> intention <hi>necessary to the conferring the</hi> Order <hi>of</hi> Priesthood <hi>is this; to give a Power to</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate, <hi>i. e. to</hi> Transubstantiate <hi>the</hi> Host <hi>into Christ's</hi> Body, <hi>and so</hi> offer <hi>it as a</hi> Sacrifice <hi>for the</hi> Living <hi>and the</hi> Dead.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>If therefore any of their Bishops, for instance</hi> Cardinal du Perron, <hi>or</hi> Monsieur de Marca, <hi>did not believe that either the</hi> Church <hi>or</hi> themselves <hi>as Bishops of it, had any</hi> Authority <hi>to confer any such</hi>
                           <pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:36811:395"/>
Power, <hi>they could not certainly have any</hi> Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of doing <hi>in this case</hi> what the Church <hi>intends to</hi> do. <hi>Having no such</hi> Intention, <hi>the Persons whom they pretended to</hi> Ordain <hi>were no</hi> Priests. <hi>Being no</hi> Priests <hi>they had no</hi> Power to Consecrate. <hi>All the</hi> Hosts <hi>therefore which were either</hi> offered <hi>or</hi> taken, <hi>or</hi> worshipped <hi>in any of the</hi> Masses <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by those</hi> Priests <hi>whom these two</hi> Bishops Ordained, <hi>were only</hi> meer Bread, <hi>and not the</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ; <hi>And as many of them, as being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards advanced to a higher dignity, were conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated</hi> Bishops, <hi>received no</hi> Episcopal Character, <hi>because they were destitute of the</hi> Priestly <hi>before. Thus the danger still encreases: For by this means, the</hi> Priests <hi>whom they also</hi> Ordain <hi>are no</hi> Priests; <hi>and when any of them shall be promoted to a higher degree, are uncapable of being made</hi> Bishops; <hi>And so by the Infidelity of these two Men, there are at this day infinite numbers of</hi> Priests <hi>and</hi> Bishops, <hi>who</hi> say Mass, <hi>and confer</hi> Orders <hi>without any manner of power to do either; and in a little time it may be there shall not be a true</hi> Bishop <hi>or</hi> Priest <hi>in the whole</hi> Gallicane Church. <hi>But,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. <hi>A second</hi> Consideration <hi>which I would beg leave to offer from the fore-going instances is this: What reliance we can make upon the</hi> Pretended Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>of their</hi> Church; <hi>when 'tis thus plain that so many of the most learned Men of their own</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <hi>did not only not believe it to be</hi> Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>but supposed it to have</hi> actually Erred, <hi>and that in those very Doctrines that are at this day esteemed the most considerable</hi> Points <hi>in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Us.</hi>

                           <pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:36811:396"/>
                           <hi>It is plain from what has been said in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> reflection, <hi>that disbelieving</hi> Transubstantiation, <hi>they must also have lookt upon all the other Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> Adoration of the Host, <hi>the</hi> Sacrifice of the Mass, &amp;c. <hi>as Erroneous too. Nom though it be not yet agreed among them, nor ever likely to be, where the</hi> supposed Infallibility <hi>of their</hi> Church <hi>is seated, yet since all manner of Authority has conspired to establish these things;</hi> Popes <hi>have</hi> decreed <hi>them,</hi> Councils defined <hi>them, and both</hi> Popes <hi>and</hi> Councils anathematized <hi>all those that shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to doubt of them; 'tis evident either these Men did not believe the</hi> Church <hi>to be</hi> Infallible, <hi>as is pretended; or they did not believe the</hi> Roman, <hi>to be, according to the modern phrase, indeed the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. <hi>And upon the same grounds there will arise a third</hi> Reflection, <hi>which they may please to make with us; and that is, with what Reason they can press us with the</hi> Authority <hi>of their</hi> Church <hi>in these matters; when such eminent persons of their own</hi> Communion, <hi>and who certainly were much more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to it than we can be thought to be, yet did not esteem it sufficient to enslave their belief.</hi>

                           <hi>It is a reproach generally cast upon us, that we set up a</hi> private Spirit <hi>in opposition to the</hi> Wisdom <hi>and</hi> Authority <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>of God: and think our selves better able to</hi> judge <hi>in matters of</hi> Faith, <hi>than the most</hi> General Council <hi>that was ever yet as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled.

his Understanding with the utmost skill and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that he is able, to know God's will, and what it is that he requires of us. We do not set up our</hi> own judgments <hi>against the</hi> Authority of the Church; <hi>but having both the Holy</hi> Oracles <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>and the</hi> Definitions of Men <hi>before us, we give to each their proper weight. And therefore if the</hi> one <hi>at any time contradicts the</hi> other, <hi>we resolve, as is most fitting, not that</hi> our own, <hi>but</hi> God's Authority <hi>revealed to us in his</hi> Word, <hi>is to be preferred. And he who without this</hi> examination <hi>servilely gives up himself to follow whatever is required of him; He may be in the right, if his</hi> Church <hi>or</hi> Guide <hi>be so; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this method shall never be able to give a</hi> reason <hi>of his</hi> Faith; <hi>nor if he chance to be born in a</hi> False Religion, <hi>ever be in a capacity of being better instructed. For if we must be allowed nothing but to obey only, and not presume to</hi> enquire <hi>why; He that is a</hi> Jew <hi>must continue a</hi> Jew <hi>still; he that is a</hi> Turk, <hi>a</hi> Turk; <hi>a</hi> Protestant <hi>must always be a</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant: <hi>In short, in whatsoever</hi> profession <hi>any one now is, in that he must continue, whether</hi> true <hi>or</hi> false, <hi>if</hi> reason <hi>and</hi> examination <hi>must be excluded all place in</hi> matters <hi>of</hi> Religion.</p>

a full conviction submit to them. Now if this be their intention, 'tis then clear, let them pretend what they will, that they think us both capable of <hi>judging</hi> in these matters, and that we ought to follow that, which all things considered we find to be most <hi>reasonable,</hi> which is all that we desire.</p>
                        <p>And for this we have here the undoubted <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of those Eminent <hi>Persons</hi> of their <hi>own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> before named; who notwithstanding the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>decision</hi> of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Councils</hi> esteemed by it as <hi>General,</hi> have yet both thought themselves at liberty to <hi>examine their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> and even to pass sentence too upon them, that they were erroneous in the <hi>Points</hi> here mentioned. And therefore certainly we may modestly desire the same liberty which themselves take; at least till we can be convinced, (and that by such Arguments as we shall be allow'd to judge of,) that there is such an <hi>infallible Guide</hi> whom we ought in all things to follow without further inquiry, and where we may find him, and when this is done I will for my part promise as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give up myself to his Conduct, as I am till then, I think reasonably, resolved to follow what according to the best of my ability in <hi>proving all things,</hi> I shall find indeed to be <hi>Good.</hi>

                        </argument>
                        <p>TO understand the true design of our Blessed Saviour, in the <hi>Institution</hi> of this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> we cannot, I suppose, take any better course than to consider first of all, what Account the Sacred Writers have left us of the <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of the doing of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="2" facs="tcp:36811:403"/>
Now for this St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 Cor. 11. 23. <q>
                              <hi>That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betray'd</hi> (having first eaten the Passover according to the Law, Exod. 12. Matt. xxvi. 20.) <hi>took Bread, and when he had given thanks he brake it,</hi> 
                              <note n="*" place="margin">Matt. xxvi.</note> 
                              <hi>and gave it to the Disciples, and said, Take, Eat, This is my Body which is broken for you, This do in Remembrance of Me. After the same manner also he took the Cup when he had supp'd, saying, This Cup is the</hi> New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament <hi>in my Blood: This do ye, as oft as ye Drink it in Remembrance of me.</hi> 
                           </q> 
                        </p>
                        <p>Such is the Account which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us of the <hi>Original</hi> of this <hi>Holy Sacrament:</hi> Nor do the Evangelists dissent from it; only that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> with reference to the <hi>Cup,</hi> adds, <hi>Drink ye ALL of it,</hi> Matt. xxvi. 27. to which St. <hi>Mark</hi> subjoins a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Observation, and which ought not here to be pass'd by, <q>That <hi>they ALL drank of it,</hi>
                           </q> 
                           <bibl>Mark xiv. 23.</bibl>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is not to be doubted, but that the design of our Blessed Saviour in <hi>instituting</hi> this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> was to Abolish the <hi>Jewish Passover,</hi> and to establish the Memory of another, and a much greater <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> than that of the first-born, now to be wrought for the whole World in his Death. The <hi>Bread</hi> which he <hi>brake,</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> which he <hi>poured out,</hi> being such clear <hi>Types</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> to be <hi>broken,</hi> his <hi>Blood</hi> to be <hi>shed</hi> for the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that it is impossible for us to doubt of the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>And as God Almighty under the Law, designed that other Memorial of the <hi>Paschal Lamb,</hi> now changed into a so much better and more excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, to continue as long as the Law its self
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36811:403"/>
stood in force: So this Blessed <hi>Eucharist,</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd by Christ in the room of it must no doubt have been intended by Him, to be continued in his Church, as long as the <hi>Covenant</hi> seal'd with that <hi>Blood</hi> which it exhibits, stands: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that since <hi>that</hi> shall never be abolish'd; 'tis evident that <hi>this</hi> also will remain our Duty, and be our perpetual Obligation to the end of the World.</p>
                        <p>This is the import of our Saviours Addition, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of Me;</hi> and is by St. <hi>Paul</hi> more fully expressed in those Words, which he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately subjoyns to the History of the Institution before recited, 1 Cor. xi. 26. <q>
                              <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew,</hi> i. e. in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Phrase, set forth, Commemorate <hi>the Lords Death till his coming.</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36811:405"/>
certainly considerable it is, that as God under the Law, the same night in which he deliver'd them, instituted the <hi>Passover</hi> to be a perpetual <hi>Memorial</hi> of it throughout their Generations; so here our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour instituted his <hi>Communion</hi> not only in the same Night in which he deliver'd us, but immediately after having eaten His last <hi>Passover;</hi> to shew us, that what that <hi>Solemnity</hi> had hitherto been to the <hi>Jews,</hi> this <hi>Sacrament</hi> should from henceforth be to <hi>us;</hi> and that we by this Ceremony should comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate ours, as they by that other had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do their Deliverance.</p>
                        <p>This the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> themselves direct us to, by so often calling our Blessed Saviour in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press terms, <q>

form of the <hi>Paschal</hi> Phrases; and in a <hi>Ceremony</hi> which 'tis thus evident he designed to introduce in the stead of that <hi>Solemnity;</hi> The best method we can take for explaining both the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>intent</hi> of this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> will be to examine what such men to whom he spake must necessarily have conceived to be his meaning, but especially on an occasion wherein it neither became him to be obscure; and the Apostles silence, not one of them demanding any explication of his words, as at other times they were wont to do, clearly shewing that he was not difficult to be understood.</p>

                           <p>Such is the Account which themselves give of this <hi>Mystery:</hi> From all which we may in short conclude the State of the Question before us, to be this; That we do not dispute at all about Christ's <hi>Real Presence,</hi> which after a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> manner, we acknowledg in this Holy Eucharist, as we shall hereafter shew; nor by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of the <hi>Truth</hi> of Christs <hi>Words</hi> which we undoubtedly believe: But only about this <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of his <hi>Presence, viz.</hi> Whether the <hi>Bread</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36811:407"/>
the <hi>Wine</hi> be changed into the very natural <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, so that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> themselves do no longer remain; But that under the <hi>Appearance</hi> of them is contain'd that same <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of Christ, which was <hi>Born</hi> of the Blessed <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> with his <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Divinity;</hi> which same <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of Christ, tho <hi>extended</hi> in all its parts in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is at the same time in the Sacrament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Extension,</hi> neither <hi>Great</hi> nor <hi>Small,</hi> comes thither neither by <hi>Generation,</hi> nor by <hi>Creation,</hi> nor by any <hi>local Motion;</hi> forasmuch as it continues still at the right Hand of God in Heaven, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same instant that it exists <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>intire</hi> in every consecrated <hi>Host,</hi> or <hi>Chalice;</hi> nay more, is <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>intire,</hi> not only in the <hi>whole Host,</hi> or the <hi>whole Chalice;</hi> but in every the <hi>least Crumb</hi> of the <hi>Host,</hi> and every the <hi>least Drop</hi> of the <hi>Chalice,</hi> here upon Earth.</p>
                           <p>And here it might well be thought a very needless, indeed an extravagant undertaking, to prove that those Elements, which so many of our Senses tell us; continue after their Consecration the very same, as to what concerns their <hi>natural Substance,</hi> that they were before, are in reality the very same: That what all the World <hi>Sees,</hi> and <hi>Feels,</hi> and <hi>Smells,</hi> and <hi>Tasts,</hi> to be <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> is not changed into the very natural <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of a Body actually before existent; had it not entred into the Minds of so great a part of the Christian Church to joyn in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a <hi>Paradox,</hi> which has nothing to defend it, but that fond Presumption they have certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done well to take up, That they cannot possibly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36811:408"/>
be in the <hi>wrong,</hi> and without which it would be very difficult for them to perswade any sober man that they are here in the <hi>right.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To shew that those <hi>words,</hi> which they tell us, work all this <hi>Miracle,</hi> and are the only reason that engages them to maintain so many absurdities as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly the unavoidable Consequences of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, have no such force nor interpretation as they pretend; I must desire it may be remembred what I before remark'd, That this Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> was establish'd by our Saviour in the room of the <hi>Jewish Passover,</hi> and upon the very <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of it. So that, if in that all things were <hi>Typical;</hi> the <hi>Feast,</hi> the <hi>Customs,</hi> the <hi>Expressions</hi> merely <hi>allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> to something that had been done before, and of which this sacred Ceremony was the <hi>memorial;</hi> we ought in all reason to conclude, that both our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our must have designed, and his Apostles understood this Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> to have been the same too.</p>
                           <p>Now as to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Passover;</hi> we have already seen that it was appointed by God as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of his delivery of the <hi>Jews</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he slew all the <hi>first-born</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> xii. The <hi>Lamb</hi> which they ate every year in this Feast, was an Eucharistical Sacrifice and <hi>Type</hi> of that first <hi>Lamb</hi> which was slain in the night of their deliverance, and whose Blood sprinkled upon the Posts of their Doors had preserved their Fore-fathers from the <hi>destroying Angel,</hi> that he should not do them any mischief.

That as by calling the <hi>Lamb</hi> in that Feast <q>The <hi>Body of the Passover,</hi>
                              </q>  they understood that it was the <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of God's mercy in commanding the <hi>destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel</hi> to <hi>pass over</hi> their Houses when he slew their Enemies; the <hi>memorial</hi> of the <hi>Lamb</hi> which was killed for this purpose in <hi>Egypt;</hi> so Christ calling the <hi>Bread</hi> his <hi>Body,</hi> nay, his <hi>Body broken</hi> for

them, could certainly mean nothing else but that it was the <hi>Type,</hi> the <hi>Memorial</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> which as yet was not, but was now just ready to be given for their redemption.</p>

It has before been observed, That these words of our Saviour in this Holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> were used by him instead of that other Expression of the <hi>Master</hi> in the <hi>Paschal Feast,</hi> when in the very same manner he took the very same <hi>Bread</hi> into his Hands, and <hi>blessed</hi> it, and <hi>brake</hi> it, and <hi>gave</hi> it to those who were at the Table with Him, saying, <hi>This is the Bread of affliction which our Fathers ate in Egypt.</hi> And can any thing in the world be more plain, than that as never any <hi>Jew</hi> yet imagined, that the <hi>Bread</hi> which they thus took every year, was by that saying of the <hi>Master</hi> of their Feast changed into the very <hi>substance</hi> of that <hi>Bread</hi> which their forefathers had so many Ages before consumed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the night of their deliverance; but being thus broken and given to them, became a <hi>Type,</hi> a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi> a <hi>Memorial</hi> of it: So neither could those to whom our Saviour Christ now spake, and who as being <hi>Jews</hi> had so long been used to this <hi>Phrase,</hi> ever imagine, that the pieces of that <hi>Loaf</hi> which He <hi>brake,</hi> and <hi>gave</hi> them, saying, <q>
                                 <hi>This is my Body which is broken for you, Do this in Remembrance of me,</hi>
                              </q> became thereupon the <hi>very Body</hi> of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour from whose Hands they received it; and who did not sure with one <hi>member</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> give away his <hi>whole Body</hi> from himself to them; but only designed that by this Ceremony they should <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> Him, and his <hi>Body broken</hi> for them, as by the same they had hitherto <hi>remembred</hi> the <hi>Bread of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which their Fathers ate in Egypt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I ought not to omit it, because it very much confirms the force of this Argument, That what I have here said of this <hi>Analogy</hi> of the Holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> to the

                              <hi>Jewish Passover,</hi> was not the original remark of any <hi>Protestant,</hi> or indeed of any other Christians differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in this point: But was objected to them long before the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> by the <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. apud Author.

                              <hi>Jews,</hi> themselves to shew that in their literal Interpretation of these Words, they had manifestly depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the intention of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and advanced a notion in which 'twas impossible for his Apostles, or any other acquainted, as they were, with the <hi>Paschal</hi> forms, ever to have understood him.

                           <p>It is wonderful to consider with what confidence our new <hi>Missionaries</hi> produce these words on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; and thereby shew us how fond they would be of the Holy Scripture, and how willingly they would make it their <hi>Guide in Controversie,</hi> did it but ever so little favour their Cause. Can any thing, say they, be more express? <hi>This is my Body;</hi> Is it possible for words to be spoken more clear and positive? And indeed were all the Expressions of Holy Scripture to be taken in their <hi>literal</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will not deny, but that those words might as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36811:410"/>
evidently prove <hi>Bread</hi> to be Christs <hi>Body,</hi> as those other in St. <hi>John, I am the Bread that came down from Heaven,</hi> argue a contrary <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> of Christ's <hi>Body</hi> into <hi>Bread,</hi> John vi. 48, 51. or those more usual instances, <hi>I am the true Vine; I am the door of the sheep; That Rock was Christ;</hi> prove a great many <hi>Transubstantiations</hi> more, <hi>viz.</hi> of our Saviour into a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Door,</hi> and a <hi>Rock.</hi> But now, if for all this plainness and positiveness in these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, they themselves tell us, That it would be ridiculous to conclude from hence, that Christ was indeed turned into all these, and many other the like things; they may please to give us leave to say the same of this before us, it being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther less impossible, nor less unreasonable to suppose <hi>Bread</hi> to be changed into Christ's <hi>Body,</hi> than for Christ's <hi>Body</hi> to be changed into <hi>Bread,</hi> a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Door,</hi> a <hi>Rock,</hi> or whatever you please of the like kind.</p>
                           <p>But I have already shewn the ground of this mistake to be their want of considering the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms</hi> and <hi>Phrases</hi> of the <hi>Jewish Passover,</hi> and upon which, both the Holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> it self, and these <hi>Expressions</hi> in it were founded: And I will only add this farther, in confirmation of it; That in the Stile of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language in general, there is nothing more ordinary, than for things to be said to <note n="*" place="margin">

It is a little surprizing in this matter, that they universally tell us, That neither the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nor ending of our Saviours Discourse in that Chapter belongs to this Matter; that both before and after that passage which they refer to, 'tis all <hi>Metaphor;</hi> only just two or three words for their purpose, <hi>Literal.</hi> But that which raises our wonder to the highest pitch, is, that the very fifty first <hi>Verse</hi> its self on which they found their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, is two thirds of it <hi>Figure,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly otherwise in one Clause to serve their <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>It must be confessed, that this is an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way of explaining indeed, and becomes the Character of a Church whose dictates are to be <hi>received,</hi> not <hi>examined;</hi> and may therefore pass well enough amongst those, with whom the supposed <hi>Infallibility</hi> of their <hi>Guides,</hi> is thought a sufficient dispensation for their own <hi>private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</hi> But for us, who can see no reason for this sudden change of our Saviours Discourse;

                              <hi>Paraphrase</hi> set out on purpose to explain it, and which will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly sufficient to shew the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of that <hi>Interpretation</hi> which we give of it.

or Wickedness, or forbid what is profitable and good, it is Figurative.

These are Improbabilities that will need very convincing Arguments indeed to remove them.

                                 <note n="*" place="margin">John xx. 27, 29.</note> Did not Christ himself appeal to them for the proof of his own <hi>Rising?</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The <hi>Romanist</hi> himself believes <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> because he reads in the Scripture, or rather (to speak more agreeably to the method of their Church) because he has been told there are such Words there, as, <hi>Hoc est Corpas Meum:</hi> Now not to enquire how far those words will serve to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant this Doctrine, is it not evident that he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36811:420"/>
cannot be sure there are any such words there, if he may not trust his <hi>Senses:</hi> And if he may, is it not as plain, That he must seek for some other meaning than what they give of them?</p>
                              <p>Let us suppose the change they speak of to be Supernatural; Be it as much as <hi>Miracle</hi> as they desire: The very Character of a <hi>Miracle</hi> is to be known by the <hi>Senses.</hi> Nor God, nor Christ, nor any Prophet or Apostle, ever pretended to any other. And I shall leave it to any one to judge what progress Christianity would have made in the World, if it had had no other <hi>Miracles</hi> but such as <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> to confirm it: <hi>i. e.</hi> Great Wonders confidently asserted, but such as every ones <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> would tell him were both falsely asserted, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be performed.</p>
                              <p>But now whil'st we thus oppose the Errors of some by asserting the continuance of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Substance of the Elements of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in this Holy <hi>Eucharist;</hi> let not any one think that we would therefore set up the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of others; as if this Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> were nothing more than a meer <hi>Rite</hi> and <hi>Ceremony,</hi> a bare <hi>Commemoration</hi> only of Christ's Death and Passion.</p>
                              <p>Our Church indeed teaches us to believe, That the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> continue still in their True and Natural <hi>Substance;</hi> but it teaches us
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36811:421"/>
also that 'tis the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <note place="margin">See the Church Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, and Article Twenty eighth. The Communion-Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                 </note> Christ, which every faithful Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in that Holy Supper: <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> indeed, and after a <hi>Heavenly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> but yet most <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really</hi> too.</p>
                              <p>The Primitive Fathers, of whom we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken, sufficiently assure us, that they were strangers to that <hi>Corporeal change</hi> that is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but for this <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Mystical,</hi> they have openly enough declared for it.</p>
                              <p>Nor are we therefore afraid to confess a <hi>change,</hi> and that a very great one too made in this Holy <hi>Sacrament.</hi> The <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Wine</hi> which we here Consecrate, ought not to be given or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any one in this <hi>Mystery,</hi> as <hi>common</hi> ordinary food. Those Holy Elements which the Prayers of the Church have <hi>sanctified,</hi> and the Divine Words of our Blessed Saviour applied to them, though not <hi>Transubstantiated,</hi> yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly separated to a Holy use and signification, ought to be regarded with a very just Honour by us: And whilst we Worship Him whose Death we herein Commemorate, and of whose Grace we expect to be made partakers by it, we ought certainly to pay no little regard to the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> by which he has chosen to represent the <hi>one,</hi> and convey to us the <hi>other.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Thus therefore we think we shall best divide our Piety, if we <hi>Adore</hi> our Redeemer in <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet omit nothing that may testifie our just esteem of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36811:421"/>
his Holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> on <hi>Earth:</hi> Nor suffer the most Zealous Votary for this new Opinion, to exceed us in our Care and Reverence of Approaching to his Holy Table.</p>
                              <p>We acknowledg him to be no less <hi>Really</hi> Present, tho after another <hi>manner</hi> than they; nor do we less expect to Communicate of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> with our <hi>Souls,</hi> than they who think they take Him car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally into their <hi>Mouths.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Let our <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Communion</hi> be examined; let the Reverence and Devotion, with which we Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate this Sacred Feast, be consider'd; all these will shew how far the Church of <hi>England</hi> is from a light esteem of this great <hi>Mystery;</hi> indeed, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any to set a higher Value and Reverence upon it.</p>
                              <p>I shall close this with the Declaration of One, who after many Years spent in great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their <hi>Communion,</hi> was so happy as to finish his Days in our <hi>Church;</hi> upon his first receiving the Blessed <hi>Communion</hi> among us: <q>

                              <p>Of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> acknowledged by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>IT may sufficiently appear from what has been said in the foregoing Chapter, what just reason we have to reject that kind of <hi>Presence</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> supposes of Christ in this <hi>Holy Eucharist.</hi> But now in Answer to our Reflections upon them on this <note place="margin">Two Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses concerning the Adoration of our B. Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist. <hi>Oxford.</hi> 1687.</note> Occasion, a late Author has thought fit to make the World believe, that we our selves, in our Opinion of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> are altogether as absurd as they are; and that the same Exceptions lie against our own <hi>Church,</hi> which we urge against <hi>theirs:</hi> All which, if it were true, would but little mend the matter, unless it may be thought sufficient for a man to prove, that he is not mad himself, because most of his Neighbours are in the same condition. Indeed herein he must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to have reason on his side, that if the Case be so as he affirms, we, of all men living, ought not to press them with such <hi>Contradictions,</hi> as our own Opinion <note place="margin">Tract. I. pag. 15, 16.</note> stands equally involved in.</p>
                           <p>'Tis true, he confesses for what concerns the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as it stood in the latter <note n="*" place="margin">Tract. I. §. 26.</note> end of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the <hi>oth</hi>'s time, and as it may perhaps be thought to stand now, since the <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid. §. 4.</note> 
                              <hi>reviving</hi> of the <hi>Old Rubrick</hi> against the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> at the end of our <hi>Communion-Office;</hi> it seems not to lye open to such a Recrimination: But taking our Opinion of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> from the Expressions of our own <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
                              <pb n="42" facs="tcp:36811:423"/>
and of those abroad, such as <hi>Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. whose <q>Doctrine, amongst all the rest, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> seems rather to have embraced and agreed with, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially since the beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi> by Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi>
                              </q> it plainly implies, <q>
                                 <hi>That the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christ's Body; That his Natural Body, that very Body that was born of the Blessed Virgin, and crucified on the Cross, is present as in Heaven, so here in this Holy Sacrament, either to the worthy Receiver, or to the Symbols:</hi>
                              </q> which not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the present Declaration of our Church; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                              <q>That <hi>the Natural Body of Christ is not in this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament;</hi>
                              </q> but will also lay a necessity upon us to quit our Reason too that we give for it; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                              <q>
                                 <hi>That it is against the Truth of a Natural Body to be in more places than One at One time;</hi>
                              </q> and on which we seem to found our Faith in this matter.</p>
                           <p>This is, I think, the design of the former of those Discourses lately Printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Real Presence; and in Answer to which, that I may proceed as distinctly as possible, I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my Reflections to these Four Generals:</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. What is the true Notion of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> as acknowledged by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. That this has been the Notion constantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the Generality of our Divines.</item>
                              <item>3. That the <hi>Alteration</hi> of the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> as to this matter, was not upon any such difference in their Opinions, as this <hi>Author</hi> seems to surmise.</item>
                              <item>4. That the Reason alledged by it, concerning the Impossibility of Christ's <hi>Natural Body</hi>'s existing in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36811:423"/>
several places at the same time, is no way invalida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any of his Exceptions against it.</item>
                           </list>
                           <p>But before I enter on these <hi>Reflections,</hi> I cannot but observe the unreasonableness of our Adversaries, in repeating continually the same Arguments against us without either adding of any the least new force to them, or even taking notice of those Replies that have more than once been made against them. The <hi>Publisher</hi> of this <hi>Treatise</hi> has not been so indiligent an Observer of what has past under his Eyes, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to these kind of <hi>Controversies,</hi> as not to know, that this very <hi>Objection,</hi> which is the Foundation of his <hi>First Discourse,</hi> was made by his Old Friend <hi>T. G.</hi> above Nine Years since; and fully answer'd by his Reverend and Learned <hi>Adversary</hi> not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore that he certainly ought either qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to have let alone this Argument already baffled, and not have put the World in Mind where that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate stopp'd; or, at least, he should have added some new strength to it. But to send it again into the World in the same forlorn State it was before; to take no notice either from whose Store-house he borrow'd it, or what had been returned to it; This is in effect to confess, that they have no more to say for themselves: And 'tis a sad Cause indeed that has nothing to keep it up, but what they know very well we can answer, and that they themselves are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend.</p>
                           <p>But to return to the <hi>Points</hi> proposed to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd: And,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>First,</hi> To state the Notion of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> as acknowledged by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="44" facs="tcp:36811:424"/>
I must observe, <hi>1st.</hi> That our <hi>Church</hi> utterly denies our Saviour's <hi>Body</hi> to be so <hi>Really Present</hi> in the Blessed <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as either to leave <hi>Heaven,</hi> or to exist in <hi>several places at the same time.</hi> We confess, with this Author, that it would be no less a Contradiction for <note place="margin">1. Tract. p. 19. §. 27.</note> Christ's <hi>Natural Body,</hi> to be in several places at the same time by any other <hi>Mode</hi> whatsoever, than by that which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> has stated; the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy being in the <hi>thing its self,</hi> and not in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it. 2dly,</hi> That we deny that in the Sacred <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which we receive, there is any other <hi>Substance</hi> than that of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> distributed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants; which alone they take into their Mouths, and press with their Teeth. In short, <q>All which the Doctrine of our <hi>Church</hi> implies by this Phrase, is <note place="margin">Answer to <hi>T. G</hi>'s Dialogues. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1679, pag. 66.</note> only a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of Christ's Invisible <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> so in and with the <hi>Elements,</hi> as by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful receiving of them, to convey <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>real Effects</hi> to the Souls of Men. As the <hi>Bodies</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Angels, might be called their <hi>Bodies,</hi> while they assumed them; or rather, as the <hi>Church</hi> is the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ, because of his Spirit quickening and enlivening the Souls of Believers, so the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> after <hi>Consecration,</hi> are the <hi>Real,</hi> but the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of Christ.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus has that learned Man, to whom <hi>T. G.</hi> first made this Objection, stated the Notion of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> profess'd by us; and that this is indeed the true <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is evident not only from the plain words of our <hi>xxviii. Article,</hi> and of our <hi>Church Catechism;</hi> but also from the whole Tenour of that <hi>Office</hi> which we use in the celebration of it. In our <hi>Exhortation</hi> to it, this Blessed Eucharist is expresly called <q>The <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
                                 <pb n="45" facs="tcp:36811:424"/>
of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our Saviour Christ:</q> We are told, <q>that if with a true Penitent Heart and lively Faith we receive this Holy Sacrament; then we <hi>Spiritually eat</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> of Christ, and <hi>drink</hi> his <hi>Blood.</hi> 
                              </q>When the Priest delivers the consecrated <hi>Bread,</hi> he bids the Communicant <q>Take and eat this in Remembrance that Christ died for thee, and <hi>feed</hi> on him in thy <hi>Heart</hi> by Faith with Thanksgiving.</q> In our Prayer after the Receiving, <q>We thank God, for that he doth vouchsafe to feed us who have duly received these Holy <hi>Mysteries,</hi> with the <hi>Spiritual</hi> food of the most precious <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of his Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, and doth assure us thereby of his favour and goodness towards us, and that we are very Members, incorporate in the <hi>Mystical Body</hi> of his Son.</q> All which, and many other the like Expressions, clearly shew, that the <hi>Real Presence</hi> which we confess in this Holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> is no other than in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Phrase, a <hi>Real Communion</hi> of Christ's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> or as our Church expresses it <hi>Article</hi> xxviii. <q>That to such as rightly and worthily, and with Faith receive the same,</q> the <hi>Bread</hi> which we break is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ,  and likewise the <hi>Cup of Blessing</hi> is a partaking of the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ.</p>
                           <p>Hence it was that in the Prayer of <hi>Consecration</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi> vi. time, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> after the Example of the ancient <hi>Liturgies</hi> of the <hi>Greek Church</hi> used that Form, which our Author observes to have been since left out. <q>And with thy Holy Spirit vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe <note place="margin">Tract. I. 2.</note> to Bless and Sanctifie these thy Gifts and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> that they may be unto us the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus Christ—</q>
                              <hi>i. e.</hi> as the Sense plainly implies, may Communicate to our Souls all the Blessings and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:36811:425"/>
which Christ's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> has purchased for us; which is in Effect the very same we now pray for in the same Address<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <q>Hear us, O Merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we most humbly beseech thee, and grant that we receiving these thy Creatures of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> according to thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christs Holy Institution, in remembrance of his Death and Passion, may be <hi>partakers</hi> of his most Blessed <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi>
                              </q> Between which two Petitions there is so near an Affinity, that had not our Author been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry desirous to find out <hi>Mysteries</hi> where there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none; He would hardly have suffer'd his <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> Friend to have lead him to make so <hi>heavy a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> about so small a Variation.</p>

                           <p>And thus far I have consider'd the forreign Divines produced by our <hi>Author,</hi> and in which we find the very same Explication which our <hi>Church</hi> gives of the <hi>Real presence.</hi> For our own Authors, I shall insist the rather upon them, both to take off any impression which the scraps here put together by those whose business it is to represent their <hi>own Sence,</hi> not their <hi>Authors,</hi> might otherwise be apt to make upon some Men; and also to shew the exact concord there has been ever since the <hi>Reformation</hi> amongst us as to this matter.</p>
                           <p>Now for what concerns our <hi>Divines</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi> vi<hi rend="sup">ths.</hi> time, we have our Authors own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that towards the latter end of the Reign of that excellent Prince, they seem to have deny'd any such <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Essential presence</hi> as he would fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> after. <q>For as the first days of this Prince, <hi>says he,</hi> seem to have been more <note place="margin">1 Treatise §. xxvi. pag 19.</note> addicted to <hi>Lutheranism,</hi> so the latter days to <hi>Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glianism;</hi> as appears in several expressions of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Ridley</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi>
                              </q> And indeed the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> agreed upon in the <hi>Convocation</hi> at <hi>London</hi> 1562. plainly shew it; in the xxixth. of which we find this express Clause; <q>Since the very being of humane <hi>Nature</hi> doth require that the <hi>Body</hi> of one and the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36811:428"/>
same man cannot be at one and the same time in <hi>many places,</hi> but of necessity must be in some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and determinate <hi>place;</hi> Therefore the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> cannot be present in <hi>many</hi> different <hi>places</hi> at the same time. And since, as the Holy Scriptures te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, Christ hath been taken up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> and there is to abide till the end of the World, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh not any of the faithful to believe or profess, that there is a <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Corporal</hi> Presence, as they phrase it, of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ in the <hi>Holy Eucharist.</hi>
                              </q> I shall therefore produce only a Witness or two of this <hi>King</hi>'s Reign; and so pass on to those that follow.</p>

And utterly denies, that this is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther said or thought by him. The <hi>Substance</hi> of the true <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, <hi>says he,</hi> is always in <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor shall it depart thence before the end of the World.

                           <p>Hitherto then there can be no doubt, but that both the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Divines</hi> knew no other <hi>Real Presence</hi> than what has been before acknowledged to

                              </q> which may be very true, and yet but little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if she <hi>propugned</hi> it in the same sense that her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England</hi> had done before, and not in the new Notion imposed upon her by this Author, but without any manner of proof to warrant his suggestion.

                           <p>And here I cannot but again take notice of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuousness of this Author, in dissembling the true Account that has so largely been given by our late ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate Compiler of the <hi>History</hi> of our <hi>Reformation</hi> of this whole matter, only for the advancing so pitiful an Insinuation of what I dare appeal to his own Conscience whether he did not know to be otherwise.

                              <q>This shews, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the whole <hi>Convocation,</hi> was at that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the belief of a <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Corporal Presence</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> only it was not thought necessary or expedient to publish it.

And here I must observe, that this. Learned Person is drawn in only by a Consequence, and that no very clear one neither, to favour his Opinion. The truth is, he has dealt with Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> just as himself, or one <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Protestants Plea for a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> pag. 54.</note> of his Friends has been observed to have done on the like occasion with the incomparable <hi>Chillingworth;</hi> has pick'd up a Passage or two that seemed for his purpose; but dissembled whole Pages in the same place that were evidently against him. For thus Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in the Chapter cited by him, interprets the words of <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> 
                              <q>If we doubt, <hi>says he,</hi> what those admirable words may import, let him be our Teacher for the meaning of Christ, to whom Christ was himself a School-master. Let our Lord's Apostle be his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter; content we our selves with his Explication; <hi>My Body, the Communion of my Body; My Blood,</hi> the <hi>Communion of my Blood.</hi> Is there any thing more expedite, clear and easie, than that as Christ is termed our Life, because through him we obtain Life: So the <hi>parts</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament</hi> are his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> because they are <hi>Causes</hi> instrumental, upon the receit whereof the <hi>participation</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> ensueth?—The <hi>Real Presence</hi> of Christ's most blessed <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> is not therefore to be sought for in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but in the <hi>worthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi>—And again, <hi>p.</hi> 310. he thus interprets the same words; This Hallow'd Food through the concurrence of Divine Power, is in verity and truth unto faithful Receivers instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally a Cause of that <hi>mystical participation,</hi> whereby as I make my self wholly <hi>theirs,</hi> so I give them in hand an actual possession of all such saving <hi>Grace</hi> as my sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed <hi>Body</hi> can yeild, and as their <hi>Souls</hi> do present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly need. <hi>This is</hi> to them and in them <hi>my Body.</hi>

And this may suffice in Vindication of Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi> Those who desire a fuller Account, may find several Pages to the same purpose in the Chapter which I have quoted. The next our Author mentions, is the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> in that much noted passage, as he <note place="margin">Bishop <hi>ANDREWS.</hi> 1 Tract. pag. 7. §. xi. n. 1.</note> calls it, in the Answer to <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>

                           <p>And indeed we need desire no other Passage to judge of his Opinion in this matter; in which 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>.

So that all that worthily communicate, do by <hi>Faith receive</hi> Christ <hi>Really, Effectually,</hi> to all the purposes of his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—It is <hi>Bread</hi> and it is <hi>Christs Body:</hi> It is <hi>Bread</hi> in in <hi>Substance,</hi> Christ in the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and Christ is as <hi>really</hi> given to all that are truly dispos'd, as the <hi>Symbols</hi> are p. 183.—It is here as in the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for as there <hi>natural Water</hi> becomes the <hi>laver of Regeneration;</hi> so here <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> become the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ: but there and here too the first <hi>Substance</hi> is changed by <hi>Grace,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the <hi>same</hi> in <hi>nature</hi>—We say that Christs <hi>Body</hi> is in the Sacrament <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>Spiritually.</hi> They (the <hi>Papists)</hi> say it is there <hi>really,</hi> but <hi>Spiritually.</hi> For so <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> is bold to say that the word may be allowed in this Question. Where now is the difference? Here; By <hi>Spiritually</hi> they mean present after the manner of a <hi>Spirit;</hi> by <hi>Spiritually</hi> we mean present to our <hi>Spirits only;</hi> that is, so as Christ is not present to any other Sence but that of <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi> susception—They
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36811:435"/>
say that Christs <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>truly</hi> present there, as it was upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> but not after the <hi>manner</hi> of all, or any <hi>Body</hi>—But we by the <hi>real Spiritual Presence</hi> of Christ, do understand Christ to be present, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is present in the Hearts of the faithful, by <hi>Blessing</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> and this is <hi>ALL we mean</hi> besides the <hi>tropical</hi> and <hi>figurative</hi> presence.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Such is the Account which that Excellent Bishop here gives not only of his own, but, as he expresly terms, it of the <hi>Church of</hi> England'<hi>s, and the Generality of the Protestants Belief in this Matter.</hi> Our Author's dissimulation of it is so much the more inexcusable, by how much the more zealous an Advocate he <note place="margin">Treatise <hi>1st.</hi> p. 20th.</note> makes him of his Cause, when all this that I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, was in the very same Section, and almost in the same Page with what he has cited. For his little Remark upon the Title of the Bishops Book, where he calls it of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> whence he would infer a difference between the two Terms, and find something <hi>Real</hi> that is not <hi>Spiritual</hi> in this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> it is evident that the Design of that Distinction was this: There be several sorts of <hi>Real Presences;</hi> the <hi>Papists,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> all allow a <hi>Real Presence</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but after dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

In short, thus he concludes the State of the Question, in the same Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Pag 186.</note>

on, between us and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> so that now, <hi>says he,</hi> The Question is not, <q>Whether the <hi>Symbols</hi> be <hi>changed</hi> into Christ's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> or no? For it is granted on all sides: But whether this <hi>Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> be <hi>Sacramental</hi> and <hi>Figurative?</hi> Or whether it be <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Bodily?</hi> Nor is it whether Christ be taken <hi>Really,</hi> but whether he be taken in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> or in a <hi>Natural Manner?</hi> We say the Conversion is <hi>Figurative, Mysterious,</hi> and <hi>Sacramental;</hi> they say, it is <hi>Proper, Natural,</hi> and <hi>Corporal.</hi> We affirm that Christ is <hi>really taken</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit, to all real Effects</hi> of his Passion </q>(this is an Explication a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle different from our Authors) <q>They say he is taken by the <hi>Mouth,</hi> and that the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and the <hi>Virtual</hi> taking him in <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Effect,</hi> is not sufficient, tho' done also in the Sacrament. <hi>Hic Rhodus, hic Saltus.</hi>

                           <p>If this does not yet satisfie him that he has injur'd this Learned Man in the Representation of his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, directly contrary to his Sense, I will offer him yet one Passage more, taken from another part of his Works, and which, I hope, will throughly convince him.

                              <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the <hi>Alterations</hi> which have been made in our <hi>Rubrick,</hi> were not upon the account of our Divines changing their Opinions, as is vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fasly suggested.</p>
                           <p>To give a rational Account of this Affair, we must carefully consider the Circumstances of the Times, the Tempers and Dispositions of the Persons that lived in them; and what the Designs of the <hi>Governing</hi> Parties were with reference to them; and then we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently see both a great deal of Wisdom and Piety in the making of these <hi>Alterations;</hi> allowing the Opinions of those who did it, to have continued, as we have seen, in all of them the same.</p>
                           <p>When first this <hi>Rubrick</hi> was put into King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Liturgy, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was but just rising up out of the Errors and Superstitions with which it had been over-run by the prevalency of <hi>Popery</hi> upon it. It had the happiness to be <hi>reformed,</hi> not as most others were, by private persons, and in many places contrary to the desires of the <hi>Civil Power;</hi> but by a Unanimous Concurrence of the Highest <hi>Authority</hi> both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> Hence it came to pass, that <hi>Convocations</hi> being assembled, <hi>Deliberations</hi> had of the greatest and wisest Persons for the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, nothing was done out of a Spirit of Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness or Opposition; the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> were carefully consulted; and all things examined according to the exactest measures that could be taken from them; and a diligent distinction made of what
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36811:438"/>
was <hi>Popery,</hi> and what <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Catholick Christianity,</hi> that so the One only might be rejected, the other duly retained.</p>
                           <p>Now by this means it was that the Ancient <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> became preserved amongst us; a just and wise <hi>Liturgy</hi> collected out of the <hi>Publick Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals:</hi> Whatever <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were requisite for <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Decency,</hi> were retain'd; and among the rest, that of receiving the <hi>Communion kneeling</hi> for One, which has accordingly ever since been the manner establish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. But that no Occasion of Scandal might hereby be given, whether to our <hi>Neighbour-Churches</hi> abroad, or to any particular Members of our own at home: That those who were yet weak in the Faith, might not either continue or fall back into Error, and by our retaining the same <hi>Ceremony</hi> in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> that they had been used to in the <hi>Mass,</hi> fancy that they were to <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> as they did before: For all these great Ends this Caution was inserted; that the true Intent of this <hi>Ceremony</hi> was only for <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> not that any <hi>Adoration</hi> was thereby <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or ought to be done unto any Real or Essential Presence of Christ's Natural Flesh and Blood, which were not there, but in Heaven, it being against the Truth of Christ's Natural Body to be at One time in more places than One.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And this is sufficiently intimated in the words of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> to have been the first Cause and Design of it. Thus it continued the remainder of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time: But now Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being come to the Crown, there were other Circumstances to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd. Those of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Religion abroad were sufficiently satisfied, both by this <hi>publick Declaration,</hi> which had stood so many years in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36811:439"/>
                              <hi>Church;</hi> and by the Conversation and Acquaintance of our Divines, forced by the dispersion in the foregoing Reign, to seek for refuge among their Brethren in other Countries, of our Orthodox Faith, as to this Point. Our own Members at home had heard too much of this matter in the publick Writings and Disputations, and in the constant Sufferings of their <hi>Martyrs,</hi> not to know that the <hi>Popish Real Presence</hi> was a meer Figment, an <hi>Idolum,</hi> as Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> justly stiles it; and their <hi>Mass</hi> to be <hi>abhorred</hi> rather than <hi>adored.</hi> There was then no longer need of this <hi>Rubrick</hi> upon any of those Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for which it was first establish'd; and there was a very just reason now to lay it aside. That great <hi>Queen</hi> desired, if possible, to compose the Minds of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and make up those Divisions which the differences of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the late unhappy Consequences of them had occasion'd. For this, she made it her business to render the publick Acts of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as agreeable to all Parties as Truth would permit. The Clause of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> inserted in the <hi>Articles</hi> of her first <hi>Convocation,</hi> and <hi>subscribed</hi> by all the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of it (to shew that their belief was still the same it had ever been as to this matter) was nevertheless, as we have seen, struck out for this end their next Session. The Title of <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which her Father had first taken, her Brother continued, and was from both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to her, so qualified and explained, as might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Occasion of quarrelling at it by the most cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons. That Petition in the <hi>Litany</hi> inserted by King <hi>Henry</hi> viii. <q>
                                 <hi>From the Tyranny of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and all his detestable Enormities, Good Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</q> struck out: And in conformity to what was done in the <hi>Articles</hi> as to this Point, this <hi>Rubrick</hi> also was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, lest it should give <hi>Offence</hi> to those who were still
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36811:439"/>
zealous for their mistaken Principles and Worship. This was the Wise and Christian Design of that Excellent <hi>Princess;</hi> and how happy an Effect this Moderation might have had, if the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had not by his Artifice and Authority with some of her Subjects, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, the first Years of her Reign sufficiently shew.</p>
                           <p>Thus was the Occasion and Reason of its omission in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, as great as the necessity of its first Insertion in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s. And in this state it continued all the Reign of that <hi>Queen,</hi> and of her two Successors, King <hi>James</hi> and King <hi>Charles. 1st,</hi> I shall not need to say by what means it was, that new Occasion was given for the reviving of it. We have all of us heard, and many of us seen too much of it. How Order became Superstitious, and Decency termed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> traduced as but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name for <hi>Popery;</hi> and this <hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>kneeling at the Communion,</hi> one of the strongest Arguments of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd for the Proof of it. And now when Panick Fears had found such prevalence over the Minds of Men, as to destroy a King, and embroil a Kingdom into a <hi>Civil War,</hi> of almost Twenty Years continuance; and tho by the good hand of God our King and our Peace were again restored, yet the minds of the People were still unsetled, and in danger of being again blown up upon the least Occasion; what could be more advisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to justifie our selves from all suspicion of <hi>Popery</hi> in this matter, and induce them to a <hi>Conformity</hi> with us in a <hi>Ceremony</hi> they had entertain'd such a dread of, than to revive that ancient <hi>Rubrick;</hi> and so quiet the Minds of the People now, by the same means by which they had been setled and secured before?</p>
                           <p>This I am perswaded is so <hi>rational</hi> an Account, as will both justifie the proceedings of our Governours in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36811:440"/>
these Changes, and shew the dis-ingenuity of those, who not only knowing, but having been told these things, will still rather impute it to an imaginary wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, or uncertainty of Opinion, than to a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Christian Accommodation to the Times. For the change in the Prayer of <hi>Consecration,</hi> I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy said, that 'tis in the Words, not the Sense: And if our Governours thought the present Expressions less liable to exception than the former, they had certainly reason for the Alteration. For the other Exceptions there is very little in them, whether the Minister lay his Hand on the Sacred Elements, when he repeats the words of <hi>Institution,</hi> as at this time, or only consecrates them by the Prayers of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Words of Christ, without any other <hi>Ceremony,</hi> as heretofore: Whether with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> we use only the words of Christ in the distribution; or with most of the Reformed Churches, the other Expression, <q>
                                 <hi>Take and eat this,</hi> &amp;c. </q>or (as we chuse rather) joyn them both together: Whether we sing the <hi>Gloria in Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis Deo</hi>—before or after the receiving; but because the chiefest Mystery he thinks lies in this, That whereas in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days the <hi>Rubrick</hi> called it an <hi>Essential Presence,</hi> which we have now turned into <hi>Corporeal;</hi> I must confess I will not undertake to say what the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it was; if they thought this latter manner more free from giving Offence than the other would have been, I think they did well to prefer it. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one entertain what Notion he pleases of these things; this I have shewn is the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> which we all subscribe, <q>That the <hi>Natural Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our Saviour Christ are in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and not <hi>here;</hi>
                              </q> 
                              <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Sacrament; and if there can be any other <hi>Real Presence</hi> than such as I have shewn to have been the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36811:440"/>
constant belief of our Divines consistent with this <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi> I shall no more desire to debar any one the belief of it, than I shall be willing to be obliged to believe it with him.</p>
                           <p>And now after so clear an Account as I have here gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the several changes that have been made in our <hi>Rubrick,</hi> were I minded to recriminate, and tell the World what Alterations have been made in their Mass, &amp; those in Points infinitely more material than any thing that can be alledged against us, I much question whether they would be able to give us so good an account of it. And something of this I may perhaps offer as a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen</hi> of the wisdom of this Author in the choice of his Accusation before we part; In the mean time I go on to the last thing proposed to be here consider'd.</p>
                           <p>4thly. that the <hi>Reason</hi> mention'd in our <hi>Rubrick</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Impossibility</hi> of Christs <hi>natural Body</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting in <hi>several places</hi> at the <hi>same time,</hi> is no way inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidated by any of this <hi>Authors</hi> exceptions against it.</p>
                           <p>Now these being most of them founded upon the former mistaken Notion of the <hi>Real presence</hi> falsely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, will admit of a very short and plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>

                              <q>That <hi>Protestants,</hi> but especially our <note place="margin">Treatise 1st. §. xx. n. 1. pag. 13.</note> 
                                 <hi>English Divines</hi> generally confess the <hi>presence</hi> of our Saviour in the Eucharist to be an <hi>ineffable Mystery.</hi>
                              </q> Well, be it so; what will he hence infer? Why <q>this he conceives is said to be so in respect of something in it <hi>opposite</hi> and <hi>contradictory</hi> to, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible and ineffable by <hi>Humane Reason.</hi>
                              </q> But supposing they should not think it so from being <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite</hi> and <hi>Contradictory</hi> to, but because the manner how Christ herein communicates himself to us is <hi>hid from,</hi>

and <hi>above</hi> our Humane Reason; might not this be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make it still be called an <hi>ineffable,</hi> and <hi>incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Mystery?</hi> Whereas the other would make it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plain and <hi>comprehensible Nonsence.</hi> 'Tis a strange Affection that some Men have got of late for <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions;</hi> they are so in love with them, that they have almost brought it to be the definition of a <hi>Mystery,</hi> to be the <hi>Revelation</hi> of something to be believ'd in <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to Sense and Reason.</hi> And what by their <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Parallels,</hi> have advanced no very commendable Character of Christianity; as if it were a <hi>Religion</hi> full of <hi>Absurdities;</hi> and as <hi>Fisher</hi> the Jesuit once told King <hi>James</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">st.</hi> with reference to this very Subject, <hi>the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                              <hi>Reason</hi> is the voice of God as well as <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and what is opposite to the one, can no more be agreeable to the other, than God can be contrary to himself. And though, if the <hi>Revelation</hi> be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident,</hi> we submit to it, because we are then sure it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>Reason,</hi> whatever it may appear to us; yet when the <hi>contradiction</hi> is <hi>manifest,</hi> as that a <hi>natural Body should be in more places than one at the same time,</hi> we are sure that interpretation of Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> can never be the right which would infer this, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when there is another, and much more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36811:441"/>
that do's not. And in this we are after all justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by one whose Authority I hope our <hi>Author</hi> will not question, even his own self; <q>If, <hi>says he,</hi> we are <note place="margin">Treatise 1st. §. 29. pag. 21.</note> certain there is a <hi>contradiction,</hi> then we are certain there neither <hi>is</hi> nor <hi>can be</hi> a <hi>contrary Revelation;</hi> and when any <hi>Revelation,</hi> tho' <hi>never so plain,</hi> is brought; <hi>we are bound to interpret it so, as not to affirm a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known impossibility.</hi>
                              </q> And let him that sticks to this rule, interpret Christs words for <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> if he can.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>But do not our own Authors sometimes say, that notwithstanding all the difficulties brought against <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> yet if it can be shewn that God has revealed it, they are ready to believe it?</q> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some may have said this, because for that very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that there are so many <hi>contradictions</hi> in it, they are sure it cannot be shewn that God has <hi>revealed</hi> it. But if he means, as he seems to insinuate, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding such <hi>plain contradictions</hi> as they charge it with, they thought it possible nevertheless, that God might have revealed it, and upon that supposition, they were ready to believe it; I answer from his own words, that their supposa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="2">II. <hi>Observation,</hi> But our Author goes on, <q>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that any one thing that seemeth to us to include

a Perfect <hi>Contradiction,</hi> can no more be effected by divine Power than another, or than many others the like may.

                           </p>
                           <p>Now not to contend with him about words; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever told our Author, that we allow'd that there was any thing in this Sacrament, as received by us, that <hi>seemed</hi> to us to include a <hi>Perfect Contradiction? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Contradictions</hi> we confess are all of them <hi>equally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyable by a divine Power,</hi> that is, are all of them <hi>impossible.</hi> And for this we have his own word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now if there be any such things as <hi>perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions</hi> to be known by us, that which <hi>seems to us</hi> to be a <hi>perfect contradiction,</hi> must <hi>really be a perfect contradiction;</hi> unless <hi>contradictions</hi> are to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd some other way than by seeming to our <hi>Reason</hi> to be so.

                           <p>I shall close up this Discourse of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> acknowledged by us in this Holy <hi>Sacrament,</hi> with a plain familiar Example, and which may serve at once both to illustrate, and confirm the Propriety of it.

The <hi>Son</hi> in this case receives nothing but a <hi>Roll of Parchment,</hi> with a <hi>Seal</hi> tied to it from his <hi>Father;</hi> but yet by virtue of this <hi>Parchment</hi> he is intituled to his <hi>Estate,</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Conditions of his <hi>Will,</hi> and to all the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and Advantages of it: And in that <hi>Deed</hi> he <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> received <hi>the very House</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> that were thereby conveyed to him. Our Saviour Christ in like manner, being now about to leave the World, gives this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> as his final <hi>Bequest</hi> to us; in it he conveys to us a right to <hi>his Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and to all the <hi>Spiritual Blessings</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from them. So that as often as we receive this Holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as we ought to do, we receive indeed nothing but a little <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> into our <hi>Hands;</hi> but by the <hi>Blessing</hi> and <hi>Promise</hi> of Christ, we by that <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> as <hi>really</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> become <hi>Partakers</hi> of Christ's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> as the <hi>Son</hi> by the <hi>Will</hi> of

                           <p>WE are now arrived at the last Part of this <hi>Discourse;</hi> in which I must thus far change the <hi>Method</hi> I pursued in the Other Subject, as to consider,</p>
                           <p>First, What the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as to this Point is; and what our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi> Exceptions against it are.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, What is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and whether what this <hi>Author</hi> has said in favour of it, may be sufficient to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant their <hi>Practice</hi> as to this Matter.</p>
                           <p>For the former of these, <hi>The</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, we shall need go no farther than the <hi>Rubrick</hi> we have before-mention'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is expresly declared, with reference to this Holy Sacrament, <q>That no <hi>Adoration</hi> is intended, or <note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Rubr.</hi> at the end of the Communion.</note> ought to be done, either to the Sacramental <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> there <hi>bodily</hi> received, or to any <hi>Corporal Presence</hi> of Christ's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood:</hi> For that the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36811:445"/>
Sacramental <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> remain still in their very <hi>Natural Substances,</hi> and therefore may not be <hi>adored,</hi> (for that were <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be abhorred of all Faithful Christians) and the <hi>natural Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of our Saviour Christ, are in <hi>Heaven</hi> and not <hi>here;</hi> it being against the truth of Christ's <hi>natural Body,</hi> to be <hi>at One time</hi> in <hi>more places</hi> than <hi>One.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>This then being sufficiently cleared, let us see what this <hi>Author</hi> has to <hi>observe</hi> against it.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <q>He supposes that we will grant, that if there <note place="margin">Treatise 1.

                                 <hi>i. e.</hi> of its being there <hi>ad modum Corporis,</hi> or clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the ordinary Properties of a Body, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd; as it is, not only by the <hi>English</hi> Divines, but by the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Roman:</hi> Yet let there be any other manner of <hi>Presence</hi> (known from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation) of the very same <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> and this as <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Essential,</hi> as if <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real;</hi> and then I do not see but that <hi>Adoration</hi> will be no less due to it <hi>thus,</hi> than <hi>so,</hi> Present.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now to this I shall at present only say, That the <hi>Supposition</hi> being <hi>absurd,</hi> do's not admit of a <hi>rational</hi> Consideration. Those who deny a <hi>bodily Presence</hi> of Christ's <hi>Body</hi> in the Eucharist, and ask whether <hi>Adoration</hi> may not be paid to his <hi>Body,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd not to be <hi>bodily present</hi> there, supposing it to be there some other way; ought to have no other
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36811:446"/>
satisfaction than this, that they suppose an Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, a thing which cannot be; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which no reasonable Answer can be given. Some I know have been more free, and allowing for the unreasonableness of the <hi>Supposal,</hi> have resolved contrary to our Author: But I think it very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to dispute of the Affections of a <hi>Chimera;</hi> and wrangle about Notions that have neither Use nor Existence.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. He <hi>observes,</hi> lastly, <q>That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Treatise 1. p. 28. §. xli.</note> hath believed and affirmed such a <hi>Presence (he means of Christ's</hi> Body <hi>in the</hi> Eucharist) to which they thought <hi>Adoration</hi> due.</q> I presume it was then in the Times of <hi>Popery;</hi> for since the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> I have shewn before, that she has always held the contrary. But our Author will prove it, and that since the <hi>Reformation;</hi> 
                              <q>For, <hi>he says,</hi> he <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> has in his time met with no less than five of our Writers, and those of no mean Account neither, that have been of this Opinion.</q> This indeed is a very notable way of proving the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our <hi>Church:</hi> But what now if I should bring him <hi>fifteen Others</hi> that have deny'd it; then I hope the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> may be as fair for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But we will examine his Evidence.</p>
                           <p>First; <q>Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> he says, declares, that <note place="margin">Treatise 1. §. xlii. p. 28.</note> tho we <hi>adore</hi> not the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> yet we adore <hi>Christ</hi> in and with the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> besides and without the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> and assures the World, that K. <hi>James</hi> looked upon Christ to be <hi>truly present,</hi> and <hi>truly</hi> to be <hi>adored</hi> in it.</q> How this <hi>Bishop</hi> thought Christ <hi>truly present</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> we have seen before; and may from thence easily conclude how he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed he might be <hi>adored</hi> there: <hi>viz.</hi> As in all other
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36811:446"/>
                              <hi>Holy Offices,</hi> in which we confess Him by his <hi>Divine Power</hi> to be <hi>present</hi> with us, but especially in this <hi>Sacred Mystery.</hi> And thus we all <hi>adore</hi> him, both in and with, and without the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> we confess him to be <hi>truly present,</hi> and therefore <hi>truly</hi> to be <hi>adored</hi> by us. But now for Christ's <hi>Natural Body,</hi> (of which, and not of Christ himself, our Dispute is) if that be any otherwise <hi>truly present</hi> than as we before shew'd, let it be remembred, that according to this <hi>Bishop,</hi> it must not be his <hi>Glorified Body,</hi> his <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> as it now is; but his <hi>Body Crucified,</hi> his <hi>Body</hi> as <note place="margin">See above.</note> 
                              <hi>offer'd for us,</hi> and in the <hi>State of his Death;</hi> so He expresly affirms; and this I believe our <hi>Author</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will confess in his sense to be impossible.</p>
                           <p>His next Witness is Bishop <hi>Taylor:</hi> 
                              <q>We <hi>worship,</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Treatise 1. §. xliii. p. 28.</note> He means, says this Author, the <hi>Body,</hi> or the <hi>Flesh</hi> of Christ [in the Eucharist].</q> But is he sure the Bishop meant so? If he be, I am sure the Bishop thought we all of us committed <hi>Idolatry</hi> in so doing. For being consulted, as we have seen above, <q>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without all danger of <hi>Idolatry</hi> we may not <note place="margin">See Polemical Discourses 5.

                              </q> And indeed this our Author knew very well was his Opinion, who himself in his next Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, cites the <hi>xiiith</hi> Section of his <hi>Real Presence,</hi>

                              <hi>Protestant</hi> Minister, who in the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>France</hi> being brought over to the King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, was secretly reconciled to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and permitted so far to dissemble his own Opinion, as not only to continue in the outward profession of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> but even to exercise the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his <hi>Ministry</hi> as before; and that by the express leave of his <hi>Holiness,</hi> for three whole Years, the better to carry on the <hi>Catholick Cause</hi> in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Secrets, and managing the Debates of his Brethren.</p>
                           <p>As for Bishop <hi>Forbes,</hi> and the Arch-bishop of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latto,</hi> it is not to be wondred if Men that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained the Design of <hi>reconciling all Parties,</hi> were forced to strain sometimes a little farther than was fit for the doing of it. And for Mr. <hi>Thorndyke,</hi> we have seen that his Notion of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> was particular, and widely different both from theirs and ours; and therefore that we are not to answer for the Consequences of it. But however, to quit
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36811:447"/>
these just Exceptions against them: Will he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self allow every thing to be the <hi>Doctrine</hi> or not of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I shall bring him three of their <hi>Authors</hi> to affirm or deny? If he will, then <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is not their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> for I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready quoted above twice three of their most Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men against it. To <hi>adore</hi> an <hi>Unconsecrated Host</hi> by mistake, is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> for so S. <hi>Thomas, Paludanus, Catharine,</hi> and others, assure us: To worship the <hi>Host,</hi> supposing their Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> false, a worser <hi>Idolatry</hi> than any Heathens were ever guilty of; so several of their Writers confess. But now if our Author will not allow this to be good <hi>arguing</hi> against them, with what reason do's he go about to urge it against us?</p>
                           <p>Secondly; We must in the next place consider what the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as to this <hi>Point</hi> is; and whether what this <hi>Author</hi> has advanced in favour of it, may be sufficient to warrant their <hi>practice</hi> of this <hi>Adoration.</hi>

                           <p>For the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> I find it thus clearly set down by the <hi>Council of Trent:</hi>

                              <q>There can be no doubt, but that all the Faithful of Christ, after the manner that has ever been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> ought to give that <hi>Supreme Worship</hi> which is due to the <hi>true God,</hi> to his <hi>Holy Sacrament.</hi> For it is nevertheless to be <hi>adored,</hi> because it was instituted by our Lord

                              <hi>adoration</hi> of it upon any such account, I have just now declared his Mistake of them in that Point too. And I shall not follow our Author's ill Example in repeating it all over again.</p>
                           <p>For his <note n="*" place="margin">§. vii. p. 10.</note> fifth Remark, <q>That the <hi>Lutherans</hi> affirm that <hi>Christ's Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> are <hi>present,</hi> not only to the worthy <hi>Communicants,</hi> but to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Symbols,</hi> and whilst so present, which is during the Action of the Lord's Supper <hi>(i. e.</hi> says he, as I conceive them from the <hi>Consecration,</hi> till the end of the <hi>Communion)</hi> are to be <hi>Adored.</hi>
                              </q> I answer; First, As to the former part, it is confess'd that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do indeed suppose Christ to be present, not only to the <hi>worthy Communicants,</hi> but also to the <hi>Consecrated Symbols.</hi> But now, secondly, for the other part, that during the <hi>Action of the Lord's Supper, He is</hi> to <hi>be Adored there;</hi> this is not so certain. For, 1. I do not find any thing establish'd amongst them as to this matter, neither in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> of <hi>Auxpourg,</hi> nor in any other <hi>publick Acts</hi> of their <hi>Church.</hi> 2. I find several of their Divines ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denying, that <hi>Christ's Body</hi> is to be <hi>Adored</hi> in the <hi>Holy Sacrament;</hi> and our <note n="*" place="margin">See below, Disc. 2. p. 16.</note> 
                              <hi>Author</hi> himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses it. Tho now, 3. <note n="†" place="margin">Conrad. Schlusselburgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Catal.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36811:449"/>
that Christ is present during the Action of the Lord's Supper; and therefore it is by several of them supposed, that he ought to be <hi>adored</hi> in it.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>As to the sixth and last <hi>Concession,</hi> which he draws <note place="margin">§. vi. p. 10, 11.</note> from Monsieur <hi>Daille's Apologie,</hi> 
                              <q>That tho we do not our selves belive the <hi>Real Presence</hi> of Christ'<hi>s Body</hi> in the <hi>Signs,</hi> yet neither do we esteem the belief of it so criminal, as to oblige us to break off <hi>Communion</hi> with all those that hold it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that had the <hi>Roman Church</hi> no other Error but this, that it would not have given us any suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause of separation from it; we are ready to admit it;</q>  always supposing that the belief of it had not been press'd upon us neither, as a necessary <hi>Article of Communion;</hi> nor any <hi>Anathema</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against us for not receiving it. And for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of it which he subjoyns, <q>That a Disciple <note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 11.</note> giving Divine Honour, upon mistake, to another Person, much resembling our Saviour Christ, would have been no <hi>Idolater;</hi>
                              </q> from whence he would infer, <q>That therefore allowing a <hi>Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Host</hi> to be truly <hi>Adorable,</hi> a Person that should by mistake adore an <hi>unconsecrated One,</hi> would not be guilty of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                              </q> We are content to allow it; tho what use he can make of it in this <hi>Controversy,</hi> unless against his own Brethren, S. <hi>Thomas, Paluda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and others, I do not understand; since he knows we utterly deny any <hi>Host, consecrated</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> to be fit to be <hi>worshipped.</hi> And this may serve for his first Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Protestant Concessions,;</hi> which were they every one as certain as his first is, that <hi>Christ is to be adored,</hi> I cannot see what his Cause would gain by it; and he has not by any <hi>Application</hi> of them in this <hi>Treatise,</hi> given us the least reason to think that they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36811:450"/>
are of any moment in it. But some Men have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar faculty of amusing the World with nothing: and I remember, I once heard a judicious and modest Man give this <hi>Character</hi> of an Author much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ours, with reference to his <hi>Guide in Controversy,</hi> that for a <hi>Book</hi> which carried a great appearance of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> it had the least in it of any he ever met with.

                           <p>For our Saviour Christ, 'tis evident that the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols</hi> instituted by him, were <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine:</hi> They were these that he <hi>took</hi> and <hi>blessed,</hi> and <hi>gave</hi> to his <hi>Disciples;</hi> and commanded them also in like manner to <hi>take,</hi> and <hi>bless,</hi> and <hi>give to others</hi> in <hi>remembrance of him;</hi> and as the <hi>Symbols</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> in this <hi>Holy Eucharist.</hi> But now for the <hi>Papists;</hi> they destroy the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Wine;</hi> they leave only a few aiery, empty <hi>Species,</hi> that is, appearances of something, but which are really nothing, have no <hi>substance</hi> to support them.</p>

The <hi>Symbols</hi> establish'd by Christ were <hi>Festival Symbols,</hi> a matter apt for our <hi>Corporal Nourishment;</hi> so signify to us, that as by them, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> our <hi>Bodies</hi> are nourished to a <hi>Corporal Life;</hi> so by the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, which they both <hi>represent</hi> and <hi>communicate to us,</hi> our Souls are fed to <hi>Life Everlasting.</hi> But for that which hath no <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, i. e.</hi> nothing which can be converted into our <hi>Bodily Nourishment;</hi> how that can be a <hi>Symbol</hi> of this <hi>Spiritual Food,</hi> I do not very well understand. Indeed our Author tells us, <q>That tho after Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, <note place="margin">Pag. 14. §. x.</note> the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd to remain, yet is <hi>Substance</hi> here taken in such a sense, as that neither the <hi>hardness,</hi> nor the <hi>soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> nor the <hi>frangibility,</hi> nor the <hi>savour,</hi> nor the <hi>odour,</hi> nor the <hi>nutritive virtue</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>visible</hi> or <hi>tangible,</hi> or otherwise <hi>perceptible</hi> by any <hi>Sense,</hi> is involved in it: </q>That is to say, that the <hi>Symbol</hi> or <hi>external Sign</hi> then in this Eucharist, is according to them, a <hi>hard, soft, frangible, gustible, odoriferous, nutritive, visible, tangible, perceptible no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Verily a fit <hi>external Species</hi> indeed to contain, a <hi>one, manifold; visible, invisible; extended, unexten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; local, illocal; absent, present; natural, superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; corporal, spiritual Body.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly; Concerning the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> he tells us, <q>That this word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> is <note place="margin">Pag. 14. §. xi.</note> not to be taken always in the same sense; but sometimes to be used to signify only the <hi>external Sign,</hi> or <hi>Symbols;</hi> sometimes only the <hi>Res Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> or the thing contain'd under them, which is the more principal part thereof.</q> This indeed is a sort of new Divinity. I always thought hitherto, that when we talked of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> properly so
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36811:451"/>
called, we had meant an <hi>outward and visible Sign of an inward and spiritual Grace:</hi> and that this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Sacrament</hi> had been a whole composed of the <hi>External Species,</hi> (whatever they are) as the <hi>Sign;</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ as the <hi>inward part,</hi> or <hi>thing signified.</hi> Thus I am sure the <hi>Catechism</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> instructs us. First, for the name; it tells us, that <q>
                                 <hi>The Latin Doctors have thought</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Catech. ad Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach. part 2. de Sacram. n. iii. &amp; v. p. 92.</note> 
                                 <hi>that certain Signs, subjected to the Senses, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and as it were set before the Eyes, the Grace which they effect, may fitly be called Sacraments.</hi>
                              </q> And for the <hi>nature</hi> of them, thus it defines a <hi>Sacrament</hi> from S. <hi>Austin,</hi> 
                              <q>It is the <hi>sign</hi> of a <hi>holy thing;</hi>
                              </q> or more fully, as I before said; <hi>a visible sign of an</hi> 
                              <q>
                                 <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Grace, instituted for our Justification.</hi>
                              </q> So that neither then <hi>Symbols</hi> alone, nor the <hi>invisible part,</hi> or <hi>Grace alone,</hi> can with any manner of <hi>propriety</hi> be called a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> but the <hi>Sign</hi> referr'd to the <hi>Grace;</hi> and as it is the <hi>Symbol</hi> instituted by Christ for the <hi>conferring</hi> of it.</p>
                           <p>This therefore can with no good reason be called a <hi>Catholick Assertion;</hi> being neither <hi>general</hi> nor <hi>true:</hi> But however, since he seems content to allow it to be an <hi>impropriety of Speech,</hi> and that, I confess, the <note n="*" place="margin">Catec.

                              <hi>Catechism</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> does lead him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; let us see what use he can make of it. <note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 15. §. xi.</note> 
                              <q>And as Protestants much press, so <hi>Catholicks (Roman Catholicks)</hi> willingly acknowledg a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between these two, The worshipping of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as this word is taken for the <hi>Symbols;</hi> and the worshipping of <hi>Christ's Body</hi> in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                              </q> There is, no doubt, a <hi>great difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>these two:</hi> but then they who tell us, the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> is to be <hi>Adored,</hi> if they will speak <hi>rationally,</hi>
                              <pb n="99" facs="tcp:36811:451"/>
must mean neither the <hi>one</hi> nor <hi>other</hi> of these, but the <hi>Host;</hi> that is, as Card. <hi>Pallavicini</hi> expounds it, The <hi>whole,</hi> of which <hi>Christ's Body is a part;</hi> in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Council of Trent;</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> IN WHICH they believe <hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>present,</hi> and for that <hi>Cause adore</hi> it; as the Cardinal again argues; <note n="*" place="margin">See above, <hi>pag.</hi> 91, 92.</note> that, <hi>To make a Whole Adorable, it is sufficient that one part be so; and therefore since the Body of Christ is adorable, the Sacrament for its sake is to be worshipped.</hi> It is therefore a meer shift to tell us that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is to be <hi>adored; i. e. Christ's Body</hi> in the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Nor will the remark of our Author help us out, that tho the <hi>Chapter</hi> indeed calls it the <hi>Sacrament</hi> IN <note place="margin">Pag. 16. §. xiii.</note> WHICH <hi>is Christ's Body,</hi> yet the <hi>Canon</hi> speaks more <hi>precisely,</hi> and calls it <hi>Christ in the Sacrament;</hi> unless he supposes the <hi>Council</hi> to have been <hi>infallible</hi> in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> only, and not in the <hi>Chapters;</hi> as some have thought, that they may be out in their <hi>Proofs,</hi> but cannot be in their <hi>Conclusions.</hi> But however, since he so much desires it, for my part I shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to allow them this too; for I should be glad by any means to see them sensible of their Errors. But yet so as that it be esteem'd only a <hi>private Opinion this,</hi> not a <hi>Catholick Assertion.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly; <hi>Catholicks,</hi> he means the <hi>Papists</hi> still, <note place="margin">P. 21. §. xvii.</note> 
                              <q>ground their <hi>Adoration,</hi> not upon <hi>Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> as if <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> defeated, <hi>Adoration</hi> is so too; but on a <hi>Real Presence</hi> with the <hi>Symbols,</hi> which in general is agreed on by the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them.</q> By which Assertion, if he means only to make this Discovery, That Christ's <hi>Real Presence,</hi> together with the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> is in his Opinion as good a ground for <hi>Adoration,</hi> as if he were there only with the

                              <hi>Species</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> the <hi>Substance</hi> being changed into his <hi>Body;</hi> I have no more to say to it.

And therefore, whereas he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,</p>
                           <p>Fourthly; <q>That supposing <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to be an <hi>Error,</hi> yet if the Tenent of <hi>Corporal</hi> or <hi>Real</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">P. 22. §. xviii.</note> 
                                 <hi>Presence</hi> (as held by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or others) be true; <hi>Catholicks</hi> (he would say <hi>Papists)</hi> plead their <hi>Adoration,</hi> is no way frustrated, but still warrantable:</q> I must tell him, that the <hi>Adoration</hi> of those among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who worship Christ in this Sacrament upon the account of his <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> in, or with the <hi>Bread,</hi> tho it be an Error, yet is infinitely more excusable than theirs, who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the <hi>Bread</hi> to be turned into Christ's <hi>Body;</hi> and because it may not be thought that I speak this out of any prejudice against them, I will here offer my Reasons for it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>1st,</hi> They that <hi>adore Christ</hi> as <hi>really present,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>Bread,</hi> do no violence to their <hi>Senses:</hi> They confess, that what they <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>taste,</hi> and <hi>feel,</hi> and <hi>smell,</hi> is <hi>really Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> Whilst the <hi>Papist</hi> in denying the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to remain; or that what he <hi>sees,</hi> and <hi>feels,</hi> and <hi>smells,</hi> and <hi>tastes,</hi> is what all the World perceives and knows it is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts his <hi>Senses,</hi> and in them the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
                              <pb n="101" facs="tcp:36811:452"/>
that Means which God has given us to <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>lead</hi> us into the search of <hi>Truth;</hi> and by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence errs against infinitely greater Means of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> and so is more inexcusable than the Other.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>2dly;</hi> They who worship Christ, as supposing Him to be together with the <hi>Bread</hi> in this <hi>Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> are erroneous indeed in this, that they take Christ's <hi>Body</hi> to be where really it is not; but yet their Object is undoubtedly right, and in that they are not mistaken. But now for the <hi>Papist;</hi> he <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dores,</hi> 'tis confess'd, what he thinks to be Christ's <hi>Body;</hi> and would not otherwise <hi>adore</hi> it: But yet still 'tis the <hi>Host</hi> that he <hi>adores,</hi> the Substance that is under those <hi>Species</hi> which he sees; and which if it be not Christ, but meer <hi>Substance</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> the Case is vastly alter'd between the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Him.</hi> The former <hi>adores Christ,</hi> only as in a place where he is not; the latter not only do's this, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>adores</hi> a <hi>Substance</hi> for Christ which is not his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> but a meer <hi>Creature</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Monsieur <hi>Daille</hi> therefore might rightly enough say of a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> 
                              <q>that his <hi>Adoration</hi> is mistaken, <note place="margin">P. 23. §. xix.</note> not in this—that it addresseth it self to an <hi>Object</hi> not <hi>adorable,</hi> but only that by Error it seeks and thinks to enjoy it in a place where it is not; and so becomes only <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>unprofitable:</hi>
                              </q> And yet our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has no manner of Reason from thence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that a <hi>Papist</hi> who terminates his <hi>Adoration</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Substance</hi> which <hi>really</hi> is not Christ's <hi>Body,</hi> but only mistaken by him to be so, shall be in the same Condition: there being an apparently vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between worshipping Christ in a place where he is not, and worshipping that for Christ which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36811:453"/>
really is not Christ, but only a created <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And this in truth our Author seems to have been sensible of, and therefore thinks to evade it, by saying, <q>That they do not worship the <hi>Substance</hi> that is in <note place="margin">Ibid p. 23.</note> that <hi>place,</hi> under such <hi>Accidents</hi> whatever it be, (which if <hi>Bread</hi> should happen to be there, he confesses would make them <hi>Bread-worshippers)</hi> but they worship it only upon <hi>supposition</hi> that it is Christ's <hi>Body,</hi> and not <hi>Bread.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Well, be this so: But what now if they are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in their <hi>Supposition:</hi> They worship, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, the <hi>Substance-</hi>that is under those <hi>Accidents,</hi> supposing it to be Christ's <hi>Body;</hi> but still, mistaken or not, that <hi>Substance</hi> which is under those Species, whatever it be, they do worship: And if they have, as he thinks, a <hi>rational ground</hi> for this <hi>Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which we shall see by and by, yet this will only excuse them from being <hi>formal Idolaters;</hi> but will not hinder but that their Worship is still directed to an <hi>undue Object,</hi> if that which is under the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> be indeed but <hi>Bread,</hi> and not Christ's <hi>Body</hi> as they imagine. And this then may serve to argue the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of what he lays down as his</p>
                           <p>Fifth, <hi>Catholick Assertion:</hi> 
                              <q>That supposing both <note place="margin">P. 22. §. xix.</note> the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> mistaken in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, yet there can be no pretence why the One should not be as excusable as the others.</q> Since as I have said; <hi>1st,</hi> They err more grosly in abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conviction of their <hi>Senses,</hi> which the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> do not; <hi>2dly,</hi> They worship a <hi>Substance</hi> for <hi>Christ,</hi> which really is not: To which if this be not enough, I will add yet two other Reasons: <hi>3dly,</hi> That they make the <hi>Consecration,</hi> without
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36811:453"/>
which Christ is not present upon their own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to depend on such uncertainties (as I shall more fully shew anon) that they can never be sure that Christ is there, which the <hi>Lutherans</hi> are free from: And lastly; They <hi>Anathematize</hi> those who dissent from them as to this <hi>Point,</hi> and so make a <hi>Schism</hi> in dividing the <hi>Unity of the Church,</hi> which the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> are so far from doing, that they neither esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish any Doctrine of <hi>Adoration</hi> at all, nay many of them do not believe it; and upon occasion, freely <hi>communicate</hi> with those who dissent from them in their belief, both of their way of the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and of the <hi>Adoration.</hi> And for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I cannot totally assent to his</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Sixth Assertion:</hi> 
                              <q>That supposing there be no <note place="margin">P. 25. §. xxi.</note> such <hi>Real Presence</hi> as either of them believes, yet that their <hi>adoration</hi> of Christ, who is a true <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Supreme Adoration,</hi> and only by them mistaken to be in some <hi>place</hi> where He is not, cannot be termed any such <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as is the <hi>worshipping</hi> of an <hi>Object</hi> not at all <hi>adorable.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>This as to what concerns those of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> who adore Christ in the Sacrament, is true: But for the <hi>Papist</hi> it is not. He intends, I allow it, to worship Christ, but he mistakes an <hi>Object</hi> for <hi>Christ,</hi> which is only a piece of <hi>Bread.</hi> He worships his <hi>Host,</hi> supposing it to be our <hi>Saviour's Body,</hi> but his Error is gross, and he not only mistakes Christ to be in a place where he is not, but he mistakes that to be Christ which indeed is not, but only a <hi>simple Wafer.</hi> His Worship therefore is not like the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> worshipping of Christ in the <hi>Sun;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as if the <hi>Manichee</hi> should, from some mistaken grounds, have fancy'd the <hi>Sun</hi> it self to be turned
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36811:454"/>
into Christ's <hi>Body;</hi> and then in defiance of all <hi>Scripture, Sense,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> should have fallen down before it; but with a <hi>good Intention</hi> not to <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> but the <hi>Body</hi> of our Blessed Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> of the <hi>Sun.</hi> This is the true <hi>Parallel;</hi> only that herein still the <hi>Manichee</hi> would have been the more excusable of the two, by how much the <hi>Sun</hi> is a more likely Object to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for Christ's <hi>glorified Body</hi> than <hi>a Morsel of Bread;</hi> and less capable of being discovered by our <hi>Senses</hi> and <hi>Examination</hi> not to be so.</p>
                           <p>It remains then, that these <hi>Lutherans</hi> only <hi>adore</hi> Christ where he is not; the <hi>Papists</hi> not only do this, but more-over they <hi>adore</hi> that for <hi>Christ</hi> which <hi>really is not,</hi> but a meer <hi>created Substance.</hi> Both the One and the Other are Erroneous; but the Papist's Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, renders him at the least guilty of <hi>material I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,</hi> whereas the <hi>Lutherans</hi> is only an undue Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Worship as to the <hi>Place,</hi> but right as to the <hi>Person.</hi> Let us see,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Seventhly;</hi> How far their Mistake will excuse them, in answer to his <hi>seventh Assertion:</hi> 
                              <q>That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a <hi>Manichaean</hi> may be guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> for <note place="margin">P. 26. §. xxii.</note> worshipping Christ in the Sun; and an <hi>Israelite</hi> for worshipping God as specially resident in the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> because it is <hi>adoring</hi> a Fancy of their own, without any <hi>rational Ground</hi> or <hi>Pretence</hi> thereof; and however meerly a <hi>good Intention,</hi> grounded upon a <hi>culpable Ignorance,</hi> can excuse none from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or any other Fault; yet if <hi>Catholicks, (i. e.</hi> the pretended Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks) can produce a <hi>rational Ground</hi> of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Christ <hi>present</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> tho possibly mistaken in it, they are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excused
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36811:454"/>
from <hi>Idolatry.</hi>

But then it must be remembred too, that he confesses if these <hi>Grounds</hi> be not <hi>reasonable,</hi> but as he says of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> their <hi>adoring of the Host</hi> be indeed an <hi>adoring</hi> a <hi>Fancy</hi> of their own without any <hi>rational Ground;</hi> So that their ignorance in this Matter is culpable, then by their own allowance they are <hi>Idolaters.</hi>

But before we proceed to these Points, we must vet have one touch more upon the old String: <q>For <note place="margin">Pag. 26. §. xxiii.</note> the <hi>Lutherans, he says,</hi> being allow'd to have such a plausible <hi>Ground</hi> or Motive for their <hi>Adoration,</hi> whereby they become Absolved by other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants from <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in <hi>adoring</hi> our Lord as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent there, I see not why the <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> should be any whit less valued than theirs.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>In Answer to which, the <hi>Reader</hi> may please to remember, that I have before said, that we do not excuse those <hi>Lutherans</hi> who do this so much upon this Principle, that they have a more <hi>plausible Ground</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> for their <hi>Adoration;</hi> but for this rather, that confessing the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> to remain, they do not mistake their <hi>Object,</hi> but pay their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration</hi> indeed to <hi>Christ,</hi> only supposing him to be there where in Truth he is not. But, <hi>2dly,</hi> this Author is very much mistaken if he thinks the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> have no better a Foundation for their <hi>Real Presence</hi> than the <hi>Papists.</hi> Indeed, were the difference <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>See</hi> Ibid.</note> no greater than between a <hi>Con</hi> and a <hi>Trans,</hi> it would, I confess, be hardly worth the while to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. But when we come to the Point it self, we may observe these four Advantages, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> side. 1. They confess for the outward <hi>Elements,</hi> that they are <hi>really</hi> what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be, <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine;</hi> and so they do no <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> to their <hi>Senses;</hi> which, as I have said, is a great <hi>aggravation</hi> against the <hi>Papists.</hi> 2. By this means they are at no defiance with all those Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where they are so often called <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> after <hi>Consecration:</hi> All which the <hi>Papist</hi> contradicts, but the <hi>Lutheran</hi> does not. 3. From the words of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36811:455"/>
Christ, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> we all of us confess may be inferr'd, that <hi>Christ's Body</hi> is in this Holy <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> But whence do's the <hi>Papist</hi> infer the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread;</hi> so that what is <hi>taken,</hi> and <hi>blessed,</hi> and <hi>given,</hi> is not <hi>Bread,</hi> but Christ's <hi>Body</hi> under the appearance of <hi>Bread?</hi> This is an Error which I am sure the Text gives no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of colour to; and therefore our Author cannot with any reason pretend, as he do's, whether we consult the Text of Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> or our own <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> that they have as good <hi>grounds</hi> for their <hi>Real Presence,</hi> as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> have for theirs. To all which let me add, <hi>4thly,</hi> that by <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> they destroy the very Nature of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> by leaving no true external <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Symbol,</hi> and which is another unanswerable Argument against them, whilst the <hi>Lutherans</hi> acknowledging the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> to remain, do not destroy at all the Nature of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but retain the same <hi>Sign</hi> which our Blessed Lord established, and so have no Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on this side neither to convict them.</p>
                           <p>But yet notwithstanding all this, <q>Do not some <note place="margin">Pag. 26, 27.</note> of our Writers confess, that the <hi>Papists</hi> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is more rational than the <hi>Lutherans?</hi>

And if these Reasons I have here given for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary are valid, they ought to be more regarded, than the ungrounded Assertions of a <hi>Sacramentary</hi> Historian.</p>

                                 <hi>Adoration</hi> upon <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> but on <hi>Corporal Presence;</hi> and so they must <hi>both</hi> be excused, or neither.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is a fetch to very little purpose: For let me ask this Author; He confesses he founds his <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon the <hi>Corporal Presence:</hi> Do's he believe the <hi>Corporal Presence</hi> in the way of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> exclusive to all others, or no? If he do's, then 'tis evident that the <hi>Corporal Presence</hi> and <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> must with him stand or fall together; and so if he <hi>adores</hi> on the account of the <hi>Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> he do's it upon the account of <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> If he do's not believe this, 'tis plain he is no <hi>Papist,</hi> nor submits to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which has defined the <hi>Corporal Presence</hi> to be after this particular manner, exclusive to all Others, and <hi>Anathematized</hi> all that dare to deny it.</p>
                           <p>Laying aside therefore this Comparison, <hi>and which in truth will do them but very little kindness:</hi> 
                              <q>Let us view more particularly what rational <note place="margin">Pag. 27. §. xxiv.</note> Grounds they have to exhibit for this their belief of their <hi>Corporal Presence</hi> of Christ in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> and of the <hi>Adoration</hi> of him upon that account.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>I. <hi>Ground:</hi> And the first is <hi>Divine Revelation:</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> For which our Author offers the two usual Instances, of the <hi>words of Institution,</hi> and the <hi>6th Chapter of S.

                              <q>That none can believe a thing true upon <hi>what Motive soever,</hi> that he knows certainly to be <hi>false,</hi> or which is all one, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>contradict</hi>—So that if our <hi>Reason</hi> then <note place="margin">P. 21.

                           <p>These are great Words indeed; but I wonder who ever heard before that a few miserable <note n="*" place="margin">These are his Synods; at <hi>Rome, Vercelles, Tours; Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>An.</hi> 1059. and again, <hi>An.</hi> 1078.</note>

most supream and universal Church-Authority.</hi> For his little Reflection, that they were assembled long before the birth of <hi>Protestantism,</hi> I must tell him, I doubt he is mistaken. The Religion of <hi>Protestants,</hi> like that of <hi>Papists,</hi> is composs'd of two great parts; <hi>Catholick Christianity,</hi> common in some measure to us all; and <hi>Protestations against Popery.</hi> Now 'tis true, for what concerns the latter of these, we allow <hi>Popery</hi> to have the advantage of us, as to the Point of <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> nor are we ashamed to own it: It being necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they should have fallen into <hi>Errors,</hi> before we could <hi>protest</hi> against <hi>them;</hi> but as to the present matter, our Author in his <note n="*" place="margin">Disc. 1. p. 55. §. lvii.</note> 
                              <hi>Guide,</hi> to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us, confesses that <hi>Berengarius,</hi> against whom these little <hi>Synods</hi> were called, proceeded upon <hi>Protestant Grounds, i. e.</hi> in effect was a <hi>Protestant</hi> as to this Point: And therefore 'tis false in him now to say, that these Councils were <hi>assembled long before the birth of Protestantism.</hi>

                           <p>But I return to his Church Authority; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; 1. If this Doctrine be certainly contrary to <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> as was before said, then he has told us before, that <q>
                                 <hi>no Motive whatever, no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho never so plain, can be sufficient to engage us to believe it.</hi>

These <hi>Councils</hi> were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a <hi>Party</hi> against <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and therefore no wonder if they condemned him. 4. They were neither <hi>universal</hi> of the whole Church, or even of the <hi>Western Patriachate</hi> in which they assembled; and therefore we can have no security that they did not
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36811:457"/>

those who please to interest their Curiosity in a matter of so little moment as to their Faith, may satisfy themselves in the Authors, to which I refer them. Tho now, 2. To allow the matter of Fact to be true, I pray, what force is there at last in this Argument, <q>The Church both Eastern &amp; Western, in these last Ages have believed <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> therefore the <hi>Papists</hi> have a <hi>rational Ground</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</q> That is to say, you <hi>Protestants</hi> charge us for believing <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as Men that act contrary to the design of Christ in this <hi>Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,</hi> that have forsaken the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> that destroy the nature of this <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> and do violence to the common <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of Mankind: Be it so; yet at least we have this <hi>rational Ground</hi> for our belief, tho it should be false, <hi>viz.</hi> That we did all of us peaceably and quietly believe it, till you came with your <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> to raise Doubts and Difficulties about it; nay more, we all of us still do believe it, except those that you have perswaded not to do so.

                              <q>That since <hi>Luther</hi>'s Time no small number of <hi>Protestants,</hi> even all the <hi>Genuine Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thus far, as to confess a <hi>Real Presence</hi> of our Lord's <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of it, as present there.</q> For, 1. If we did <hi>acknowledg</hi> this, yet it seems we are mistaken in it; and then what grounds can it be for a <hi>Papist</hi> to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36811:460"/>
believe <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> that we <hi>Hereticks</hi> by a Mistake do not believe it, but only a <hi>real spiritual Presence,</hi> and as such are <hi>Anathematized</hi> by them for our Error? 2. I have before shewn, that were this a <hi>rational Ground,</hi> yet it fails them too; for neither do the <hi>Genuine Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> nor any other that I know of, either believe Christ's <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body</hi> to be substantially present in the Holy <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> or to be <hi>adored</hi> there: I am sure if there be any such, they cannot be the <hi>Genuine Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in this Matter, who believe so expresly contrary to her formal Declaration, as this Author has himself observed.</p>
                           <p>And then for the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> to whom he again <note place="margin">Ibid. Pag. 32.</note> returns; it is hard to conceive what <hi>rational ground</hi> of Security they can derive from their practice; that because they commit no <hi>Idolatry</hi> in worshipping what they know certainly to be Christ, the <hi>Papist</hi> commits none for worshipping what he do's not know certainly is Christ; in truth what, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he might know certainly is not Christ.</p>
                           <p>And now after a serious and impartial Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Grounds produced in Vindication of this <hi>Worship;</hi> tho I could have wish'd I might have found them as <hi>rational</hi> as our Author pretends them to be, and shall be glad, as they are, that they may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after prove sufficient to excuse them from the Guilt of <hi>formal Idolatry</hi> in this <hi>Adoration;</hi> yet I must needs say, I do in my Conscience think 'tis more <q>an excess of <hi>Charity,</hi> than any necessity of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if our <hi>Writers</hi> do sometimes, either not <note place="margin">P. 33. §. xxx.</note> at all, or but faintly, charge them with <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                              </q> And the Testimonies he produces, argue rather the candor of our Affections towards them, even such
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36811:460"/>
as to hope, almost against Hope for their sakes; than give any security to them in their Errors. And because I would willingly, if possible, convince them of it, I will very briefly subjoin a Reason or two.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>2dly;</hi> Why even upon their own <hi>Principles</hi> I am not satisfied that they have such a <hi>rational Ground</hi> for this <hi>Adoration,</hi> as may be sufficient to excuse them.</p>
                           <p>For, <hi>1st,</hi> It is granted by this Author, <q>That a <note place="margin">P. 26. §. xxii.</note> meerly <hi>good Intention</hi> grounded upon a <hi>culpable Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> cannot excuse them from <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                              </q> So that if their <hi>ignorance</hi> then be really <hi>culpable,</hi> their <hi>good Intention</hi> will not be sufficient to excuse them. Now the <hi>ignorance</hi> upon which this practice is founded, is their mistaken interpretation of those words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and whether that be a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> or <hi>culpable</hi> Mistake, we shall best be able to judg by two or three Observations.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. It is confess'd by the greatest Men of their Church, that there is <hi>no necessity</hi> to interpret those words in that manner that they do; so that had not the Authority of their Church interposed, they might have been <hi>equally verified</hi> in our Interpretation. And this must be allow'd, unless we shall say, that all places of Holy Scripture must be understood in a <hi>literal sense,</hi> whatever the Consequence be of so doing.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Our Author himself confesses, that if the taking of them in the <hi>literal sense</hi> do's involve a <hi>certain Contradiction,</hi> then it cannot be right; but we are <hi>bound</hi> to seek out some other Exposition to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a <hi>certain Contradiction.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="118" facs="tcp:36811:461"/>
3. It is undeniable, that their Interpretation of these words destroys the certainty of <hi>Sense,</hi> and in that of the Truth of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which was confirmed by <hi>Miracles,</hi> known only by the <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of <hi>Sense;</hi> and by Consequence of this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Point, that <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is revealed to us by God, or can be rely'd upon as coming from him.</p>
                           <p>Now from these Principles I thus argue: If that <hi>sense</hi> of these words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> upon which they ground their <hi>Adoration,</hi> do's necessarily imply many plain and certain <hi>Contradictions,</hi> then by their own Confession that cannot be the right <hi>sense</hi> of them. But that it do's so, and that without gross and culpable <hi>Ignorance</hi> they cannot doubt of but know it, I thus shew. He that believes these words in the sense of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> must believe the same <hi>natural Body,</hi> at the same time, to be in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thousand several places upon Earth, and yet still to be but <hi>one Body,</hi> and that all the while in Heaven: He must believe that the same <hi>natural Body</hi> is at the same time <hi>extended</hi> in all its Parts, and yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing still the <hi>same Body</hi> without any change, to be <hi>unextended,</hi> and have no distinct Parts, nor be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being divided into any: He must believe the same <hi>Body</hi> at the same time, to move, and to lie still: to be the Object of our Senses, and yet not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible by any: With infinite others of the like kind <note n="*" place="margin">See above, Ch. 2. of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi> Pag. 32, 33.</note> as I have more fully shewn before. But now all these are gross <hi>Contradictions,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of a <hi>Body,</hi> and to the common <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> in all Mankind; and no Man can, without <hi>culpable Ignorance</hi> pretend not to know them to be so: And therefore, notwithstanding any such supposed <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> as may be pretended from those
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36811:461"/>
words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> they cannot, by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's own <hi>Rule,</hi> without <hi>culpable Ignorance,</hi> not know that they are mistaken in this Matter.</p>
                           <p>Again: No <hi>Papist</hi> can have any reason to believe <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to be true, but because he reads those words of Holy Scripture, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> That these words are in Scripture, he can know on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his <hi>Senses:</hi> If his <hi>Senses</hi> therefore are not to be trusted, he is not sure there are any such words in Scripture. If they are to be trusted, he is then sure that the <hi>Interpretation</hi> which he puts upon them must be <hi>false.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Since then it is confess'd, that there is <hi>no necessity</hi> to understand those words in a <hi>literal sense;</hi> and that both upon the account of the <hi>Contradictions</hi> that such an Exposition involves to the <hi>common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Reason,</hi> and to the certain <hi>Evidence of the Senses of all Mankind,</hi> it is necessary to take them in some other meaning, it remains that without gross and <hi>culpable Ignorance</hi> they cannot pretend not to know, that this could never have been the intention of our Blessed Saviour in those <hi>words;</hi> and that such <hi>Ignorance</hi> will not <hi>excuse</hi> them, our Author himself has freely confess'd.</p>
                           <p>But, <hi>2dly,</hi> let us quit this Reflection, and for once suppose the possibility of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> Yet still it is confess'd by them: 1. That there is no Command nor Example in holy Scripture for <hi>adoring</hi> Christ in the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> 2. That infinite Defects may happen to hinder him from being there; and then what they <hi>worship</hi> is only a piece of <hi>Bread.</hi> 3. That they can never be sure that some of these <hi>Defects</hi> have not happened; and by consequence, that what they suppose to be <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> is indeed any more than a <hi>meer Wafer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="120" facs="tcp:36811:462"/>
From whence I argue;</p>
                           <p>He that without any Command or Warrant of God, pays a <hi>Divine Adoration</hi> to that which he can never be sure is more than a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> can never be sure that he do's not commit <hi>Idolatry:</hi> But whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever worships the <hi>Host,</hi> worships that which he can never be sure is more than a <hi>meer Creature;</hi> and therefore he can never be sure that in so doing he do's not commit <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now concerning the former of these, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is for any one to give <hi>Divine Worship</hi> to what he can never be sure is any more than a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> be it considered, what <hi>jealousy</hi> God has at all times express'd of his <hi>Honour</hi> as to this Matter; how strict he has been in the peculiar vindication of his Supreme <hi>Prerogative</hi> in such Cases. How there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that will come to him, must be very well assured that it is God to whom he approaches; and therefore if he has but the least reason to <hi>doubt</hi> of it, ought not to worship with a <hi>doubting Mind;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he ought not to do that the <hi>omitting</hi> whereof can be no <hi>fault,</hi> but the <hi>doing</hi> of which may, for ought he knows, be a very great <hi>Sin.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And for the second; Whether every <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> who <hi>adores</hi> the <hi>Host,</hi> has not even upon his own <hi>Principles,</hi> very great cause to doubt, whether he <hi>adores</hi> Christ's <hi>Body,</hi> or only a bit of <hi>Bread,</hi> will appear from those infinite Defects which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves allow as sufficient to hinder a <hi>Consecration;</hi> and which make it great odds, were their Doctrine otherwise never so true, whether yet one <hi>Host</hi> in twenty, it may be in five hundred, be consecrated.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. With reference to the Holy <hi>Elements</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated: If the <hi>Bread</hi> be not all, or at least the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                              <hi>pure Water;</hi> if the <hi>Bread</hi> be corrupted, or the <hi>Wine</hi> sour; if the <hi>Grapes</hi> of which the <hi>Wine</hi> was made were not <hi>ripe;</hi> if any thing be <hi>mingled</hi> with the <hi>Wine</hi> but <hi>Water;</hi> or if there be so much <hi>Water</hi> mix'd with it, that that becomes the prevailing Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; in all these Cases, and many others which I omit, there is no <hi>Consecration.</hi> And of all this, he who <hi>adores</hi> either the <hi>Bread</hi> or <hi>Wine,</hi> can have no security. But,</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Be the Elements right, yet if the Priest, being either ignorant, or in haste, or unmindful of what he is about, should by mistake, or otherwise, err in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of <hi>the words of Consecration;</hi> whether by <hi>Addition,</hi> or by <hi>Diminution,</hi> or by any other <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> there is no <hi>Consecration:</hi> The <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> continue what they were; and of this too he that worships them can never be certain.</p>
                           <p n="3">3.

implied, <hi>of it be rightly consecrayed:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he advises, let them so adore the Host, I. <hi>ADORE THEE IF THOU ART CHRIST.</hi>
                              </q> But now if, as the Apostle tells us in another case, <hi>Whatsoever is not of Faith, is Sin;</hi> and, <hi>He that doubts, is damned if he eats:</hi> I shall leave it to any sober Christian to say what secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity there can be in such a <hi>Worship,</hi> which is neither ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, encouraged, or commanded in Holy Scripture; and which they themselves confess they can never be certain is addressed to a right <hi>Object;</hi> and therefore are forced to such Shifts and Reserves, as were they once admitted, might make any other Creature in the World as warrantably <hi>adorable</hi> as their <hi>Host.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>How much better were it for them to <hi>adore</hi> their Blessed Saviour in <hi>Heaven,</hi> where his <hi>glorified Body</hi> most certainly is: Where there can therefore be no danger to <hi>lift up our Hearts</hi> unto him. Were his Sacred <hi>Body</hi> indeed <hi>substantially present</hi> in this Blessed <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet still it would be in a manner to us impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, in the state of his Death, and by consequence of his Humiliation; and we might therefore have some cause to doubt whether, since we have received no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning it, it were our Saviour's Pleasure that his <hi>Body</hi> should be <hi>adored</hi> by us in that State: So that there could be no Sin in the not doing of it. But now amidst so many Doubts, not only upon Ours, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon their own Principles, that they dare not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>worship at a venture,</hi> that which yet they do <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> tho I shall leave them to their own Master to stand or fall at the Great Day, yet I must needs profess. I think there is very much hazard in it. A great Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and great Ignorance, may excuse a poor untaught, and therefore <hi>blindly obedient</hi> Multitude: but for their <hi>Guides,</hi> who lead them into Error, for those to whom
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36811:464"/>
God has given Capacities and Opportunities (as to those now among us he has done, of being better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) I can only say, <hi>Lord, lay not this Sin to their Charge!</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And this may suffice to have been said to the third Thing proposed, of their <hi>Rational Grounds</hi> for this Worship. For what our Author finally adds; <q>That <note place="margin">Pag. 37. §. xxxiii.</note> to adore that which the Adorer believes not to be our Lord, but Bread, would be unlawful to be done by any, so long as the Person continues so perswaded—But then if we suppose the Church <hi>justly</hi> requiring such Adoration upon such a true Presence of our Lord, neither will the same Person be free from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning greatly in his following such his Conscience, and in his not adoring.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>I Answer: It will then be time enough to consider this, when either the <hi>Church</hi> to which we owe an <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> shall require it of us, or they be able to prove that in such a Case the <hi>Church</hi> would not <hi>sin</hi> in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,</hi> and not <hi>we</hi> in <hi>refusing</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> her. But, blessed be God, there is no great danger of either of these: Our <hi>Church</hi> is too well perswaded of the unlawfulness of such a <hi>Worship,</hi> ever to require it of us. And for that <hi>Church</hi> which has so uncharitably undertaken to <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize</hi> all those who will not own her <hi>Authority,</hi> and receive her Errors, tho never so gross, as Articles of Faith: We are so fully convinced of the unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness of her Pretences, and of our own Liberty, that we shall hardly be brought to submit our selves to the Conduct of such a <hi>blind Guide,</hi> lest we fall into the same <hi>Ditch,</hi> into which she her self is tumbled. And it would certainly much better become our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and his Brethren, to consider how they can ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify their <hi>Disobedience</hi> to their own <hi>Mother,</hi> than to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36811:464"/>
endeavour at this rate to lead us into the same <hi>Apostacy,</hi> both to our <hi>Religion</hi> and our <hi>Church</hi> with them.</p>

                           <p>AND thus by the Blessing of God, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a good Cause, have I very briefly passed through this Author's <hi>Reflections,</hi> and I am perswaded sufficiently shewn the weakness and falsity of the most of them. If any one shall think that I ought to have insisted more largely upon some Points, he may please to know, that since by the importunate Provocations of those of the <hi>other Communion,</hi> we have been forced too often to interrupt those Duties of our <hi>Ministry,</hi> in which we could rather have wish'd to have employ'd our Time, for these kind of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies which serve so very little to any purposes, either of true Piety, or true Charity among us: We have resolved thus far at least to gratify both our selves and others, as to make our <hi>Disputes</hi> as <hi>short</hi> as is possible; and loose no more time in them, than the necessary Defence of our selves and the Truth do require.</p>
                           <p>I have indeed pass'd by much of our Author's <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi> because they are almost intirely made up of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and endless <hi>Repetitions</hi> of the same things, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often in the same words. But for any thing that is Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative, or otherwise material to the main <hi>Cause,</hi> I do not know that I have either let the Observation of it slip, or dissembled at all the Force of it.</p>
                           <p>It was once in my thoughts to have made some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections in the Close upon the <hi>Changes</hi> of their <hi>Ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,</hi> in requital for our Author's Observations on the <hi>Alterations</hi> of our <hi>Liturgie;</hi> but I have insisted longer
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36811:465"/>
than I designed already, and shall therefore content my my self to have given the Hint of what might have been done, and shall still be done, if our Author, or any in his behalf desire it of me.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time I cannot but observe the unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness of that <hi>Method</hi> which is here taken; from the Expressions of some of our Divines, and the Concessions of others, whose profess'd Business it was to reconcile, if possible, all Parties, and therefore were forced some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to condescend more than was fit for the doing it; and even these too miserably <hi>mangled</hi> and <hi>misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> to pretend to prove the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> contrary to the <hi>express Declarations</hi> of the <hi>Publick Acts</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> of it. This has been the endeavour of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of our late Writers, but of this <hi>Discourser</hi> above any. Had those worthy Persons, whose Memory they thus abuse, been yet living, they might have had an ample Confutation from their own Pens; as, in the very Instance before us, has been given them for the like ill use made by some among them, of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Meditations</hi> of a most Excellent and Learned <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of our <hi>Church;</hi> and who might otherwise in the next Age have been improved into a new Witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. I do not think that Bp <hi>Taylour</hi> ever thought he should have been set up as a favourer of <hi>Popery,</hi> who had written so expresly and warmly against it. Yet I cannot but observe a kind of Prophetick Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in his Book of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> which being so often quoted by these Men, I somewhat wonder it should have slipp'd their Remark: Where speaking of their Shifts to make any One they please of their side, he has these words; <q>And—I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <note place="margin">Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, §. <hi>xii. n. 28. pag.</hi> 261.</note> 
                                 <hi>says he,</hi> but it may be possible, but a WITTY MAN may pretend, when I am dead, that in this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:36811:465"/>
                                 <hi>Discourse</hi> I have pleaded for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>We have now lived to see some of those WITTY MEN that have done but little less than this; tho how <hi>Honest</hi> they are in the mean time, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But I hope this Design too shall be from henceforth in good measure frustrated: And therefore, since neither their <hi>New Religion,</hi> nor their <hi>New Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi> will do their Business; since it is in vain that they either <hi>misrepresent</hi> their own <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or our <hi>Authors</hi> in favour of it; may they once please either honestly to avow and defend their Faith, or honestly to confess that they cannot do it. Such shuffling as this, do's but more convince us of the <hi>weakness</hi> of their <hi>Cause;</hi> and instead of defending their <hi>Religion</hi> by these Practices, they only encrease in us our <hi>ill Opinion</hi> of that, and les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen that <hi>good'One</hi> which we willingly would, but shall not always be able to conserve of <hi>those,</hi> who by such indirect means as these, endeavour to support it.</p>

                           <p>THERE is so near a Connexion between the two Points of <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Prayers for the Dead,</hi> as they are now establish'd in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is impossible to state the one as we ought, without entring on some Consideration of the other. It has been so much the rather thought fit to give an account to the World of both these, in that the Opinions of the Primitive Fathers touching the <hi>state of the Souls departed,</hi> and the early Practice of <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Dead</hi> founded thereupon, being not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the Generality now a days, seem to give our Adversaries a greater pretence to <hi>Antiquity</hi> in these Points, than in most others that are in debate betwixt us.</p>
                           <p>For what concerns the <hi>Latter</hi> of these, I shall in the next <hi>Discourse,</hi> say what I suppose may be sufficient to shew how little Grounds the Ancient Custom of <hi>Praying for the Dead</hi> in the Primitive Ages of Christianity, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to the Practice of those who pretend to be their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers in the same Custom now. As to the business of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which is our present concern, We willingly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to have been of very <hi>Venerable Antiquity;</hi> and to have exceeded not only our <hi>Reformation,</hi> but even <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> its self for some hundreds of Years. The Truth is,

the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome is beholding for this Doctrine, as well as for many other things in her Religion, to her worthy Ancestors the <hi>Heathen Poets</hi> and <hi>Philosophers:</hi> And tho I cannot tell how far <hi>Cardinal Bellarmin</hi>'s Argument will <note place="margin">Bellarm. de Purgat. lib. 1. cap. 11. p 612.

                           <p>Such were the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> as to this matter.

                           <p>It is, I know, generally pretended by those of the other Communion, that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> at least began to favour their Opinion.

                              <hi>Grief</hi> which he imagined those Souls who had been pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately tied to the things of this World, might still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their place of <hi>Sequester:</hi> And which he therefore

thought to be the meaning of that obscure place of S. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> iii. 12. so confidently produced by our Adversaries on all occasions, in favour of their Doctrine. But all this he proposes with so much doubt and uncertainty, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews it to have been in this <hi>Fathers</hi> time so far from an <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> that he durst not affirm any thing at all concerning it.</p>
                           <p>Thus then had the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of foundation in the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> About DC Years after Christ, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> first began to give countenance to it. The publick practice of <hi>Praying for the Dead</hi> continuing still in force in the Church, and those Opinions of the Primitive Fathers upon which that was first established, being now no longer received with that Universal Belief they had heretofore been, it was but natural to seek out some other grounds for a practice which they saw so generally received, and yet could not well tell what account to give of the reason of it. Let us add this, that about that time a sad Barbarity began every where almost to overspread the World: The <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Franks</hi> and <hi>Burgundians</hi> in. <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> and <hi>West-Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Britain,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying almost all Learning out of the World. From henceforth <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Visions</hi> govern'd the <hi>Church:</hi> The Flames of <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> were thought <hi>on purpose</hi> to have been kindled to torment <hi>departed Souls.</hi> Some were seen <hi>Broiling</hi> upon <hi>Gridirons,</hi> others <hi>Roasting</hi> upon <hi>Spits,</hi> some <hi>Burning</hi> before a <hi>Fire,</hi> others <hi>shivering</hi> in the <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Smoaking</hi> in a <hi>Chimney.</hi> The very ways to <hi>Purgatory</hi> were now discovered; one in <hi>Sicily,</hi> another in <hi>Pozzueto,</hi> a third nearer home, in <hi>Ireland.</hi> One found out by the help of an <hi>Angel,</hi> another of the <hi>Devil.</hi> Insomuch that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> himself was carried away with these illusions, and which some are not ashamed even at this day to support.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36811:473"/>
By these means came <hi>Purgatory</hi> first establish'd in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> in the VI, VII and VIII. <hi>Centuries:</hi> But yet, still the Article continued rude and unpolish'd.

                           </p>
                           <p>St. <hi>Thomas</hi> is yet more precise; not only that it is <hi>Fire</hi> in which the <hi>Souls</hi> are <hi>tormented,</hi> but that it is the very <note place="margin">In 4. Sent. dist. 21. qu. 1. art. 1.</note> 
                              <hi>same Fire that Torments the Damned in Hell, and the just in Purgatory.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself confesses, That almost all their Divines teach, <hi>that the Damned and the Souls in</hi>

                           <p>TO demonstrate this, it will not, I presume, be expected that I should shew the weakeness of all those Places, which tho some of their Controvertists have alledged, yet the more learned among them freely confess to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose in them. <hi>Cardinal Bellarmin</hi> has put together <hi>xix</hi> several Texts out of both Testaments; but yet was far from thinking them all to his purpose; confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <note place="margin">De Purgat. l. 1. c. 3. p. 578. a.</note> either of all, or at least of all out of the <hi>old Testament,</hi> except the <hi>first,</hi> that they are but <hi>probable Arguments.</hi> Of these <hi>Alexander Natalis</hi> utterly rejects <hi>xvi;</hi> and one he mentions not, as indeed he needed not to do it, when <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself had set a particular mark upon it, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. <note place="margin">Ibid. cap 8. arg. ult.

                           <p>The <hi>Misrepresenter</hi> unwilling to see his Cause reduced to two only places of Holy Scripture, restores again to its Authority <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. iii. 15.</note> one of those which <hi>Natalis</hi> had rejected <note n="⸪" place="margin">1 Pet. iii. 15.</note>, and adds another which they had all of them over-look'd, but very unfortunately: For that <hi>1st,</hi> They have ever been esteemed <note n="‖" place="margin">Bellarm. de Purg. l. 1. c. <hi>v.</hi> p. 582. <hi>A.

And then <hi>2dly,</hi> For St. <hi>Austin,</hi> upon whose Authority he would be thought to alledg them; 'tis evident that he utterly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stook the design of that Father, if he thought that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood them of the <hi>Roman Purgatory,</hi> as both his words evidently shew, and his own Masters <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. in loc. 1 Cor. 3. 15. pag. 377, 379.</note> 
                              <hi>Natalis,</hi> has inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously confess'd for the one, and <note n="⸫" place="margin">Bellarm. de Christi Anima, Lib. 4. cap. 13. pag. 455. per tot.</note>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36811:476"/>
So that then I may reasonably presume to have answer'd the design of the present <hi>Section,</hi> if I can give a fair account of those two places which they all agree to be the principal supports of this Doctrine; and from whence some of them <note place="margin">Natal. Alex. in loc. pag. 362.</note> doubt not to say it may be <hi>demonstratively</hi> concluded.</p>
                           <p>Now the first of these, is that noted passage in the 2 <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cab. cap.</hi> xii. Where <note n="⸪" place="margin">Misrepres. n. 23. p. 28.</note> (they tell us) it is said, <hi>That Money was sent to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>that Sacrifices might be offerr'd for the slain; and 'tis recommended as a holy Cogitation to pray for the Dead.</hi> This not only <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ranks in the front <note place="margin">Bellarm. de Purg. l. 1. c. 3.

This discovered to them the cause of their Death, and how they were slain by God for their Sin. Hereupon <hi>Judas</hi> and all his men betook themselves to Prayer, and besought God that the Sin might wholly be put out of Remembrance. And <hi>Judas</hi> upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion exhorted the People to keep themselves by their Example from the like Sin; and lastly, He made a <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> among them of a Sum of Money, and sent it to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> to offer a <hi>Sin-offering</hi> unto the Lord.</q>

                           <p>This is the Story, and the Design of all is very easy; That <hi>Judas</hi> considering the danger he had been in by the Sin of these men, pray'd to God that it might not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the People, and offer'd a <hi>Sin-offering for the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> according to the <hi>Law;</hi> remembring what the whole People had once suffer'd in the like case for <hi>Achan's</hi> Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression. <note place="margin">

                           <p>But our Adversaries will have this <hi>Sin-offering</hi> to have been for the <hi>Dead,</hi> and the History expresly says it was so. I answer, <hi>1st,</hi> The <hi>History</hi> says no more than what we have set down, that <hi>Judas</hi> did this: For the rest, it is the conjecture of the <hi>Historian,</hi> not an historical Narration of what design <hi>Judas</hi> had in it. Now that this could not have been his design, is evident, <hi>2dly,</hi> In that neither the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> nor any other part of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> makes any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36811:477"/>
of any such <hi>Sacrifice</hi> either prescribed or allow'd of, for the <hi>Dead.</hi> And <hi>3dly,</hi> Had the <hi>Law</hi> in some Cases ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of <hi>Sacrifices for the Dead,</hi> yet certainly it could not have done it in this, <hi>Idolatry</hi> being one of those Sins for which there was no Offering allowed, nor any <hi>Atonement</hi> to be made for it.</p>
                           <p>But what then is it that this <hi>Historian</hi> designed? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, it was this: That <hi>Judas</hi> by this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> made an <hi>atonement</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> to the end that their Sin being forgiven, they might have a happy <hi>Resurrection.</hi> This he expresly declares, <hi>v.</hi> 44, 45. For considering (says the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian) that there is an excellent reward laid up for those that dye Godly, <q>which was a holy and godly thought; <note place="margin">

                                    </gap>.</note> he therefore made an expiation for the <hi>Dead,</hi> that they might be absolved from their Sin. </q>For many of the <hi>Jews</hi> then, as some Christians have done since, thought <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> might be made for the forgiveness of those Sins after <hi>Death,</hi> that were not <hi>forgiven</hi> before. Therefore seeing that these Souldiers died in a grievous Sin before they had time to repent, the Historian supposed that <hi>Judas</hi> might have designed this <hi>Offering</hi> to expiate their Offence, that so they might obtain a <hi>Happy Resurrection.</hi> But now this was only the <hi>conjecture</hi> of the <hi>Historian,</hi> and as before we have seen very ill grounded, to be sure far enough di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the <hi>Roman Purgatory.</hi> For <hi>1st, This</hi> respected the <hi>future Resurrection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>, That</hi> the present <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Dead. 2dly,</hi> The <hi>Prayers</hi> here spoken of, were offered for men who dyed in a <hi>Mortal Sin;</hi> but the <hi>Papists</hi> deny that any such go to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or can receive any benefit from the Prayers of the <hi>Living. 3dly,</hi> Whatever becomes of all the rest; how was it possible that these <hi>Prayers</hi> should have been designed for the slain to deliver them out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> when if we will believe the <hi>Papists</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, their Souls were not <hi>there,</hi> but either in <hi>Hell,</hi> or in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36811:478"/>
the <hi>Limbus,</hi> where they supposed the <hi>Souls</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> were detained, till our Saviour Christ descending thither, set them free.</p>
                           <p>So that which way soever then we consider this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, it cannot give us any manner of satisfaction. If we look upon it as a part of that <hi>History,</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> is not <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical;</hi> nor was ever esteem'd so by the <hi>Jews,</hi> or by the <hi>Christians</hi> of the first 600 Years. If we take it as the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> of what <hi>Judas</hi> did, this respected not the <hi>Dead</hi> at all; nor by consequence can it belong to <hi>Purgatory.</hi> If, according to the Opinion of the <hi>Relator,</hi> it regards the <hi>Dead</hi> indeed, but then with reference to their <hi>future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> not their <hi>present Punishment;</hi> and so is still im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. If finally, according to the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, it is utterly impossible it should belong to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> because there was as yet no such place, and therefore these Souldiers could not be there, or by any <hi>Sacrifices</hi> be delivered from thence. And this I hope may be a sufficient reply to this first passage.</p>
                           <p>The other, from whence they also tell us their Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> may be <hi>demonstratively</hi> concluded, is in the <hi>xiith</hi> of St. <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 32. Where our Saviour speaking of the <hi>Sin against the Holy Ghost,</hi> tells us, <q>
                                 <hi>That it shall not be forgiven neither in this World, nor in that to come.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>He would, I believe, be thought to make a very strange conclusion, that should without more ado argue thus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly from this Passage, <hi>Therefore there is a Purgatory:</hi> And indeed they themselves are sensible of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bellarmin</hi> confesses, that according to the <hi>Rules of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic, Purgatory</hi> cannot be inferr'd from hence: But accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Rules of Prudtnce</hi> he thinks it may, because that otherwise, he says, Christ must be said <hi>to have spoken im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, which we ought not to suppose he did.</hi> But if there be nothing in this place to prove Purgatory, according to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36811:478"/>
the rules of Logic, I suppose it must be some mistake then, in that which he told us before, that it may be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively</hi> inferr'd from thence. For as for the rule of <hi>Prudence,</hi> that will at most make it but <hi>very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But indeed this rule will fail them as well as the other, as we shall evidently see in examining the Proofs which they make from it. Now their Argument lies thus: <q>Our Saviour Christ says, that the Sin against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> shall not be remitted <hi>neither in this World, nor in that to come:</hi> We must therefore suppose that some Sins shall be remitted <hi>in the World to come,</hi> or else our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our spake improperly, which according to the <hi>Rules of Prudence</hi> we may not say. Now <hi>the World to come,</hi> must signifie the <hi>state of the Soul between the day of every mans Death, and the final Resurrection,</hi> because that after that, no Sins shall be remitted: And it must be to those who are in a <hi>middle state,</hi> because those who are <hi>blessed,</hi> are <hi>already forgiven;</hi> and those who are <hi>damned</hi> shall <hi>never be remitted.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is the sum of their arguing from this place: but now if it appear that we can have no manner of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any of these suppositions; much more if it be clear that not one of them is true; Then I presume it will follow, that neither is it <hi>prudentially credible</hi> that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour here intended to establish a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together certain that he did not.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>1st,</hi> Then: Our Saviour says, that <hi>the Sin against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven, neither in this World, nor in that to come;</hi> therefore, they conclude, some Sins shall be forgiven <hi>in the World to come.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I answer: It is most certain that some Sins shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given <hi>in the World to come,</hi> even all those that are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36811:479"/>
                              <hi>in this,</hi> and for which therefore God shall not call us to account at the last Day. As if one should say, To him that repents and believes, his Sins shall not be imputed neither <hi>in this World</hi> nor <hi>in the World to come;</hi> that is, they shall never be imputed. And so both St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> interpret the Phrase, <note n="*" place="margin">

                              <hi>He shall not be forgiven,</hi>  says the one; <hi>he shall not be forgiven for ever,</hi> says the other: What is this to <hi>Purgatory?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But our Adversaries are more acute: Christ says the <hi>Sin against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven neither in this World nor in that to come;</hi> therefore some Sins that are not forgiven <hi>in this World,</hi> shall be forgiven in <hi>the World to come.</hi> This indeed is no consequence, according to the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Logic,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> acknowldges; but how then does it follow? Because that otherwise our Saviour Christ would have spoken <hi>improperly,</hi> which according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Prudence</hi> we ought not to say. The <hi>Cardinal</hi> might have added, according to the <hi>Rule of Civility</hi> and <hi>good Breeding</hi> too. But still how does this appear? Why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that otherwise it would have been impertinent to say that it shall not be forgiven neither <hi>in this world,</hi> nor in <hi>the world to come,</hi> if no sins should be forgiven in <hi>the world to come,</hi> that are not forgiven in <hi>this.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I answer, <hi>1st,</hi> He might have said it to exaggerate his Speech, and so the better enforce the hainousness of the Crime; and it is a thing very ordinary on such occasions to use many words, when one would have been sufficient: But <hi>2dly,</hi> He might, and certainly did do it, to prevent the mistake of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and cut off all hopes of pardon for this sin: Two things there were which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36811:479"/>
therefore to take away all hopes of Remission for this Sin, and make the deeper Impression upon their minds, bids them not flatter themselves with any such fond Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that this was a Sin that should <hi>never be</hi> forgiven them, neither in <hi>this World,</hi> nor in the <hi>World to come;</hi> i. e. neither <hi>now</hi> nor in the <hi>Kingdom of the Messiah;</hi> neither in <hi>the hour of Death,</hi> nor in the <hi>day of Judgment.</hi> But</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>2dly,</hi> They suppose, That the <hi>World to come</hi> must signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the time between every mans <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Resurrection.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But now for this, there is no manner of Ground, either in the Holy Scripture, or in the Language of the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor can it be with any propriety so esteem'd.

                           </p>
                           <p>I relpy, <hi>1st,</hi> That there is not a word of all this so much as hinted in the <hi>Text;</hi> and any one might from thence as reasonably conclude for either of the <hi>other kinds,</hi> as they do for this <hi>middle sort.</hi> For as concerning the <hi>Just,</hi> it is not certainly at all absurd to say, that their <hi>Sins</hi> are then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36811:480"/>
                              <hi>forgiven,</hi> when they are finally <hi>acquitted at Gods Tribunal,</hi> as they shall be in the <hi>World to come.</hi> And for the <hi>Wicked,</hi> since we here are told that <hi>Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost</hi> is the <hi>only</hi> Sin that shall <hi>not be forgiven;</hi> nay, our Saviour expresly says, That <hi>all other Sins shall be remitted;</hi> it may with much more agreement to the <hi>Text</hi> follow, that all men, be their Sins what they will, shall have Grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance whereby they may be pardon'd in <hi>the World to come,</hi> the <hi>Blasphemers of the Holy Ghost</hi> alone excepted, than that those only shall be <hi>forgiven,</hi> who die with <hi>venial Sins.</hi> But</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>2dly,</hi> What have we here to do with the <hi>Remission of Sins? Purgatory</hi> is a place, not where <hi>Sins</hi> are <hi>remitted,</hi> but where they are punish'd with the greatest Severity; nay, what is still more, punish'd after they are <hi>remitted;</hi> nay, what is still more extraordinary, therefore <hi>punished,</hi> because they are <hi>remitted.</hi> For if the <hi>Guilt</hi> were not <hi>remitted,</hi> the Sinner could not go to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> nor have the <hi>favour</hi> of being <hi>punish'd</hi> there. And therefore it is utterly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent from the <hi>Remission</hi> of some Sins in the <hi>World to come,</hi> to conclude there is a place where <hi>all Sins,</hi> even the <hi>least,</hi> are <hi>exacted,</hi> and that so rigidly, that there is no escaping thence, till either by their selves or their friends, they have paid the <hi>very uttermost Farthing.</hi>

                           <p>In short, if we will conclude any thing as concerning the <hi>Remission</hi> of <hi>Sins</hi> from this; the Rules both of <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> will direct us to make one part of the <hi>Opposition</hi> answer to the other: And then it will stand thus. The <hi>Sin against the Holy Ghost</hi> shall never be at all forgiven, whether as to <hi>Guilt</hi> or <hi>Punishment,</hi> but shall be avenged to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> Therefore all other Sins upon <hi>Repentance</hi> shall be <hi>forgiven,</hi> both as to the <hi>Fault</hi> and <hi>Punishment,</hi> so as not to be required, neither <hi>now</hi> or <hi>hereafter.</hi> Any other <hi>Remission</hi> than this, the Scripture no where speaks of, nor do's this Text infer it:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36811:480"/>
And to suppose without proof that there is any other, is in good earnest to beg the Question.</p>
                           <p>The sum of all, is what I before said: That our Blessed <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi> upon the place.</note> Saviour intended by this Phrase, to cut off all hopes of Pardon for this <hi>Sin,</hi> by telling them that it should not be <hi>remitted,</hi> neither by any Expiation in <hi>this Life,</hi> nor by any extraordinary <hi>Grace</hi> of God in the <hi>Age of the Messiah,</hi> or in the <hi>Life after this;</hi> which are the only notions of <hi>the World to come,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> knew, and in both which they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci'd some Sins not elsewhere <hi>remissible,</hi> might <hi>be forgiven.</hi>

                           <p>And this may suffice to have been said to shew how far the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is from establishing this <hi>Doctrine</hi> as an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith;</hi> for sure, if these places which they call <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative,</hi> are so little to the Purpose, we can have no great Expectation from the rest, which themselves esteem but only <hi>probable</hi> proofs of it.</p>

                           <p>And hitherto we have considered such passages as the Error of <hi>Origen,</hi> sufficiently different from the Doctrine of

the <hi>Romish</hi> Purgatory, has given occasion to. But there was another <hi>opinion</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> which I have mentioned above, and to which many other expressions of the <hi>other Fathers</hi> do allude, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                              <q>That all those who at the <hi>last day</hi> shall appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ, shall be proved by a certain <hi>terrible fire,</hi> by the force of which the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> shall be <hi>separated,</hi> and if any evil of their past life still adheres to the <hi>Good,</hi> it shall then in <hi>that Purgatory fire</hi> be intirely done away.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now to this belong those passages that are produced on this occasion from <hi>Lactantius, Hilary,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose, Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>

                              <hi>Emissenus,</hi> and some of St. <hi>Austin</hi> himself. I shall offer one proof of this in the last instance of Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> which he thus quotes, <q>
                                 <hi>An unwearied fire is to be undergone by us, in which are to be endured those grievous punishments, of a soul</hi>

                              </q> But the whole passage is indeed this: <q>St. <hi>Hilary</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations on the 20 <hi>v.</hi> of the 119. <hi>Psal. My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments;</hi>

                              </q> This certainly is such a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as had <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ever examined it, he

                              </q> But the truth is, this is as little to the purpose as any we have yet seen.

                           </p>
                           <p>To this rope of Sand, rather than Argument, I reply; <hi>1st,</hi> That the Supposition it goes upon, is false. <hi>2dly,</hi> That the Conclusion it infers, is inconsequent. For the former of these; That some Sins are less than others, it is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; but that any Sins are properly <hi>Venial,</hi> we deny. To be <hi>Venial,</hi> is to be worthy of <hi>Pardon,</hi> or not to deserve <hi>Punishment;</hi> but whatsoever do's not deserve <hi>Punishment,</hi> can be no <hi>Sin,</hi> for all <hi>Sin</hi> infers an <hi>Obligation to Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and therefore to be a <hi>Sin,</hi> and yet be <hi>Venial,</hi> is in proper terms no better than a flat Contradiction. Again, The Sins here spoken of, are supposed to be <hi>worthy</hi> of a <hi>temporal Punishment;</hi> but <hi>Sins</hi> that are worthy of a <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Punishment,</hi> are not <hi>properly Venial;</hi> therefore, either the Sins here spoken of, must not deserve even a <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Punishment,</hi> or they cannot be said to be <hi>properly Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> Be the Sins, as they desire, <hi>Venial;</hi> how do's it from hence follow, that it is necessary that these be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd in another Life? And why is not the <hi>Blood of Christ</hi> which cleanses the <hi>greatest Sins,</hi> a sufficient <hi>Purgatory</hi> for the least Infirmities? <hi>Venial Sins</hi> are by themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd to be intirely consistent with the <hi>Grace</hi> of God; nay, so consistent as not to <hi>destroy,</hi> or but even <hi>lessen it.</hi> Now
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36811:486"/>
for a <hi>Christian,</hi> who has lived so well as to be still in the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> of God; that has received an actual Pardon of all his other Sins, through the Merits and Satisfaction of Christ, so as to be absolutely certain of a Crown of Glory for ever; to think that such a one, I say, shall be punish'd with Torments, inferior in nothing but the Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those of <hi>Hell-fire</hi> its self, for such slips and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as the best of men are encompass'd with, and which no man can ever hope perfectly to overcome; and this, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the Promises of Mercy and Forgiveness, which God has declared to us; this certainly is so far from being a Dictate of <hi>Right Reason,</hi> that it is impossible for any one that has <hi>any Reason</hi> at all, and is not exceedingly carried away with <hi>Prejudice</hi> for his <hi>Opinion,</hi> ever to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
                           <p>Again, <hi>2dly,</hi> Thus they Argue: <q>When Sinners are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, the whole <hi>temporal Pain</hi> is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remitted with the <hi>Sin:</hi> Now it may happen, <note place="margin">Bellarm: ibid. p. 610. C.</note> and often do's happen, that in a Mans whole Life, he do's not fully satisfie for that <hi>temporal Pain;</hi> and therefore there must be a <hi>Purgatory</hi> wherein to do it.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>I answer, That this too proceeds upon a false Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That God when he forgives our <hi>Sins,</hi> do's not also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the intire Obligation to <hi>Punishment,</hi> which by our Sins we stood engaged to; and which both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> contradict.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>1st,</hi> That God do's sometimes afflict those Persons whose Sins he forgives, whether to prove, or to amend, or to secure them for the future, this 'tis confess'd we read in Scripture; and that this is most reasonable, cannot be deni'd upon the account of those excellent ends that are to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereby, both to the benefit of the Sinner, and to warn others by his Example not to offend. But where is there
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36811:486"/>
any mention of any thing of this kind either threatned or done in <hi>another Life?</hi> What end is there to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this? When Men go to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> they are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Grace of God, or otherwise they could not come thither; they are already forgiven their Sins, and secure of their Salvation. The punishments therefore of that place can serve no end, either of improving him that suffers them, or of keeping others by his example from offending. Add to this, That the Justice of God is already intirely satisfied by the Merits and Sufferings of Christ: So that then these punishments can be inflicted for no other purpose than for the delight God takes in punishing. But to say that God delights in the punishment of any, much more of good men, who are his Children, who love him, and whom therefore he both loves and intends to glorify to all Eternity; this is certainly to advance a notion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of God, and contrary to all those kind and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Idea's</hi> which the Holy Scriptures have given us of him; and therefore ought not without evident proof, which is not so much as pretended to by them, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>2dly,</hi> When we say that God <hi>forgives sin,</hi> we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by it one of these two things, <hi>viz.</hi> That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits either the <hi>Stain,</hi> or the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it. For by <hi>sin</hi> there is only these two contracted. As for the <hi>stain</hi> or <hi>pollution</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> That is not properly <hi>forgiven,</hi> but is wash'd away by God's sanctifying Grace upon our repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to him: And for the <hi>Guilt,</hi> that is nothing else, but that <hi>obligation</hi> to punishment, which every Man by sinning, renders himself obnoxious to; so that to remit the <hi>Guilt,</hi> is to remit the <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>punishment.</hi> To say therefore that God forgives the <hi>Guilt</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and yet that our <hi>Obligation to punishment</hi> remains, is in effect to say, that God forgives the <hi>Guilt,</hi> which he do's not forgive, which must be a <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="34" facs="tcp:36811:487"/>
But may not God forgive the <hi>Guilt</hi> as to the <hi>Obligation</hi> it lays upon us to <hi>Eternal punishment,</hi> and yet retain it as to a <hi>Temporal one?</hi> No doubt he may; and had He declared that he would do so, we must have believed it. But then this would not have been properly to <hi>forgive</hi> the <hi>Guilt,</hi> but to <hi>commute</hi> it, to <hi>lessen</hi> it. And since neither has He any where declared that this is all he does when he <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives sins;</hi> nor does his Justice require that he should do no more; But especially, seeing wherever God speaks of the <hi>remission of sins,</hi> he does it without restriction, in the most large, comprehensive terms that can be imagined: We see no cause either to suspect his Goodness, or to lessen his Mercy by our own arbitrary and ungrounded limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>3dly,</hi> There is yet another Argument, and it is this: <q>The Opinion that takes away <hi>Purgatory,</hi> is not only <note place="margin">

                                 <hi>false</hi> but <hi>pernicious;</hi> for it makes men lazy in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding sinning, and in the doing of good Works. Whilst he that believes that there is no <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but that all sins are abolish'd by death to those that die in Faith, saith to himself, To what purpose do I labour in Fastings and Prayer, in Continence and Almsdeeds? Why do I defraud my heart of its delights and pleasures, since at my death, my sins, whether few or many, shall all be done away</q>

                              <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be? But yet since the point is brought at last to this issue, let us see the comparison.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>1st.</hi> We who deny <hi>Purgatory,</hi> thus press the practise of <hi>good works</hi> upon our Auditors. That God, to whom we are engaged by all imaginable ties of Love, Duty, and Gratitude, expresly requires them of us, as the <hi>only means</hi> to retain his favour. That if we be zealous in his service now, we shall certainly receive an Eternal weight of Bliss and Glory in his Kingdom. But that if we be careless and negligent of our duty, nothing but everlasting torments shall remain for us. That, let us not deceive our selves, or flatter our souls with any <hi>new ways</hi> of Getting to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Without Holiness no man shall ever see the Lord. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> is the only thing that by <hi>Faith</hi> can reconcile us to his favour: And <hi>repentance</hi> cannot be true, except there be a true <hi>Love of God,</hi> and an utter <hi>detestation of sin,</hi> and a <hi>hearty contrition</hi> that we have ever committed it; and a <hi>stedfast resolution</hi> never to fall any more into it; and this improved in an <hi>actual, sincere endeavour,</hi> what in us lies, to abound in <hi>Good works,</hi> and fulfil <hi>that duty</hi> which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us. That without this, 'tis not any power or <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Church, Absolving</hi> us from our sins; any <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> or <hi>Indulgences,</hi> either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> our <hi>Commission of them,</hi> that can stand us in any stead, or restore us to God's favour and the hopes of Salvation. But that if we do this, then indeed we may assure our selves of his acceptance; we may raise our hopes to the blessings that he has promised; and that we may be the more encouraged to pursue them, may assure our selves that all those joys which he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us, and which it does not now enter into the heart of man but to conceive any thing of as he ought to do, are not at any great distance: As soon as ever we have finish'd our course here, we shall presently be translated, if not to a perfect fruition of them, yet to such an <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past,</hi>

as shall be more than a sufficient reward for all our endeavours in the pursuit of them.</p>
                           <p>This is the method of our Preaching: Let us now set Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and see how much more effectually he will press these things upon his <hi>Congregation.</hi> And because I would not make the worst of the matter, we will not consider him in quality of a Jesuit, instructing the people by Artifice and Distinction, how to <hi>evacuate</hi> the whole <hi>morality</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> by stating precisely the <hi>point,</hi> How often a man is obliged to <hi>love God?</hi> Whether upon all <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holydays?</hi> or only <hi>once a year?</hi> or once in <hi>five years?</hi> or but any <hi>one time</hi> in a mans <hi>whole life?</hi> or finally not <hi>at all,</hi> neither <hi>living</hi> nor <hi>dying?</hi> This were, it may be, to carry matters too far; we will stop within the bounds of their more common belief.</p>
                           <p>And here first of all, as is most fitting, we must be sure to put them often in mind of the <hi>Obedience</hi> they owe to the <hi>Church:</hi> of the high opinions they ought always to retain of her, and of that intire <hi>submission</hi> wherewith they are to yield themselves up to her <hi>Conduct.</hi> That they be sure not to fail to go to <hi>Mass</hi> every <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Holyday;</hi> that they eat no <hi>flesh</hi> on any of the <hi>Fasts</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> unless they are otherwise <hi>dispensed with</hi> to the contrary: That once at least every year they receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and before they do so, that they fail not to go to <hi>Confession;</hi> That they make no doubt but by the <hi>Priests Absolution</hi> they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly forgiven their sins whatsoever they were; That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it were well that they were <hi>contrite</hi> for them; but if they are not, 'tis all one, <hi>Attrition</hi> with the Sacrament of <hi>Penance</hi> do's the same thing: That this therefore sets them free of all danger of <hi>Hell,</hi> so that be their lives what they will, there is no great fear of that; but yet that to <hi>secure their Piety,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> has thought fit to discover to them another very <hi>terrible place</hi> called <hi>Purgatory,</hi> whither they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36811:488"/>
must go to <hi>satisfie</hi> for their <hi>sins</hi> before they can get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That, indeed, let them live how they will, hither they must come: But yet let them not be discouraged; there are several secret ways of avoiding it, with infinitely more security than the best Life in the world can give them. First, an <hi>Indulgence</hi> may be had, and that too <hi>before-hand,</hi> to <hi>secure</hi> the greatest <hi>sinner</hi> from ever coming thither. If this fail, yet they may enter themselves into some <hi>Holy fraternity,</hi> as for instance that of the <hi>Scapulary,</hi> and then they certainly get out of <hi>Purgatory</hi> the <hi>Saturday</hi> after they dye. At least, that let the worst that can happen, a good number of <hi>Masses</hi> when they are dead, <hi>infallibly</hi> does the <hi>business.</hi> 'Tis true, none of these things can be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money, and therefore the <hi>poor</hi> must take heed and have as few sins as they can to answer for; but yet that if they watch their time, an <hi>Indulgence</hi> will come at an easie rate, and the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Charity</hi> will fall her price, rather than refuse that <hi>Money</hi> that will be so much to the benefit of her <hi>faithful Children.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is, I think, the difference between us: Let the world now judg, who it is that give the greatest encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to <hi>Vice,</hi> the Cardinal in these easie <hi>methods</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> or <hi>We</hi> by retaining the old Scripture-way of <hi>Repentance</hi> and a <hi>Good Life.</hi> But the truth is, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to have lain thus; The Opinion that takes away <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and leaves men that have lived well, in repose at their death, cuts off all the benefit of <hi>Masses, Prayers for the dead,</hi> and the like; not to say any thing of the dear concern of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> by which our <hi>Church</hi> and our <hi>Clergy</hi> in great measure subsist; and therefore tho' we know we have nothing to say for it, yet we are resolved we will not quit the belief of it: And this indeed is the honest Truth; but for the rest, 'tis in good earnest nothing to the purpose.</p>

                              <p>And this then may be a second <hi>Observation;</hi> That the Scrpture always speaks of the <hi>Death</hi> of good men as a <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> an immediate rest from their labours; and therefore sure understood nothing of those <hi>Torments</hi> to which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> now condemns them.

                                 <hi>I heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me, Write; Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from</hi> HENCEFORTH, <hi>yea saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labours.</hi> 'Twas this assurance made the Holy men of old so desirous of their dissolution, That they might find an end of all those labours and evils which they suffer'd here: Phil. 1. 23. <note place="margin">Phil. i. 23.</note> 
                                 <hi>I am in a straight,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, betwixt two, having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to depart and to be with Christ which is better,</hi> &amp;c. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly St. <hi>Paul</hi> never thought of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> when he talk'd thus of going to Christ; nor would he have appear'd so desirous of his Dissolution, had he known he should have been cast into such a <hi>fire</hi> as the <hi>Romanists</hi> suppose to be in this infernal Region.</p>
                              <p>Nor can it here be reasonably said, that this was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles peculiar happiness; and therefore that tho' he indeed was secure of going immediately to <hi>Christ,</hi> yet others were not therefore to expect the like favour: For 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 1. we <note place="margin">2 Cor. v. 1.</note> find him promising the very same to <hi>all Christians</hi> indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; <hi>We know,</hi> says he, <hi>that if our Earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building with God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> And again, Verse 8. <hi>When we are absent from the Body,</hi> says he, <hi>We are</hi> 
                                 <note place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> 
                                 <hi>present with the Lord:</hi> By all which it appears, that when good Men dye, they go <hi>to the Lord;</hi> to <hi>Christ;</hi> to <hi>their Heavenly House;</hi> and that sure is not <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
                              </p>

To this agree those few instances we have of Just mens dying, in the <hi>New-Testament. Lazarus</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> was in <hi>Abraham's besome;</hi> The <hi>Penitent Thief</hi> on the <hi>Cross</hi> was promised that he should be that day with Christ in <hi>Paradise:</hi> And we have good reason to believe that the same is the state of all others, not only from the passages already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and many more of the like kind that might have been offer'd; but also from this, that we have not in all the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> the least intimation of any such place as <hi>Purgatory:</hi> That there is neither precept nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of any one that either <hi>pray'd</hi> for the <hi>delivery of their friends departed,</hi> out of these pains, or any Directions left for any one hereafter so to do: Now certainly it is not easie to be imagined, that the Holy Penmen should have been so perfectly silent in this matter, had there been so great a <hi>Cause</hi> for it, as the delivery of their <hi>Souls</hi> out of <hi>Purgatory</hi> undoubtedly would have been; or had they then esteemed it so excellent and necessary a piece of Christian <hi>Charity,</hi> as it is now pretended to be.</p>
                              <p>And this Presumption against <hi>Purgatory</hi> the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will afford us. If we look</p>

                                 </q> Where we see the Father expresly Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the time of <hi>Purgation</hi> in this <hi>Life,</hi> to the time not of <hi>Purgation,</hi> but of <hi>Punishment</hi> in the next. And St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,</hi>

                                 </q> This was the Doctrine of those times; the Soul that was clear of Sin, by Gods Pardon and Forgiveness, no <hi>Fire</hi> could hurt; that which was not, no <hi>Fire</hi> could cleanse; but it was to remain in Torments of <hi>Hell</hi> for ever.</p>
                              <p>Nor may we omit to observe, <hi>3dly,</hi> That the <hi>Fathers</hi> take no notice of <hi>Purgatory</hi> in such places, as had they believed it, they could not well have omitted it. Hence we see no mention of it in any of their <hi>Creeds</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> or <hi>Catechetical Discourses,</hi> in which the other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their Faith are set down and explain'd.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36811:491"/>
                                 <hi>Purgatory</hi> in opposition to that which he had <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> invented. But that which shews it yet more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have been unknown to them, is, that not only St. <hi>Austin,</hi> but Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> himself, the great Patron of this Error, yet spoke of it with some doubt; not as they use to do of a Point firmly believed by the <hi>Church,</hi> but as a peculiar thing in which they were not themselves very well resolved. When the Fathers disputed against <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> they none of them mention any of the <hi>Purgatory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pains,</hi> which the <hi>Orthodox Faith</hi> taught, to distinguish them from those from which he erroniously had invented. When <hi>Epiphanius</hi> disputed against <hi>Aerius,</hi> concerning the Reason and Benefit of <hi>Praying for</hi> the <hi>Dead,</hi> is it to be imagined he could then have forgot the great concern of delivering the <hi>Souls</hi> departed out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> had the Church then believed any such thing? To all which, if we finally add, That the <hi>Greek Church</hi> neither at this day do's, nor ever did receive this Doctrine, I cannot tell what clearer Evidence we can desire to shew, that this whole Business of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> is but an Error of the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> not an <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi>

                              <p>I shall only offer this one Reflection: Whether there can be any Reason to think there should be such a place, and such punishments as <hi>Purgatory,</hi> for no end or purpose in the World. They who go thither, must be perfect in Charity, in the Grace of God, secure of their Salvation; their Satisfaction must have been made by Christ's Blood, and so God's Justice satisfied. Now when all this is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done, to what end is it that they should be tormented? Had there been any means by such a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> either to fit
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36811:492"/>
them for Heaven, or to satisfie the <hi>Divine Justice,</hi> there might then have been some pretence for it. But to think that God punishes Men only for Punishing-sake; and this too his own Servants, Men who are in his Favour, that have lived well, and upon that account are justified by him through the <hi>Blood of Christ;</hi> this is such an <hi>Idea</hi> of an Infinite <hi>Love, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> as sure can never be the Dictate of <hi>Right Reason;</hi> I think I may say, is utterly inconsistent with it.</p>

                        <p>WE have now pass'd through the former Part of our Undertaking, and found but little Reason to be concern'd for those <hi>imaginary Flames,</hi> which so much terrify those of the other Communion. It only remains that we descend to the great Argument that is most usually insisted upon by them, to prove at least the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of their <hi>Error,</hi> and that is from the undeni'd Primitive Custom of <hi>Praying for the Dead;</hi> and concerning which, I suppose, it may be sufficient to offer these two things.</p>

                           <argument>
                              <p>Of the Practice of the Primitive Church, in <hi>Praying for the Dead.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>NOW that I may give the clearer account of this, I must observe; <hi>1st,</hi> That it is one thing to enquire whether we may not innocently <hi>Pray for the Dead;</hi> and another, whether we ought to do it? 2. That there is a great difference between <hi>Praying</hi> for the <hi>Dead</hi> in general, without defining what the particular intent of it is, and what Advantages accrue to the Dead thereby, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining that we are to <hi>Pray</hi> for the <hi>Dead</hi> upon such a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Account, as for instance, <hi>To delive their Souls out of Purgatory,</hi> and that our <hi>Prayers</hi> are effectual in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. As to the former of these, We do not deny but that the Fathers did begin very early to <hi>Pray for the Dead;</hi> and some of them were so zealous for it too, that <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> (as we shall see below) made it no small part of his Accusation of <hi>Aerius,</hi> that he opposed the Practice of it. But yet, we do not find that they pretended it was any part of a Christian's <hi>Duty</hi> to do this: That the Gospel has any where required it of us, or recommended it to us: In short, they did it as something which seemed to them very Pious and Fitting; but they tied up no Man's Conscience with any <hi>Decisions</hi> or <hi>Anathema</hi>'s about it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. For the Benefit and Advantage of it, in this they were yet less agreed than in the other: Insomuch, that when <hi>Aerius,</hi> whom I before mentioned, earnestly demanded what good came to the <hi>Dead</hi> from our <hi>Prayers?</hi> 
                              <note n="*" place="margin">Epiph. Heres. 75. l. 3. n. 3. p. 908. A. Edit. An. 1682. Ibid. n. 7. p. 911. C.</note> 
                              <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> chose rather to fly off to the <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to the necessity of these Prayers to distinguish the Condition
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36811:493"/>
of our Blessed <hi>Lord</hi> from that of all other Persons, and the like; than he would say expresly, <hi>how</hi> or <hi>wherein the Dead</hi> were profited by them?</p>
                           <p>Many were the <hi>private Opinions</hi> of those holy Men, as to this matter. Some who believed the <hi>Millenary Doctrine</hi>

                           <p n="2">2. Others supposed that in the <hi>General Conflagration</hi> of the World at the last day, All Men should pass through the <hi>Fire;</hi> That the better Christian any one had been, the less he should feel of the Torment of it: And these <hi>pray'd</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> that God would <hi>have Mercy on them in that day,</hi> and not suffer them to be too much <hi>singed</hi> and <hi>burnt,</hi> not in the Fire of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but in the <hi>General Conflagration at the end of the World.</hi>

4. And lastly, not to mention any more; others there were who thought that the <hi>Sentence</hi> was not instantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced as soon as men died; or if it were, yet not so Peremptorily, but that still, till the last day, an encrease of <hi>Glory</hi> might be added to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> which God hath designed for the <hi>Just;</hi> and some <hi>diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> made of the <hi>Torments</hi> of the <hi>Wicked.</hi> Now these pray'd for the <hi>Dead</hi> out of this Hope, to render them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more <hi>Happy</hi> or less <hi>Miserable,</hi> to <hi>augment</hi> their <hi>Glory,</hi> or to <hi>diminish</hi> their <hi>pains</hi> for ever.</p>
                           <p>And all these were the <hi>private Opinions</hi> of particular men, no <hi>definitions</hi> of the Faith of the Church in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <note n="†" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Epiphan.</hi> ib. Sect. 7. p. 911.</note> Many of the Holy Fathers declaring no other cause of their <hi>praying for the Dead</hi> than only to shew their Hopes of them, that they still lived, and therefore ought to have some <hi>Communion</hi> maintain'd with them: Or else to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish all, even the greatest <hi>Saints,</hi> from our <hi>Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> and shew his infinite Prerogative above them, whilst they <hi>pray'd</hi> for all the rest, to testifie their infirmity, and only <hi>gave thanks</hi> for him to manifest his Glory.</p>
                           <p>Having given this particular account of the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the primitive <hi>Fathers</hi> as to this Point, and to some or other of which I shall shew, that all the passages produced out of them, in vindication of the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> may be applied; it will be no difficult matter to shew how little all this can favour the present Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in this matter.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Primitive Christians, 'tis true, <hi>pray'd for the Dead,</hi> but they never put it into any of their <hi>Creeds,</hi> as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> has done now.

                           <p n="2">2. The <hi>Prayers</hi> that are made for the <hi>Dead</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> are expresly determined to this particular end, To <note place="margin">See Sess. 25. Conc. Trid. de Purg. Symb. <hi>Pii</hi> IV. &amp;c.</note>

                           </p>
                           <p>Now this in general is Evident, in that we find them to have pray'd for the best Persons, for the Holy <hi>Apostles, Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>Confessors;</hi> for the Blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> her self; for those whom they supposed at the same time to be in <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,</hi> and whom the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves do not suppose to have ever touch'd at <hi>Purgatory.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>That the Fathers practised <hi>praying for the Dead,</hi> and that many of them believed it <hi>advantageous</hi> to them, we have before freely allow'd: And that <hi>Aerius</hi> was to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for what he did in Opposition hereunto, we shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shew: In the mean time this <hi>Gentleman</hi> ought to have known, that this is neither what they affirm, or we deny: If he will state the <hi>Question</hi> as he ought, it must be as we have before done it. <q>

                              </q> This was the case of <hi>Aerius:</hi> And had the <hi>Church</hi> indeed universally believed, as some of the <hi>Fathers</hi> did, that the <hi>Judgment</hi> after death was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended till the <hi>General Resurrection,</hi> and that in the mean time the sins of the <hi>dead</hi> might be expiated by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the living, he had but justly enough opposed so <hi>danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> an <hi>Error.</hi> But this was not the common opinion of the <hi>Church,</hi> nor her design in those <hi>Prayers:</hi> which as the <note place="margin">

therefore <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in answer to this Objection, gives <note place="margin">

                           <p>The <hi>Prayers</hi> therefore of the <hi>Church,</hi> for the rejecting of which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> here justly reproves <hi>Aerius,</hi> were not such as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> now useth; it being not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, had the <hi>Church</hi> then known any thing of <hi>praying of Souls out of Purgatory,</hi> that either <hi>Aerius</hi> could have ask'd the Question, <hi>To what purpose are these Prayers?</hi> Or <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> being ask'd, not presently have replied, to <hi>deliver the Souls departed from the flames of Purgatory.</hi> The <hi>Prayers</hi> that <hi>Aerius</hi> condemned were those which the primitive Fathers made upon the account that from <hi>Epiphanius</hi> I have just now given: And which those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> do no less condemn than he did; whilst they so often tell us, that if there be no <hi>Purgatory, Prayers</hi> for the <hi>dead</hi> must be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable:</hi> So says <note n="†" place="margin">Contr.

thought her in a state and place vastly different from the condition of <hi>Souls</hi> in <hi>Purgatory;</hi> all that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> then meant by this, was only thus much, that this <hi>Charity</hi> of <hi>Pammachius</hi> was most pleasing to <hi>Paulina,</hi> that her <hi>Soul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in it, as in a <hi>fragrant</hi> and <hi>delightful Odour;</hi> and that hereby he should engage the Mercy of God not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self alone, but for his Wife too, in whose name he did it, and to whose Salvation it should therefore not a little conduce.</p>

                              <hi>2dly,</hi> Some <hi>others</hi> there are that may seem more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to their purpose; in which they expresly desire <hi>Rest, Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Refreshment</hi> for the <hi>dead.</hi> I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy answered in great measure this Argument, by shewing that these things they prayed for, even for the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and the <hi>B.

                           <p>If it shall be objected against this, That to <hi>pray</hi> for their <hi>rest</hi> implies as if they were not now in <hi>Ease,</hi> and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to a necessity of confessing either a <hi>Purgatory</hi> or some other the like place of punishment. I answer <hi>1st,</hi> If this be so, then the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> the <hi>Apostles, Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>Confessors</hi> were all at this time in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> above 300 years after their death; for thus we see they prayed in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> by name for them, which yet the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> dares not say. But <hi>2dly,</hi> In the continuance of their <hi>Prayers</hi> for <hi>the dead,</hi> they used the same supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that they did at their <hi>first departure;</hi> and therefore pray for their rest and repose, as if they were but now just <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Purg. cap. <hi>v.</hi> p. 644. C.</note> about to enter into it; and this account <hi>Cardinal Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>
                              <pb n="63" facs="tcp:36811:503"/>
himself gives us of it. To which let me add <hi>3dly,</hi> That the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> thought, that in this <hi>place</hi> of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment</hi> there were divers <hi>degrees</hi> of it; and therefore they prayed that God would <hi>give them rest,</hi> not as if they were now totally destitute of it, but as desiring it might be increased to them in a yet higher degree: Or else <hi>4thly,</hi> as <hi>Tertullians</hi> words seem to imply, they desired hereby their <hi>rest,</hi> i. e. the <hi>continuance of that rest</hi> they now enjoy'd to the day of judgment.</p>
                           <p>Nor is it any prejudice to this, that the <hi>dead</hi> were now out of a capacity of having their state ever alter'd, and therefore that it was in vain to <hi>pray</hi> for that happiness which they were already secure of, since as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de Purg. cap. v. ib.</note> confesses, the Ancients thought it no way improper to pray for those things which they knew God was resolved to give: And we see our Blessed Saviour in his own short Prayer has commanded us to pray that God's <hi>Kingdom may come,</hi> which whether we pray or no, will in its due time most infallibly be accomplish'd.</p>
                           <p>Whether these Reasons may, any or all of them appear to be a sufficient vindication of such kind of <hi>Prayers</hi> I cannot tell: But this is certain, that the primitive Christians did pray for the <hi>rest</hi> of those whom they esteemed already in happiness, and by consequence that these <hi>Prayers</hi> do not argue a state of <hi>Torments</hi> from whence the <hi>dead</hi> were to be <hi>delivered</hi> by them. And because it may be of great moment to be well assured of this, I will subjoyn an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able instance of it, in one of the very particulars offer'd by our <hi>Collector,</hi> but with what sincerity I shall leave the <hi>Reader</hi> to judge, in favour of <hi>Purgatory.</hi>

                           <p>St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his <hi>Oration</hi> on the Death of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> thus <hi>prays</hi> for him: <q>
                                 <hi>Give perfect rest to thy Servant</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius, <hi>that</hi> Rest <hi>which thou hast prepared for thy Saints. Let his Soul ascend thither from whence it had its Origine;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36811:504"/>
where it may be out of the power of Death, where it may know that Death is not an end of Nature but of Sin. I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, and therefore I pursue him to the Region of the living; nor will I leave him, till by my Tears and Prayers I bring him whither his Merits call him, into the</hi> Holy Mount <hi>of our Lord, where there is life without end.</hi>

3. There is yet one Witness to be consider'd, and upon which our <hi>Collector</hi> insists more largely than ordinary, and that is St. <hi>Chrysostome:</hi> Who in the places cited out of him <note place="margin">Nub. Test. p. 88, 89, &amp;c.</note> speaks indeed of certain <hi>Benefits</hi> which came to the <hi>dead</hi> by our <hi>Prayers;</hi> and thereupon exhorts all persons to perform this Office to them. I have before mentioned an Opinion of some Fathers, that even the <hi>damned</hi> in <hi>Hell</hi> might be advantaged by the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>living;</hi> and if not be freed from, yet be at least alleviated in their torments. And in this excessive <hi>Charity</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> was one of the forwardest; as is evident in the very <note n="⸫" place="margin">Hom. 21. in Act. Tom. 3. in N. T. p. 202, 203. Hom. 3. in Ep. Phil. To. 6. in N. T. p. 32, 33.</note> 
                              <hi>Homilies</hi> cited by this <hi>Collector,</hi> were I at liberty to insist on a thing so well known. We are not therefore to wonder if we find this <hi>Father</hi> so earnestly pressing this Charity of <hi>praying for the dead,</hi> which he thought of so great a force as even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the greatest sinners. If this be either the belief or practise of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> we shall not deny them a patern in this <hi>Holy Father;</hi> But if this be what they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe nor allow of, How impertinent must it be to produce his <hi>praying for the dead,</hi> on such Principles as they condemn, to be a witness of the Antiquity of their <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the dead</hi> to deliver them out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which he knew nothing at all of, nor did at all intend by his <hi>Prayers.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. As for what is finally added concerning the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> it is confessed that they do <hi>pray for the dead</hi> upon the same grounds, and after the same manner that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church did; but that they <hi>pray</hi> for them as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> would now insinuate, this is false, as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewn; nor do the testimonies produced at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of it.</p>
                           <p>And this may suffice to have been said to the several proofs that are offer'd by those of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> in favour of this Error, concerning <hi>Prayers for the dead;</hi> for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36811:505"/>
as for <hi>Isidore Hispalensis,</hi> he is beyond the period I have fix'd to my reflections; and for St. <hi>Perpetua</hi>'s Dream which the <hi>Misrepresenter,</hi> from <hi>Natalis</hi> too, heretofore insisted upon, I may reasonably presume by our <hi>Collector</hi>'s omission of it, that he thought it sufficiently answer'd by the <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author</hi> that first undertook the examination of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences against us.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div type="conclusion">
                           <head>CLOSE.</head>
                           <p>AND now after so particular Examination of all these things, there is but One <hi>Objection</hi> more remaining that I can foresee may possibly be made against us, on this Occasion: For be it that we have reason to throw off the <hi>Romish</hi> Error of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and by consequence those <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Dead</hi> which are made in that <hi>Church</hi> to deliver the <hi>Souls</hi> from thence; yet since we cannot deny but that the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> did <hi>pray for the Dead</hi> for many other ends, and which we do not presume to condemn them for, Wherefore at least do we not continue the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Practice, and <hi>pray</hi> for them as those <hi>Holy Men</hi> of old did?</p>
                           <p>This perhaps may be a scruple that some may raise, and having answer'd it I shall conclude: And</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>1st,</hi> If he be one of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> that makes this Objection, he may please to tell us, wherefore it is, That they of his own <hi>Church</hi> do not do this? Or why he should require us to follow the <hi>Ancient practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in those things which themselves do not think suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to oblige them to a Conformity? They may call us <hi>Aerians</hi> or what else they please upon this account; but if to follow the <hi>Error</hi> of <hi>Aerius,</hi> this be to become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36811:505"/>
                              <hi>Aerians,</hi> we have before seen that they do so; nay they outstrip him in it; whilst that sort of <hi>Praying for the dead,</hi> which the <hi>Ancients</hi> used, he thought only <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>irrational;</hi> but there are amongst them those who <note place="margin">See above.</note> doubt not to call it <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>absurd.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I have before shewn what the <hi>Grounds</hi> were on which those <hi>Holy</hi> Men <hi>prayed</hi> for the <hi>dead:</hi> Now there is not one of these which is not at this day disclaim'd by the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> no less than by us, and especially that which was the chiefest foundation of all, <hi>viz.</hi> The Opinion of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Soul out of Heaven during its separation,</hi> they have in the <hi>Council of Florence</hi> flatly condemn'd. Now if it be then no crime in them to reject the Opinions of those <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> on which this practice was founded, nay to censure the very practice its self upon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but that which they now assert, and which the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> as we have seen, never knew; how comes it to be more unlawful in us to do this, than it is in them; or why may not we as well give off <hi>Praying for the dead</hi> as the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> did, as they themselves not only leave it off, but even censure it to have been <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>absurd,</hi> which we never presumed to do? But</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>2dly,</hi> If the Person who makes this Objection, be of some other Communion, I have several Reflections to offer in our Justification in this Matter.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>1st,</hi> Let his Reverence for <hi>Antiquity</hi> be never be so great, yet he will not I am sure, say either, that those holy Men were <hi>Infallible</hi> in every thing they did, or that we ought to receive at all adventures whatever can be proved to have descended from them. We do indeed confess, that this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of <hi>Praying for the Dead,</hi> was one of the most early <hi>Practices</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But then we have seen what it was that introduced it: And their grounds are many of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36811:506"/>
them such, as are now generally disclaimed by almost all Christians; such as that of Christs <hi>Millenary Kingdom;</hi> of the passing of all Men, through the <hi>Purgatory-fire at the end of the World;</hi> of the <hi>Souls</hi> of the <hi>just</hi> being in a place of <hi>Sequester out of Heaven till the last day,</hi> and the like; the rest so inconsiderable, as that we cannot by any means think them sufficient to warrant so dangerous a Practice. For what is it to engage us to this, that the Ancients thought hereby to <hi>distinguish the best of Men from our Saviour Christ?</hi> To testifie their <hi>Hopes</hi> of a <hi>future Resurrection?</hi> To maintain a kind of <hi>Fellowship</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with them? There are other ways enough to do all this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out engaging in such a piety as the Holy Scripture, is not so much as pretended to Countenance: the most that ever the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> offer'd for it, being the <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> expresly places it among those things which are <hi>no where written.</hi> How far such an Authority might then have obliged us to compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Practice of the Church had we lived in those <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> it is not necessary to enquire; but since neither the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> requires it, nor do's the <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> now exact it of us, nor do we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg those <hi>Opinions</hi> on which it was heretofore used, nor can we see any <hi>Benefit</hi> that we are able to do the <hi>Dead</hi> by them; it is but reasonable to omit that, which might justly give offence to some, but cannot possibly bring advantage to any.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>2dly,</hi> We have yet a more particular Reason, why it is by no means fitting at this time, thus to <hi>pray for the Dead;</hi> and that is, to prevent that danger which the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Practice</hi> of the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome would be apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Men to, should we do it. To <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>the Souls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted</hi> as that <hi>Church</hi> do's, neither did the <hi>Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> ever allow, and we have sufficiently shown how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36811:506"/>
erroneous it is to do so. It is therefore by no means convenient to continue a Practice, whereby it might be very easy to lead Men into such <hi>gross Mistakes;</hi> and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, some might still be able to make the Distinction, and see a great difference in the Design and Intention of the same kind of <hi>praying;</hi> yet the ill use that is made, even of what those <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> did, sufficiently shews us how apt men are to confound those things together, that have so nigh a Relation as to the Practice, and the Act being the same, to lead them to believe that the Principle is so too.</p>
                           <p>In short, <hi>3dly,</hi> We cannot imagine, if there were indeed any such great Piety in this Practice, as to deserve our <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Omission</hi> of it, how it comes to pass that neither <hi>Precept</hi> nor <hi>Example</hi> of any such thing, is to be found in the <hi>Holy Scriptures:</hi> And to those, who make that the <hi>Rule of their Religion;</hi> we do not see that any more need be said than this, That we find nothing there to <hi>Authorize</hi> such a <hi>Devotion,</hi> and that, therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it fitting to make it a part of the <hi>Churches Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I shall close up all with the Words of our Church in her <hi>Homily</hi> upon this Subject: <q>Let these and such other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations <note place="margin">Third part of Serm. concern. Prayer, <hi>p. 212. Ed. Ox.</hi> 1683.</note> be sufficient to take away the gross Error of <hi>Purgatory</hi> out of our <hi>Heads;</hi> neither let us <hi>dream</hi> any more that the <hi>Souls</hi> of the <hi>Dead</hi> are any thing at all <hi>holpen</hi> by our <hi>Prayers:</hi> But as the <hi>Scripture</hi> teacheth us, let us think that the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> passing out of the Body, goeth straight ways either to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or else to <hi>Hell;</hi> whereof the one needeth no <hi>Prayer,</hi> the other is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Redemption.</hi> The only <hi>Purgatory</hi> wherein we must trust to be saved, is the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> which if we apprehend with a true and stedfast <hi>Faith,</hi> it <hi>purgeth</hi> and cleanseth us from all our Sins, even as well as if he were

now hanging upon the Cross. <hi>The Blood of Christ,</hi> saith St. <hi>John, hath cleansed us from all Sin. The Blood of</hi>

He that cannot be saved by <hi>Faith in Christs Blood,</hi> how shall he look to be deliver'd by <hi>Mans Intercessions?</hi> Hath God more Respect to Man on Earth, than he hath to Christ in Heaven? <hi>If any man sin</hi> (saith St. <hi>John) we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jesus Christ the Righteous,</hi>

                                 <hi>and he is the Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> But we must take heed that we call upon this <hi>Advocate,</hi> while we have space given us in this Life, least when we are once Dead, there be no hope of Salvation left unto us.

                        <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                        <p>WEre we to judge of the <hi>Merits</hi> of a <hi>Book</hi> meerly by the <hi>good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> which the <hi>Author</hi> seems to have of it, we might reasonab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that the <hi>Discourse</hi> concerning the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which I am about to consider, was not onely set forth in Defence of a truly <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> but that the Author of it thought himself delivering nothing but <hi>Oracles</hi> all the while he was composing of it.</p>
                        <p>If his <hi>Reasons</hi> had born proportion to the nature of his Attempt, we should easily have forgiven him, or rather we should have thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, no less than the Gentlemen of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Communion would have done in such a case. He does indeed Treat men with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, whom all the World knows to be above his Contempt, nor can I believe him to be so
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:36811:511"/>
singular as not to know it himself; but yet had he <hi>reasoned</hi> well, we had yielded to him: for an over-bearing Spirit in an Adversary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes us to submit to a bad Argument, nor to resist a good one.</p>
                        <p>It seemed something strange, that that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor should think to Trample upon us now, for pretending that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> as 'tis understood by us, and that she has established an Idolatrous Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in her Communion: For not only the greatest Persons of the Reformed Religion have brought this Charge against her, but to the truth of it himself has subscribed in his time. But it was much more amazing to find so new a Confidence supported by Arguments so weak, that 'tis not without reason that some of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion are said to complain, That they have been Betrayed, rather than Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him.</p>
                        <p>How unsuccessfully he has managed his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Expounding <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> has been shewn in a late Discourse proving <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> to be the <hi>peculiar</hi> Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination</hi> of the New Articles of the <hi>Roman</hi>
                           <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:36811:511"/>
Creed by <hi>Catholick Tradition.</hi> If I make it appear that he has miscarried as much in the point of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> his <hi>Theological</hi> part will then be considered; and for the rest, we do not by any means presume to meddle with it.</p>
                        <p>As for the Subject which I have undertaken, one would have thought, that a man who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to despise all that had ever written upon it, and not according to his <hi>Opinion,</hi> should have taken care, if not to produce something <hi>that could not be Answer'd,</hi> yet at least not to offer any thing that had <hi>been already Confuted.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But on the contrary, this Author, after all this noise, has for the most part been only an humble Transcriber of the Old <hi>Exploded Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences;</hi> and which I may truly say were much more <hi>strongly,</hi> as well as more <hi>modestly</hi> urged by Dr. <hi>Godden</hi> against his learned Adversary. And when I consider how much more roughly this Author uses him, than that Doctor did, I am apt to think it might in some measure proceed from the sence he had that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> in discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sophistry</hi> of his Old Antagonist, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand confuted whatever this New one could find out again to revive the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:36811:512"/>
And for this I shall leave the following <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> to be my Evidence; and of which I shall say no more here, than that in his own phrase: <q>I have delivered my Judgment, as I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <note place="margin">Pag. 135.</note> for my <hi>Integrity</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>World.</hi>
                           </q> But now there is another thing, which I ought not in this place to pass by. It has been insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated by this hot <hi>Reasoner,</hi> as no small Crime in us, that we charge the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> with Idolatry, <q>Not only (says he) because of the <note place="margin">Pag. 72.</note> 
                              <hi>falseness</hi> of the <hi>Calumny,</hi> but the barbarous <hi>consequence</hi> that may follow upon it, to incite and warrant the <hi>Rabble,</hi> whenever Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity favours, to destroy the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> and their <hi>Images,</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to destroy the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and their <hi>Idols.</hi> And in the next Page he tells us, That this Charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> has ever been set <note place="margin">73. 74.</note> up as the <hi>Standard</hi> against Monarchy.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are many more Passages of the like kind, in which he exercises his <hi>Gift</hi> of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: for I dare say he never learnt it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he has in his time studied to imitate a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest; for I know not what other Original he could propound to himself. This stile is the fittest in the World to his purpose, and will
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:36811:512"/>
perhaps be a Copy for the future to them that intend to speak neither according to <hi>Charity</hi> nor <hi>Truth;</hi> which are ever best heard in a Calm.</p>
                        <p>But however, if this too were for the <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of his <hi>Judgment,</hi> we will no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the <hi>Violence</hi> of his <hi>Expressions,</hi> than we do of the <hi>Force</hi> of his <hi>Arguments;</hi> only I would beg leave to say, that he should have been sure he could <hi>discharge</hi> the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> of that <hi>Guilt,</hi> before he had fix'd a Mark of <hi>Calumny</hi> upon the whole Body of the <hi>Reform'd,</hi> who accuse them of it; lest when men examine his <hi>Proofs,</hi> and find them defective, they be tempted to retort the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> especially considering with what Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Violence he has been pleased to lay it upon us.</p>
                        <p>But now for his great fear that this should incite the <hi>Rabble</hi> to any <hi>Violence</hi> against those of the other Communion, I dare venture to say, there is not the least reason to be at all apprehensive of it. He knows very well how free the <hi>Christians</hi> of the first three <hi>Centuries</hi> were in laying the very same <hi>Charge</hi> against the <hi>Gentile World;</hi> and yet we do not
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:36811:513"/>
find that they ever shew'd themselves either the less <hi>obedient</hi> to their <hi>Emperours,</hi> or the less <hi>charitable</hi> to their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> upon the account of it. And though I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that the <hi>Romanists,</hi> in the <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> and in the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Reliques,</hi> and of the <hi>Host,</hi> are guilty of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi> yet I thank <hi>God</hi> I am not conscious to my self of one <hi>disloyal</hi> Thought to my <hi>King,</hi> or of the least <hi>Uncharitableness</hi> towards any of my <hi>Country-men,</hi> who differ from me in these <hi>Particulars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And what I can thus truly profess in my own behalf, I doubt not but I may do for all others the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>genuine Members</hi> of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and who by being such, must, I am sure by <hi>Principle,</hi> be both <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Subjects,</hi> and <hi>Charitable Christians.</hi> As for this Author, he has made as broad a signe that he intends to leave us, by insinuating, that the Charge of Idolatry ought to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with Blows, as by his concern not to have Idolatry charged upon the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> We who do protest against certain Practices as Idolatrous, do also protest against violating either Loyalty or Charity, upon the
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:36811:513"/>
account of Religion. This Author, it seems, likes us neither upon one account, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or this at least is to be said, that he has been thus long of our Communion, and has not all this while understood what we teach concerning a Christian's Duty to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                        <p>Did we indeed profess that of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which some others do of <hi>Heresie,</hi> that 'tis a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Ground for the <hi>Excommunicating</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Absolving</hi> his <hi>Subjects</hi> of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; had we ever been caught not in <hi>Otesian Conspiracies,</hi> but in <hi>Real Plots</hi> against our <hi>Soveraign</hi> upon this account, there might then have been just cause for such an <hi>Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But whilst our <hi>Principles</hi> are so <hi>Loyal,</hi> that we have even been laught at for our assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and that too by some of those who would now be thought so <hi>zealous</hi> for their Princes Safety; it was a very unreasonable Apprehension, to think that the Charge of Idolatry (and that too begun in the time of a Prince of whom it was Misprision of Treason, but to say that he was guilty of it) should in the bottom have been the designe against the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which we have so often declared,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:36811:514"/>
and in the very Person of our present <hi>King</hi> have shewn, we think our selves obliged to support, whatever his Religion be who is to sit upon the Throne.</p>
                        <p>And for what concerns our Brethren of the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> it is well known that we are not of those who <hi>destroy</hi> men for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> sake. We have never been infamous either for <hi>Parisian Massacres,</hi> or Military Conversions. They are Others that have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined at once both the <hi>Churches</hi> and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the <hi>Living God,</hi> out of <hi>Zeal</hi> for their <hi>Religion.</hi> We have indeed taken care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the <hi>Idols</hi> out of our <hi>Israel;</hi> but for the <hi>Worshippers</hi> of them, if they have suffer'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, it has not been for their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but for that which shews there is <hi>something else</hi> more dangerous to the <hi>English Monarchy</hi> than this Charge.</p>
                        <p>The truth is, when I consider how heinous a <hi>Suggestion</hi> this is, and what little <hi>foundation</hi> there is, either from our <hi>Principles,</hi> or our Practices, to support it, I am under some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to reply to this Author, as an ancient <hi>Father</hi> once did to a <hi>Heathen</hi> who accused them of such <hi>Cruelties</hi> and <hi>Filthiness</hi> in their
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:36811:514"/>
                           <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> as none but themselves were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of committing. <q>

                        <p>And this I hope may serve for my Excuse, if I have at this time appear'd in <hi>defence</hi> of a Charge in which every true <hi>Member</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is so highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; and for which all <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> among us, have been so contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously exploded by this <hi>Author.</hi> Or if I must still be content to bear the Censure of such as He, I shall at least comfort my self in this, that I can fall under no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> but what must at the same time reflect upon all the great <hi>Names</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Christian Church,</hi> with whom I had rather suffer the angry Reflections of a few of our own Communion, than flourish with them, and gain their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses.</p>
                        <p>To say the truth, when such Learned Defenders of our Church are struck at, and that in so impetuous a manner as that

                        <argument>
                           <p>In which the Charge of <hi>Idolatry</hi> which we bring against those of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is freed from those <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Imputations</hi> that have been of late suggested against it.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>IT may possibly appear to some not a little sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, that a <hi>Church</hi> which makes no scruple of <hi>practising</hi> what is <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> should yet be so very unwilling to lie under the <hi>imputation</hi> of it: There is nothing in all our <hi>Disputes</hi> with those of the <hi>other Communion,</hi> which they would be thought so highly to resent as this; the very mention of it has seem'd to <hi>Scandalize</hi> them; and if heat and confidence could have born us down, they had long since effectually deliver'd themselves from all <hi>suspicion</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>It is not my business to enquire into the <hi>Reasons</hi> of this <hi>Proceeding,</hi> and which, when duly consider'd, will be found to have nothing in it, but what is exceeding natural. Men are always more forward to do ill things, than to <hi>avow</hi> them, or to own them under their proper names: <hi>Idolatry</hi> (as our Author says) <hi>is a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Charge.</hi> By his leave, the <hi>Charge</hi> is not always
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36811:519"/>
scandalous, though the Crime be ever so, and the Charge reputed scandalous by them who are charged with it. Though a <hi>Church</hi> that does countenance the Commission of it, may by subtile Arguments and bold Denials keep up its <hi>Reputation</hi> well enough amongst those who are resolv'd at any rate to believe her, yet 'twere impossible she should long support her <hi>Interest,</hi> should she freely avow the doing of it.</p>
                        <p>But of all the <hi>Methods</hi> that have been made use of to put a stop to this <hi>Charge;</hi> there has been none so surprizing as what this <hi>Author</hi> has here found out; and could he but have made it good, I am perswaded there would not have been any more effectual. He represents it as inconsistent not only with the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> towards our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> but even of <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Page</hi> 71, &amp;c.</note> 
                           <hi>Loyalty</hi> towards our <hi>Prince;</hi> and makes the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to be little less than <hi>a setting up of the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard against Monarchy.</hi> And yet he is not so unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <note place="margin">Page 74.</note> with the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Dispositions</hi> of those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as not to know, that next to our sollicitude for the Honour of God, there are no two things in the World, we value our selves more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than that Character we have so justly obtained, of teaching the best Measures both of <hi>Duty</hi> to our <hi>King,</hi> and of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Kindness,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards <hi>One A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I must therefore, before I proceed to vindicate our <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> first say somewhat to remove this great <hi>prejudice</hi> that has been offer'd against it; And this I shall do,</p>

                        <p>Now all that he has to say for this odious <hi>Charge,</hi> if taken out of his turbulent and declamatory Stile, is but this: <q>That <hi>Idolatry</hi> is a Sin very heighnous to <hi>God,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Page 71, 72, 73.</note> and which he therefore, under the <hi>Law,</hi> commanded to be punished with <hi>Death.</hi>
                           </q> This is the sum of what he has dilated upon in <hi>three</hi> whole <hi>Pages;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this I have many things to except. For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. What if <hi>Idolatry</hi> be a damnable Sin, may we not therefore say, without uncharitableness, that those are guilty of it, whom we effectually prove to be so? <hi>Must we therefore become mens Enemies because we tell them the Truth?</hi> I am sure a very little <hi>Charity</hi> would have taught him to have made a better <hi>Conclusion;</hi> nor can I imagine what greater instance of my Affection, I could shew my best Friend, if I saw him in such a course as I thought would render him <hi>eternally mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> than to tell him freely of the <hi>danger</hi> of his <hi>Sin,</hi> and press him with the best <hi>Reasons</hi> I had to perswade him to forsake it.</p>
                        <p>It may be he will say, he does not deny but that we may <hi>charge</hi> men with great <hi>Sins,</hi> provided that they be truly <hi>guilty</hi> of them: But yet that the heighnous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this <hi>Crime</hi> should make us careful not to do it, but upon very good grounds; for to this purpose I find he sometimes expresses himself: <q>So black a <hi>Crime</hi> as this (says he) is not <hi>Lightly</hi> to be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Page 73.</note> on any Party of <hi>Christians.</hi> And again, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

so <hi>bloudy</hi> an <hi>Indictment</hi> be preferred against the greatest Party of <hi>Christendom,</hi> the nature of the thing <note place="margin">Page 73.</note> ought to be very well understood.</q> And if this be all he means, we readily acknowledge the reasonablness of it: but then he ought not to fly out into such Tragical common places against us for charging the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but to come close to the <hi>Point,</hi> and shew that we have not sufficient <hi>grounds</hi> for what we do. If those whom we accuse of this <hi>Crime,</hi> be indeed <note place="margin">Page 70, 71.</note> 
                           <hi>innocent</hi> of it, whether <hi>God</hi> had commanded <hi>Idolaters</hi> to be Stoned under the <hi>Law</hi> or not, we could not justifie our charging of them with it: but if our <hi>Arguments</hi> do prove them <hi>guilty,</hi> the <hi>heinousness</hi> of the Sin, and the <hi>danger</hi> of it, may be a good <hi>motive</hi> to dispose them seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to weigh our <hi>Allegations,</hi> but I am sure it can lay no obligation upon us not to impute to it them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As to the other <hi>insinuation,</hi> that God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Page 71.</note>

If so, I dare be bold to say, he has done more in one single Page, to stir up the <hi>People</hi> against <hi>the Romanists</hi> and <hi>their Images,</hi> than all those <hi>popular</hi>

                           <hi>Divines</hi> he so complains of, in all the <hi>Books</hi> they have ever written upon this <hi>Subject.</hi> And yet this must be his <hi>Meaning,</hi> if it has any <hi>Meaning</hi> at all. For to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this matter a little more closely: <hi>God</hi> (he says) commanded the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6. <hi>If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend which is as thine own

soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto him, neither shall thine eye pity him; But thou shalt surely kill him: thine hand shall be first upon him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him with stones that he die.</hi> Now either he looks upon this <hi>Precept</hi> as still in force, and would hereby insinuate to the <hi>People,</hi> that it is their Duty, if they think the <hi>Romanists</hi> guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> utterly to destroy them; and this is certainly one of the most <hi>Seditious,</hi> as well as one of the most <hi>false</hi> Suggestions in the World: or if he does not believe this <hi>Command</hi> obligatory to us now, nor would insinuate any such thing by the repetition of it, what <hi>impertinence</hi> must it be to say that we cannot in <hi>Charity</hi> charge the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heretofore under the <hi>Law</hi> that all those that were <hi>guilty</hi> of it should be put to Death.</p>
                        <p>But though these kind of <hi>Precepts</hi> do not oblige us now, yet may not such a <hi>Charge</hi> be apt to stir up the deluded <hi>Rabble</hi> to think so; and so upon occasion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage <note place="margin">Page 72.</note> them to destroy the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and their <hi>Images,</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were commanded to destroy the <hi>Canaanites</hi> and their <hi>Idols?</hi> Answer, Yes; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided there were but a few such <hi>Orators</hi> as himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, to fill their heads with such Notions as these, and never tell them the <hi>impertinence</hi> of them.

with all <hi>Christian Charity</hi> towards those of the <hi>Roman Communion,</hi> notwithstanding we both believe them to be guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and charge them accordingly. But</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We do not only tell them, that those kind of <hi>Laws</hi> are now no longer in force, and that therefore we may not by vertue of them presume to run into any <hi>violence</hi> against our <hi>Brethren:</hi> but we teach them moreover, (what yet more shews the impertinent Malice of this <hi>Suggestion)</hi> that they never were intended, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Jewish State,</hi> to be in force against such <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> as they of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are. It is manifest to every one that has impartially considered the <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in the Old Testament, that there were <hi>two</hi> very different <hi>kinds</hi> of it: 1. One whereby they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Apostatized from the <hi>Law,</hi> to Worship other <hi>Gods</hi> than the <hi>GOD</hi> of <hi>Israel;</hi> as when 'tis said that they fell off to Worship <hi>strange Gods; i. e.</hi> they renounced the Religion established by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and took in another Religion, with all the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> belonging to it, as the <hi>Aegyptian, Canaanitish,</hi> or <hi>Chaldaean:</hi> And such as these were concluded under the Sentence of the <hi>Law</hi> before mentioned. 2. But then another sort of <hi>Idolatry</hi> there was, in which they still pretended to adhere to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and Worship the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> but yet after an <hi>Idolatrous</hi> manner, as when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> set up the <hi>two Calves</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> parallel to which, is that <hi>Idolatry</hi> with which we charge those of the <hi>other Communion</hi> at this day. Now in this <hi>Case;</hi> though we find the Prophets severely exclaiming against their new Altars, yet we do not meet with any inforcement of this <hi>Precept</hi> for putting such <hi>Idolat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

where charged as guilty of it upon this Account.</p>
                        <p>In short, he that would know how innocent this <hi>Charge</hi> is, of any of those ill <hi>Consequences</hi> that are here brought against it, need onely look back to the State of the Church in the days of <hi>Constantine:</hi> there he will find our <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> freely accusing the <hi>Arrians</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and sometimes warm enough too in their Disputes against them; but yet I believe all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of those times, will not furnish <hi>this Author</hi> with so much as one instance of any <hi>Bishop</hi> that ever put the Emperour in mind of this Law against them; or so much as insinuated to him, that he might warrantly <hi>destroy</hi> them out of his <hi>Dominions</hi> for their <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And sure our behaviour towards those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> has not been so different from what theirs was against the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that any <hi>such violence</hi> should be fear'd from us now, as was never so much as urged by the <hi>hottest Opposers</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in those days.</p>
                        <p>But 2dly, If there be then no good <hi>Grounds</hi> for such <hi>Insinuations</hi> as these, which he has here offer'd onely to render our <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> odious, I am sure there is cause enough upon other accounts, to make them just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be detested by all <hi>good Men.</hi>

                        <p>For 1. Not to say any thing of the <hi>sad Consequences</hi> that may arise from hence, should such insinuations as these ever be able to gain so much credit with his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majesty,</hi> as to make him entertain that ill Opinion of <hi>Us</hi> and our <hi>Religion,</hi> as we should justly deserve, were we such as we are here <hi>represented</hi> to be: Can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing be more desperate, than to impeach at once the whole Body of a Great and Orthodox <hi>Church,</hi> of holding Principles so <hi>inhumane,</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. To allow this great Author to take any Liberty he pleases with us: What shall we say as to the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians,</hi> whose Examples we follow, by whose <hi>Principles</hi> we manage this whole <hi>Controversie,</hi> and with whom therefore we must either stand or fall. Were all they a parcel of <hi>Seditious Fellows</hi> too? It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, but that those <hi>Holy Men</hi> very freely charged the <hi>Gentiles</hi> first, and then the <hi>Heretical Christians,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
                           <pb n="10" facs="tcp:36811:523"/>
and others, with <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And the Passages of those Writers, <hi>Justin Martyr, Origen, Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus, Tertullian, Cyprian, Athanasius, Greg. Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, Epiphanius, Theodoret,</hi> and others, have been too often alledged, to need a Repetition here. And which ought not to be forgot, at the time that they did this, their Emperours were themselves of that very <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which they so Accused. Now then, according to this <hi>Learned Gentleman,</hi> all these Holy <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> were even as bad as we; and <hi>Antiquity</hi> has been so sottish as to celebrate the <hi>Praises,</hi> and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to us the <hi>Examples</hi> of a long Series of <hi>Factious Fanaticks,</hi> who for their Rudeness to their <hi>Emperours,</hi> and <hi>Cannibal</hi> uncharitable <hi>Censures</hi> of their Brethren, justly deserv'd all the <hi>Torments</hi> and <hi>Persecutions</hi> that they underwent. But,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Because those that pretend the highest regard to the Authority of the Fathers, can yet easily except against it, when they are pressed with it, what will this Author say to that of the Apostles? It cannot reasonably be doubted but that St. <hi>Paul</hi> very well understood the true nature of <hi>Charity,</hi> who so often and earnestly recommended it to his Disciples; and that he was no Friend to any <hi>Seditious, Anti-monarchical</hi> Principles, I believe his 13th Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> will sufficiently demonstrate. Yet behold this very St. <hi>Paul</hi> charging the <hi>Emperours Religion</hi> as <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> exhorting all men to forsake it as such; and going up and down in all parts, preaching where-ever he came against it, on this account. And I desire this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to consider with himself what he can say in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this <hi>Holy Apostle,</hi> that shall not vindicate <hi>us</hi> too.</p>

So that now then upon the whole it appears, that out of an over-eager desire to <hi>Traduce</hi> us, this <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Author</hi> has in his <hi>Heat</hi> exposed all the <hi>Christians</hi> of the first three hundred years, the <hi>Catholicks</hi> of the following <hi>Centuries,</hi> nay the blessed <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, besides the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Reform'd Religion</hi> in this and the last Age, as the worst of <hi>Monsters,</hi> and such as deserve to be esteem'd any thing, rather than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                        <p>Let those, whose Cause he has so unfortunately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, consider this; and I am perswaded they will begin to grow <hi>asham'd</hi> of their Advocate. And how unjust soever they may esteem our <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet they will not say, it is such as cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd against them, without inspiring us at the same time with all the horrible impulses of <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity</hi> against themselves, and of Faction and Rebellion against the <hi>Government;</hi> which some men would insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate.</p>
                        <p>As for our selves, we earnestly beseech all those of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> against whom we at any time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance this <hi>Imputation,</hi> that they will as <hi>candidly</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our <hi>Arguments,</hi> as we can truly profess they are <hi>charitably</hi> proposed by Us; and whether they shall remain satisfied or not, that there is Reason in our <hi>Charge,</hi> yet to give us so much <hi>Credit</hi> with them at least, as to believe that we think there is; and shall be heartily glad to be convinced that we were mistaken in our <hi>Opinion.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>In which this Author's <hi>True</hi> and <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, and the Method laid down for a more <hi>particular Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Will now take it for granted, that under the shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so great an <hi>Authority</hi> as I have shewn to be equally concern'd with us, in all the scandalous impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that can be raised against our charging those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> I may venture to search a little more particularly into the nature of it, without being thought either a <hi>Cannibal</hi> or a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick,</hi> or to have any design of <hi>setting up a Standard</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 73, 74.</note> 
                           <hi>against the Monarchy,</hi> for my so doing; especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that I resolve not to encounter any <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Party</hi> of men in the <hi>World</hi> on this occasion, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew that this Man's <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though set off with such assurance as few Writers have ever equalled, is yet, after all, so far from being supported either by <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that it is indeed utterly repugnant to both. And therefore that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is only Vindicated by him from the Charge of an <hi>Idolatry</hi> that no man ever produced against her,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36811:524"/>
but for such <hi>Idolatry</hi> as we accuse her of, she may still fall under the weight of that, for any thing that has here been offer'd to the contrary.</p>
                        <p>According to this Author, <hi>Idolatry</hi> is neither more nor less than this: <hi>The Worship of the heavenly Bodies, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, or any other Visible and Corporeal Deity, as the Supream God, so as to exclude all Sense and Apprehension of a Spiritual and Invisible Godhead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From whence it follows, that to make a Man an <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later,</hi> these three things are required.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. That he cast off all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. That he believes there is no other <hi>Supream God</hi> than either the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> or some other the like <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corporeal parts of the World.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>3. That in pursuance of this Apprehension, he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships these Visible and Corporeal Deities as the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream God.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Now to exclude all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead,</hi> and to believe no other <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream God,</hi> but some <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corporeal</hi> part of the World, in opposition to a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> is, I think, to be an <hi>Atheist,</hi> though here is much ado to describe him. For to believe none but a <hi>Visible God,</hi> in opposition to an <hi>Invisible One,</hi> and to believe none but a <hi>Corporeal God,</hi> in opposition to a <hi>Spiritual God,</hi> is to believe no God at all; unless a man can sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>Supream God,</hi> without Understanding, or any Perfection whatsoever of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="14" facs="tcp:36811:525"/>
By consequence, for a man with these Apprehensions to worship this <hi>God</hi> which he has made to himself, is not well capable of any other construction, than that he takes some pains, and goes a little way about to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose all <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> to Contempt.</p>
                        <p>I would be very glad to understand our <hi>Author</hi>'s Notion of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and therefore if it were possible, I should be content that his <hi>Idolater</hi> should not be an <hi>Atheist</hi> for a while, that we might see what else we can make of him. For a man to take nothing else for the <hi>Supream God,</hi> but a certain <hi>Visible Being,</hi> from which he shuts out all <hi>Apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead,</hi> is certainly to be a downright <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist,</hi> though his <hi>Atheism</hi> might have been described in fewer words. And yet on the other side, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship something in good earnest as the <hi>Supream God,</hi> seems to imply that a man is not an <hi>Atheist:</hi> For an <hi>Atheist</hi> is one that does not so much as believe that there is a <hi>Supream God.</hi> But he surely <hi>believes</hi> a <hi>God,</hi> who worships any thing for the <hi>Supream God,</hi> whatever that be which he so worships.</p>
                        <p>Now if <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> were here, it would strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplex him to clear this matter. I do not mean to make good sense of the words, for that I take to be impossible, but to tell us by the words, what the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>'s drift should be. For they make up a <hi>Nonsense</hi> so very stiff, that it will not bend one way or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if I must understand something by every word that he says, I can have no more Notion of his <hi>Idolatry</hi> than I have of nothing. And if he had said, <hi>Idolatry</hi> is neither <hi>more</hi> nor <hi>less</hi> than <hi>Nothing,</hi> I had been as much edified as I am now. Unless he would give us to understand, that <hi>Idolatry</hi> is meer specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36811:525"/>
Madness, which no body that has common sense and understanding, can possibly be guilty of.</p>
                        <p>For all that part of the World that either is or ought to be out of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> and the like <hi>Hospitals,</hi> do by the <hi>Supream God,</hi> understand something at least, that is not only able to help or to hinder, but knows also when to do one and t'other, and is willing to do accordingly. And therefore to worship any thing as the <hi>Supream God,</hi> and at the same time <hi>to exclude all Sense and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of a Spiritual and Invisible Godhead,</hi> is to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship a thing because I am sure it knows something, while I take care to be as sure at the same time, that it knows nothing at all. I can compare this to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as I have already intimated, but to some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary instance of <hi>Madness.</hi> For instance: If I should ever see a man fall down upon his Knees, and seem in good earnest to ask Blessing of a Post, and to call it Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I should presently think of this <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> for his <hi>Idolater</hi> is rather more than less mad than he that fancies a <hi>Post</hi> to be his <hi>Father.</hi> For men in their Wits, have at least as high an Opinion of what they take to be their <hi>Supream God,</hi> as they have of their <hi>Parents:</hi> And therefore to worship that as the <hi>Supream God,</hi> which no less wants the Perfections of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Nature,</hi> than a <hi>Post</hi> does, is a Misfortune that cannot light upon any Body but a Mad man.</p>
                        <p>So that our <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>Idolater</hi> is a man whom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all the World must acknowledge to be out of his <hi>Wits,</hi> or if you put him into his <hi>Wits,</hi> he is a meer <hi>Atheist;</hi> though I am confident he would not have described himself so wittily, as this <hi>Author</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:36811:526"/>
This <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is to me so monstrous a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I am apt to look again and again into the Book, to see if the words be there in which he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd it. But when at last I find that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly there, I am taken with a new fear, that the <hi>Author</hi> did not <hi>mean</hi> what he <hi>says;</hi> and therefore that I do not understand <hi>his</hi> meaning, though I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the meaning of <hi>his words.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In such a Case as this, I have nothing to do, but to take another <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> which though it be not the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>only Notion</hi> of it, has yet plain sense, and comes as near to his, as a <hi>Notion</hi> that has <hi>Sense</hi> can come to one that has none. And it is this: That <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi> is the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corporeal Deity,</hi> as the <hi>Supream God,</hi> not so as to <hi>exclude</hi> all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead;</hi> but so as to suppose that as they are <hi>Visible Beings,</hi> so they have <hi>Invisible Natures</hi> too, and some <hi>Spiritual Perfections,</hi> which are indeed proper to the <hi>true God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now this Notion of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is, in <hi>one part</hi> of it, quite contrary to our <hi>Author's.</hi> For they who worship any <hi>Visible Deity</hi> as the <hi>Supream God,</hi> with this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that it has indeed <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> do not thereby <hi>exclude all Sense and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Spiritual and Invisible Godhead;</hi> because they have the <hi>Sense</hi> of such a <hi>Godhead</hi> in the <hi>Notion</hi> of that very thing which they <hi>worship.</hi> But though this is not the <hi>Idolatry</hi> which his Book speaks of, yet, as I said, 'tis the likest to it that I can think of. And if he does not mean what his Book says, 'tis a hunder'd to one but he means this.</p>
                        <p>But if I should be mistaken, 'tis no great matter;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36811:526"/>
for if I can but shew that this is not the <hi>only Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> it follows out of hand, that the <hi>Notion</hi> of his <hi>Book</hi> cannot possibly be so neither: So that one way or other I am sure to reach him, whether <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>Book</hi> have one meaning or two.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. According to this <hi>Notion</hi> then, those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Godhead,</hi> though they do worship the <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> but this only as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior</hi> and <hi>Subordinate Deities,</hi> cannot be <hi>Idolaters.</hi> And therefore if the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or the <hi>Chaldoeans,</hi> did believe <hi>One Supream God,</hi> and worshipped the <hi>Sun Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> upon the account of those <hi>Coelestial Spirits</hi> they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to reside in them, this worship was not <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In like manner, those <hi>Gentiles</hi> that worshipped any <hi>Corporeal Deity,</hi> or any thing <hi>Visible</hi> or <hi>Invisible</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> if they believed all the while that it was not the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> and did not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it as such, they I say could not be <hi>Idolaters.</hi> And therefore I think if the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were <hi>Idolaters</hi> in <hi>worshipping</hi> any of their <hi>Deities,</hi> it must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had no knowledge of the <hi>true God.</hi> So that either St. <hi>Paul</hi> or this <hi>Author</hi> was out in the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>only Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For though St. <hi>Paul</hi> accused the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet he confessed, that they <hi>knew God.</hi> For (says he) Though they knew God yet they glorified him not as God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If we do but interpret the <hi>Cautions</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> against <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by our <hi>Author's Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> they will be <hi>Paraphrased</hi> so as I believe they never were done before his time, and I suppose
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36811:527"/>
will never be after it. For instance; When St. <hi>Paul</hi> said to the <hi>Corinthian Christians, My dearly Beloved, flee from Idolatry;</hi> this was as much as if he had said, <q>
                              <hi>My dearly Beloved, Idolatry</hi> being neither <hi>more</hi> nor <hi>less</hi> than the <hi>Worship of the Heavenly Bodies,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Stars,</hi> or any Other <hi>Visible or Corporeal Deity as the Supreme God,</hi> I intreat and earnestly require you to <hi>Flee from Idolatry.</hi> And therefore though I do not bid you worship the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies,</hi> or their <hi>Images</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> yet I strictly charge you, not to worship them as the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God,</hi> or as if there were not an <hi>Invisible God</hi> above them All; if ever you should find it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to worship the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> or any <hi>Representation</hi> of them here below.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This would be an Admirable <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> and which I doubt not but our <hi>Author</hi> would be able to make good against all those that <hi>neither do, nor can, nor ought to understand</hi> these things. But whether our <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> are willing to come into this Number I think I need not say.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But because to <hi>Created Beings</hi> he afterwards adds <hi>Mortal Ones,</hi> of which more hereafter, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he means <hi>Reasonable Beings,</hi> let us see how things will go upon these <hi>new Terms.</hi> 
                           <q>
                              <hi>Dearly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,</hi> if ever you should worship <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> or such like men who died long since, still remember that they were once <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Mortal Men,</hi> and have a care not to worship them as the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I mention here only dead <hi>Heathens,</hi> there being yet no <hi>Christian Hero's</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time to whom any such worship was given, nor for some <hi>Ages</hi>
                           <pb n="19" facs="tcp:36811:527"/>
after. Now I think this will pass as little as the Other with <hi>Men</hi> that <hi>ought</hi> and <hi>do understand.</hi> For besides the barbarous Stuff which this <hi>Notion</hi> makes the <hi>Apostle</hi> to speak, it presses a meer <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> upon us; That the <hi>Apostle</hi> supposes it utterly impossible for a <hi>Christian</hi> that does not at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his whole <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Profession,</hi> to be guilty of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> certainly was a very deep man in hiding his purpose, if by intreating the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> to <hi>Flee from Idolatry,</hi> he meant no other thing than that they should not <hi>take</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> or the <hi>Moon,</hi> or some <hi>dead man,</hi> as the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God.</hi> And our <hi>Author</hi> is as deep a Man in finding out this hidden purpose of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> which till He arose no man was ever so happy as to do.</p>
                        <p>But indeed with all his <hi>Rhetorick</hi> he will never make <hi>himself</hi> and the <hi>Apostle</hi> of <hi>One mind</hi> in this matter. For thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> goes on: <q>
                              <hi>Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord and the Cup of Devils; Ye cannot be Partakers of the Lord's Table, and of the Table of Devils. Do we provoke the Lord to Jealousie? Are we stronger than He?</hi>
                           </q> Now if they who partake in <hi>Idolatrous Sacrifices</hi> are <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and if <hi>Idolaters</hi> have no <hi>Sense</hi> of a <hi>Supreme God,</hi> above the pretended <hi>Deities</hi> to whom they offer, they will not I conceive care one <hi>Jot</hi> whether they <hi>partake of the Lord's Table</hi> or not, nor be concerned about the <hi>Lord's Jealousie</hi> at all. And yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> plainly supposes, that if <hi>Christians</hi> should be guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> they would yet probably be concern'd about <hi>God's Jealousie,</hi> and desire to <hi>partake of the Lord's Table.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="20" facs="tcp:36811:528"/>
Thus when the same <hi>Apostle</hi> wrote to the very same <hi>Persons not to keep Company, no nor so much as to eat with One called a</hi> Brother, <hi>if he were a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, or Covetous, or an IDOLATER, or a Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or a Drunkard.</hi> I cannot but wonder what an <hi>Idolater</hi> has to do in this Company, if this <hi>Author's Idolater,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul's Idolater</hi> were the same <hi>Idolater.</hi> For whatsoever the <hi>Fornicator,</hi> or <hi>Covetous,</hi> or <hi>Railer,</hi> or <hi>Drunkard,</hi> might pretend for a Title to <hi>Brotherhood;</hi> I am yet certain, that he is fallen even from all right to that <hi>Name,</hi> who <hi>worships</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> (for instance) as the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> and so renounces <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Maker</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and the Father of our <hi>Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of his <hi>Idolater</hi> as One within the <hi>Church,</hi> and One of those wicked Persons that were to be cast out of the <hi>Civil</hi> as well as the <hi>Religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of it. But if there be no <hi>Idolater</hi> besides this <hi>Author's Idolater,</hi> who has renounced the <hi>Maker</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and lost all <hi>Apprehension</hi> of him, he has prevented the <hi>Apostle's</hi> direction, and is out of the <hi>Church</hi> by his own <hi>Act.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. These things do, I confess, give me a great <hi>Prejudice</hi> against this <hi>Author's true and only Notion of Idolatry.</hi> And there is one thing which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve will make him less fond of it <hi>himself,</hi> when he comes to consider it; and that is, that his <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> does by no means suit with the <hi>Sense</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> to which he designed a good Turn in all this. It is very well known how the <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> to Vindicate their <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> from being <hi>Parallel</hi> to what the <hi>Gentiles</hi> heretofore paid
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36811:528"/>
to theirs, did, among other Differences, lay down this for one: <q>
                              <hi>That they do not believe any Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or Vertue to be in them, for which they ought to be Worshipped.</hi>
                           </q> For to believe this, their <hi>Catechism</hi> tells us, is to make the <hi>Images</hi> become <hi>Idols,</hi> and by consequence, the <hi>Worship</hi> of them to be <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Now if it be <hi>Idolatry</hi> to worship <hi>Images</hi> with such an <hi>Opinion,</hi> then it cannot be the <hi>only Notion</hi> of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> to <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> or any <hi>Corporeal Deity, as the Supream God,</hi> or their <hi>Images</hi> as the <hi>Images</hi> of a pretended <hi>Supreme God:</hi> For without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of all this, one may believe <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> to be in <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> them upon that account.</p>
                        <p>For Example: The <hi>Heathens</hi> had a mighty O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> after his Death, that in his <hi>Temples,</hi> and by his <hi>Images,</hi> he could cure Diseases. Let us suppose now a Person to fall <hi>down</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> one of these <hi>Images,</hi> in hopes of some <hi>Divine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> coming thence. Were this Worship <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or not? If it were not, then was the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> to blame, to make this an instance of the <hi>Gentiles' Idolatry;</hi> if it were, then in the opinion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> the account of <hi>Idolatry</hi> which this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> has given, cannot be the <hi>only Notion</hi> of it: For this was neither the Worshipping of any <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Deity,</hi> as the <hi>Supream God,</hi> nor of any <hi>Corporeal Image</hi> of the <hi>Supream God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, In all the Accounts which the <hi>Missionaries</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have given us of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Nations</hi> where they have come, we find them generally acknowledging a <hi>Supream, Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead.</hi> And that if they worship the Sun,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36811:529"/>
Moon, or Stars, it is not that they esteem them to be meer Visible and Corporeal Deities, much less think them to be the <hi>Supream God, so as to exclude all sense and apprehension of a Spiritual and Invisible God above them;</hi> but they worship them either as inferiour Deities, to whom God has committed the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> under him; or they look upon <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>Soul of the World,</hi> and that therefore the <hi>parts</hi> of it deserve <hi>Honour</hi> upon that account: or finally, they esteem <hi>God</hi> to be of so great <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Excellency,</hi> that He is above their <hi>service,</hi> and that therefore they ought to pay their <hi>External Adoration</hi> to somewhat <hi>below him.</hi> Now I shall leave it to this <hi>Author</hi> to consider up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what <hi>grounds,</hi> according to his <hi>True and Only Notion of Idolatry,</hi> he will charge these men with this <hi>Guilt;</hi> or if out of his great <hi>Charity</hi> he shall think fit generously to acquit them of it, I will then send him to some of his Friends of the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> for better Instruction.</p>
                        <p>These and many other <hi>Reasons,</hi> that I might add, occur to me upon the very first view only, to make me suspect his <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> But now when I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it more particularly, I find it yet more gross and unreasonable. The sum of what he offers for it, is an <hi>Historical Deduction</hi> of the State of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> compar'd with the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that are given of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Ancient,</hi> especially the <hi>Eastern Nations,</hi> 
                           <q>Who acknowledged <note place="margin">Pag. 99, 100.</note> no other Deities, but the Stars, among whom the Sun was Supream; in opposition to which false Principle, <hi>Rabbi Maimon</hi> says, God enacted the <hi>Law of Moses.</hi> And according to this <hi>Law,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36811:529"/>
That Idolatry is giving the Worship of the <note place="margin">Pag. 80, 81.</note> 
                              <hi>Supream God</hi> to any <hi>Created, Corporeal,</hi> or <hi>Visible Deity,</hi> or any thing that can be represented by an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> which nothing but <hi>Corporeal</hi> Beings can; and to suppose <hi>such a Being</hi> the <hi>Supream Deity,</hi> is the only <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Idolatry.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In opposition to which positive <hi>Conclusion,</hi> I will content my self at present to say, that there is not one word of truth in it; for that neither was the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Eastern Nations,</hi> such as he pretends, nor the <hi>Nature of Idolatry</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> what he represents it to have been. And to the end I may plainly clear this whole matter, I will distinctly shew three things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of those Nations whom he mentions, the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> &amp;c. did not consist in Worshipping the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> as the <hi>Supream God; So as to exclude all sense</hi> and <hi>apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual and Invisible Godhead. Nor therefore,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Was this the <hi>only Idolatry</hi> forbidden to the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Law.</hi> But</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That as the <hi>Jews</hi> retaining both the <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>God of Israel,</hi> were yet guilty of Idolatry for worshipping him after a <hi>gentile manner,</hi> so may <hi>Christians</hi> be now.</p>
                        <p>And therefore that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> may justly be charged by us as <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> though we do not pretend in any wise to say either that she worships the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> or any other <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corporeal Deity</hi> as the Supream God; or that she has
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36811:530"/>
lost all <hi>Apprehension of a Spiritual and Invisible God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus having established the <hi>true Notion</hi> of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> I shall last of all consider such <hi>Objections</hi> as may be necessary to be replied to for the clearing of it; and so leave the <hi>particular Charges</hi> to be made good by those who shall have occasion so to do.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Heathens;</hi> especially, of the <hi>Chaldeans, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Persians;</hi> and that it did not consist in their Worshipping the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> or any other <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Deity, as the Supreme God;</hi> so as to exclude all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Apprehension</hi> of a Spiritual and Invisible Godhead.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>THis is the <hi>Fundamental mistake</hi> of our <hi>Author</hi> concerning his <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and which being overthrown, his whole <hi>Hypothesis</hi> built upon it, must fall together with it. For thus it is that he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues: <note place="margin">P. 80.</note> 
                           <q>God designed by his <hi>Law,</hi> to preserve the <hi>Jews</hi> from falling into the Idolatry of the Nations round about them: Against this, we find not only all its <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">P. 102.</note> but even the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of it, to have been directed. But the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of those Nations was no other than the <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> or of some the like <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corporeal Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">P. 97, 100.</note> so as to exclude all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead.</hi> And therefore this must be the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>only</hi> Notion of it in the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:36811:531"/>
I shall hereafter more fully shew the weakness of this <hi>Proof,</hi> when I come to demonstrate, That there were two sorts of <hi>Idolatry</hi> mention'd in those <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> extreamly different the one from the other. And therefore that tho this were the <hi>true</hi> Notion of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> in one respect, yet it would not follow that it was the <hi>only Notion,</hi> by reason of the other. And this I shall do in the <hi>next Chapter.</hi> My business at present is to shew, That what he has thus Confidently laid down, is so far from being the <hi>only Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that it is indeed no <hi>Notion</hi> of it at all; for that those very <hi>Heathens</hi> whom he insists upon for his Warrant in this matter, were not guilty of such an <hi>Idolatry</hi> as he pretends they were.</p>
                        <p>We have already seen his <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that <note place="margin">P. 74.</note> it is neither more nor less than this: <q>
                              <hi>The Worship of the Heavenly Bodies, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, or any other Visible and Corporeal Deity, as the Supreme God, so as to exclude all Sense and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Spiritual and Invisible Godhead.</hi>
                           </q> This he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends is the only Scripture Notion of it. <q>
                              <hi>And thus</hi>

                              <hi>ever understood the old Notion of Idolatry, till this last Age, when Folly and Passion cast it at any thing that peevish Men were angry with. So</hi> Rabbi Mamion, <hi>the most Learned and Judicious of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Doctors Discourses at large, That the Ancient Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry was nothing but the Religion of the</hi> Eastern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>who acknowledg no other Deities but the Stars,</hi>

                        <p n="1">I. That as to this <hi>latter sort</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> seeing he has declin'd the Consideration of it, as being of too young a date to found the <hi>Scripture Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> upon it, I shall not insist upon it; tho I am by no means satisfied, either in his account of its <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or that it was <hi>a meer Invention of the vain and lying</hi> Greeks. For</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It has been the Opinion of very Learned Men, that this kind of <hi>Idolatry</hi> was practised in <hi>Egypt</hi> soon after the Flood. And that the most Ancient <hi>Osiris,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">See <hi>Vossius</hi> de Idol. l. 1. c. 27.</note> was no other than <hi>Mitzraim,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> whom they worshipped together with his Father, and from whom the whole Country is in <hi>Scripture</hi> called by his <hi>Name.</hi> In the cv. <hi>Psalm</hi> 23. it is expresly stiled, <hi>the Land of Cham:</hi> And <hi>Plutarch</hi> informs us, that in the <note place="margin">

And that which makes this the more likely is, that in the Division of the World among the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. x. <hi>Arabia</hi> fell to the Lot of <hi>Cham;</hi> and in that <hi>Chush</hi> his eldest Son fixed himself, from whence the Country is called, <hi>the Land

of Cush,</hi> in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xix. 9. And then it may easily be conceiv'd that his second Son <hi>Mitzraim,</hi> should go into the next adjoyning Country, the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Now if this be so, then it follows, not only that this sort of <hi>Idolatry</hi> was much more Ancient than is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but that being practised in <hi>Egypt</hi> before the Children of <hi>Israels</hi> going down thither; it may be reasonably enough allow'd a sufficient Antiquity for us to derive something from it of the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> with reference to the times under debate.

And in the very Scripture it self, <hi>Joseph</hi> is either call'd, or at least compar'd to an <hi>Ox,</hi> Deut. xxxiii. 17. And some of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> have given this account of the very <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> that they were the Symbols of <hi>Joseph,</hi> set up by him in Honour of his Ancestors, from a part of whose <hi>Tribe, viz.</hi> that of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he was himself descended.</p>
                        <p>Here it were an easie matter to multiply Proofs upon this occasion, to shew that the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of Consecrating <hi>Heroes</hi> into Gods, and Worshipping them as such, is by no means of so fresh a date, as this <hi>Author</hi> would have it thought to be. For what he adds, <hi>That</hi>

                              <hi>giving the Worship of the Supreme God, not only to Created, but to Mortal Beings:</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>I answer, 1. That this is evidently contrary to all the accounts we have of their Worship; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which it appears, that the Heathens paid no other Worship to their <hi>Divi,</hi> or <hi>deified Men,</hi> than what the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day does to her <hi>Saints;</hi> but as carefully distinguish'd between the Adoration of <hi>the Supreme God,</hi> and these <hi>Heroes,</hi> as the other do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Him,</hi> and those <hi>Blessed Men</hi> that <hi>Reign together with Him,</hi> as their Language tells us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whenever this Idolatry came in, 'tis evident that the very nature of it utterly overthrows his <hi>Only No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> before laid down; unless he supposes that they thought their <hi>Heroes,</hi> whom whilst they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they knew to be but <hi>men,</hi> born into the World after the common order of Nature, and even dying after the same manner as all others, became after Death the <hi>Supreme God</hi> that made <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> and believed all this so firmly, as not only to give the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:36811:533"/>
of the <hi>Supreme God</hi> to them, but to exclude all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Apprehension</hi> of any <hi>God</hi> above them. For so <hi>(he</hi> says) a man must do, before he can be guilty of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if this be his Opinion, I would then ask this <hi>Learned Antiquary</hi> one small <hi>Question:</hi> Seeing the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their <hi>Heroes</hi> was very great, whom the same Persons at the same time worshipped; Did they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every one of these to be the <hi>Supreme God</hi> that made <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and give the highest <hi>Divine Honour</hi> accordingly unto every one of them as such? That they did this, no man of Sense will either say or believe; and yet if they did not, the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>only Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is at an end; for which ever of their <hi>Heroes</hi> they believed to be the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> and <hi>Worshipped</hi> as such, they must have Adored the rest only as <hi>Inferior Deities,</hi> and with an <hi>Honour</hi> suitable to their <hi>Apprehensions</hi> of them.</p>
                        <p>Either therefore he must quit his <hi>true</hi> and <hi>only No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Idolatry, which he tells us is <hi>neither more nor less</hi> than, <q>The Worship of the <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> the <note place="margin">Page 74.</note> 
                              <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Stars,</hi> or any other <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corporeal Deity,</hi> as the Supreme God, so as to exclude all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>invisible Godhead;</hi>
                           </q> or he must give us some assurance that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (for instance) worshipping of <hi>Joseph</hi> under the <hi>Symbol</hi> of an <hi>Ox,</hi> did believe him to be the <hi>Supreme Deity,</hi> so as to exclude all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>apprehension</hi> of any <hi>Superior Godhead,</hi> and did worship him accordingly; that is, that those men were so sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish as to think that a man who had <hi>lived</hi> and <hi>died</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, was the <hi>Great God</hi> that framed the world, and all things in it, many Ages before himself had any <hi>Being.</hi> But</p>

II. To come to the <hi>Other,</hi> and (as he supposes) the more Ancient <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and in his Notion of which, I affirm him to have been utterly mistaken: And here I must observe, that it is not at all doubted, but that these <hi>Heathens</hi> did Worship the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars;</hi> that which I pretend is, that this <hi>Author</hi> is very much out in the Account which he gives of their <hi>Worship</hi> of them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He affirms, That they worshipped these <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies</hi> as <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corporeal Deities,</hi> so as to <note place="margin">Page 74.</note> exclude all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Godhead:</hi> Whereas on the contrary, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved these <hi>very Bodies themselves</hi> to be animated by <hi>Celestial Spirits</hi> who resided in them, and rendred them thereby proper <hi>Objects</hi> of their Adoration.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That they worshipped these <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Deities, as the <hi>Supreme God;</hi> whereas they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly acknowledged a <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead, superior</hi> to them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That they worshipp'd no <hi>other Gods</hi> but these, <note place="margin">Page 97, 100.</note> and amongst these the <hi>Sun</hi> as <hi>supreme;</hi> when on the contrary it is certain, even from the very <hi>Authors</hi> that himself produces, that they worshipp'd <hi>other Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> both <hi>Heroes</hi> and <hi>Doemons,</hi> of which this Man yet pretends with so much assurance, that <hi>they had no Notion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And all these are not only <hi>gross Errors</hi> for an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> who writes with such Confidence as if he would be thought to have been <hi>initiated</hi> into all the <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of which he discourses, but such as utterly ruin all that he has to say to support his true and only Notion of Idolatry. But I must examine these Points more particularly. And</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:36811:534"/>
1. <q>That these <hi>Nations</hi> did not worship the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bodies</hi> as <hi>Visible</hi> and <hi>Corporeal Deities,</hi> so as to exclude all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>apprehension</hi> of a Spiritual and invisible <hi>Godhead.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is an Assertion not only so monstrously absurd in its self, but so contrary to all the Accounts we have from <hi>Antiquity,</hi> of the <hi>Theology</hi> of those <hi>Nations</hi> to which he refers us, that I must once more confess, that I never lay under a greater Temptation to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my own <hi>Senses,</hi> or to suspect my understanding of plain words than now: On the one hand, I am sure our <hi>Author</hi> here defines <hi>Idolatry</hi> to be, <q>The Worship of the <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the <hi>Stars,</hi> or some other visible and <hi>Corporeal Deity,</hi> not only as the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> but <hi>so</hi> at to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>apprehension</hi> of a Spiritual and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Godhead:</hi>
                           </q> That is to say, that he who is an <hi>Idolater</hi> must worship them as mere <hi>Corporeal Parts</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> void of all <hi>Understanding;</hi> for so I think Visible and <hi>Corporeal Gods</hi> must be taken, when oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>apprehension</hi> of a Spiritual and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible <hi>Godhead.</hi> And yet on the other hand, how to reconcile such a <hi>Paradox</hi> with either the <hi>common Reason</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> as I have observed before; or the clear Evidences of the <hi>Gentile World</hi> to the contrary, as I observe now, I am not able to comprehend: But let our <hi>Author</hi> take his choice; for I will here again do more than I need, rather than be thought to omit any thing that was fit to be taken notice of. If he thinks good to own this Notion, I will then offer what may serve to confute it; but if being admonished of the <hi>Absurdity</hi> of it, he shall chuse rather to wrest his words to some other meaning than they naturally bear, I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36811:534"/>
shall only have spent some little time in <hi>confuting</hi> that, which if he does not, I am certain no body else will ever <hi>affirm.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And to begin where himself does, with the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> not only the most certain, but the most Ancient <hi>History</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He produces indeed a few Texts from whence it may be concluded, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> of old, did worship the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars;</hi> but that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped them (according to his Notion) as <hi>Corporeal Deities,</hi> and so as to <hi>exclude all sense and apprehension of a Spiritual and Invisible Godhead;</hi> for this he has not so much as offer'd at one single Proof.</p>
                        <p>For 1. As to his first Instance, (and which indeed <note place="margin">Page 77.</note> is the first account we have) of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 'tis true, tells us that <hi>Terah, Abraham</hi>'s Father, worshipped <hi>Strange Gods;</hi> but that these <hi>Gods</hi> were Corporeal Deities, and that they worshipp'd them so as to exclude all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead,</hi> of this there is not a word: See <hi>Josh.</hi> xxiv. 2. and I shall presently shew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                        <p>If we go on with him to the next (and as he thinks <note place="margin">Page 78.</note> the first plain) intimation we find of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine,</hi>

                           </q> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here shall we find our <hi>Author</hi>'s notion so much as insinuated, but as I will now prove, much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. It is not to be doubted, but that these Gods were the same that they worshipped in <hi>Syria</hi> when they

                           </q> Now this plainly shews that <hi>Laban</hi> lookt upon his <hi>Father's God</hi> (and who was also the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Tera</hi> before-mentioned, <hi>Josh.</hi> xxiv. 2.) not to be a mere <hi>Corporeal Deity,</hi> but as having an <hi>Intellectual Being</hi> incorporated in it, that was both capable of hearing their <hi>Oath,</hi> and of judging betwixt them, and without which he could never have called him to witness their Contract.</p>

                        <p>Thus this <hi>Author,</hi> and still, as becomes himself, he pronounces, <hi>Dictator-</hi>like, and is alway in the wrong; for the Question is not about the name of <hi>Zabii</hi> (which from henceforth must signifie <hi>Easterlings,</hi> tho the Learned Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi> had collected no less than <hi>five several significations</hi> of it, and every one supported by probable <hi>Conjectures);</hi> but about the <hi>People,</hi> or <note place="margin">De Legib.

                        <p>As for the point before us; we are told that they <note place="margin">Spencer ib. p. 237, 238.</note> worshipped the <hi>Host of Heaven,</hi> supposing the Stars to be animated by <hi>Divine Understandings.</hi> Dr. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock</hi> adds, <q>That they lookt upon the <hi>Planets,</hi> as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators <note place="margin">Not. in spec.

                        </p>
                        <p>Now these are all plain and rational Accounts, why they should worship these <hi>Heavenly Bodies;</hi> but to talk of their worshipping the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> as Visible and <hi>Corporeal Deities,</hi> and that so as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Apprehension</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead,</hi> is to represent their Worship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary not only to <hi>Truth,</hi> but to <hi>common Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> too.

                        <p>As to the <hi>Egyptians, Jamblicus</hi> informs us, That <note place="margin">Jamblic. de Myster.

                        </p>
                        <p>But it may be said, That these were <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and endeavour'd to make the best of their <hi>Idolatry.</hi> I answer, That <hi>Jamblicus</hi> declares, he delivers nothing <note place="margin">Jambl. de My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.

                        <p>If from both these Nations we pass finally to the <hi>Persians, Jac.

                        <p>And now, after so many plain Testimonies in this matter, were it yet needful to look into any <hi>other Countries,</hi> we should find the Case to be every where the same. <hi>Pliny</hi> pleads much for the Divinity of the <note place="margin">Pliny l. 2. c. 6.</note>

                        <p>I have enlarged my self the more on this part of Antiquity, because the <hi>Persians,</hi> if any, must have been found to worship the <hi>Sun,</hi> as the <hi>Supreme God.</hi> I shall be very short in other Nations, and so close this Consideration.</p>

And for what concerns the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> I have already given some Account of their <hi>Theology;</hi> and we may learn from thence, how it came to pass, that the <hi>Sun</hi> (whom none of the <hi>Heathens</hi> looked upon as absolutely the <hi>supreme</hi> and <hi>highest Being)</hi> is yet so often spoken of by them as such. For as <hi>Jamblicus</hi> informs us out of <note place="margin">See before.</note> the old <hi>Egyptian</hi> Books, they believ'd <hi>one Supreme God above all,</hi> next him the <hi>Demiurgus,</hi> and then <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or the <hi>Sun;</hi> whom they esteem'd the <hi>Supreme Visible God,</hi> and as he who had the Super-intendency over the visible World. To which I will add the Authority of <hi>Prophyry,</hi> and that the rather for that in his Epistle to <note place="margin">Euseb. pr. Ev. lib. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Anebo,</hi> he seems to suspect that the old <hi>Egyptians</hi> look'd no farther than the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars.</hi> But 'tis plain that this was only a difficulty, which he puts to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest; since himself owns that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the <hi>Creator,</hi> whom they call'd <hi>Cneph,</hi> with an Egg in his <hi>Mouth,</hi> to signifie the Production of the World; and of which the <hi>Sun</hi> is but a Part.</p>
                        <p>And here I may not omit another Notion of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and which was not theirs only; and from whence we may again know how to understand those <note place="margin">Porphyr. de Abst. l. 2. Sect. 34.</note> who seem to represent the <hi>Sun</hi> as the <hi>Supreme Deity.</hi> It was a Principle in their <hi>Theology,</hi> that the <hi>Supreme God</hi> of all, is not to be worshipped by any <hi>External and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible thing, not so much as by Vocal Prayer, but only by pure Silence and Contemplation:</hi> But that Sacrifices and <hi>Hymns were to be made to Powers inferior to Him.</hi> Among these they esteemed the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> to be the chief; from whence it was obvious enough to mistake, that because these were the <hi>highest Deities,</hi> to whom they paid any <hi>External Adoration,</hi> therefore they had no other superior to them.</p>

And now there remains only the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> to be consider'd; and of these, both <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius Abulfarajus</hi> and <hi>Sharestanius,</hi> cited by our <note place="margin">Not. in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cim. Hist. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rab. p. 143.</note> Learned Dr. <hi>Pocock,</hi> gives us Accounts very different from that of <hi>Maimonides</hi> before mention'd; and that <hi>Judicious</hi> and <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> justly esteems the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of <hi>Abulfarajus,</hi> preferrable to <hi>R. Maimon</hi>'s, for that he was better acquainted with their Writings, and read them in their own Language, which the other did not. And if what <hi>Sharestanius</hi> reports be true, That it was their Principle, that between the Supreme God <hi>and</hi> Us, <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 140.</note> 
                           <hi>there must be some</hi> Mediators; this again will furnish us with yet <hi>another Reason,</hi> why the <hi>Sun</hi> may easily have been mistaken for their <hi>Supreme Deity,</hi> because he was the principal <hi>Mediator</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and them, and the Highest to which they paid any immediate <hi>External Adoration.</hi> And tho this <hi>Author</hi> is as posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as if he had all the Evidence in the World for it, <q>
                              <hi>That God made an extraordinary Discovery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>

                           </q> by which he would imply that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in those days did not suppose <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>Lord of all things;</hi> yet is it (like the rest of his Book) all Imagination, without any thing to support it. For indeed we have all the reason in the World to believe that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had at this time the knowledg of the <hi>one true God.</hi> 1. It appears by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Computation, that <hi>Shem,</hi> from whom <hi>Tera</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were descended, was yet living with them, and it is altogether unaccountable, either that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self should have lost the knowledg of the <hi>one true Supreme God;</hi> or that if he retain'd it, all the rest of his Family should have been utterly ignorant of it.

2.

In all the History of <hi>God</hi>'s calling <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> we do not find any thing to make us believe that God was pleased to make the discovery of himself to him, as <hi>Lord of all things,</hi> in opposition to the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of his Family. 4. It is hard to suppose, that when all the barbarous Nations, as we have seen, preserv'd the Notion of the True, Supreme <hi>God,</hi> only these <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> should lose it; it was but on the other side the River, that we find the knowledg of <hi>God</hi> preserv'd in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And lastly, we do certainly know, that but two Generations after <hi>Laban,</hi> tho he did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (as it is said of <hi>Tera)</hi>

                        <p>I shall close all with a passage of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which will at once shew both that the Heathens had a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg <note place="margin">Plutarch de I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side &amp; Osiride.</note> of the <hi>Supreme God</hi> amongst them, and that it was <hi>He</hi> whom they all every where <hi>Adored</hi> as such, however differing in their <hi>Manners</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> from one another: <q>
                              <hi>No inanimate thing can be a God to men; but they who bestow upon us a continual supply of what is sufficient for us, have therefore been esteemed Gods by us; which Gods are not different among diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Nations, as if the</hi> Barbarians <hi>and</hi> Greeks, <hi>the</hi> Southern <hi>and</hi> Northern <hi>People had not the same God; but as the Sun, and Moon, and Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, are common to all, but are called differently by different men; so tho there be but</hi> ONE WORD, <hi>or</hi> REASON, <hi>ordering all those things, and but</hi> ONE PROVIDENCE <hi>dispensing all things, and the Inferior Powers which are appointed over all, having had several Names and Honours from several Persons, and by the Laws of several Countries, have been every where wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp'd throughout the whole World.</hi>

I have already shewn in opposition to this suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had their <hi>Divi,</hi> or <hi>Canonized men</hi> presently after the <hi>Flood;</hi> and that we have some reason to believe their principal <hi>Deities,</hi> viz. <hi>Apis</hi> and <hi>Osyris,</hi> to have been such; I will now add, that the first <hi>Dynasties</hi> of <hi>Manetho,</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> and Demi-Gods upon Earth, confirms this, and to which the old <hi>Egyptian Chronicon</hi> in <hi>Syncellus</hi> adds yet more force.

                              <hi>The Gauls,</hi> says he, <hi>are very superstitious, and therefore if they fall into any dangerous distemper, or are concerned in War, or in any other danger, they straightway sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For this purpose they have their particular Gods;</hi> Mercury <hi>to prosper them in their Journeys, or help them in their Traffick;</hi> Apollo <hi>to cure them in their sickness; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva to find out any Artificial Works;</hi> Mars <hi>for War,</hi> &amp;c.</q> And this our <hi>Author</hi> could not but know, since in the very Passage to which he refers, he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the <hi>Germans</hi> to them; the <hi>Germans</hi> (says he) differ much from <hi>this custom (viz.)</hi> of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> which he had just before recounted; for they esteem them only for <hi>Gods</hi> whom they see, and by whom they are manifestly help'd, the <hi>Sun, Vulcan,</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36811:546"/>
Either, <hi>1st,</hi> That they worshipp'd the <hi>true God</hi> by <hi>Corporeal</hi> and Visible Symbols; or that <hi>2dly,</hi> together with the true <hi>God,</hi> they worshipp'd other <hi>inferior Deities;</hi> whether <hi>Intelligences,</hi> (which they supposed to reside in the <hi>Heavenly Bodies)</hi> or <hi>Daemons.</hi> And that by consequence,</p>
                        <p>To Worship the <hi>Supreme God</hi> in any Corporeal Representation or <hi>Image</hi> whatsoever; or to pay <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship</hi> to any <hi>Created Being,</hi> whether <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>separate Soul;</hi> either as having the Power over this <hi>inferior World</hi> to Administer things in it, or as <hi>Mediators</hi> between the <hi>Supreme God</hi> and <hi>Us;</hi> this is, if not the <hi>only,</hi> yet at least a <hi>true Notion</hi> of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi>

                        <argument>
                           <p>Of the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> under the <hi>Law;</hi> and that it did not Consist in the giving the worship of the <hi>Supreme God</hi> to some <hi>Created, Corporeal</hi> or <hi>Visible Deity</hi> as <hi>supposing</hi> it to be the <hi>Supreme God.</hi>
                           </p>

                        <p>THis was the next <hi>point</hi> I proposed to examine, and our <hi>Author</hi> thus delivers his <hi>Opinion</hi> of it. <q>That according to the <hi>Law, Idolatry</hi> is giving <note place="margin">Page 80.</note> the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Supreme God</hi> to any <hi>created, corporeal,</hi> or <hi>visible deity,</hi> or any thing that can be <hi>represented</hi> by an <hi>image,</hi> which nothing but <hi>corporeal Beings</hi> can, and to suppose such a <hi>Being</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Pag. 81.</note> the <hi>Supreme Deity.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>And though there may seem to be <hi>two sorts</hi> of it. First, either to <hi>worship</hi> a <hi>material and created Being</hi> as the <hi>Supreme Deity,</hi> or Secondly to ascribe any <hi>corporeal Form</hi> or <hi>Shape</hi> to the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> yet in the result both are but One; for to ascribe unto the <hi>Supreme God</hi> any <hi>Corporeal Form,</hi> is the same thing as to worship a <hi>Created Being,</hi> for so is every <hi>Corporeal Substance.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This is, I say, the <hi>TRUE</hi> and <hi>ONELY Notion</hi> of Idolatry.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This indeed is <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Magisterial,</hi> and would almost dispose a man to think, that there should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be at least <hi>something</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> where there is so <hi>very much confidence.</hi> But we have had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36811:547"/>
already sufficient reason to suspect him, where he seems least to suspect himself. Here I cannot but wonder that a person of his <hi>Character</hi> should send abroad such <hi>Notions</hi> into the world for the <hi>Dictates</hi> of <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as are evidently contrary to the Tenor of it; unless he thought our <hi>Nobility and Gentry</hi> as little acquainted with that <hi>Book,</hi> as some of their <hi>Guides</hi> are said to have thought it fit they should be.</p>
                        <p>To make a man an <hi>Idolater</hi> according to the <hi>Idea</hi> this <hi>Author</hi> has given of it, two things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which I much question whether they ever yet concurred in any considerable number of men in the world, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. That he give the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Supreme God</hi> to some <hi>Created, Corporeal,</hi> and <hi>Visible</hi> part of the Universe.</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>2dly,</hi> That he give this <hi>worship</hi> to it as esteeming such a Being to be the <hi>Supreme God.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I will not be so rude as to enquire by what <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Discourse</hi> he infers all this from the <hi>Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that because <hi>God</hi> there forbids the <hi>Israelites</hi> to make any <q>
                              <hi>Graven Image, the likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath or in the water under the Earth; to bow down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it and worship it;</hi>
                           </q> therefore, this <hi>Image</hi> must be the <hi>similitude of some visible and Corporeal deity;</hi> and that <hi>Deity</hi> be supposed to be the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> and be <hi>worshiped</hi> as such. He that can infer this from the Second Commandment, would doe well to tell us how he does it. But not to be importunate here. If this be the <hi>true and onely Idolatry,</hi> according to the Law, I would desire to know;</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="59" facs="tcp:36811:547"/>
                           <hi>First,</hi> Seeing the <hi>Law</hi> was deliver'd by the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> and these were no <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real deities;</hi> what if the <hi>Jews</hi> had paid <hi>Divine Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> to them? would this have been <hi>Idolatry</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law? If it would, I should be glad to know what <hi>part</hi> of his <hi>definition</hi> it is that makes it to be so?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have before shewn that the ancient <hi>Heathens,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians, Chaldeans,</hi> &amp;c. though they <hi>worshiped</hi> indeed the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars;</hi> yet they neither <hi>believed</hi> them to be the <hi>Supreme God</hi> nor the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Supreme God;</hi> nor that they were onely <hi>visible,</hi> and <hi>Corporeal deities:</hi> They look'd upon them as the <hi>vehicles</hi> of <hi>Celestial Spirits,</hi> which dwelt in them; and as such they pay'd their <hi>Adoration</hi> to them. Now then was this <hi>Idolatry</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> or was it not? If it were not, how came the <hi>Israelites</hi> to be charged with <hi>Idolatry</hi> (according to this <hi>Author's</hi> own <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples)</hi> for joyning with them in this <hi>Service?</hi> If it were, how will this agree with his <hi>true and onely Notion of Idolatry?</hi> Seeing they worship'd these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies neither as the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> nor so as to exclude all <hi>sense and apprehension of a spiritual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible deity.</hi> But,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To come to the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> it self we read 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. that <hi>Soloman</hi> in his old age turned away his Heart, and worshiped <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>other Gods,</hi> viz. <hi>Ashtoreth,</hi> and <hi>Milcom,</hi> and <hi>Chemosh,</hi> and <hi>Moloch,</hi> i. e. according to this <hi>Learned Man's Notion,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and I suppose he will not deny that herein he committed <hi>Idolatry.</hi> But now can any one believe that <hi>Solomon</hi> who had been so well instructed in the knowledge of the <hi>Lord
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36811:548"/>
God of Israel;</hi> he to whom God had <hi>twice himself</hi>

                           <hi>appeared;</hi> and whom he had endu'd with <hi>wisedom</hi> above all the men upon the Earth; finally who had not so long since built him a magnificent <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> where the Service of the true God was continued, even whilst he worshiped the Gods of his Wives. Can any one, I say, be so stupid as to believe that this <hi>Solomon</hi> gave the worship of the <hi>Supreme God</hi> to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them to be the <hi>Supreme deities,</hi> and that he did not onely not worship but likewise not so much as believe the onely supreme God? And yet this we must say, if we will allow this <hi>Author</hi> to have given us the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>onely notion of Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Besides it is certain that whilst he was engaged in his Idolatrous worship, God did not utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him, but admonished him of it and threatned him with the loss of his Kingdom for serving strange Gods, which is inducement enough to conclude that he had still an apprehension of the True God. If <hi>Solomon</hi> did immediately upon this admonition give over his Impious worship, it shewed evidently that he retained the knowledge of that God who had twice appeared to him. For to suppose that he had quite lost all sense and apprehension of him just when he fell to Idolatry, and just recovered some sense of him upon this admonition, and that all the while between, he believed his <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal deities,</hi> or some one of them to be the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> and had no sense of him who is truely so, is to make <hi>Solomon</hi> almost such a man as I before shewed our <hi>Author</hi>'s Idolater to be according to the meaning of his words: I am
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36811:548"/>
sure it is not to make him one of the wisest men that ever was in the World. But supposing that <hi>Solomon</hi> went on for some time after this to worship his strange Gods, yet he must now at least have recovered some Sense of the <hi>true God,</hi> it being this admonition in all likelyhood, that sooner or later brought him to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: And then our Author's Principles do from that time that he was admonish'd, acquit <hi>Solomon</hi> of all <hi>Idolatry,</hi> though he went on to serve the Gods of his Wives.</p>
                        <p>It is a shame to run this matter any farther, and I make no doubt but that I have all men of Sense whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ours, or of the Roman Church with me in this matter against our Author. But that I may not seem onely to destroy his <hi>Idea,</hi> without fixing any other in the room of it; I now proceed to observe, That we find two sorts of <hi>Idolatry</hi> mention'd in the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> and (such is the misfortune of this posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive man,) both of them <hi>utterly destructive</hi> of his <hi>true</hi> and <hi>onely Notion</hi> of it, viz.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>I. The worshiping of the <hi>true God,</hi> by a <hi>material Symbol</hi> or <hi>Representation.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>II. The worshiping of <hi>other Gods,</hi> than the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and that whether it be so as,</item>
                           <item>1. Utterly to <hi>forsake</hi> the <hi>true God,</hi> and serve <hi>others</hi> onely, Or</item>
                           <item>2. To worship <hi>other Gods</hi> together with <hi>Him.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>
                           <hi>1st.</hi> That according to the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> it was esteemed <hi>Idolatry</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to worship the <hi>true God</hi> by any material <hi>Symbol</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:36811:549"/>
And of this I shall desire no better proof, than those very <hi>instances</hi> which this <hi>Author</hi> so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists upon, for the establishing of his <hi>Notion,</hi> viz. those of the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> and of the <hi>Calves of Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> That the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> did commit <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the <hi>worship</hi> of these is on all hands agreed; And yet that both these were designed as <hi>Symbols</hi> of the <hi>true God,</hi> and not of any <hi>visible</hi> or <hi>Corporeal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities,</hi> will I think appear evident, almost to a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi> from these following reflexions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>1st.</hi> That it is altogether incredible that the <q>
                              <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in either of those <hi>Cases,</hi> could so soon have forgotten the <hi>true God,</hi> as to give <hi>divine worship</hi> to <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>Corporeal Beings,</hi> as supposing them to be the supreme Deity.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>If we consider their Circumstances when they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped the <hi>Golden Calf, Exod.</hi> 32. It was but a very few days since <hi>God</hi> had made a very great <hi>discovery</hi> of Himself to them at Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> when he gave them the Law, and asserted Himself to be the <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> their God which had <hi>brought them up out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> Exod. 20. 1.</p>
                        <p>And in the Case of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s <hi>Calves,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>God</hi> in which they had been bred up; a continued <hi>publick Service</hi> of Him at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> the <hi>Feasts</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which they observed in Obedience to his Command, the very <hi>Seal</hi> of his <hi>Covenant</hi> which they carried about them in their <hi>Flesh,</hi> not to say any thing of that <hi>Temple</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> had so lately built unto him; all these must certainly have made too deep an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression upon their minds, to permit them so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly to fall away into such an utter forgetfulness of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36811:549"/>
him, as to worship <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>corporeal deities</hi> as the <hi>supreme God,</hi> so as to exclude all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension</hi> of him who really is the <hi>supreme God.</hi> Such an Ignorance as this is hardly to be found, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those <hi>Infidels</hi> that have never had any revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>true God</hi> at all made to them: But that Men who had once been instructed in the <hi>knowledge</hi> and worship of him, should so suddenly fall off from both, as they must here have done according to this <hi>Author's true</hi> and onely <hi>Notion</hi> of their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> this I think is as <hi>incredible,</hi> as the notion it self, which he would prove by the supposition of it. But,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2dly.</hi> That the people did not fall into any <q>such <hi>Apostasie,</hi> but design'd in those <hi>Calves</hi> to worship the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> is evident from the <hi>Characters</hi> given of that <hi>deity</hi> whom they served by them.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>For as to the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 4. that when it was set up they cry'd out, <q>This is thy God O <hi>Israel, which brought thee up</hi> out of the Land of Egypt, and <hi>Aaron</hi> built an Altar <hi>before it,</hi> and <hi>made proclamation and said, to Morrow is a Feast to the Jehovah</hi> or <hi>the Lord.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And so <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in the very same manner, having set up his <hi>Calves</hi> in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> 1 Kin. 12. 28. <q>
                              <hi>It is too much for you</hi> (said he to the people) <hi>to go to Jerusalem; Behold</hi> thy God O Israel, <hi>which brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt.</hi>
                           </q> Now may I desire this Learned <hi>Author</hi> to tell us. 1. Where in <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> do's he find the name <hi>JEHOVAH,</hi> or the <hi>LORD</hi> attributed to any other but the <hi>true God?</hi> Or if we should suppose the people to be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in this Case, yet could <hi>Aaron</hi> the <hi>High-priest</hi> be so forgetfull, as not to remember that this was that

Whom should they then, and <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> mean after by the Jehovah <hi>that</hi> had brought them up <hi>out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> but him who at the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Law, appropriated this Character to himself, <hi>Ex.</hi> 20. 1. and who was under that Title worshiped by the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> where his <hi>Temple</hi> stood, and whither all the <hi>Tribes</hi> were wont to go up to <hi>worship</hi> him. <hi>It is too much for you to go up to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem. <hi>Behold thy</hi> God, <hi>O</hi> Israel, <hi>which brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Had <hi>Jeroboam</hi> hereby designed to set up a <hi>new God</hi> amongst them, how came it to pass that He used no <hi>Arguments</hi> with them at all as to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but merely remonstrated to them the trouble of going up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>worship?</hi> Never sure were people easier persuaded out of their <hi>religion</hi> than the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> if our <hi>Author</hi> thinks, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of place made him chuse rather to return to the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> than to be at so much pains to <hi>worship</hi> the true <hi>God.</hi>

                           <hi>3dly.</hi> But all this will farther appear, in that it is altogether incredible that the <hi>Egyptian Gods</hi> should be the <hi>God</hi> that delivered the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of the hand of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and sent all those <hi>Plagues</hi> upon their own servants. But especially that <hi>thick darkness</hi> under which they lay for three days, seems to be a very odd <hi>Effect</hi> for the Sun to have wrought. But to quit such <hi>Suppositions;</hi> Two things there are by which it undoubtedly appears that the <hi>Israelites</hi> in these <hi>Cases,</hi> could not have design'd any return to the <hi>Egyptian Idolatry.</hi> For,</p>

                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:36811:550"/>
1. As to the <hi>Golden-Calf,</hi> it is said that they <hi>offer'd burnt offerings, and brought Peace offerings unto it.</hi> And <hi>Jeroboam</hi> sacrificed unto the <hi>Calves</hi> which he had made and <hi>Consecrated Priests with</hi> a bullock and <hi>seven</hi> rams to their Service.</p>
                        <p>Now all this was most agreeable to what <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in his Service: but so utterly repugnant to the <hi>Superstition</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that our Author himself confesses <hi>God</hi> commanded their beasts to be offer'd in Sacrifice to him, in contempt of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credness in which they were held by those <hi>Idolaters.</hi> He tells us <q>That to offer a <hi>young Ram</hi> was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test affront that could be put upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who held a <hi>Ram</hi> not onely in religious esteem, but the most sacred of all their <hi>Holy Animals.</hi> And particularly upon the account of the sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. of these <hi>Animals,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (says he) <hi>NEVER OFFER'D</hi> any of their Species in Sacrifice. In so much that when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> bid <hi>Moses</hi> go sacrifice to the Lord in the Land of <hi>Egypt, Moses</hi> answers that they durst not doe it, <hi>because</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Exod. 8. 26.</note> 
                              <hi>it would be an Abomination to the</hi> Egyptians, so that they would <hi>stone them:</hi> that is, it would be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness and open affront to the Religion of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> if they should offer in Sacrifice those very Animals that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had consecrated to the Honour of their Gods. And for the same reason the <hi>Israelites</hi> were also commanded to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <hi>young-Bullocks,</hi> as well as <hi>Rams;</hi> for that next to a <hi>Ram</hi> the <hi>Bullock</hi> was the most <hi>Sacred</hi> of all the <hi>Holy Animals.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our <hi>Author</hi> is very large on this Argument; but I think what I have here offer'd, is little less
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36811:551"/>
than a <hi>demonstration</hi> against him as to this <hi>point;</hi> that the Jews in the Worship of their <hi>Calves</hi> did not return to the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> seeing they offer'd such <hi>Sacrifices</hi> before them as by his own confession were <hi>an open affront to the Religion of the</hi> Egyptians.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2dly.</hi> It is evident from <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> that the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of these <hi>Calves</hi> was a distinct <hi>Idolatry</hi> from that of <hi>worshipping</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Bodies;</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Estimate which <hi>God</hi> himself put upon it, much less heinous. And this we find in both the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> before mention'd. For as to the <hi>Golden Calf, Stephen</hi> says Acts 7. 41, 42. <q>That <hi>they made a Calf</hi> in those days, and offer'd Sacrifice to the Idol, and rejoyced in the work of their hands; <hi>THEN God gave them up to worship the Host of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                           </q> Now here must be a manifest difference al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd  between these two, seeing the one is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the <hi>punishment</hi> of the <hi>other,</hi> and what a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>paraphrase</hi> would it make of these words, to suppose that they <hi>Adored</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> in both; viz. <q>That for worshiping the <hi>Sun,</hi> under the <hi>Symbol</hi> of the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> God gave them up to worship the <hi>Sun</hi> under the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Moloch.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for <hi>Jeroboam's Calves,</hi> we find this also distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd from that of worshiping the Heavenly Host. For thus the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Ahab</hi> was aggravated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; 1 Kings 16. 31. That <q>
                              <hi>as if it had been a small thing for Him to walk in the Sins of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>the Son of</hi> Nebat; <hi>He went and served</hi> Baal, <hi>and worshipped Him.</hi>
                           </q> Now if the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Golden Calves</hi> was the worship of the <hi>Sun</hi> too, (as this Author would have it,) then this passage concerning <hi>Ahab</hi> must be expounded in this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36811:551"/>
manner; <q>That as if it had been a small thing for him to worship the <hi>Sun</hi> under the <hi>Calves,</hi> He even proceeded to such a height of <hi>Impiety,</hi> as to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the <hi>Sun</hi> under the name of <hi>Baal.</hi>
                           </q> But <hi>4thly,</hi> and to conclude this Point; That under the <hi>Calves</hi> they worshiped the <hi>true God,</hi> is evident from the whole Course of the History of the ten Tribes, and of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> under them. We find <hi>God</hi> as well revealing himself to these as to the other two. His Prophets came amongst them, and though they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inveigh'd against their <hi>Altars,</hi> yet never charged them as deserters of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nay, in many <hi>Cases</hi> we find those who worshiped the <hi>Golden Calves,</hi> yet accepted by <hi>God</hi> as zealous in his Service. I shall instead of many, offer onely one Example, that of <hi>Jehu.</hi> 2 Kings 10. 16. who as he was expresly design'd by <hi>God</hi> to be <hi>King</hi> over <hi>Israel,</hi> so he there bids <hi>Jehonadab,</hi> 
                           <q>come and see his Zeal for the <hi>LORD.</hi>
                           </q> Now the <hi>zeal</hi> he there meant was in destroying of <hi>Baal</hi> out of <hi>Israel.</hi> This he most Effectually did, as may be seen at large in that <hi>Chapter;</hi> and for the doing of it, had the Throne confirm'd by <hi>God</hi> to his Posterity for <hi>four Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> I shall therefore make bold to conclude, that <hi>Jehu</hi> was no worshipper of <hi>Baal</hi> or the <hi>Sun,</hi> but of the <hi>God of Israel,</hi> whose Service he promoted, and for whom <hi>Elijah</hi> not long before had appeared in opposition to this very <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 Kings 18. 21. <hi>How long</hi> (says he) <hi>Halt ye between two opinions, if the Lord be God follow him; but if BAAL</hi> then follow him. And yet <hi>Jehu still worship'd the Golden</hi>

                           <hi>Calves</hi> that <hi>were in</hi> Bethel, <hi>and that were in</hi> Dan; He observed not to walk in the Law of the <hi>LORD

God of Isral</hi> with <hi>ALL HIS HEART, seeing he departed not from the Sin</hi> of Jeroboam <hi>which made</hi> Israel to <hi>Sin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I conclude upon the whole, that that cannot be the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ONELT Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> which this Author pretends, viz. <q>The giving the worship of the Supreme God to some Created Corporeal or visible Deity, as supposing it to be the Supreme deity,</q> since (as we have now seen) to worship even the <hi>true God,</hi> under the worship of some <hi>Corporeal Symbol</hi> or <hi>representation,</hi> as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did in these <hi>Calves,</hi> is in the account of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to commit <hi>Idolatry.</hi> I go on,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2dly.</hi> To shew: That to worship any <hi>other God,</hi> besides the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> whether it be so as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the <hi>true God,</hi> or but onely to joyn the worship of any <hi>other with him;</hi> This is also according to the sense of Holy Scripture, to commit Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>Now this will appear from the Examples of this kind of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that occur in those <hi>Sacred Writings;</hi> I shall mention onely an <hi>Instance</hi> or two in either kind. And,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>1st.</hi> That to give <hi>divine worship</hi> to any other than to the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> though they do not worship that <hi>Being</hi> as the <hi>Supreme deity,</hi> but on the Contrary worship the <hi>true God</hi> together with it, is according to the Censure of the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> Idolatry.</p>
                        <p>This was the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> in some of the last years of his Life, For however, at the persuasion of his <hi>Wives;</hi> he neglected very much the Service of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36811:552"/>
the <hi>true God,</hi> yet we do not find that he utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook either the <hi>Worship</hi> or the <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of him. On the Contrary, the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> plainly enough insinuates, that he still served the <hi>God of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and his fault was, that he did not serve him onely, but worshiped <hi>Moloch,</hi> and <hi>Chemosh</hi> and <hi>Ash<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>reth,</hi> and <hi>Milcom</hi> together with him. For thus speaking of his <hi>Idolatry</hi> it says, 1 Kings 11. 4. <hi>That his heart was not</hi> perfect, <hi>with the Lord his God:</hi> and again ver. 6. <hi>That he went not</hi> fully <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord</hi> as did <hi>David his Father, i. e.</hi> He did not wholly give up himself to serve the Lord, and him <hi>ONELT</hi> as his Father had done.</p>
                        <p>Another, and a more notable Instance of this we meet with in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. Where the Kings of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syria</hi> having led the ten Tribes into Captivity, and planted some of his own Subjects in their Countrey, we read <hi>ver.</hi> 24. that <hi>God sent</hi>

                              <hi>Lions amongst them to destroy them,</hi>
                           </q> because they neglected to worship <note place="margin">ver. 25.</note> him. Upon this the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> ordered one of the Priests of <hi>Bethel</hi> to go up and teach them, <q>
                              <hi>the manner of the God of the Land; then</hi> one <hi>of the</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">ver. 27.</note> Priests <hi>whom they had carried away from</hi> Samaria, <hi>came and dwelt in</hi> Bethel, <hi>and taught them how they</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">28.</note> 
                              <hi>should</hi> fear <hi>or serve the Lord. Howbeit every man made</hi> Gods <hi>of his own, and so they feared the Lord and served their</hi> own Gods <hi>and their</hi> Graven Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Such was the State of these <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and their practice will furnish us with two very usefull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon this Occasion. For 1. Since these <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans</hi> were punished for not <hi>worshiping</hi> the <hi>God of the Countrey, i. e.</hi> of the God whom the <hi>Israelites</hi>
                           <pb n="70" facs="tcp:36811:553"/>
were wont to worship; it follows that the God of the <hi>Israelites</hi> was not the same with the <hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans:</hi> And therefore since these are supposed to have worshipped the <hi>Sun,</hi> it follows that the <hi>Israelites</hi> did not worship the <hi>Sun;</hi> but some other and him the <hi>true God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2dly.</hi> That these <hi>Samaritans</hi> at the same time that they committed <hi>Idolatry</hi> in serving their <hi>own Gods,</hi> did also both <hi>know</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> the <hi>true God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their <hi>Idolatry</hi> could not consist in giving the worship of the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> to their <hi>created</hi> and <hi>visible Deities,</hi> as <hi>supposing them so to be.</hi> But their Sin was that they gave <hi>divine worship</hi> to their own <hi>false Gods,</hi> after they had been instructed in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the <hi>true,</hi> and joyned both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their <hi>Religious Service.</hi> But,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2dly.</hi> As it was therefore thought to be <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> to worship any other <hi>being</hi> together with <hi>God,</hi> so must it much more have been esteemed so, to <hi>forsake</hi> the <hi>true God,</hi> and worship any other <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>visible Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>An Instance of this we seem to have in <hi>Ahab,</hi> who <note place="margin">1 Kings 16. 30.</note> seduced by <hi>Jezabel</hi> his <hi>Wife, did evil in the sight of</hi> the <hi>Lord, above all that were before him,</hi> and what this was we find in the next <hi>verse,</hi> viz. That not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi> after an <hi>Idolatrous manner,</hi> he utterly <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook</hi> him and served <hi>Baal,</hi> and built a <hi>Temple</hi> and an <hi>Altar</hi> for him.</p>
                        <p>Now that <hi>Ahab</hi> had utterly laid aside the Service of the <hi>true God,</hi> seems evident upon two accounts, <hi>1st.</hi> Of the Great persecution that he suffered his <hi>Wife</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">1 Kings 18. 4.</note>
                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:36811:553"/>
to make of the Prophets of the <hi>LORD, 2 Kings</hi> 18. 4. When as <hi>Obadiah</hi> tells <hi>Elijah,</hi> he hid them in <hi>Caves</hi> from her fury. <hi>2dly.</hi> From the miserable <hi>State</hi> of the Kingdom, in that time as we find <hi>Elijah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it even to <hi>God himself,</hi> 1 Kings 19. 14. <q>
                              <hi>The Children of Israel,</hi> says he, <hi>have forsaken thy Covenant, thrown down thy Altars,</hi> and slain thy Prophets <hi>with the Sword, and I even I onely am left, and they seek my Life to take it away.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Indeed it is not to be doubted, but that the Idolatry of this time was very deplorable. But now wherein did it consist? Did <hi>Ahab</hi> worship <hi>Baal</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> as a <hi>Corporeal Deity,</hi> so as to exclude all <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension</hi> of a <hi>Superiour, Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head?</hi> This is not credible, seeing throughout his whole Reign we find him corresponding upon all occasions with the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the <hi>LORD,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sure he could not be without some <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension</hi> of him.</p>
                        <p>And what I have now shewn in the Example of <hi>Ahab</hi> I will yet farther confirm in another, that will perhaps be liable to less exception, and that is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Manasse</hi> King of <hi>Judah.</hi> This King not content to forsake the <hi>God</hi> of his Fathers set up his <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the very Temple of the Lord; but yet neither had he lost all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>apprehension</hi> of a <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead.</hi> He had been bred up by his Father in the knowledge of the <hi>true God,</hi> the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the <hi>LORD</hi> still continued to <note place="margin">2 Chr. 33. 10.</note> put him in mind of his danger, and no sooner did he feel the punishment of his <hi>Rebellion,</hi> but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his <hi>God,</hi> ver. 12. <q>
                              <hi>When he was in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he besought the Lord his God, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36811:554"/>
greatly before the God of his Fathers.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus have I taken a short <hi>View</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sorts of <hi>Idolatry</hi> which occur in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and from thence it appears, that this sin is consistent not onely with the <hi>acknowledgment</hi> but even with the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>true Supreme Deity,</hi> and therefore that it is a very false account, which this Author has here given us of it, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                           <q>
                              <hi>That</hi> Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>is neither more nor less than the Worship of the</hi>

                              <note place="margin">Pag. 80, 81.</note>

                        </p>
                        <p>But before I quit this <hi>point</hi> it may not be amiss to observe yet one instance more of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> (I am sure generally supposed at least to be so) and which I cannot tell whether it may properly be reduced to any of the foregoing kinds, and it is that of the <hi>Brazen-Serpent</hi> to which the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> burnt <hi>Incense</hi> in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time, as we may see 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. This pious King observing their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition caused it to be broke into pieces, and we find this recorded among the Rest of <hi>his Enterprizes,</hi> for Rooting <hi>Idolatry</hi> out of his Country. <q>

                        <argument>
                           <p>The objections against the Notion of <hi>Idolatry</hi> laid down in the foregoing <hi>Chapter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, and refuted.</p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>SInce I first began the examination of this <hi>Book,</hi> I have been under some temptations to doubt whether the <hi>Author</hi> of it really designed to serve the interest of those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in the writing of it, or by a seeming defence of their <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> intended onely to shew how little he could say in their behalf, and to give us an occasion by Answering his Arguments to convince the World upon what just <hi>Grounds</hi> we advance that <hi>Charge</hi> against them.</p>
                        <p>It does indeed a little startle me when I consider how base a thing it is, and unbecoming the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>Christian,</hi> to put on onely an <hi>appearance of Zeal</hi> in behalf of a <hi>Party,</hi> to whom it must be confess'd he has been highly Obliged, and whom therefore if he <hi>could not serve,</hi> yet at least he <hi>ought not to have betray'd.</hi> But then it seems to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worse, I do not now say for a <hi>Christian,</hi> but for a <hi>Bishop</hi> that has not yet quitted either the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues</hi> or the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> nor retracted the <hi>subscription</hi> he once made of this very <hi>charge of Idolatry</hi> against those for whom he would now be thought to plead; to revile that <hi>Church</hi> which nourishes him, and whose <hi>Opinions</hi> we must
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36811:555"/>
suppose him to hold, till we see him as <hi>formally</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce them, as ever he once <hi>subscribed</hi> to them. And if on the one hand he seems to shew a great deal of bitterness against us in his <hi>Expressions,</hi> yet on the other, it must be confessed his Arguments are so <hi>extremely civil</hi> as not to carry so much as the <hi>appearance of Reason</hi> in them. And few of the <hi>Romanists</hi> have ever undertaken this cause, that have not said a great deal more in their <hi>own defence,</hi> than this <hi>Amphibious Advocate</hi> has offer'd <hi>for them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But whether this <hi>Author</hi> designed to expose <hi>them</hi> or <hi>us</hi> or <hi>himself</hi> onely, as I am not much concern'd to know, so neither will I undertake to determine. This is plain, that had he meant to ridicule the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> never so much, he could not have taken a more effectual way of doing it. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>Nobility do,</hi> or <hi>can,</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to understand <note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> or no, yet I am sure men of much meaner capacities than those <hi>Honourable Personages</hi> for the most part are, will be able to discern the truth of this remark. And that he must indeed have thought them not onely <hi>uncapable of judging</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>of Abstruse propositions,</hi> but even destitute of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason,</hi> if he hoped to impose such <hi>discourse</hi> as this upon them for <hi>Arguing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to make this appear, I shall need onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the <hi>Reader</hi> to observe with me these two things:</p>
                        <p n="1">I. That the position he undertakes to defend is, that the notion of <hi>Idolatry</hi> in holy Scripture is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>MORE</hi> nor <hi>LESS</hi> than this. <q>
                              <hi>The worship of the Heavenly bodies, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars,</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Pag. 74.</note> 
                              <hi>or any other visible and Corporeal Deity, as the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36811:556"/>
Supreme God, so as to exclude all sense and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of</hi> a spiritual and invisible Godhead.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. That to prove this, it is not sufficient to shew, that this is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or that the <hi>Jews</hi> did sometimes fall into it: But it must be shewn that they never committed any other <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and particularly that this was the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Golden-Calf,</hi> and of the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Dan,</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> For though the <hi>worship of the Heavenly Bodies,</hi> (as the <hi>Author</hi> represents it) were one sort of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet if the Scripture has charged the <hi>Jews</hi> with this <hi>Guilt</hi> for any <hi>other worship,</hi> wherein they did not adore <hi>the Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars, or any other visible and Corporeal Deity as the Supreme God,</hi> it will then follow that this, which is alledged, cannot be the <hi>ONELY Notion</hi> of <note place="margin">Pag. 80, 81.</note> 
                           <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and it must be false to assert, that <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> according to the <hi>word of God</hi> is neither <hi>MORE</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Page 74.</note> nor <hi>LESS</hi> than this.</p>
                        <p>Now from these two <hi>remarks</hi> onely, it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently appear what slender pretences some men will take up with to run out into the most excessive cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours against those whom they oppose. For, <hi>1st.</hi> As to what he so largely insists upon, as if there were something very important at the bottom of it, viz. <hi>That the Jews were a people prone to Idolatry,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 83.</note> 
                           <hi>and that the design of God throughout the whole Law, was to preserve them from it,</hi> though it be a great truth, yet it is certainly in this place a great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence. Seeing neither do we deny this, nor can he make any use of it, in establishing his <hi>true</hi> and <hi>onely notion of Idolatry.</hi> For I hope he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to argue thus, <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>were very prone to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and God intended his Law</hi> to restrain them
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36811:556"/>
from it; Therefore <hi>Idolatry</hi> is neither <hi>more</hi> nor <hi>less,</hi> than the worship of the <hi>Heavenly bodies, the Sun, Moon and Stars,</hi> as the <hi>Supreme Deity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2dly.</hi> It will from hence appear, that all those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> where God charges the <hi>Jews</hi> with <hi>worshiping other Gods,</hi> with <hi>serving the Hoast of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. conclude nothing, seeing it is confessed that they did fall into <hi>this Idolatry too;</hi> but that does not hinder but that they may have fallen into <hi>some other</hi> besides; and we are assured that so they did; nay, that they were suffered by God to fall into this, as a <hi>punishment</hi> for having committed the other, so St. <hi>Stephen</hi> expresly tells us, <hi>Acts 7. 41, 42. They made a Calf in those days, and offered Sacrifice to the Idol, and rejoyced in the work of their hands. THEN God gave them up to worship the Hoast of Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor is it any more to the purpose, <hi>3dly,</hi> to prove <note place="margin">Pag. 99.</note> that the <hi>Scripture</hi> says, that to worship the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> is <hi>Idolatry;</hi> unless he could find out some <hi>Text</hi> where it adds, <hi>that they who worshiped the</hi> Sun <hi>and</hi> Moon, <hi>worshiped them as</hi> visible <hi>and</hi> Corporeal Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>with the Honor due to the</hi> Supreme God; <hi>and so as to exclude all</hi> sense <hi>and</hi> apprehension <hi>of a</hi> spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>and</hi> invisible Godhead, <hi>and that this is the true and onely Idolatry.</hi> But now this which was the <hi>onely point</hi> in question, he has prudently forgot, and whilst he lives will never be able to prove it.</p>
                        <p>In short if there be any thing more than <hi>noise</hi> and <hi>shew</hi> in what he has said, it must be in his Account of the <hi>two points</hi> before consider'd. <hi>viz. The Golden-Calf</hi> and the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Dan</hi> and of <hi>Bethel:</hi> For as for the <hi>Brazen-Serpent</hi> and the <hi>honor</hi> paid to that, he is as silent as if there had been no such thing in his <hi>Bible.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="78" facs="tcp:36811:557"/>
For the former of these, the <hi>Golden-Calf,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiates very much, but sure never were <hi>Words</hi> put together with less pertinence than here. The thing to be proved is, <hi>that the</hi> Jews <hi>intended by this</hi> Calf <note place="margin">Pag. 84, 85, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>to worship the</hi> Egyptian Apis <hi>or</hi> Serapis <hi>or</hi> Osyris, <hi>that is, the</hi> Sun <hi>as the</hi> Supreme Deity.</p>
                        <p>But how does he go about to prove this. <hi>First,</hi> He learnedly shews that the <hi>Apis</hi> whom the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> worshiped was not the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Argives,</hi> nor <hi>Son</hi> to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And this I think may be foreign enough to what we are seeking, which is the design of the <hi>Jews</hi> in setting up the <hi>Golden-Calf. Secondly,</hi> He assures us 'tis much more propable that the <hi>Greeks</hi> borrowed the very word <hi>Apis</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 87.</note> And thereupon he takes occasion to make a Learned reflexion upon our <hi>Translation</hi> of <hi>Jer.</hi> 46. 15. which it may be was one of the passages for which he has been wont to censure our <hi>version</hi> with as little <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty</hi> as <hi>Understanding.</hi> For to say no more of it than this, if we have rendred this Verse amiss we have erred not onely with all the Learned <hi>Versions</hi> the <hi>Syriack,</hi> the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> and even the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> it self, but with the <hi>Original Hebrew</hi> too; and in all which there is this onely Difference, that what they call <hi>Valiant</hi> in one Number, we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Valiant Men</hi> in the other. And all this is still as impertinent to the <hi>Point</hi> in hand, as any thing can well be imagined to be.</p>
                        <p>And yet from this, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He boldly infers, <q>
                              <hi>That the Calf must have been the</hi> Symbol <hi>of some</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Egyptian Idol, <hi>and that the people thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves betray'd or deserted by</hi> Moses <hi>after fourty days absence forced</hi> Aaron <hi>to restore to them the Symbols
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36811:557"/>
of their old Gods to go before them, instead of this new God that seemed to have deserted them.</hi>
                           </q> And this indeed is pertinent, but it has another terrible <hi>defect, viz.</hi> that it wants proof. In short the onely <hi>reason</hi> he has to offer for what he says, is this; <hi>That all their other worship seems to have been forced and constrained, but this is free and voluntary: And that there could be no other Ground of that great joy they shew'd on this occasion, but that they were restored to the Exercise of their former Religion.</hi> And to this I have many things to reply.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> That this is at best but a <hi>plausible presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and such as if compared with the <hi>reasons</hi> I have alledged to the contrary, will not be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the name of an <hi>Argument.</hi> For,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas this <hi>Author</hi> (always <hi>positive</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 88.</note> if that might pass for <hi>proof)</hi> says, <hi>that there could be no other ground of this joy than that they were restored to the worship of their old Gods;</hi> I would fain know how he comes to be assured of this? I am confident were it fit to establish a <hi>Principle</hi> of this moment upon the <hi>sandy Foundation</hi> of our own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,</hi> one might be able to find out other reasons for it. For why might they not have had just cause of rejoycing to behold a <hi>Symbol</hi> of their <hi>own God</hi> set up amongst them, as well as if it had been a figure of an <hi>Egyptian Idol?</hi> what if despairing of <hi>Moses</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them, as they design'd this <hi>Symbol</hi> to supply his place, to direct them in their journey, and to be an <hi>Oracle</hi> at which they might continually enquire <hi>God</hi>'s pleasure, so they testified some transports of joy upon the erecting of it? Nay but,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:36811:558"/>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What if we should say that we cannot discern any such <hi>extraordinary joy,</hi> more than what the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of a <hi>Feast</hi> Dedicated to the <hi>JEHOV AH</hi> for the setting up of a visible <hi>Symbol</hi> of his <hi>presence</hi> amongst them might very well warrant? The case in short was this; <hi>Moses</hi> delay'd to come down from the <hi>Mount,</hi> the people were impatient to continue on their Journey towards the <hi>Promised Land;</hi> but how to learn <hi>God</hi>'s pleasure they knew not, and for this purpose they cryed unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> that he would make them a <hi>God to go before them;</hi> such as very probably they had seen in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and which might serve instead of an <hi>Oracle</hi> unto them. This <hi>Aaron</hi> makes, and for the <hi>Dedication</hi> of it appoints <hi>a Feast unto the Lord,</hi> and offers such <hi>Sacrifices</hi> as <hi>God</hi> indeed required, but which this <hi>Author</hi> himself confesses were an <hi>Abomination to the Egyptians:</hi> And upon the occasion of this <hi>Feast</hi> it was that it is said, <hi>They rejoyced in the works of their hands.</hi> Acts 7. 41. And again, <hi>The people sate down to eat and drink and rose up to play,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 7. And what this joy was we find particularly expressed, <hi>Exod. 32. 19. They were singing, and dancing before the Calf.</hi> Now all this was very natural on such an occasion; and what ever sin they committed in it, yet I cannot see any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity there is to conclude that there could be no <hi>other ground for such a joy than their returning to the Idols of Egypt.</hi> And the Arguments I have before given clearly shew that whatever it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> was, it could not be that, seeing that the whole Solemnity was consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>JEHOV AH,</hi> and performed in a manner utterly inconsistent with the <hi>Egyptian Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:36811:558"/>
As for the <hi>Calves</hi> of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> our <hi>Author</hi> has (if possible) yet less to say against their being the <hi>Symbols</hi> of the <hi>God of Israel,</hi> than he had in the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Case.</hi> He produces onely the Learned <hi>Visorius</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">Pag. 93.</note> to prove that <hi>Monceius</hi> was mistaken in imagining that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> set up these <hi>Calves</hi> in imitation of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's Cherubim.</hi> But now this is not our <hi>question,</hi> whether the <hi>Calves</hi> were made in imitation of the <hi>Cherubim,</hi> but whether the <hi>God of Israel,</hi> or the <hi>Gods of Egypt</hi> were worshiped by the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel?</hi> And yet without saying one pertinent word, he concludes, with as good Assurance as if he had made a demonstration of it; <q>
                              <hi>So that it is plain that these Calves were set up by him as Idols, or Symbols of a new or separate Religion from the Tribe of Judah.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>One thing indeed there is that may seem to deserve an <hi>Answer,</hi> and that is, why the people for three whole years did not comply with him, if he kept up the <hi>old Religion</hi> that had been established under <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Solomon?</hi> But now this is a gross <hi>Mistake</hi> in a person that would be thought so <hi>Learned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> The people did comply very readily with <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> and were far from refusing for any such time as is pretended. And that passage to which this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> must, I suppose, refer 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 17. is spoken not of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> but of the <hi>Kingdom of Judah;</hi> namely, <hi>that for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now let any reasonable man consider what a pitifull <hi>Vindication</hi> is this, to support so much <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> and <hi>confidence?</hi> And how must all men of sense, even in the <hi>Roman Communion</hi> despise such tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36811:559"/>
after what they have seen their own <hi>Dr. Godden</hi> perform upon this very subject? The truth is we ought to give that <hi>Learned Man</hi> his due. He has said what was to be said to excuse his <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and his performance shews that he wanted nothing but a better <hi>Cause</hi> to have acquitted himself to every one's satisfaction. But he had a hard <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress</hi> to serve, and he was not unsensible of it. But for this new <hi>Advocate</hi> his Arguments are as much short of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s, as his assurance is greater. There the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi>'s found something worthy his consideration, but here is nothing but a <hi>great noise,</hi> and a great deal of Anger and Scorn, without any just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, though in such a Case the Cause ought to be very plain. In short, I cannot imagine any other effect this <hi>Discourse</hi> can possibly have than to raise the Credit of Dr. <hi>Godden</hi>'s; and after whom it is indeed a bold undertaking for another to engage: for could this <hi>Point</hi> have been <hi>defended,</hi> he was the <hi>Person</hi> that of any other seems to have been the most likely to have done it. But he too has fail'd, and because his performance was good, considering the matter of it, the worth of the man argues the badness of the <hi>Cause,</hi> and the impossibility of defending it.</p>

                        <argument>
                           <p>That the <hi>Account</hi> which has been given of the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> is equally applicable to the Case of the <hi>Christians</hi> now. The <hi>Objection</hi> from the <hi>Cherubims</hi> answered: and the whole <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </argument>
                        <p>I Am now come to the last <hi>point</hi> to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and it is indeed so necessarily consequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foregoing, that if what I have before said concerning the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> under the <hi>Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> be allowed, this cannot be denied: viz. <hi>That as the Jews retaining both the Apprehension and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of the truely Supreme God, <hi>were nevertheless guilty of Idolatry, for worshiping him after</hi> a Gentile manner, <hi>so may</hi> Christians <hi>be now, and therefore that the</hi> Church of Rome <hi>may justly be charged by us</hi> as Idolatrous, <hi>though we do not pretend in any wise to say either that she worships the</hi> Sun, Moon, <hi>and</hi> Stars, <hi>or</hi> any <hi>other</hi> visible <hi>and</hi> Corporeal Deity <hi>as the</hi> Supreme God, <hi>or that she has lost all</hi> Apprehension <hi>of a</hi> Spiritual and invisible Godhead.</p>
                        <p>I shall not much enlarge my self upon the <hi>proof</hi> of a <hi>Consequence,</hi> both in it self very plain, and which this <hi>Author</hi> is so far from denying, that his <hi>whole Book</hi> is built upon the <hi>Supposal</hi> that he makes of the <hi>truth</hi> of it; It is indeed the onely thing wherein he seems to have any reason, nor can any thing be more
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36811:560"/>
just than for the understanding what <hi>Idolatry</hi> is to search the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and see what is there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be so.</p>
                        <p>As for the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> we find the <hi>Apostles</hi> earnest indeed in their <hi>Cautions</hi> against <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but we do not see that they any where defined the <hi>Nature</hi> of it; They spake as to men who understood these things, and were acquainted with the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and needed onely to be warn'd against fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into it. They give not the least intimation that it was not the same then, it had ever been esteemed before, or that <hi>Christians</hi> were to think any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of it, than the <hi>Jews</hi> had been wont to do under their <hi>Law.</hi> All we can conclude from their <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> to avoid it is, that <hi>Christians</hi> were capable of falling into it, and by consequence that Men who have not lost all <hi>Sense</hi> and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a <hi>Supreme, Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Invisible Godhead</hi> may for all that become <hi>Idolaters.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So that to know what the <hi>Scripture Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is, we must with this <hi>Author</hi> search into the History of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and from thence I have shewn two <hi>Cases</hi> wherein Men may without exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding either the <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>true God,</hi> yet justly be charged with this Crime. I. By worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>true God,</hi> by any <hi>Corporeal Image or represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> II. By giving <hi>divine Worship</hi> to any other besides <hi>God,</hi> though they do not onely retain the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but even the <hi>Adoration</hi> too of the <hi>true God</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it.</p>
                        <p>It were an easie matter to enlarge upon both these <hi>points here</hi> in the <hi>Application</hi> of them, but my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign now is not to accuse any <hi>particular Church</hi> of this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36811:560"/>
                           <hi>Guilt,</hi> but onely to shew in General what <hi>Idolatry</hi> it self is, and that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> though it both <hi>knows</hi> and <hi>worships</hi> the <hi>true God</hi> yet may do it in such a manner, and give such <hi>worship</hi> to <hi>other beings,</hi> as justly to deserve the censure which has been brought against her, for any thing this <hi>Author</hi> has said to clear her of it.</p>
                        <p>Indeed as to the former of these <hi>ways</hi> whereby I pretend a Man may be guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> viz. <hi>By worshiping God by any Corporeal Image or Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he has offer'd somewhat in prejudice of it. For did not <hi>God himself</hi> command <hi>two Cherubims to be</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">pag. 125. 127.</note> 
                           <hi>made, and used in his worship? and were not these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Images set up in the place of worship, and does not this shew that</hi> God <hi>was so far from forbidding the use of</hi> Images <hi>in his Service, that he would not be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without them?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But, to this I answer that <hi>God</hi> did indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand two <hi>Cherubims</hi> to be made and placed at the two ends of the <hi>Mercy Seat;</hi> But that they were put there for any use to be made of them in his <hi>Service,</hi> or for any other purpose than to over-shadow the <hi>Mercy Seat,</hi> from whence <hi>God</hi> had promised to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his <hi>Oracles</hi> unto them, this we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                        <p>Hence we find that when <hi>God</hi> had directed <hi>Moses</hi> how to make this Throne of his glory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 22. he commanded him, <hi>To put the Mercy Seat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove upon the Ark of the Testimony, and there (says he) I will meet thee, and I will commune with thee from above the Mercy Seat from between the two Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims which are upon the Ark,</hi> and in the VIIth. of <hi>Numbers</hi> ver. 89. It is said, That when <hi>Moses went
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36811:561"/>
into the Tabernacle of the Congregation to speak with God, he heard the Voice of one speaking to him, from off the Mercy Seat, from between the two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims.</hi> Now here we may plainly see what the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> was, not the <hi>Cherubim</hi> but the <hi>Invisible Majesty</hi> which spake from between them, and communed with <hi>Moses.</hi> The <hi>Mercy Seat</hi> it self was but the place where <hi>God</hi> had promised to meet them; The <hi>Cherubim</hi> were the <hi>Ornament,</hi> and <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> of that, But neither the <hi>one</hi> nor the other of these were the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> or <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes of that God who</hi> alone was adored there.</p>
                        <p>And this the Learned Men of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> confess no less than we, <hi>Aquinas</hi> having objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Aquinas</hi> 12. Q. 102. Art. 4. ad 6.</note> the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> That the <hi>Cherubim</hi> were put in the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and in the <hi>Temple:</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers that they were neither put there as <hi>representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God,</hi> nor for <hi>any Worship to be paid to them.</hi> And explaining the <hi>Ark</hi> and all that belong'd to it as a <hi>Mystery,</hi> he says, That the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented <hi>Heaven;</hi> The <hi>Ark</hi> was the <hi>Foot stool</hi> of the <hi>Divine Majesty;</hi> But that because <hi>God</hi> was <hi>Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible</hi> to any Creature, <hi>propter hoc nulla Similitudo ejus ponebatur,</hi> therefore was there <hi>no Similitude of him placed there</hi> the better to denote his <hi>Invisibility.</hi> As for the <hi>Cherubim</hi> he says they <hi>represented</hi> the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> attending upon his <hi>Throne;</hi> and there was therefore <hi>more</hi> than <hi>One, that all worship might be excluded from them,</hi> to whom it had been commanded <hi>that they should worship</hi> onely one <hi>GOD.</hi> So far was <hi>Aquinas</hi> from thinking—that these <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> were any <hi>Representations</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or that any <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> was to be paid to them, and the same has been
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36811:561"/>
confessed by others of no less note of that Church, <hi>Vasquez Lorinus, Azorius</hi> and even by his own <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorius,</hi> whom he has before alledged, but is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to take notice of on this occasion.</p>
                        <p>But here our <hi>Author</hi> supposes he has something to boast of. For if we may believe him our own great <hi>Defender</hi> of this <hi>charge</hi> has given up the Cause as to this matter, and confessed that it was <hi>lawfull to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship TOWARDS</hi> an <hi>Image,</hi> but not to give wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <note place="margin">pag. 130.</note> 
                           <hi>to one.</hi> This is I fear a wilfull <hi>perverting</hi> of that <hi>Learned man's</hi> words. The <hi>Question</hi> was about the <hi>Jews Adoration towards the Ark, and the holy of Holies.</hi> His <hi>Answer</hi> is this; <hi>That they onely directed their worship towards the place, where God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be signally present among them, which</hi> (says he) <hi>signifies no more to the worship of Images, than lifting up our Eyes to Heaven doth when we pray, because God is more especially present there.</hi> What is there in all this to allow it to be <hi>lawfull to give worship TO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARDS an Image, but not to it?</hi> Nay he plainly deni'd that there were <hi>any Images for worship</hi> there, <hi>or any worship directed towards them.</hi> But there was <hi>a Symbol</hi> of <hi>God's immediate presence</hi> as on his <hi>Throne</hi> between the <hi>Cherubim,</hi> and this appointed by <hi>God</hi> himself, and thither the people <hi>directed their worship,</hi> and I desire this <hi>Author,</hi> if he can, to tell me what there was more in this, than there is in <hi>directing</hi> our <hi>worship towards Heaven</hi> when we pray. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to his <hi>true</hi> and <hi>onely Notion</hi> of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> he may not as well say that we worship <hi>Apis</hi> or <hi>Baal</hi> or <hi>Maloch, i. e.</hi> The Sun, Moon, and Stars, in this, as that the <hi>Jews</hi> worship'd the <hi>Cherubim</hi> by that?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="88" facs="tcp:36811:562"/>
Nor is there any more Sincerity in what he calls his <hi>Second reply,</hi> and in which he represents him as allowing <hi>that the Cherubim might be Adored once a year by the high Priest, but not exposed to the people to worship.</hi> For in that very place he denies the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim to have been any representations of God, But says that his Throne was between them on the Mercy Seat;</hi> and adds in plain words, <hi>That they were never intended for objects of worship.</hi> And yet this <hi>Author</hi> insults and triumphs upon this, in a very glorious manner, as if the Cause had been gained by it. Had that <hi>Learned Man</hi> said <hi>that the high Priest adored the Cherubims once a year,</hi> then indeed there might have been some Colour forthose sweet Expressions of <hi>shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less shifts and pretences.</hi> But this he utterly deny'd; and he might as well have made him confess it to be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to worship Images,</hi> though he disputed against it, and have brought him in allowing that 'twas no <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> so to do, as to represent him confessing that the <hi>high Priest adored the Cherubim once every year.</hi> But what defence can there be against such <hi>Adversaries,</hi> as will make men <hi>confess</hi> what they <hi>reject,</hi> and <hi>affirm</hi> what they <hi>deny;</hi> and yet when they have done, dare to appeal both to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> for their <hi>Sincerity?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now from what has been said, I will venture to <hi>conclude</hi> in behalf of our <hi>Church,</hi> and of those <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men</hi> of our <hi>Communion,</hi> who have been concern'd in this <hi>Controversie,</hi> that the <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> which both the one <hi>Teaches,</hi> and the <hi>others</hi> have <hi>Defended,</hi> is after all this <hi>Author</hi>'s Clamours against it neither <hi>new</hi> nor <hi>unlearned,</hi> nor <hi>Fanatical,</hi> nor <hi>Anticatholick,</hi> nor <hi>Antichristian,</hi> nor any of those ill things he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36811:562"/>
but the truly <hi>Ancient, Learned,</hi> and <hi>Catholick Notion</hi> of it. The <hi>Notion</hi> which <hi>God</hi> in his Holy Word has Established; Which the <hi>Jews</hi> received; The <hi>Apostles</hi> taught, and the <hi>Christian Church</hi> till these latter days, that mens <hi>interest</hi> prompted them to seek out to themselves <hi>new Inventions,</hi> constantly maintained. It was by this Notion that St. <hi>Paul</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the Worship of the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> as <hi>Idolatrous,</hi> and condemned the <hi>Gentile World</hi> of the same crime, <hi>Rom. 1. 21, 23. That though they knew God, yet they did not Glorify him as God, but changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an Image made like unto Corruptible Man, and to Birds, and fourfooted Beasts and creeping things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This was the <hi>Notion</hi> that made our fore-runners in the <hi>Faith,</hi> chuse rather to suffer <hi>Martyrdom</hi> than to give <hi>Religious worship</hi> to any <hi>Creature</hi> whatsoever. And whatever this <hi>Author</hi> thinks of those <hi>Primitive Saints,</hi> I am confident he will find but very few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that will believe they Sacrificed their Lives to their <hi>Folly and Passion,</hi> and died onely to defend a <hi>mistaken Notion of Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was this <hi>Notion</hi> upon which the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> condemned the <hi>Arians</hi> of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> They did not believe <hi>Christ,</hi> to be either the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon,</hi> or any <hi>other visible</hi> or <hi>Corporeal Deity,</hi> or the <hi>Image,</hi> of the <hi>Supreme</hi> and <hi>invisible Godhead.</hi> They believed him to be the most Divine and excellent <hi>Being</hi> after <hi>God,</hi> onely they denied that he was <hi>Coëternal</hi> and <hi>Coëqual with the Father;</hi> and yet those <hi>Holy, Orthodox Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> censur'd them as <hi>Idolaters,</hi> because suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him to be a <hi>Creature</hi> they worshiped him as a <hi>God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:36811:563"/>
And upon the very same Notion it is that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches</hi> have ever looked upon the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the very same censure; And I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this <hi>Author</hi> should charge the Invention of this <hi>Notion</hi> upon a person <hi>now living,</hi> which he must needs have known both our <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Writers</hi> of it have constantly asserted, before any of this <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> ever saw the light.</p>
                        <p>I should now add somewhat in <hi>Answer</hi> to those <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reflexions</hi> he has made upon the same <hi>Reverend Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> whom he seems to have resolved at any rate to run down: But though the <hi>Charge</hi> be severe, yet is it so inartificially laid, as plainly shews there was no <hi>Achitophel</hi> in the Contrivance; And I will onely say that whoso shall consider the little Credit he had in those days, to which this <hi>Author</hi> refers, with them whom himself looks upon as the <hi>Contrivers</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers</hi> of that <hi>Plot</hi> which he would be thought to lay to his <hi>Charge,</hi> will soon discover a great deal <hi>of ill will</hi> utterly <hi>ruined,</hi> for want of a little <hi>skill</hi> in the <hi>management</hi> of it.</p>
                        <p>But we ought not to wonder, if he who in the beginning of his Discourse flew out into such violence against all the Abettors of this <hi>Charge</hi> as a company of <hi>Fanatick, Anti-monarchal Villains</hi> has in the <hi>Close</hi> thought fit to fix some particular marks of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasuere, upon the last and most <hi>Learned Assertor</hi> of it. This was the least he could do to make amends for the misfortune of a approving and <hi>Licensing</hi> that <hi>very Book</hi> which was written in <hi>Defence</hi> of this <hi>Charge.</hi> And it is well for us all that there are some
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36811:563"/>
men in the World, who as <hi>Ulpian</hi> tells us <hi>can do no injury, Sive pulsent sive concivium dicant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>How far this <hi>Author</hi> may be reckoned in the number of these I shall leave <hi>the final result of his Judgement in</hi> this case to satisfie the world, <hi>viz. That Idolatry made the Plot, and the Plot made Idolatry, and the same persons made both.</hi> For whether this can be the <hi>result</hi> of any man's <hi>Judgment</hi> that is <hi>well</hi> in his Head, I shall leave it to those who have no Distempers there to determine.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>he has delivered himself, as he will answer for his Integrity to God and the World.</hi> To this <hi>Judgment</hi> I now leave him: And though I fear it be too late to provide against the sentence of the Last, yet I heartily pray he may consider what he has done, and how he will <hi>stand</hi> in <hi>Judgment</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other.</p>

                        <opener>
                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>IN pursuance of my promise made to you, to send you such an account as you desire, of what has been lately published here, with reference to the Points in Controversie between us and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> I now give you the trouble of this Address.</p>
                        <p>It was you know the design of the Clergy of this City some years since, to reduce the matters in debate with the Dissenting Party, to a certain number of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36811:568"/>
Cases, and in the plainest and most inoffensive manner that they could, to shew them how little cause they had to separate from our Communion upon any of those pretences, which were said to be the cause of Separation. I need not tell you what their <hi>Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> were, for you have read their Tracts, and are therefore able to judg, from your own knowledg, concerning them. As to the <hi>Success</hi> which they have had, we that live here, have not only observed that our Churches have been more charged since, but do also know, that several for whose sake those Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were principally intended, have declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves abundantly satisfied, both with the strength and temper that appear'd in them.</p>
                        <p>When this first undertaking was finished, their next resolution was to run through the principal Points of difference between the Papists and us after the same manner, that those who had not the liesure or oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to consult longer Books, might here in short be led to a true knowledg of the Controversie, and stand the firmer in the truth, by being better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the grounds of it. It was also hoped, that many who had hitherto been detained in their Errors for want not so much of a Will to embrace the Truth, as of Light to discern it by, might possibly take this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of seeing with their own eyes, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that way of Error in which their ignorance or their prejudices had so long detained them.</p>
                        <p>But before they had finished this their second un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, the sudden and unexpected Death of our late Royal Sovereign broke their measures, and from thenceforth they thought fit to be of the Defensive side, and for some time published no more Discourses of this kind, but waited to see whether the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36811:568"/>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion would make any At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taques upon us, or be contented that the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie should rest as it was.</p>
                        <p>But because you desire an Account of all that has been done of this nature, I will let you know how far they advanced in their design, and give you a Catalogue of their Tracts, tho not just in the order as they came out, yet in that order which seems to have been design'd, and is most natural for you to peruse them. And in the first place, as a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to all the rest, there is a little Tract intituled,
<q>
                              <p n="1">I. <hi>A Perswasive to an ingenuous Trial of Opinions in Religion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           </q>
and which they who know the unreasonable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, as to any free enquiry, cannot doubt to have been exceeding necessary. To which I must add,
<q>
                              <p n="2">II. <hi>The difference of the Case between the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Protestants from the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the separation of Dissenters from the Church of</hi> England.</p>
                           </q>
For both these Tracts, as you may easily discern, were design'd to remove such Mistakes and Prejudices as are common to Papists and to Dissenters, and were therefore thought to be a proper transition from the first undertaking to the second.</p>
                        <p>Then follow those Treatises that relate to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions about the Church, and for which our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of late seem the most concern'd.

                        <p>But as these general Discourses were coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into the World; the particular Disputes were prepared, and those that follow were published.

                        <p>These are the Tracts that were published in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of that Design I mention'd before, since which time, our Divines have kept themselves, as I told you, upon the Defensive Part, their whole Work ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been little else than to answer such printed Books, or Papers scatter'd about in writing, as the Romanists have from time to time sent abroad.</p>
                        <p>I need not tell you that at length we were surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with a Book published by some Romanist, which has made no little noise all over the Kingdom, and has been the occasion of many more: But that which surprised us was this, that there was not the least notice taken in it, of those Discourses now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and not long before published in behalf of the Church of <hi>England</hi> against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The discreet Persons of that Communion acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged they were above Contempt; and it was the general perswasion of our Communion, that they would not admit of any just and reasonable Answer; and for this very reason, some appearance of an Answer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36811:570"/>
was generally expected to save, if it might be, the reputation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cause, or at least of the Ability of our Adversaries to maintain it, unless they should think fit to let the Controversie lye still, which if they had done, I believe our Divines had thought themselves obliged by the example, not to publish new Books upon it, but to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with that diligence in their Parochial Stations, that might be sufficient to countermine any secret endeavours to draw People from the Communion of this Church: But it seems our Adversaries thought fit to begin a Dispute, and that without taking the least notice of what had been so lately done on our side: Which tho we wondred at, at first, yet we have given over wondering at it now that we are something used to their way of Controversie. For some of them (as the Representer knows) can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blushing for the matter, drop the Defence of Arguments, and the maintaining of Disputes begun by themselves; and yet they write on still, as if the Cause went for them, and they had not made one false step in the management of it.</p>
                        <p>But I must now give you a particular account how these Gentlemen began, and in what manner they carried on that Assault, of which it is possible they may have had some cause to repent them since.</p>
                        <p>The first that led the way, was one that calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>R. L.</hi> with a Book full of Cunning and Dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, intituled
<q>A Papist Misrepresented and Represented.</q>
In which he runs through most of the Points in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie between us in a two-fold Character; in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36811:571"/>
one of which he pretends to shew that which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists are commonly misunderstood to be; in the other, that which, as he says, they really are.</p>
                        <p>The real design of this Method, you must know is this. Popery in its proper colours is so unlike Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Christianity, that it is in vain ever to hope to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it, if it appear in its own shape. It is necessary therefore, that the Religion, like the Prophet, should come to us in <hi>Sheeps cloathing,</hi> and the Heresie to be made look as Orthodox as is possible. Some things are denied, others mollified, all disguised, and a double benefit thereby obtaind: Popery is to be received as a very innocent, harmless thing; and the Protestants, especially the Ministers and first Reformers represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World, as a sort of People that have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported themselves by Calumnies and Lies, and made a noise about Errors and Corruptions, which are no where to be found, but in their own Brains or Books, but which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> detests no less than We.</p>
                        <p>But this Trick was quickly discovered, and the design laid open by an excellent hand, in a Treatise which he called</p>
                        <p n="1">I. <hi>The Doctrines and Practices of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>truly represented; in answer to a Book intituled, A Papist Misrepresented and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>In which the Author passes through every Point of his Characters, and truly states the Question between us, and gives a short, yet sufficient account of our Reasons against their Tenets.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="11" facs="tcp:36811:571"/>
I shall not need enlarge my self to give you any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Controversie which has been lately sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up, to satisfie the World, that this Author has taken as little care to defend his Characters, as he shew'd Sincerity in the first drawing of them.

                        <p>This is in short the Sum of what has hitherto pass'd in this Dispute, the Misrepresenter not having yet taken any notice of this new Antagonist, who it's thought by some, has summ'd up this Controversie so effectually, as to put an end to it. As for his second Part which he acted afterward under the Character of the Catholick Representer, I shall have occasion to give you some farther account of it when I come to those Pieces of our own Divines that have either been the occasion of, or the Answers to his Sheets and half Sheets.</p>

The next that appeared upon the Stage, was the famous Bishop of <hi>Condom,</hi> the great Abettor, if not Founder of this new Sect of Expositors of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the occasion of his appearance this. Our Misrepresenter being answer'd the first time, as has been said by the Learned Author of the <hi>Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>truly represented.</hi> The new Method of Expounding and Representing, <hi>i. e.</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the good Old Doctrine of the Church began to sink; and the People who were principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to be seduced by it, generally discovered the Snare that had been laid for them. It was now too late to recede into the old Popery again. The Misrepresenter had not only forsaken, but in good measure <hi>Anathematiz'd</hi> that, and profess'd that they abhorr'd it no less than we; and therefore to own it now, was in effect to confess that we had reason to reform those Errors which themselves were once ashamed to abet: So that what remained, was to put a good face upon the matter, and see if the Original Pattern, the pompous Exposition of this Bishop, with the long Relation of an Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the glorious Trains of Briefs and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations before and behind, might not possibly support the undertaking, and keep up the credit of their new Popery, which must otherwise neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily fall.</p>
                        <p>Such was the occasion, or rather the necessity of publishing this Bishpps Book, which you have seen under the Title of,</p>

The Exposition of the Doctrine of the Catholick Church in matters of Controversie.</p>
                        <p>To which there have been two Answers made, of one of which there has been no notice taken by the other Party: 'Tis called</p>

                        <p>The only Excuse I can think of for the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not replying to this Answer, was because an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other came out before it, which is yet but a lame pretence, since the Book is not only a direct and full Answer to all that was offered by the Bishop of <hi>Condom,</hi> either in the way of Exposition or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but has also a considerable variety of useful Reflections, which perhaps made it more advisable to let it alone, than to go about to consult it. The other is,</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <hi>II.</hi> An Exposition of the Doctrine of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36811:573"/>
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the several Articles proposed by the Bishop of <hi>Condom,</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Doctrine of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith</p>
                        <p>This Answer was so exquisite in all its parts, that it could not fail of gaining a general esteem; but the suddenness in which it was dispatch'd, rais'd the admiration of all. And that which made it yet more taken notice of, was the preface prefix'd to it, in which the worthy Author (who had the advantage of informing himself of these matters, by living some time in <hi>France)</hi> gives a large account of this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Exposition, and of a suppress'd Edition, which it seems had carried the Trick a little too far, and therefore was not permitted to see the Light, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with some other matters of Fact that very much laid open the Design.</p>
                        <p>But to those particulars wherewith you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well acquainted, I beg leave to add another piece of History which I have learn'd concerning this matter.</p>
                        <p>You must understand then that the project of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the <hi>French-</hi>Protestants, which has been more or less carried on ever since <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's time, was more especially agitated at the conclusion of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36811:574"/>
                           <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty almost 30 years since: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being apprehensive of the <hi>French</hi> Power, and willing to divert it by an undertaking, which they thought might find them work at home, and not leave them at leisure to disturb their Neighbours. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved there, at the same time that the Civil Power began to oppress them, the Church should offer some Terms of a Reunion to them, and all possible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours be used to encline them to accept it: To this end Money was secretly given to several of the Ministers, to favour this Project; but the Design be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discover'd by a Minister of <hi>Bas-Languedoc,</hi> the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Nismes, Ann.</hi> 1662. and that of <hi>Cevennes</hi> being assembled not long after, appeard so vigorously against it, that they were forc'd to lay aside the Design for some time. About Ten years after it broke out again; but the Ministers of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of the Isle of <hi>France</hi> opposing it, as those of <hi>Nismes</hi> and <hi>Cevennes</hi> had done before, it came to nothnig.</p>
                        <p>Now this second attempt was dated precisely at the same time that the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position began to see the Light: And that which convinces me that it was purposely contriv'd for the advancing this Design is this, that the Marshal de <hi>Turene,</hi> who was this Bishops Convert, and the principal Defender of this Exposition, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so at the same time the great Undertaker for this Project. 'Tis well known how to this end he sent a Person through the several Provinces of <hi>France,</hi> with private Instructions to those Ministers, which he thought he could most influence to close with it:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36811:574"/>
And in effect he did obtain several of their Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, whom when the Protestant Synods would afterwards have censur'd for their so doing, the Kings Commissioners took their parts, and would not suffer them to do it.</p>
                        <p>And here I ought not to forget one particular which may be worth your knowledg, and that is this. Among others to whom the <hi>Marshal</hi> sent, one was the famous Monsieur le <hi>Blanc,</hi> he was at that time Prisoner at <hi>Sedan,</hi> and the moderation that he shewed in stating the Controversies of <hi>Grace, Free-Will, Predestination,</hi> &amp;c. gave them great hopes that he might easily be drawn in to the favouring their Project of an Accomodation with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by meeting one another half way. The Agent brought him a Letter from Monsieur de <hi>Turene</hi> to this purpose, but was mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surprized, when instead of what he expected, hee found him stiff and inflexible, and absolutely resolved not to relax any thing. Indeed the very attempt that was made upon him, so disturbed him, that he could not be satisfied with his private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment of it, but in the year 1673. published a Disputation to them, that the re-union which they had attempted with the <hi>Lutherans</hi> made nothing to one with the Papists, which he there shews to be impossible.</p>
                        <p>This with what you have read in the Preface to the Tract, which has occasiond this Digression, may seem to satisfie you, what the Quality of the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Exposition is, and what intreague
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36811:575"/>
it was designed to serve. You have the <hi>Politiques of the Clery of</hi> France, in which Book you may see the very Propositions that were made for this Accommodation, and which are a pure Original of New Popery, and so conformable to the French Expositor, and our English Misrepresenter, that you cannot doubt but that they all designed to carry on the same Design.</p>
                        <p>For the little value that is to be set upon the Approbations prefix'd to it: The Author of the Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> has I think said enough to satifie you: To which you may add, that in the late Divisions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Jansenists</hi> and their Opposers in <hi>France,</hi> the Books on both sides have been very solemnly approved, and the <hi>Jansenists</hi> above any. And in the present Case, either the Approbations of the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Exposition signifie nothing, or those heretofore prefix'd to Cardinal <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Works, and their other learned Controvertists are become super-annuated; for all these cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly stand together.</p>
                        <p>But I run too far from my business, and must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Expositor, who was not long without an Answer, entituled</p>

IV. <hi>A Vindication of the Bishop of</hi> Condom'<hi>s Exposition, with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the said Bishop.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I will not tire you with giving my own sense of the Performances of any whose Titles I send you, and whose Books I leave you to judg of when you read them. I will only observe to you, that we are very much beholding to the Bishop, with confessing the particulars wich his Adversary had charged him with, and which there are many that before did hardly believe. And for his Excuses which he makes, the truth is, they are so little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that he has gain'd but little credit even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Friends by them. And if this be as they say, the first notice he ever took of any Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that appeared against him, he would do very well to have a care of setting out Vindications of his Works, at which he appears to be so horribly unlucky.</p>
                        <p>But for all this you may recur to the Reply that has been made by the same Author who wrote the Exposition of our Doctrine in his second under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, called</p>
                        <p n="5">V. <hi>A Defence of the Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of</hi>

England, <hi>against the Exceptions of the Bishop of</hi> Condom <hi>and his Vindicator.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In which besides an Answer to the Bishops Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and a particular review of all the several Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in debate, you will find in the <hi>Appendix</hi> some Pieces that will gratifie your Curiosity, relating to the Point of the Invocation of Saints. And in the close of all, the Epistle of S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> to <hi>Caesarius,</hi> which had been indeed very basely suppress'd by by them, but is now happily recovered, to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting reproach of those who have so often and confidently urged the Authority of that Father for to support their new Heresie of Transubstantiation, and which he here in as plain words speaks against, as if <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> had not only first produced, but as some of them have said, had written the Epistle for him.</p>
                        <p>And thus far this Controversie has proceeded, which at present stops here, though the Reverend Father who writ the Vindication, had prepar'd us to expect that it should not long do so, But we now begin to think, that both the Vindicator and the Representer, are sensible that their design will not bear being driven on any further.</p>

But tho we have done with the business of the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, yet we must not so soon part with the Bishop. For since the Publication of that, these new Popery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have favour'd the World with two other of his Pieces, the</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The latter of these which had drawn in <hi>French</hi> an admirable Answer heretofore, from that exact Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Monsieur <hi>Larroque;</hi> which 'tis said, the Bishop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thought too strong to be answer'd with any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; has also not long since produced us a Treatise ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worthy your perusing in our own Language, intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A Discourse of the Communion in one Kind, in Answer to a Treatise of the Bishop of</hi> Meaux, <hi>of Communion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And in the two Discourses, I mean the Bishops and the Answer, you may expect to find whatever Artifice and Insincerity can do on one side, or Truth and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reply on the other.</p>
                        <p>For what concerns his Pastoral Letter, I have seen se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Answers to it in <hi>French,</hi> and one particularly very accurately done, called <hi>Reponse à Monsr. L'Eveque de</hi> Meaux <hi>sur sa lettre Pastorale;</hi> which if you think fit, I will send you: I do not know that any one has particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly undertaken it here, any farther than what was done
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36811:577"/>
by the Author of the second Answer to his Exposition, who made some Reflections upon the Pastoral Letter too.</p>
                        <p>In this Letter, there is one notable passage; and the account of which, because you may not perhaps meet with elsewhere, I will run the hazard of another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression to offer it you here. In the <hi>3d</hi> page, there is set in Capital Letters, this notable Declaration, <hi>Not one of you hath suffer'd Violence, either in his Person or Goods.</hi> And page 4. <hi>So far,</hi> says he, <hi>have you been from suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Torments, that you have not so much as heard them mentioned; I hear other Bishops affirm the same: You are returned peaceably to us, you know it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I doubt not but this Passage a little surprised you, as it did all the World that ever read it; being so contrary to all the Accounts that have come from thence. Indeed His Majesties Brief alone may serve for a Confutation to so shameful an Assertion, and shew us how little we can rely upon those Gentlemen, when they talk to us of things that were done 12. or 14. years ago, that make no scruple of dealing thus with us in a matter of Fact, in the sight of the World, before whose Eyes these things are acted: Nay, to tell the very Protestants themselves, that they had suffer'd no Violence, that they knew it, when the contrary was as evident to them, as that their Host is not the Body of a Man; and no doubt the Bishop might as easily be able to prove the one, as with all his fine Words perswade the other.</p>
                        <p>But I will open to you the Mystery of this. You must know then, That, as far as I can learn, the Dragoons were not lodged in the Bishoprick of <hi>Meaux;</hi> but yet they came up to the very Gates of the City. Being thus in sight of their Danger, and expecting every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute when it would fall upon them, the Bishop thought
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36811:577"/>
that certainly now, if ever, they would be disposed to compliance.</p>
                        <p>With this advantage he invites them to a Conference, appears more moderate than even his own Exposition; and desires very little more of them than what any one might venture to subscribe. Such advances backt with so good an Authority as the Dragoons at the Gates, could not but prevail upon them; they subscribed as he desired, and so the Dragoons were dismissed without doing them any farther mischief.</p>
                        <p>In this state, they continued for about three months, when the Bishop began to Visit his Diocess, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, those parts in which there were the most Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. His carriage upon this review was very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what it had been before. He was now no longer the free, relaxing, good natur'd Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> that held the Conference with them, but rigid as any little Emissary. He threatned those, who refused to go to Mass, and assist at the other Offices of the Church; and tho several told him that this was not what he had promised them, yet he took but little notice of it. Mons. <hi>de Soguier,</hi> Lord of <hi>Charmoi,</hi> and Cousin to the late Chancellor <hi>Soguier,</hi> and several others more obstinate than the rest, both had the Dragoons quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd upon them in his Diocess, and are at this day Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners upon this Account. This I have read in some late <hi>French</hi> Pieces, which have taken notice of it; but the main of what I send you, is an extract of a Letter, which was written to a Friend of mine out of <hi>France;</hi> and who being himself not long since there, confirm'd to me several of those Particulars, as to this Bishops Diocess.</p>
                        <p>I presume you have heard how this Bishop, who in his Pastoral Letter dated <hi>March</hi> 24. denies, as you see,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36811:578"/>
that there has been any thing of violence used to the Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> did in another Letter to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Quality that had escaped thence, and whom he desired to draw back if possible to his Country, and his Church, both own and justifie the Persecution. This Letter was dated but <hi>Apr.</hi> 4. after the other. This Honourable person had such indignation against him for his double dealing, that he has permitted the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Letter to him, to be printed; and which agrees as well with his Pastoral Letter, as his Exposition does with Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Controversies; the Old Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery from whence we reformed, with the New by which they would now seduce us.</p>
                        <p>A third subject there has been for a more important Controversie than either of the foregoing, occasioned by the Papers left by His Majesty concerning the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Catholick Church; and the Method of which lies thus:</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The two Papers written by the late King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Answer intituled, <hi>An Answer to some Papers lately printed concerning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Catholick Church in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, and the Reformation of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
                        <p>To these there came out almost at the same time two Replies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>

                           <pb n="25" facs="tcp:36811:578"/>
In which there is little remarkable besides the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome levity of the stile, and the ungrateful drolls in a matter of so much seriousness.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>But to both of them the same worthy Author who wrote the former Reply, has very lately publisht a most Learned and Excellent Answer, and which I would very much recommend to your careful consideration, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,</p>

                        <p>
                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:36811:579"/>
First, concerning St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Supremacy, a Discourse Intituled,</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>A Sermon preacht upon Saint</hi> Peter'<hi>s Day, printed at the desire of some that heard it, with some Enlargements.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Occasion of which was this: Dr. <hi>Godden</hi> had the last year published a Sermon on this Subject which he preacht in the Q. Dowagers Chappel; whereupon the Reverend Author of this Discourse having likewise preacht on the same day, and upon the same Text, was prevailed with to print his too.</p>
                        <p>Another Subject that has Occasionally produced us two or three very good Treatises, is, <q>The Worship of <hi>Saints:</hi>
                           </q>  Our late Misrepresenter and the Bishop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Exposition having been pleased very much to palliate the Doctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as to this matter; and pretending that what they now do is no more than what was done even in the Fourth Age of the Church; it was necessary some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular discovery should be made of this Artifice, and it has accordingly been done very effectually in the following Tracts.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 <q>Speculum B. Virginis; <hi>A Discourse of the due Praise and Honour of the Virg.</hi> Mary.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>In which is clearly set forth what we allow, and what the bold extravagancy of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd them to do in the Worship of the Blessed Virgin.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 <q>
                              <hi>A Discourse of the Worship of the Blessed Virgin and the Saints, with an account of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36811:579"/>
the beginning and rise of it among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in Answer to</hi> Monsieur de Meaux'<hi>s Appeal to the Fourth Age in his Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Pastoral Letter.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4 <q>
                              <hi>Wholsome Advices from the Blessed Virgin to Her indiscreet Worshippers.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>This last is but a Translation: It was written origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally by a Papist, one Mr. <hi>Widenfelt,</hi> a Person of good Esteem and Reputation in his Country; who being Scandalized at the extravagant Practices of his Church in this matter, wrote this little Treatise to awaken their Consideration, and if possible, reduce the People from their usual extravagance, to the Temper and Moderation of the present Advocates for their Cause, as to this matter. But alas! He found them too fond of their Old Popery, to leave it so easily: Instead of doing any good upon them, his Book was censured in a very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner, and the Honour of the Blessed Virgin vindicated against these new Hereticks, by her faithful Champion Father <hi>Crasset</hi> the Jesuit: A short Specimen of whose Book you may see at the end of the <hi>Defence of the Exposition of the Doctrine of the Church of England;</hi> or if you had rather have it from their own Pens, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none can better expose their Extravagancies of this kind, than they have done themselves, you may then consult a late Popish Book called,</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>
                              <hi>Contemplations on the life and glory of Holy</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of Jesus; With a daily Office agreeing to each Mystery thereof. By</hi>
                              <pb n="28" facs="tcp:36811:580"/>
J. C. D. D. To which he has since added, <hi>An Apology for his Contemplations,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But of all this, you will find a particular account in an excellent Preface prefixt to these Advices by the Translator of it; who professes himself to be a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of our Church, and has the character of a very worthy, as he has sufficiently shewn himself to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ingenious Gentleman.</p>
                        <p>It may be proper here to remark, that this Preface has been attacked by the Catholick Representer; or the Misrepresenter transformed: in his <hi>4th</hi> Chapter of his Second part; and to which he has returned a smart Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, called,</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>A Letter to the Misrepresenter of Papists.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another occasional Treatise came forth not long since, intituled,</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>A Discourse concerning a Judg of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies in matters of Religion; With an Address to wavering Protestants, shewing what little Reason they have to think of any change of their Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It was written in Answer to some Papers that had been sent to the Learned Author, by a Person of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, asserting the necessity of such a Judg. If I should tell you from whose Pen this Treatise came, you would need no other inducement carefully to read it. And to encourage you to it, I will only say thus much, that it has been generally received with great Applause
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36811:580"/>
here, and do's certainly as well deserve it, as any thing that has hitherto been publish'd among us.</p>
                        <p>Here has been published likewise a short Tract con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of the Catholick Church, and the Authority of it.</p>
                        <p>It is not level'd against any particular Author; but design'd to answer the little captious Arguments now much in vogue; and therefore, necessary to have been thus prevented: The chief points handled in it, are these three. 1. What is the Nature of the Catholick Church. 2. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the Catholick Church. 3. That the Holy Scriptures, and not the Church, are the Rule of Faith. The Title of this Treatise, is this,</p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>A plain and Familiar Discourse by way of Dialogue, betwixt a Minister and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioner concerning the Catholick Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To these I may add a Treatise, concerning the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from what it once was. It is an Answer to a Popish Paper, which the Author has Printed at the beginning of his Book, given about it seems by those of that party, and sent by way of Letter to a Gentleman: It is called,</p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>An Answer to a late Paper given about by some of the Church of</hi> Rome.</p>
                        <p>Another Subject that has occasionally been handled, is, concerning Schism and Heresy: It is an Answer to some things in a Popish Pamphlet, called, <hi>Why are you a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick?</hi> The Author treats of the Nature of these two, and enquires to which Church it is that they really do
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36811:581"/>
belong: In short, Whether the Papists or we, are Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks and Hereticks? The Title is this,</p>
                        <p n="9">9. A Vindication of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the foul Aspersions of Schism and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy, unjustly cast upon Her by the Church of <hi>Rome. In two Parts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The last Subject that has occasionally, but yet more copiously been handled, and which upon that Account, I reserved to this place, is concerning the Worship of Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It began by this means. A Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of our Church, took occasion from the late Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Misrepresenting the Opinions of the Papists, to set forth an excellent Catechism, called</p>
                        <p n="10">10. A Catechism truly representing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with an Answer unto them.</p>
                        <p>It is not to be wonder'd that such a Book as this should be thought proper to be set forth; When the whole business of those of the other Communion, was to palliate by any means the true Doctrines and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of their Church; it certainly became us to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them to the World, as indeed they are. This has here been done from their own Authors, and with great Sincerity. But notwithstanding this, the Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenter that then was, in one of his Answers to the first great Controversy I have mentioned, took him to task for it: In the close of a new Edition of this Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, an answer was made to his Exceptions. Not long after this, the Misrepresenter began a new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36811:581"/>
to oblige the World with a Sheet a week, first; called <hi>the Second Part of the Papist Represented and Misrepresented;</hi> and after, of half a Sheet, which he has continued to the number of sixteen Chapters, under the new Character of the Catholick Representer. In his <hi>1st, 2d, 5th</hi> and <hi>6th</hi> Sheets or Chapters, he falls upon the Author of this Catechism, with reference to the Point of the Worship of Images, and of the Cross; which has produced us three short, but yet excellent Answers, called<list>

                              <item>1. The Papists Represented and not Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented, in Answer to the first Sheet of the Second part.</item>

                        <p>They have also been on different Subjects: Such as these.</p>

                           <head>(1.) Concerning Transubstantiation.</head>
                           <p>Upon which their late Attempts, either to set up that, or to ruin the other Mysteries of the Gospel, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that of the Trinity, have occasioned several short, but accurate Discourses: I shall send you the Titles of them.</p>

1. The Answer to the Popish Dialogue between a new Catholick Convert and a Protestant, to prove the Mystery of the Trinity to be as absurd a Doctrine as Transubstantiation: By way of short Notes upon the said Dialogue.</p>

                           <p>To these Discourses upon this subject, we cannot more fitly add any thing, than what has lately been done on another relating to the Holy Eucharist, <hi>viz.</hi>

                           <p>You ought to know very well what gave occasion to this Controversie; <hi>viz.</hi> the two Discourses set out by Mr. <hi>W—</hi>at <hi>Oxford</hi> on this Subject.

5. <q>A Discourse of the Holy Eucharist in the two great Points of the Real Presence, and of the Adoration of the Host; in Answer to the two Discourses set forth at <hi>Oxford</hi> on the same Subject.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>It was I believe expected that this Controversie would have either exposed our Church, had we own'd the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant notion of the Real Presence Mr. <hi>W—</hi>would put upon us, and which is indeed Cousin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to Transubstantiation; or have raised, it may be, a Civil War amongst us, if we did not. But I believe both their expectations will fail them; for certainly whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver some particular persons may have believed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is plainly as the Answerer has represented it; and as we expect it will be farther proved in the other Reply which we are told is preparing at <hi>Oxford</hi> by an Eminent Person there to the same Book.</p>
                           <p>There is prefixt to this extant, a very large Preface, which has properly enough retorted Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s—Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and shewn the World that if other Divines (as he pretends) have believed a Substantial Presence of Christ's Natural Body in the Holy Eucharist, 'tis more than many of the most Eminent of theirs have done, who are here plainly discover'd not to have believed Transubstantiation.</p>
                           <p>A third Subject that has given occasion to another Answer, is what they have called <hi>a Protestants plea for a Socinian.</hi> The design was to prove, that in interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Scripture by Reason, and not submitting to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Interpretation of what they call the Church, we make an Apology for the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and all other Hereticks whatsoever.

I ought not to conceal the Answer to that Libel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reformation which you have seen, called <hi>Pax Vobis;</hi> though it is not a just Answer to the Book, but a Preface rather to more that is to follow. The Title is</p>

                        <p>WHen the Author let this Paper go out of his hands, there were some Discourses omitted, which he intended to add towards the close; but because it was published before he was aware, there was no other way left to supply the defects of the Letter, but by sending abroad this Postscript after it.</p>
                        <p>To those Discourses therefore that are mentioned in this Letter, these are to be added.
<q>
                              <p n="1">I. <hi>The plausible Arguments of a Romish Priest answered by an English Protestant.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </q>
which is a Book that seems to be contrived on purpose to make the most material Differences between both Churches, easie to be considered and sufficiently comprehended by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the plainest Education. To which I must add,
<q>
                              <p n="2">II. <hi>A Discourse between two Protestants, in answer to a Popish Catechism, called,</hi> A short Catechism against all Sectaries.</p>
                           </q>
in which Tract one shall find all that plainness which is fit to enlighten ordinary Capacities, together with that solidity of Reasoning, which cannot but gratifie Persons of the best Education and Abilities.</p>
                        <p>To the same purpose there was another Book published not long since, called,
<q>
                              <p n="3">III. <hi>A plain Defence of the Protestant Religion, fitted to the meanest capacity, being a full Confutation of the Net for the Fishers of Men.</hi>

                           </q>
Above a year since there were some <hi>Queries</hi> put to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, which were answered in a Book that has this Title.
<q>
                              <p n="4">IV. <hi>Some Queries to Protestants answered, and an Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman Catholicks Belief, in Four great Points considered. 1.

Tho I omitted, how I know not, the Defence of the <hi>Dublin</hi> Letter, yet it ought to have been remembred in the first place. 'Tis an Answer to the Third Chapter of the Second Part of the Catholick Representer, and has this Title,
<q>
                              <p n="5">V. <hi>Transubstantiation no Doctrine of the Primitive Fathers.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </q>
There is another Tract which ought to have been mentioned among the Discourses against Transubstantiation; in which, tho there is an attempt to explain the real Presence by a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that neither serves the turn of the Papists, nor is needed by Protestants; yet 'tis in many respects so very rational and useful, that I am glad I did not forget to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it here. The Title is
<q>
                              <p n="6">VI. <hi>A brief Discourse of the real presence of the Body and Blood of</hi> Christ <hi>in the Eucharist, against the Bishop of</hi> Meaux <hi>and Monsieur</hi> Maimbourg.</p>
                           </q>
And here I must not forget a Book that will not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in hast, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <q>
                              <p n="7">VII. <hi>The School of the Eucharist, with a Preface concerning the Testimony of Miracles.</hi>

                           </q>
The Answer to Mr. <hi>Sclaters</hi> Reasons, and to the <hi>Nubes Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stium</hi> has been published in two Parts; the Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor seeming to design to go through with the latter. The Parts are called,
<q>
                              <p n="8">VIII. <hi>The Antiquity of the Protestant Religion, with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Mr.</hi> Sclaters <hi>Reasons, and the Collections made by the Author of</hi> Nubes Testium. The First Part.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>The Antiquity of the Protestant Religion concerning Images, with an Answer to the Collections made by the Author of</hi> Nubes Testium. The Second Part.</p>
                           </q>
In the mean time, they that would farther know what little regard is to be had to that Collector, may look into the First Part of <hi>The Doctrine of the Trinity and Transubstantiation compared:</hi> Of which Book I have given notice before.</p>
                        <p>There was published last Week another learned as well as smart Answer to Mr. <hi>Sclater,</hi> whose <hi>Consensus Veterum,</hi> will now no longer be spoken of with contempt, after it has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36811:585"/>
the occasion of the <hi>Veteres Vindicati:</hi> A Book so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in it self, that it needs not the help of comparison with the Book it answers, to set it forth. And I heartily wish that unhappy man who has a particular Right to the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of those Papers which his own have produced, may receive the greatest benefit by them. The Title is,
<q>
                              <p n="9">IX. Veteres Vindicati, <hi>in an Expostulatory Letter to Mr.</hi> Sclater <hi>of</hi> Putney, <hi>upon his</hi> Consensus Veterum, &amp;c. <hi>wherein the Absurdity of his Method, and the Weakness of his Reasons are shewn, his false Aspersions upon the Church of</hi> England <hi>are wiped off,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon this occasion I will take leave to say, that altho ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny count it needless to answer Authorities that are borrowed out of baffled Books, that have been forty times urged, and as often reply'd to; yet we are obliged to those that will undergo this Task, not only because we know what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages our Adversaries desire to make, by saying, that such and such a Book that quotes the Fathers is not answer'd: But because our Arguments and Answers from Antiquity are not at a stand, tho theirs are. Ours, I do verily believe, need no improvement, but that now and then they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, is what several Books of the learned Men of our times are undeniable instances of.</p>
                        <p>By the Author of <hi>The plain Mans Reply to the Catholick Missionaries,</hi> there was another little Tract published, which was not inserted in its place. The Title is,
<q>
                              <p n="10">X. <hi>The Country Parsons Admonition to his Parishioners, perswading them to continue in the Protestant Religion.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </q>
To both these there has been lately published an Answer by the other side, to which we expect a Reply.</p>
                        <p>The next that lies before me is,
<q>
                              <p n="11">XI. <hi>The Judgment of private Discretion in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, defended in a Sermon at S.</hi> Pauls <hi>in</hi> Covent-Garden, <hi>by Mr.</hi> Kidder.</p>
                           </q>

<q>
                              <pb n="40" facs="tcp:36811:586"/>
                              <p n="12">XII. <hi>A modest enquiry whether S.</hi> Peter <hi>were ever at</hi> Rome, <hi>and Bishop of that Church; wherein the Arguments of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> Bellarmin <hi>and others for the Affirmative are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and some Considerations taken notice of, that render the Negative highly probable.</hi>
                              </p>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Since the Fifth Part concerning <hi>Church Government</hi> which Mr. <hi>W</hi>—published, he has sent us from <hi>Oxford</hi> another Book concerning the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the <hi>Celibacy of the Clergy:</hi> He seems to have a Set of Books which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to publish one after another, for the Diversion of this Age, and to leave the Defence of them to the next. For since his two Discourses concerning the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> &amp;c. he has thought fit to publish two other Books, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any notice, or so much as offering to vindicate the First. Which Tergiversation will not I believe save his new Books from being answered, since there is so great a choice of Learned Men in that famous University, of which he is a Member, that some or other without doubt will be at leisure to attend his motions, and to do him right from time to time.</p>
                        <p>This Week was published the Examination of <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Fourth of his Fifteen Notes of the Church, <hi>viz. Amplitude;</hi> and because the Answer of the Examination of the Second is just now come to my hand, I am not unwilling to do our Adversaries that kindness to publish it here, if it be a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to them, which will be better understood in a little time.</p>
                        <p>I have no more to add but that we may expect in a little time, to see two Discourses concerning <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Prayers for the Dead;</hi> a Subject which has not been throughly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led since the revival of these Controversies. It will be no injury to the performance to raise an expectation of it, if it be done by that hand, which I am told we are obliged to for it.</p>

                        <p>But blessed be God, who has raised you up against such a time as this, and given us so great an Earnest of his Favour to us, that as we had never more need of Able, and Honest, and Firm <hi>Guides,</hi> than at this day; so I may venture to challenge any Age of the <hi>Church,</hi> to shew such a Number of truly Learned, and Pious, and constant <hi>Pastors,</hi> as the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and especially this <hi>City,</hi> do's now abound with.</p>

                           <hi>AS for those who shall please to peruse this</hi> Treatise, <hi>I have but very little to premise to them. They will here see an</hi> Exact Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>as far as I was able to make it, of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie on both sides between</hi> our Divines, <hi>and</hi> those <hi>of the</hi> Church of Rome. <hi>And in that, the Victory of</hi> Truth <hi>over</hi> Error. <hi>Never certainly was any</hi> Cause <hi>more entirely baffled than the</hi> Popish <hi>is at this time. Never was a</hi> Controversie <hi>more fully handled, and that in such a manner as to instruct even the meanest Capacities, than</hi> This <hi>has been in these last years. Insomuch that now there is scarce a person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us so ignorant, that is not able to make a Stand against the rudest Attacques of our Adversaries. Nay, our very</hi> Footmen <hi>esteem themselves, (and I think have satisfied the World that they are not mistaken) an equal match for</hi> Jesuits, <hi>i. e. for those who would at least be thought the most able Men of their Party, and dropt down from Heaven on purpose to oppose the</hi> Growth <hi>of</hi> Protestant Heresie.</p>

                           <hi>What others may judg of this, I cannot tell: But, for my part, I cannot but from thence conclude, That certainly the Hand of God is with us for Good. And that He who has given us this Opportunity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Weaknesses and Deceits of our Enemies; and endu'd us with so great and general a Resolution, never upon any Account whatsoever, to depart from our most Holy Religion, will also crown all our future Endeavours with such a Success, that the Generations to come shall rise up and call us Blessed; When they shall see our Firmness and our Labours in the Lord, and receive from our hands that</hi> pure <hi>and</hi> uncorrupted Truth, <hi>which I am persuaded those</hi> excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises <hi>I here mention, shall deliver down even to the very</hi> End of the World.</p>

                        <p>IT is now some time since it has been very much desired, That a <hi>Full Account</hi> might be given to the World, of the several <hi>Tracts</hi> that have these late years been publish'd on the <hi>Points in Controversie</hi> between the <hi>Church of</hi> England, and the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome. The <hi>Present State of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,</hi> set forth about two years since, being become very Imperfect; and serving rather to raise Mens expectations of some further <hi>Account</hi> to be given of this matter, than to satisfie their desires with what is there offer'd.</p>
                        <p>I will not pretend to have been so diligent an Observer of these Things, as not to have let many <hi>Discourses</hi> slip, in such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as have appear'd on both sides: And must, therefore, humbly entreat the <hi>Representer's</hi> favour to me, if He find some defects in my present Undertaking; and that he will not impute that to a spirit of <hi>Misrepresentation</hi> in me, which really proceeds only from my Ignorance or Inadvertency. What <hi>Discourses</hi> have come to my Hands, I will faithfully give an account of; and if He, or any other for Him, will put forth an <hi>Appendix</hi> of what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, it will be much more to the satisfaction of the World,

                           <hi>The present State of the Controversie</hi> gives an Account how the Divines of our <hi>Church,</hi> at the time of the late King's death, were engaged in a Design of publishing some <hi>Discourses</hi> on the several <hi>Points</hi> in <hi>Controversie</hi> between <hi>Us</hi> and the <hi>Papists;</hi> correspondent to what they had done, not long before, with reference to our <hi>Disputes</hi> with our <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Dissenters.</hi> And how the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Reception their former Attempt had met with from these, encouraged them to hope their Labours would not be altogether unacceptable to those. But the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of what they have done in pursuance of this design, is imperfect; and it may not be amiss, before I proceed any farther, to give a more compleat one here.</p>

I place this Discourse here, because I do not see to what other <hi>Glass</hi> it could more properly have been reduced, though it is but just now publish'd, and perhaps, was never design'd by its <hi>learned Author,</hi> to add to the number of this kind of <hi>Treatises:</hi> But that which is more pertinent for me here to observe, is, That the former part of this Undertaking soon met with such an <hi>Answer</hi> as is now commonly given to our Books, when any at all is given, <hi>viz.</hi> one single Sheet from Father <hi>Sabran</hi> the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> and who is now well known by his late little Encounters of this Nature.

                           <p>To this an exact and solid <hi>Answer</hi> was return'd by a <hi>Protestant Footman,</hi> one <hi>W.

The knowledge which this ingenious and diligent Man obtain'd, being entirely due to them; and yet how considerable it is, I shall leave it to any one to judge, that will but have the Curiosity to examine his Performance. It is called,</p>

                           <p>This <hi>Defence,</hi> and the <hi>Preface</hi> of the Publisher of it, did put the <hi>Jesuit</hi> quite out of all Patience, and Decency; and made him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himself so far, as once more to provoke the Reverend Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> by publishing an Answer to <hi>both Parts</hi> of the <hi>Preservative against Popery,</hi> and to the <hi>Footman's Defence</hi> of the <hi>first,</hi> under this Title:</p>

                              <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36811:599"/>
I do not know that any more of these <hi>Treatises</hi> have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attack'd by those of the other <hi>Communion,</hi> except that one only against <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> which having, after some years being let alone, given at last occasion to a formed Controversie, yet in agitation, I will, before I go any farther, remark what has hitherto passed concerning it.</p>
                           <p>The first that appear'd in <hi>Answer</hi> to it, was a Hot <hi>New-Convert,</hi> under the Glorious <hi>Title</hi> of,</p>
                           <p>Reason <hi>and</hi> Authority; <hi>or the</hi> Motives <hi>of a late</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant's Reconciliation <hi>to the</hi> Catholic Church; <hi>together with</hi> Remarks <hi>upon some late</hi> Discourses <hi>against</hi> Transubstantiation.</p>
                           <p>But the Performance was so mean, so disproportion'd to the Strength and Merits of the <hi>Discourse</hi> he had undertaken to attack; that it is to be presumed, the weakness of the <hi>New Convert</hi> obliged some more able <hi>Controvertist</hi> to appear as his Second; and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish not long after a new, and better <hi>Answer,</hi> call'd,</p>
                           <p>Transubstantiation Defended; <hi>and proved from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in Answer to the</hi> First Part <hi>of a Treatise Intituled,</hi> A Discourse against Transubstantiation.</p>
                           <p>And to make all sure; a <hi>Third</hi> about the same time undertakes the same Cause, in a <hi>Discourse</hi> which he calls,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>An</hi> Answer <hi>to a</hi> Discourse against Transubstantiation.</p>
                           <p>It is no part of my Design to give any Character of these Treatises; I will only observe, that the Second, which seems to have been written with the most care, continues still unfinish'd; the Author (whoever he be) having not yet thought fit to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his <hi>2d Part.</hi> Now this I the rather remark, to satisfie those who have long expected our <hi>Reply</hi> to these Treatises, what has been in some measure the Cause of the deferring it: tho the multitude of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36811:599"/>
other <hi>Discourses</hi> that have since been published on this Subject, may well excuse so small an Omission: However, since after almost a Years attendance, there is now but little Hopes of any thing more to be expected from this Antagonist, I may venture to promise the <hi>Reader</hi> that he shall not continue much longer without the <hi>Answer</hi> that has been prepared to what is already published; and which might long since have been finished, had not the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author</hi> desired to acquit himself of all his <hi>Task</hi> at the same time.</p>
                           <p>And this may serve in short to have been remarked concerning the <hi>first Part</hi> of this Design, of the <hi>Discourses</hi> which our Divines began to publish in the late King's time upon the <hi>Points</hi> in <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie</hi> between us and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We must now pass to a more troubled and perplex'd Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; and endeavour to reduce to the clearest <hi>Method</hi> we can, those many <hi>Tracts</hi> that have since come out in Answer to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on both sides; and the number of which is now so great, that it is no easie matter to give an exact Account of them. And for the doing of this, I shall consider them not in the <hi>Order</hi> of their coming out, but reduce them as near as I can to the several distinct Subjects to which they refer.</p>
                           <p>Now the first Thing that began all our Late Disputes, was the Pretence so much insisted upon, of our MISREPRESENTING the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome:</hi> And it shall therefore be the first kind of <hi>Discourses</hi> I will here consider.</p>

                           <p>And here the matter rested when the first <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie</hi> was published; and it was then generally believed would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36811:600"/>
have done so. But the <hi>Representer</hi> had by this time got too much assurance to be easily put out of Countenance; and tho by the longer time he took in his Answer to this last Treatise, than to either of the foregoing, and which his Performance sufficiently shews was not for any extraordinary pains he resolved to take in his <hi>Reply</hi> to it, he seems to have struggled a little with himself, before he could get the better of his <hi>Conscience,</hi> in going on at so pitiful a rate of <hi>Vindicating</hi> his pretences, yet at last there came out something that was to be called an <hi>Answer</hi> to our last piece, in a <hi>Preface</hi> to a further Continuation of his unjust Pretences against us, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">VI. <hi>The</hi> Papist Misrepresented <hi>and</hi> Represented; <hi>3d part; with a</hi> Preface <hi>containing Reflections upon two</hi> Treatises; <hi>the one, the</hi> State, <hi>the other, The</hi> View <hi>of the</hi> Controversie <hi>between the</hi> Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>and the</hi> Answerer.</p>
                           <p>But to this too, the worthy <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>View of the Controversie</hi> soon returned such an <hi>Answer</hi> as I find has not a little discomposed the <hi>Representer:</hi> and I believe no less troubles the <hi>Vindicator</hi> too of the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s <hi>Exposition,</hi> viz.</p>
                           <p>R. <hi>An</hi> Answer <hi>to the</hi> Representer's Reflections <hi>upon the</hi> State <hi>and</hi> View <hi>of the</hi> Controversie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To this the <hi>Representer</hi> has now satisfied us, that he never intends to reply: for having lately set out an Answer to another Discourse of which we shall speak hereafter, <hi>viz. The Apology for the Pulpits:</hi> he adds triumphantly in the <hi>Title,</hi> that it is not only an Answer to that Discourse, but also, <hi>A Vindication of the</hi> Representer <hi>against the</hi> Stater <hi>of the Controversie.</hi> But such a <hi>Vindication</hi> as this, could certainly never have come from any other Pen but the <hi>Representer's:</hi> and is by the same figure a Reply to this <hi>Treatise,</hi> by which he heretofore told us, that his <hi>Papist Represented and Misrepresented</hi> was enough to answer <hi>not only all our late Discourses against Popery, but a</hi> 
                              <note place="margin">Papist Misr. <hi>part.</hi> 3. Pref.</note> 
                              <hi>great part of all the Books and Sermons that had ever been writ or preached
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36811:601"/>
against them.</hi> The truth is, I can hardly forbear here to leave a while my design of pursuing the <hi>Treatises</hi> that have been Published on this Controversie, to expose the Confidence of this vain Man: But since the worthy <hi>Author</hi> of that Book which he pretends to answer, has thought fit to give him up as a <hi>Priviledged Person,</hi> who is past either sense of Modesty, or hopes of being reclaimed, I shall pay that deference to his Judgment, as not to trouble my self with any <hi>Vindication</hi> of his <hi>Discourse</hi> against so trivial and occasional an attempt against it. But if there be any of this <hi>Author</hi>'s <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> who shall think fit in good earnest to attack this, or any other of those <hi>Discourses</hi> which he has published against them, I will then take the liberty to promise, That tho to our great regret, the incomparable <hi>Author</hi> of them be now in his Grave, and <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Dr.</hi> Claget.</note> no longer in a state to vindicate his own Works, yet neither his Labours nor his Memory shall want a Defence, and let his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries</hi> whenever they please begin the experiment.</p>
                           <p>And here I suppose we may now take a final leave of this <hi>first Controversie;</hi> The <hi>Papist Represented</hi> and <hi>Misrepresented.</hi> I will only add, That since this first attempt of his began, he has carry'd it on in two other parts, under the Title of the <hi>Catholick Representer.</hi> The second of which coming out weekly in several <hi>Chapters,</hi> has received a very full, and I suppose a satisfactory Answer; there being no care taken to reply to what our Divines have with great care and learning return'd to it. The <hi>third</hi> has been consider'd, as far as was thought necessary, by the Late <hi>Worthy</hi> and <hi>Learned Author</hi> of the Defence of the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>View</hi> of the <hi>Controversie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. It was not long after the beginning of this, that the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding</hi> Controversie.</note> to promote the same design, another Engagement of the like kind was set on foot, under the Title of</p>

                              <hi>An</hi> Exposition <hi>of the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Catholick Church <hi>in matters of Controversie.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I need not say that this piece was Originally written in <hi>French,</hi> and published many years since by the <hi>Bishop</hi> then of <hi>Condom,</hi> now of <hi>Meaux.</hi> The prosecution that has been made of this matter in the Books that have been published on both sides, have given a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36811:601"/>
very large Account of this to the world; and what is farther ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the understanding of the design of it, may be seen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready set down in the <hi>former part</hi> of the <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 15, 16.</note> 
                              <hi>Present State of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</hi> I will therefore only perfect the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of what has past in this Enterprize also on both sides, by adding to that already given, those other Treatises, that have been publish'd since the former <hi>State</hi> was sent abroad.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>An</hi> Answer <hi>to the</hi> Bishop of Condom's Exposition, <hi>&amp;c. with</hi> Reflections <hi>upon his</hi> Pastoral Letter.</p>
                           <p>And concerning which I shall observe only, what was before remarked, That to this day no attempt has been made of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one word in <hi>Answer</hi> to it.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>An</hi> Exposition <hi>of the</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Church of England, <hi>in the several Articles proposed by the</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> Condom, <hi>in his</hi> Exposition of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Catholick Faith.</p>
                           <p>To this in a little time came out an <hi>Answer</hi> Intituled,</p>

                           <p>And to that not long after, a <hi>Reply,</hi> called,</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>A</hi> Defence <hi>of the Exposition of the Doctrine of the</hi> Church of England <hi>against the Exceptions of the</hi> Bishop <hi>of</hi> Condom, <hi>and his</hi> Vindicator.</p>
                           <p>And here this Controversie rested for some time, and it was by many supposed would have ended. But at last both the <hi>Bishop</hi> and his <hi>Vindicator</hi> resolved once more to venture into the world;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36811:602"/>
and so after a long expectation, an <hi>Answer</hi> was published to this last Treatise, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="5">5. <hi>A</hi> Reply <hi>to the</hi> Defence <hi>of the Exposition of the</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>of the</hi> Church of England; <hi>With a</hi> Second Letter <hi>from the Bishop of</hi> Meaux.</p>
                           <p>To this there have been two <hi>Treatises</hi> already returned, and we may in some time expect a <hi>Third</hi> to be added to them, as soon as the Author has discharged himself of a new <note n="‖" place="margin">O. <hi>W's</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Discourse of the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the Host.</hi>
                              </note> Adversary, which has since attacked Him on another account.

                           <p>If it be enquired here, Wherefore this last <hi>Defence</hi> was divided into so many <hi>Parts;</hi> I presume this account may be given of it; That the <hi>Vindicator</hi> having run his <hi>Answer</hi> into a greater length than the ordinary rate of these <hi>Discourses</hi> usually allows of, either no just <hi>Reply</hi> must have been made to it, which our <hi>Expositor</hi> was unwilling they should be able to object to Him; Or if there were, He thought it would be much more acceptable to the world, as well as less burdensome to Himself, to publish his <hi>Answer</hi> at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, than to be opprest with so large a <hi>Volume,</hi> as it would have amounted to all together. What is already finished will be found under these <hi>Titles:</hi>

of <hi>Rome;</hi> I cannot better close this <hi>Point,</hi> than with this remark, That in a very little time after the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s <hi>Exposition</hi> was set forth by the <hi>Vindicator,</hi> we were also obliged with the Translation of another of that Prelate's Pieces, called,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>A</hi> Pastoral Letter <hi>to the</hi> New Converts <hi>of his</hi> Diocess.</p>
                           <p>It is not necessary to say that the <hi>Bishop</hi> in this Piece pursued still the design of his <hi>Exposition.</hi> That has been already shewn in the <hi>Answer</hi> to it, which I before remarked, at the end of the other <hi>Reply</hi> that was made to His <hi>Exposition,</hi> and which still continues Unanswered. That which has made more <hi>Noise</hi> is his open declaring to the <hi>New Converts</hi> of his <hi>Diocess,</hi> that they <hi>knew there had been no such thing as a Persecution in France.</hi> And the falseness and unsince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which declaration has been sufficiently exposed, both in the <hi>former part</hi> of the <note n="‖" place="margin">Pag. 22.

                              <p>But however it be, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> doubts not to make it appear; That our Divines have asserted the very same <hi>Presence</hi> of Christ, in effect, in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> that the <hi>Romanists</hi> maintain; in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, called,</p>

Not long after this, a Person of great Worth at <hi>Oxford</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd a second <hi>Confutation</hi> of the same Piece, but with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, That whereas the former <hi>Discourse</hi> examined at large his <hi>Quotations,</hi> this chiefly consider'd the <hi>Principles</hi> on which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and the <hi>Arguments</hi> he brought to justifie his Pretences.

                              <p>The occasion of this Engagement was this: Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> having some years since composed a famous Book upon this Argument, it was thought fit by those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to translate that also, as well as the rest of his <hi>Tracts,</hi> into our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Accordingly we find it to have been publish'd some time since, under the Title of

                              <p>Now however it might have been sufficient for us to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd their Example, in translating that most accurate Answer of the late Monsieur <hi>Larrogue</hi> to it; yet one of our Divines was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to give it a new Consideration, in an excellent Book, called,</p>

I have already remarked what has passed on the occasion of the <hi>Discourse of Transubstantiation,</hi> the first that began this Debate.

                              <p>Transubstantiation <hi>no Doctrine of the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; being a Defence of the</hi> Dublin Letter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <p>And that no pretence to <hi>Antiquity</hi> might remain unconsidered as to this matter, the same Learned Hand has since obliged us with a <hi>full view</hi> of all that can reasonably be desired from the Primitive Fathers as to this matter, <hi>viz.</hi>
                              </p>

                           <p>Concerning this last Discourse, you must observe, that it does belong to the Controversie about the <hi>Nubes Testium</hi> betwixt the <hi>Representer</hi> and the Divine of our <hi>Church</hi> who answered that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.

it against him, led him into a Conference with the <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> the Dean of <hi>Pauls.</hi> I need not say what passed there, the whole having since been published: The Subject of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, was the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> The <hi>Conference</hi> being over, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> (according to the perpetual <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>assuming spirit</hi> of that Party) began to make great Boasts in the <hi>Coffee-houses,</hi> what <hi>Feats</hi> he had done, and how great a <hi>Victory</hi> he had gained; tho the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> for whose sake the <hi>Conference</hi> was held, declared himself much more confirmed in the <hi>Communion</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> than he was before, and resolved to continue in it. This enforced the <hi>Dean</hi> to publish a short Expostulatory Letter, called,</p>

                           <p>It was expected that this excellent <hi>Discourse,</hi> which made such a discovery of the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Contradictions</hi> of that busy Man, would have <hi>stopt</hi> his Mouth for the <hi>future,</hi> especially since the <hi>Blackloist Heresy</hi> was now like to be brought on the <hi>Stage</hi> again. But <hi>J.

                           <p>This we may expect to have <hi>published</hi> shortly. In the mean time the <hi>Reverend Dean</hi> himself did take another and more <hi>effectual course</hi> to disprove <hi>J. S</hi>'s <hi>Phantastical Demonstrations</hi> of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> by shewing, that tho we should allow <hi>Tradition</hi> to be as certain and Infallible a <hi>Rule</hi> as they desire, yet it would do them no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who in all those <hi>Points</hi> wherein they differ from us, have no <hi>Catholic Tradition</hi> to warrant them; upon this, in a short time after the publishing his <hi>Discourse,</hi> he set forth the <hi>First Part</hi> of a Work which we suppose may put a final end to this Debate, <hi>viz.</hi>

                           <p>And thus far this <hi>Controversy</hi> has been carried on on both sides.

                           <p>In this Condition was this Controversy when the <hi>Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> first appear'd abroad. But Mr. <hi>J. S.</hi> has since carri'd it a little farther in a new Piece, which he calls,</p>

                           <p>Besides this long Encounter upon the Score of <hi>Tradition,</hi> other Discourses have been published on both Sides upon this <hi>Point,</hi> Whether the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> has indeed such an <hi>Antiquity</hi> as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, for the <hi>Articles</hi> in dispute betwixt us?

                           <p>To this the same <hi>Learned Man</hi> who had before Encountred Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi>'s Pretences, gave a short but exact Answer; and shew'd, That tho the <hi>Representer</hi> (for it seems his it was) called it a <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> he might much better have entituled a Collection of <hi>Natalis Alexander,</hi> out of whom he stole the far greatest part of it.

2. <hi>An</hi> Answer <hi>to the Compiler of the</hi> Nubes Testium: <hi>Wherein is shewn, That</hi> Antiquity <hi>did not for the first five hundred years</hi> Believe, Teach, <hi>or</hi> Practice, <hi>as the</hi> Church of Rome <hi>doth at present</hi> Believe, Teach, <hi>and</hi> Practice.</p>
                           <p>And here we are to meet a very strange Accident, the great <hi>Chastiser</hi> of <hi>Misrepresenters,</hi> that honest, sincere Man that cannot endure false dealing, but was dropt down from Heaven to be the Scourge and Censor of a licentious Age, himself become a <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representer:</hi> And by a strange kind of <hi>Metamorphosis,</hi> from an <hi>Angel of Light</hi> transforming himself into a <hi>Spirit of Darkness.</hi> In short, He was it seems enraged to the last Degree, to see not only his venerable <hi>Authorities</hi> all ruined, but his <hi>Treasury</hi> discovered, and the very places mark'd from whence he had stollen his Book, without so much as once acknowledging to whom he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden for it. And yet what should he do? <hi>Reply</hi> to it fairly he could not; for after all his shew of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi> were a sort of <hi>Christians</hi> that he was utterly unacquainted with; and had he been as well versed in them as he is in <hi>Natalis Alexander,</hi> yet could he not have fairly brought them to speak in behalf of his <hi>Church.</hi> He therefore resolved under a new form to pickeer with the <hi>Author,</hi> and see if he could prevent him by some cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stratagem from being in a capacity of shewing him any such trick for the future. And therefore now no more the Reverend <hi>Father</hi> he was before, but as a <hi>Zealous Brother</hi> of the other Extreme, tho yet a <hi>Misrepresenter</hi> still, he lets fly at the <hi>Principles</hi> of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary; and undertakes out of his grand concern for the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Interest,</hi> to shew our <hi>Divines</hi> that this Gentleman was one, who for all his Pretences in their behalf, really endeavour'd to set up <hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>Masquerade.</hi> And to this end came out a formal Piece called,</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>A Letter from a</hi> Dissenter <hi>to the Divines of the</hi> Church of England <hi>in order to a Union.</hi>

But to the great surprize of this Gentleman, his Adversary, who it seems was as well acquainted with <hi>Henry Hill</hi>'s Press, as <hi>Natalis Alexander</hi>'s History, and by a sort of Beauties so essential to the <hi>Representer,</hi> that do what he can he is not able to disguise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, presently found out what an <hi>Ass</hi> was crept into the <hi>Lyon</hi>'s Skin. And to let the whole World see what an honest fair dealer this <hi>Representer</hi> is, he quickly gave an account of it in Print, in his Answer to the <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> Intituled,</p>

                           <p>To this I do not know that the <hi>Representer</hi> has yet replied: But in defence of his <hi>Nubes Testium</hi> we have an Answer that every way befits the Character of its <hi>Author:</hi> It is call'd,</p>

                           <p>And here the Controversy about St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Sermon was either ended or dropt, the <hi>Jesuit</hi> being now ferretted by the Second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of all his starting holes. But Mr. <hi>G.</hi> in his <hi>Primitive Fathers no Papists,</hi> taking into Consideration a Challenge, which the <hi>Jesuit</hi> had made him in one of his Letters about <hi>Invocation,</hi> published an Historical Discourse to prove that <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> was neither the Doctrine nor the Practice of the <hi>Primitive Fathers.</hi> Upon this the <hi>Jesuit</hi> begun again, after having taken a little breath, and in a whole Sheet undertakes to answer that large Historical Account, with this Title,</p>

Upon this the Jesuit, whose only stock is Confidence, being turn'd off by his Learned Adversary, was forc'd to address his next Reply to a Third Person, and pitcht upon Mr. <hi>Needham,</hi> because he had Licensed Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Third Letter to him; and directed a Letter to him with this Title,</p>

They look upon the very Name of it to be a kind of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> to them, and would be thought as heartily, as we our selves can desire, to detest the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it. But yet 'tis too evident to be deny'd, that our <hi>Charge</hi> is very justly brought against them; and by consequence that it ought not to be doubted, but that our <hi>Separation</hi> from them must have been most reasonable, if it can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be made appear, as we are perswaded we have plainly shewn, that we could not have continued in their <hi>Communion,</hi> without joyning with them in the <hi>Practice</hi> of one of the greatest of Sins, <hi>viz. Idolatry.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>

But before we come to the Particulars in which this <hi>Charge</hi> is brought against them, it is fit we should first state the general <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>IDOLATRY;</hi> and this has been effectually done, but very lately. The Reverend the <hi>Bishop of Oxon,</hi> having in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise which he published for the abrogating of the <hi>Test</hi> and <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> given us just occasion to do so. This Book is so well known, and the <hi>Answer</hi> to it was so lately published, that I shall not need say any thing more of either, but only add their Titles, which are these, <hi>viz.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="1">1. <hi>Reasons for Abrogating the</hi> Test.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. <hi>A Discourse concerning the</hi> Nature of Idolatry: <hi>In which a late</hi> Author'<hi>s true and only notion of</hi> Idolatry <hi>is consider'd and Confuted.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>I must not forget to observe also, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> in his <hi>Tract</hi> pretending to give a new and very strange Account of the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> that part of his Book received two particular Considerations, the one in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Reverend Dean</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Book, Entituled, <hi>The Council of</hi> Trent <hi>examined and disproved by Catholic Tradition:</hi> The other in a Learned Discourse, under this Title,</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Transubstantiation <hi>the</hi> Peculiar Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Church of Rome.</p>
                              <p>I am told we owe this Book to a very ingenious <hi>Nonconformist;</hi> and as we cannot but thank him for the <hi>Discourse</hi> he has given us, so he deserves to be thanked for his design of answering the other part of the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Book about the <hi>Nature of Idolatry;</hi> in which he was prevented, as I am told, by the other <hi>Discourse</hi> about the <hi>Nature of Idolatry</hi> coming out while that good design was under his hands. I cannot but wish that our <hi>Brethren</hi> had begun sooner to assist us in such a large <hi>Controversie</hi> as we have been obliged to manage, and that others amongst them would follow the Example, which this Learned Author has so worthily set before them.</p>

Another <hi>Writer</hi> hath given us a very ingenious short <hi>Answer</hi> to both parts of the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s Book, and calls it,</p>

                           <p>I shall mention but one Particular more, on which we have of late, as heretofore, been attack'd by those of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and effectually Vindicated our selves, both against their Calumnies, and their Reasons; and that is as to the <hi>Validity</hi> of <hi>OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS</hi> in the <hi>Church of England.</hi>

                           <p>THE Occasion of reviving this Matter, was given by a little <hi>Scurrilous Libel</hi> that went abroad, under the name of,
<q>
                                 <hi>The</hi> Church of England <hi>truly</hi> Represented.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>And in Reply to whose Calumnies, Three Discourses have been Published, two of them new, the other only <hi>reprinted,</hi> viz.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>A</hi> Vindication <hi>of the</hi> Ordinations <hi>of the</hi> Church of England; <hi>in answer to a Paper written by one of the</hi> Church of Rome, <hi>to prove the Nullity of our Orders.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>A Defence of the</hi> Ordinations <hi>and</hi> Ministry <hi>of the</hi> Church of England; <hi>in Answer to the Scandals raised or revived against them, in several late Pamphlets, and particularly in one intituled, The</hi> Church of England <hi>truly Represented,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

But this Subject hath been most largely and learnedly handled by the Learned Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> of S. <hi>John</hi>'s College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in his Sermon <hi>ad Clerum;</hi> and in another Sermon Preached before the University on <hi>Commencement Sunday;</hi> Translated into <hi>Latin;</hi> and both together Printed at <hi>Cambridge</hi> under this Title.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Concio ad Clerum habita coram Academia Cantabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giensi</hi> Junii 11. An. 1687. <hi>pro Gradu Baccal in S.

                           <p>I hear the worthy Author hath been very earnestly requested to Translate these <hi>Latin</hi> Sermons into <hi>English;</hi> and I am told, that he delays it only upon the account of some Answer that the Papists have been talking they would give to them, being desirous to make his Translation and Vindication one trouble. I cannot therefore but in the behalf of those who are so desirous to have these Sermons in <hi>English,</hi> request our Adversaries, That if they have any thing to say to them, they would make a little more haste with it. And for the mighty Master of Controversie, who I hear hath resolved to answer a Paragraph in one of them, I must needs tell him, That Nine Months is more by Eight and an half, than an ordinary Controvertist would have taken to answer such a Piece in.</p>
                           <p>But in this Controversie we have not been merely upon the Defensive Part, but have attack'd their <hi>Orders,</hi> as well as defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our own. This a Learned Man of our Church hath done in a Book under this Title,</p>

                           <p>This is indeed a new way of answering Books, and becoming the busie, assuming spirit of that <hi>Society.</hi> One would wonder, after so little Success as they have hitherto met with in these Encounters, what should move this <hi>Reverend Father</hi> to be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to come into the same List with <hi>Goodwin, Pulton,</hi> and a few others of the same <hi>Character.</hi> For tho abundance of <hi>Noise</hi> in a <hi>Conference,</hi> and of <hi>Misrepresentation</hi> after, may help out a <hi>weak Cause,</hi> and an <hi>Illiterate Defender</hi> of it, when they are sure before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of the person for whose sake it is held; yet methinks they should be more wary than to run upon such Hazards, where, in all probability, they are not like either to gain their <hi>Proselyte,</hi> or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36811:625"/>
to have the opportunity of these kind of <hi>Subterfuges</hi> to assist them.</p>
                           <p>However, tho I have neither the Honour to know the <hi>Lady,</hi> or the <hi>Author</hi> of that Letter; yet for this good <hi>Father</hi>'s satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I will venture for once to promise him, That if her <hi>Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> does desire it, not only the <hi>Author</hi> of that Letter will be ready to meet him, but to shew how willing we are to encourage a hopeful Design, let him chuse his <hi>Gownman</hi> between <hi>Blackwall</hi> and <hi>Hide-park Corner,</hi> and I dare say there is not one among them all that on this or any other occasion will decline to shew him how little reason he has for his forwardness.</p>
                           <p>I am now hastning to an <hi>End</hi> of this <hi>Undertaking;</hi> and, I think I cannot better <hi>finish</hi> it, than with a short Account of a <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> which made no small Noise in the World, between the <hi>Reverend</hi> Dr. <hi>Tenison,</hi> and Father <hi>Pulton</hi> the <hi>Jesuit.</hi>

                           <p>About <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last they met at a House in <hi>Long-Acre,</hi> on the acount of a Boy whom Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> had perverted from our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Great things were presently talked, as usual on such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, concerning this <hi>Conference;</hi> and the <hi>Papists</hi> fail'd not to boast of a <hi>mighty Conquest</hi> made over the <hi>Doctor.</hi> This forced him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve on a <hi>Publication</hi> of what passed, tho otherwise as little fit, as designed to be communicated to the world. Each Party set forth his own Account, and first Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> his, in two Books, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</p>

                           <p>Dr. <hi>Tenison</hi>'s was Entituled,</p>

This was followed on the <hi>Jesuit</hi>'s part, with a new <hi>Discourse,</hi> called,</p>

                           <p>To which Dr. <hi>Tenison</hi> reply'd in a second Treatise, <hi>viz.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>As for what is added in Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s 3d. Treatise in Answer to <hi>A. Cressener,</hi> the meaning of it is this: Mr. <hi>Cressener</hi> a Schoolmaster, being present at the <hi>Conference,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> in his account of it, gave him some occasion to complain of his <hi>Relation,</hi> as to that part of it which concerned him; and therefore, to justifie himself, he published a short <hi>Treatise,</hi> to which Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> there refers, <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </p>

                           </p>
                           <p>And thus this <hi>Controversie</hi> ended; but yet I must not leave it, till I have taken notice of another that it begat, and that no less memorable than the foregoing. For upon the occasion of this <hi>Conference,</hi> a Paper was taken notice of much used by the puny <hi>Controvertists</hi> of our days, called,</p>

1. Speculum Ecclesiasticum: <hi>Or an</hi> Ecclesiastical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Glass:</p>
                           <p>Written, as we are told, by a Souldier of that Party, <hi>T. Ward;</hi> and to which Dr. <hi>Tenison</hi> procured a young Man, a Friend of his, to write an <hi>Answer;</hi> which he did, Entituled,</p>

                           <p>But before this was published, the Doctor obtained a Copy of a <hi>Defence</hi> which the Soldier had prepared of his Quotations, but was not yet come from the <hi>Press;</hi> and to finish all at once, an <hi>Answer</hi> was set forth to that too at the same time ere it could appear abroad in the world. This the Soldier resented, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed his sense of it in a Letter to Dr. <hi>Tenison;</hi> which, together with a <hi>Reply</hi> to it, were published under the Title of,</p>

                           <p>Having now run through the several Heads of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy</hi> that have of late exercised the Pens of our Learned Men in Defence of our <hi>Religion,</hi> it may not be amiss to stop here awhile, and by a brief Recapitulation of the Whole, see what more remains to a compleat <hi>Vindication</hi> of our Selves against all the <hi>Tricks</hi> and <hi>Artifices,</hi> as well as against the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> of our Adversaries.</p>
                           <p>IT is sufficiently evident from the foregoing <hi>Collection,</hi> what slender Returns those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> have made to the many excellent <hi>Discourses,</hi> which themselves (without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of ours) have extorted from us. And what prejudice they have hereby done to their Religion, I am confident they themselves are not unsensible. I need not say what a Number of <hi>Disputes</hi> they have altogether let fall; how many of our <hi>Books,</hi> to this day, remain <hi>Un-answered,</hi> and are ever likely to be so. In a word, what Trifles many times they have set forth under the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant <hi>Title</hi> of FULL ANSWERS to those they have thought fit to take Notice of. And now at last, to compleat all, they seem to have utterly deserted the <hi>Controversie;</hi> and, too late, to see that <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> are not to be run down by those who are utterly destitute of the <hi>One,</hi> and, as far as we may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to guess by their performances, have but very slender pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to the <hi>Other.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The truth is, <hi>Popery</hi> is a Religion fit only for an <hi>Inquisition</hi> to maintain, and <hi>Dragoons</hi> to propagate. <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Barbarity</hi> brought it into the World; <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> maintain and keep it up: No sooner did <hi>Learning</hi> begin to revive, but <hi>Popery</hi> began immediately to decay; and ever since, the <hi>One</hi> has still decreased in proportion, as the <hi>Other</hi> has flourish'd. And to think at this
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36811:627"/>
time a day seriously to dispute a <hi>Nation</hi> so resolute and knowing as Ours, again into the Errors of it, plainly shews either that our <hi>Adversaries</hi> have a very mean Opinion of <hi>our Understandings,</hi> or I am sure deserve that we should have no very great one of <hi>theirs.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But whatever they once may have flatter'd themselves withal, I am confident they now begin to be satisfied, That <hi>Popery</hi> is a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> that will not thrive in our <hi>Northern Climate.</hi> And tho they are pleased sometimes to divert themselves with our <hi>Divisions,</hi> and, it may be, did from thence conceive some hopes of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Interest amongst us; yet I doubt not but they now see, that we are not so much <hi>divided</hi> amongst <hi>our selves,</hi> as we are all of us heartily <hi>united</hi> against <hi>them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As for the <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> how firmly they have adhered to the <hi>Protestant Interest,</hi> is not unknown to any. Their <hi>Preaching,</hi> their <hi>Conversation,</hi> but, above all, their <hi>Writings</hi> declare it to the World: And how fouly, by consequence, they were heretofore either <hi>mistaken,</hi> or <hi>misrepresented,</hi> when they were exposed by some (who I believe wish'd them so) as <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>Masquerade,</hi> or at least as <hi>Popishly affected.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Never perhaps was there a <hi>Controversie</hi> more successfully mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged than this has been in these late Years. Till now, these <hi>Points</hi> were handled in such a manner, that if the <hi>Learned</hi> applauded the performance, yet the <hi>Vulgar</hi> were but little the better for it. But in these <hi>Discourses,</hi> Strength of Argument, and Plainness of Discourse seem to vie with one another. The <hi>Arguments</hi> so sound, as to convince all Gain-sayers; and yet the <hi>Plainness</hi> so great, that the meanest Persons may comprehend the force of them. And thus have they pursued not one or two <hi>Points,</hi> but I may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably say, the <hi>whole Controversy</hi> betwixt us. Insomuch that from henceforth we may well excuse them any farther trouble, till either our <hi>Adversaries</hi> shall think fit to answer their <hi>Discourses,</hi> or to advance some other <hi>Arguments</hi> than those which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been obviated and confuted.</p>
                           <p>But indeed there is no great likelihood of either of these; and I dare venture to promise my <hi>Reader,</hi> that let those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> attacque him where they please, let them in writing or discourse offer what they are able to him, he shall here in this

                           <p>And now after so full an Account of these <hi>Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and of the several <hi>Controversies</hi> that have been handled in them; I have only remaining for the <hi>Close</hi> of all, to give a short Account of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Undertaking in which our <hi>Divines</hi> are at this time engaged; and which being finished, I do not see what more can be desired in order to our full Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this Matter.</p>
                           <p>I Have before recounted how by a joint Labour they run through the Consideration of the pretended <hi>Notes</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> on which the <hi>Romanists</hi> establish their usurped <hi>Authority.</hi> No sooner were those ended, but they presently resolved upon another, and a more useful Project, which was to search into our <hi>Adversaries Books;</hi> and collect all those <hi>Passages</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> which are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged by them to maintain their Errors. And by giving the true Explication of them, at once to secure their Flock from their false <hi>Glosses,</hi> and let them into a better understanding of those <hi>Sacred Books.</hi> In this Undertaking they have already made a considerable Advance, as will appear by the following Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue:</p>
                           <p n="1">1. POPERY <hi>not founded on</hi> SCRIPTURE: <hi>Or, The</hi> Texts <hi>which</hi> Papists <hi>cite out of the</hi> Bible <hi>for the Proof of the</hi> Points of THEIR RELIGI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON, <hi>examined, and shewed to be alledged without Ground.</hi>

                        </opener>
                        <p>
                           <hi>HAving perused your Letter to the</hi> Continuator <hi>of the</hi> Present State of our Controversie, <hi>I perceive, that you are mightily concern'd at the</hi> Historical Discourse concerning Tradition, <hi>which he mentioned to be writing, and that you</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Letter to the Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 13.</note> would gladly find some way to save our Friends this vast la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and excuse them from this Impossible Task <hi>[of answering you]. I quickly apprehended your meaning, that you had a great desire not to be answered; and therefore in pure Complaisance to you, the first time I met with the Author of the</hi> Historical Discourse, <hi>I desired him, in yours and my own Name, that he would excuse himself the writing of that Book, and told him, That I understood by your Letter, that you would take it extreamly kindly at his hands, if he would not give himself the trouble of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But this Courtship would do no good upon him; so that I was forc'd to alter my strain, and began to threaten him;</hi> Sir, <hi>said I,</hi> if you dare to answer Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> he will be reveng'd of you, for he has a plaguy sharp Pen, and will not spare you. <hi>All the answer I had to my Threats, was to be laught at, he assuring me he would venture that. Upon this, I told him, it was no jesting matter; that if he did provoke you, you would turn the</hi> rough side of your Tongue <hi>to him; and ask'd him, whether he could digest the being call'd</hi> Rogue, <hi>or</hi> Lyar, <hi>or</hi> Mad Dog? <hi>his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36811:634"/>
was, that he could not very well: why then, said I, Look you, Sir, you shall have these, and ten times worse, if you dare to answer Mr.</hi> Sergeant; <hi>and upon this I out with your Letter, and shew'd him how smartly you could handle your Pen. How will you like, Sir, quoth I, to be call'd</hi> hot brain'd <note n="b" place="margin">Letter to the Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 1.</note> Calvinist in Masquerade, par boyl'd by the scalding Zeal against Popery; into a stanch Protestant? <hi>To be call'd</hi> 
                           <note n="c" place="margin">P. 2.</note> a wilful and bold Calumniator? <hi>To be told, you are</hi> a Careless, <note n="d" place="margin">P. 2.</note> Open, and Confident Liar? <hi>To be nick-nam'd,</hi> a Knight of the Post, <hi>that writes</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, shame, or wit? <hi>To have your Book call'd,</hi> 
                           <note n="e" place="margin">P. 3.</note> a little ridiculously malicious Satyr, wholly made up of Vapour, Insolence, silly Amplifications, Ironies, Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, and open Falshoods? <hi>To be nick nam'd,</hi> a Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites with a <note n="f" place="margin">P. 5.</note> steel'd Impudence? <hi>Sir, said I, if Mr.</hi> Sergeant <hi>could bestow all these Complements in so very few Pages upon the</hi> Continuator, <hi>for no reason in the world, what must you expect, if you should dare to provoke him by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer? Be wise then, and learn so much Wit as to sleep in a whole skin, and thank me for my good Advice. Now would you think it, Mr.</hi> Sergeant, <hi>that any man could have dar'd to have withstood all this! And yet this strange man did, and bragg'd withal, that neither this, nor more than this, should fright him from answering you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I had but one other Argument left to persuade him, and concluded, that it would do his business for him. Well, Sir, said I, to be short with you, why will you run your head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Wall? Mr.</hi> Sergeant <hi>does assure me, that his</hi> Fifth Letter is <note n="g" place="margin">P. 5.</note> an Elaborate Discourse, <hi>and that it is (in one word)</hi> 
                           <note n="h" place="margin">P. 8.</note> Unanswerable; <hi>why then will you be medling with a Book that</hi> cannot be disprov'd, <hi>that is</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable? <hi>I always took you for a prudent man, shew it now, and let Mr.</hi> Sergeant <hi>alone: for he says,</hi> the Best <note n="i" place="margin">P. 8.</note>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:36811:635"/>
Wits of our Nation have <hi>also declared in his favour, that</hi> his Letters are unanswerable: <hi>(k) That he is inform'd his</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> Fifth Letter, <hi>in particular, has sold so well, that there are not an hundred left of them. Nay more, that</hi> F. W. <hi>had said, that</hi> these <hi>same</hi> Letters <hi>(which you will be daring to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with)</hi> had laid Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> so flat, that he would never be able to rise again. <hi>And can you not be quiet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing the best Wits of the Nation, and</hi> F. Warner, <hi>a</hi> Jesuit, <hi>upon your head? They have declared already against you, and they will in honour stand up for</hi> John Sergeant, <hi>and then what will become of you? But all this was lost, Mr.</hi> Sergeant, <hi>upon him, and was so far from silencing him, that he seem'd to grow proud of having the honour of baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling</hi> John Sergeant, <hi>and the</hi> Best Wits <hi>of our Nation: And for</hi> F. Warner, <hi>he had like to have call'd him F—for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to take Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet's <hi>Name into his mouth, who had so lately, and so thoroughly expos'd him in his</hi> Appendix <hi>to the</hi> Council of Trent's Examination.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In short, As to the selling of your Letter, he told me, that if he were not mis-inform'd, 'tis no great wonder your</hi> Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller <hi>should not have above an</hi> Hundred <hi>remaining, seeing there were but 300. in all Printed, and those at your own cost, and a considerable number of which you gave in Presents to your Friends, who therefore were obliged, in Gratitude, to commend it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And now Mr.</hi> Sergeant, <hi>you see what pains I have taken in your behalf; and tho the</hi> Continuator <hi>neglects you, and this other</hi> Author <hi>defies you, yet that your Letter has not been without some effect upon me. What the issue of it will be, we shall see in a little time, as soon as this</hi> Historical Discourse concerning Tradition <hi>comes out: In the mean while, all I can further do, is heartily to wish you, what I fear you will much more need than the</hi> Continuator <hi>do's</hi> Sincerity, <hi>A</hi> Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cause, <hi>and a more</hi> Civil Pen; <hi>and remain, Sir,</hi>
