            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My Lords, There are two Parts that are in this great Charge, there is a General, which is the Subverſion of the whole Nation, the King Himſelf to be Murdered, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion to be Suppreſſed, War to be introduced, and thoſe other things that are expreſſed in the Articles. This General is charged in particular upon this Lord; And my Lords, it was in conſideration how far it was fit to meddle with this General at this particular Tryal. For if this Lord be guilty of ſuch Crimes, it will prove well enough that there was ſuch a Plot; but, my Lords, withall we did conſider when the firſt Diſcovery of this Plot was made, how
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105168:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
afterwards it took cold, how rumors were raiſed againſt it, how there were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſuppreſs the belief of it, and therefore my Lords, we do conceive that it is fit we should firſt ſettle that, that there was a general Plot, a Plot of ſuch a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the Articles expreſs.</p>
                              <p>Some Objections we thought there might be raiſed, becauſe it hath been ſo long in the World, ſome years now ſince the Diſcovery of it, ſome perſons, that is ſome ten or eleven Proſecuted and Atatinted for it, and therefore that might have been ſatisfaction enough that ſuch a Plot there was; beſides, that there have been publick Declarations of the Particulars to the World; But being now to proceed before your Lordships in a judicial way; We did think fit, and we hope your Lordships will approve of it, to ſpend ſome time in the Proof of the general Plot, which we hope will be to the ſatisfaction of your Lordships and the whole World; for we do not think that <hi>England</hi> only looks into this days Tryal, but the whole World one way or other, the whole Chriſtian World is concerned in it. My Lords, after the Publication of theſe things, (which were not judicial) how far your Lordships will believe them as Judges, we know not, we will prove it now, that their Policies and Contrivances may be laid open to the World; And firſt we offer it to your Lordships, becauſe we have made it part of the Charge: And ſecondly we shall do it, becauſe we think your Lordships are not obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve things that are in Print, till we prove them by Witneſſes judicially before you. But the main Reaſon why we do it is, becauſe we would touch upon thoſe Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that have been uſed to make this ſeem as if it were a kind of State Plot, I know not what to call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>When that <hi>Oats</hi> firſt made a Diſcovery, it ſeems it had not that weight, that we think now it will clearly have with your Lordships; and had not the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> followed in the Neck of it, the World as it was aſleep would have lain ſo, but that awaked us.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, it fell out in this Caſe as it did in another, when <hi>Cateline</hi> the Traytor was a great way off <hi>Rome,</hi> and four other Lords with him, <hi>Caſſius, Cethegus</hi> and others, five in all, it came to paſs, that as the great Orator that was at that time ſaid, <hi>Many were ſo ignorant that they would not think it, many were ſo unwiſe they would not believe it; ſome ſo ill that they would favour it; &amp; ſome ſo much worſe that they did Foſter it: but all of them in not believing it, gave ſtrength to the Conſpiracy &amp; the Treaſon.</hi> And ſo it did here, for we look not upon our ſelves as diſcharg'd from the Treaſon when Diſcover'd, but when Prevented.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, another Reaſon to induce us into the Proof of the main Plot is this, We do not look upon it as a particular Offence, as if one Lord was only to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned and appear before your Lordships judicially for it; he is indeed only before you at this time to receive his Tryal, and your Judgment: But my Lords, this is a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105168:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Treaſon of a Faction, and of a general Party in the Nation, 'tis not this or that Lord, but a great number; 'tis not this or that Lord that is mentioned in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, but the Conſpiracy is of a great Faction. This we do think, and this makes us ſo earneſt to preſs the general before your Lordships, that we may give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to your Lordships and the World what this Plot hath been; and how carried on every where.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, The Conſequence of that is very great; for my Lords, if there were a general Deſign, and a general Plot, as clearly there was, for ſome were to act in <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſome in <hi>France,</hi> ſome in other places, ſome in <hi>Ireland, Scotland</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> and a great number of Jeſuits, (we have a matter of Thirty in Chaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this buſineſs:) I ſay my Lords, if it be ſo, if one Action be in one place, and another in another, yet if there be a common Conſent to accomplish this Plot, then what the one does, is the Act of All, and the Act of All is the Act of every one.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, The Perſons were many, and the Places and Times many they acted in, and the Deſigns which they were to accomplish, and the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were to accomplish them were many too: Great, and wicked were their Deſigns to deſtroy our King, to take him out of the World; and why? upon hopes of better times to them under him that should ſucceed him. Another part of the Deſign was, to deſtroy, not this or that man that ſtood in their way, but the whole Body of the Proteſtants here in <hi>England;</hi> not a Murder, but a Maſſacre and a Slaughter of all whoſoever they were that came near them, and none were to eſcape, for if any meant to flee, they would be ſure to cut them off; nay, not only to deſtroy our King, though that be the greateſt Offence that our Law can take hold off, but to deſtroy our Religion, and to deſtroy us, becauſe of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligon.</p>
                              <p>To accomplish this (that we may open the generals of it) Arms were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, Men to be raiſed, an Army was formed in effect, and who to Lead, and who to Command, and who to pay; But my Lords, not only were Arms to be had here among our ſelves, but a <hi>French</hi> Aid muſt be fetch'd in, Aſſiſtance from <hi>France</hi> muſt come too, Intelligences and Letters are written, and Correſpondencies had, and Aids promiſed by the Miniſters from thence.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, 'Tis a ſtrange thing that <hi>Engliſh</hi> men should contrive to have an Invaſion of Strangers upon their own Country, and ſurely they are the worſt Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots in the world that were ſo zealous to deſtroy their own Nation, and they were not wiſe ſure, to think, that if the <hi>French</hi> did come in, they should continue great Lords or great Men, and yet thus it was in general; It is very ſtrange that it should enter into the heart of any man to deſtroy ſo many perſons: But my Lords, if we look upon what did incourage them, and what confirmed them in this Deſign, and what they have published to the world about their Religion, we shall not wonder at it, ſince they tell us 'tis lawful to kill an Heretick King, and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105168:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King of <hi>England</hi> is an Heretick they ſay, and ſo declared, ſo that whoſoever would Kill him, did a lawful and pious piece of Service to God; Nay, not only ſo, but a Meritorious and Glorious one too, for which they may be Canonized for Saints.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, we find it is no new thing, look into all the Nations where the Pope hath any Power, or a poſſibility of hope to gain a Power, nothing hath been able to ſtand in their way, but they have broken through all the Bonds of Nature, and other Obligations to attain their Ends. Look into <hi>Spain,</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> there removed his own Son, by what means the Story tells us, he was Heir apparent, but he was a Proteſtant: and there alſo the Father puts Fire to his own Daughter becauſe she was a Proteſtant, there a <hi>Spaniard</hi> goes from <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> to murder, and did murder his Brother for no other cauſe but becauſe he was a Proteſtant. Leave <hi>Spain</hi> and go into <hi>France,</hi> what Maſſacres have been committed there under the colour of a Marriage in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, and before that how many hundred <hi>Albingenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes</hi> have been put to the Sword for Religion. Come we to our own Country, and look into <hi>England</hi> what hath been done here, when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had a Succeſſor of another Religion, how many Attempts were there made upon her Perſon to bring that Succeſſor in? When King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown let us remember the <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon,</hi> wherein all the Nation was to be deſtroyed, King, Lords, and Commons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in Parliament aſſembled were then to be a Sacrifice, a Burnt-offering, though they might call it a Peace-offering: for theſe Gentlemen are for Sacrifices of Blood as Peace-offerings, to reconcile us to the Pope. If this be made out, we think, their Principles having produced theſe fruits in other Ages, we may believe they would do ſo now.</p>
                              <p>What has been ſaid as Hiſtory of former times is not offered as Evidence of Fact to the preſent Caſe, but induces a probability that what hath been done by ſuch perſons may be done by them again. But, my Lords, we shall make it clear, and bring it home to this Lord, that he hath had his Head, his Tongue, his Hand, his Heart and his Purſe in this damnable and horrible Contrivance and Treaſon for the deſtroying of the King, the Government, our Religion, and our Nation. We shall bring it home to him: But my part is only to open the general Conſpiracy. And indeed my Lords, it is an heavy burden on my aged Shoulders, conſidering that the Winter of Infirmity and Age is growing ſo faſt upon me.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, the particulars concerning this Noble Lord, becauſe the Credit of it reſts on the Teſtimony only of one man, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony being taken by Sir <hi>Edmunbury Godfrey</hi> a Juſtice of Peace, and kept in writing by him, then Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was way-laid, and murdered by men of the Popish Religion, thereby to ſuppreſs the Examination that he had taken.</p>
                              <p>This ſtartled and opened the eyes of the world to look about us for farther Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105168:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leſt we should be led as <hi>Oxen to the ſlaughter not knowing whether we went.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Afterward it pleaſed God to bring ſome of their own Religion and party to make farther Diſcovery. Whereupon ſeveral Jeſuits Guilty of the Plot were therefore Proſecuted and brought to Judgment and Death.</p>
                              <p>After the Murder of <hi>Godfrey</hi> ſeveral Fables were ſpread abroad, as if he were alive and Married, as was declared to ſeveral Lords, others of the party Reported he had Murdered himſelf; but his Body being found; it was hard for the party to invent or tell, whether he firſt ſtrangled himſelf, and then run himſelf through, or firſt run himſelf through, and then ſtrangled himſelf; that was a <hi>Dilemma</hi> to diſprove their Fables touching <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s Murder.</p>
                              <p>It then fell out, that Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> came as a ſecond Diſcoverer, whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony Concurred with <hi>Oats.</hi> And then there being two Witneſſes, as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in caſe of Treaſon, the Deſign was to take off <hi>Bedlow</hi> that there should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main but one, a ſingle Witneſs. In order to which <hi>Reading</hi> tempts <hi>Bedlow</hi> with Rewards to leſſen his former Teſtimony, and qualifies that which he had depoſed poſitively was but matter of hear ſay; For which <hi>Reading</hi> the Inſtrument in that Deſign and Attempt, was Indicted and Convicted by three Witneſſes, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered accordingly.</p>
                              <p>But then this Attempt upon <hi>Bedlow</hi> failing, the next Attempt was to take off <hi>Oats</hi> his Teſtimony, by charging him with an Infamous offence; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one <hi>Knox</hi> is imployed, who Suborns <hi>Lane</hi> and <hi>Oſborn,</hi> and they Swore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Oats.</hi> But on Re-examination Confeſs the Subornation and Falshood of their Deſign: and <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> are therefore Indicted and found Guilty.</p>
                              <p>Thus when the Treaſon was diſcovered, the Murder of an Officer of Juſtice is made the means to hide it, and then Falſe and Infamous ſtories ſet on Foot of that Officer to hide that Murder; and Perjury and Subornation the means to blaſt the Diſcoverers.</p>
                              <p>Theſe wicked and ill practices we take to be a ſecond reproof of the Plot both in general and particular, the Records of which Convictions are here before your Lordships ready to be proved. For <hi>Cui bono?</hi> none would do ſuch wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices but to hide a greater Sin and worſe Deſigns if poſſible will be opened, and proved by one to whom that is particularly appointed.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, we ſpeak this that the World may receive Satisfaction we will let our Evidence be all open and publick in the face of the Sun, and shew we go not about by private Subornations, though there are endeavours to encounter us by ſuch.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, If we make out theſe things, here is Matter enough for the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the World as to the general Contrivance; But my Lords, As you ſit here as Judges of this Lord, the Priſoner at the Bar, we muſt bring it down to particular Perſons, and we shall do it even to him that thoſe things which were mentioned in General were his Contrivance at leaſt-wiſe, as a man highly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

deeply guilty of Conſpiring the Kings Death, and in order to that, of raiſing an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the other things that have been opened.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, I beſeech you to pardon me if I have troubled you too long; The Particulars were many, and I have had little help to prepare it from any body but my ſelf, but I ſubmit my ſelf to your Lordships, and hope that what is wanting in me will be ſupplyed by others that follow; and I alſo hope you will find no defect in our Evidence at all, whatſoever may have been in the opening of it.</p>

                                 <salute>My Lords,</salute>
                              </opener>
                              <p>I Shall begin where Mr. Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> ended, and confine my ſelf to this Caſe as it ſtands before you, and to open the particular Evidence relating to the Lord, the now Priſoner at the Bar.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, I look upon the Cauſe of this day to be the Cauſe of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and I doubt not but that Plot which has alarm'd all Chriſtendom, will be ſo clearly made out in this Tryal, that the moſt malicious of our Enemies will henceforth want Confidence to deny it.</p>
                              <p>That the Religion of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> does countenance and encourage the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Princes, the Maſſacring of ſuch as they miſcall Hereticks, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of all ſorts of Impiety in order to promote their Superſtitions, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, has been mentioned by the Gentleman who ſpoke before me, and I should miſpend time to ſay more of a truth ſo well known in ſo great and ſo learned a Preſence. I will therefore directly apply my ſelf to the Buſineſs of the day, to repreſent to your Lordships our Evidence of the Plot in general, and of the Guilt of this Lord at the Bar in particular.</p>
                              <p>In order to which, I shall crave your Lordships leave that I may uſe this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod;</p>
                              <p>Firſt, To shew what advantageous opportunities the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had to enter into, and undertake this great and deteſtable Conſpiracy.</p>
                              <p>Secondly, To prove the reality of the Plot in general, which I look upon as a very eaſie undertaking.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly, To ſtate the particular Evidence againſt the Priſoner at the Bar by which he will appear to have been one of the principal Conſpirators in this horrid Deſign, to murder our Soveraign, (whom God preſerve) to extirpate the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Religion, and to ſubvert totally the Government and Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, To shew what extraordinary Advantages the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon this Conſpiracy, will very naturally lead us into our Proof of it, and therefore I shall ſpeak ſomewhat to that in the firſt place. It is not unknown
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105168:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to your Lordships, or to any others who have in the leaſt degree inquired into Affairs, that His Majeſty has been ſo unhappy as that (unawares to him) ſome Miniſters who have been <hi>Papiſts</hi> at the Bottom, and others that have drove on their Intereſt, have crept into his Councils, and thereby gave great opportunities to advance <hi>Popery.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>'Tis moſt true, that as ſoon as theſe ill Miniſters were detected, and their ill Deſigns diſcovered, His Majeſty did diſcharge them. But to the misfortune of the King and his People, as ill men have been recommended to ſucceed them, and came into their places.</p>
                              <p>In the next place, my Lords, There did appear in ſome men too eaſie and favourable a diſpoſition towards the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> They were grown ſtrangely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate towards theſe old Enemies of our Church and State. New Projects of Reconciling us were ſet on foot, and Books were written to diſtinguish the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> One of thoſe Books, which was printed the year before the Diſcovery of the Plot, pretends, That there ought to be a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence made between <hi>Papiſts</hi> of Loyal and Diſloyal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                                    <desc>•••</desc>
                                 </gap>nciples. This Book, as it was written more artificially than the reſt, and published in ſo critical and dangerous a juncture, deſerves, and I doubt not in time will have, a particular Conſideration. 'Tis eaſie to believe how great Encouragement this muſt give to the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> to ſee how very willing men were to meet them, and how freely the Pen was drawn in their favour.</p>
                              <p>Another great Encouragement, my Lords, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had, was, That by the means of thoſe Miniſters who were ſecretly of their Faction, whenſoever His Majeſty was pleaſed to command the Laws made againſt them in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> to be put in due Execution, his good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were fruſtrated, and the Severity of thoſe Laws was turned upon the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Diſſenters. This was a Maſterpiece of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only to divert from themſelves the edge of thoſe Laws which were deſigned againſt them; but to turn them upon the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and to make them uſeful to advance the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Intereſt. And when they had thus divided and diſtracted us, then was the faireſt time for them to attempt to deſtroy us utterly, and to make sharp their Weapons in order to a Maſſacre.</p>
                              <p>But, my Lords, That which gave the <hi>Papiſts</hi> the greateſt encouragement to enter into this deteſtable Conſpiracy, was, that they had (to the great unhappineſs of this Kingdom &amp; the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion) the expectation &amp; hopes of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor. This was an opportunity not to be loſt. They had abundant Experience of His Majeſties Firmneſs in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, both during his Exile and ſince his happy Reſtauration, and how reſolutely he had kept that Promiſe which he made in his Letter from <hi>Breda,</hi> That neither the Unkindneſs of ſome <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> nor the Civilities of ſome <hi>Papiſts</hi> should in the leaſt degree ſtartle him, or make him ſwerve from his Religion.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="20" facs="tcp:105168:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They therefore could have no hopes of arriving at their Point, the Re-eſtablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Church, whilſt the King liv'd; and it was too great a hazard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect His Majeſties Death by the Courſe of Nature: And therefore, like true <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> that would ſtick at no wickedneſs to accomplish their Deſigns, they threw off all Bonds of Loyalty and Allegiance, and reſolved to deſtroy our Soveraign, whoſe Life was the only Obſtacle in their way. This was the laſt and moſt wicked part of their Plot, which though it conſiſted of very many parts, yet this was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; and our Evidence againſt the Lord at the Bar will chiefly run to this part of the Deſign.</p>
                              <p>I have only mentioned ſome of thoſe Encouragements which the World plainly ſaw the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had, before the Plot was detected: But ſince the Diſcovery, it has been abundantly prov'd, that it had been carrying on for many years, and that ſo univerſally, that it is a wonderful thing it appeared no ſooner.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, I come now to our Evidence; and though it may ſeem unneceſſary to prove to your Lordships general Plot of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who are ſo well ſatisfied of it already, and have more than once declared ſo to the world; yet becauſe it is the moſt natural method for us, firſt to prove that there was a Conſpiracy, before we attempt to prove this Lord to have been one of the Conſpirators, we shall beg your leave as to that particular; and as we shall be careful not to take up too much of your time, ſo we well know your Lordships will allow us all the time neceſſary to give our Evidence.</p>
                              <p>We have many Records, things reduced to Judgment, whereby the Plot is moſt undoubtedly proved, and which are legal Evidences before your Lordships. The Attainders of ſeveral Jeſuits and Prieſts, the Attainder of <hi>Langhorn</hi> and of <hi>Coleman,</hi> whom I should have named in the firſt place. We have alſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of thoſe that were proſecuted for the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> and there is a Conviction, though not for Murder, yet for cutting the Throat of Mr. <hi>Arnold.</hi> 'Tis true he is not dead, yet, as to the publick, I count him murdered by the Papiſts, though he be alive in the world. My Lords, we have Convictions not only of Treaſons, Murders and cutting of Throats, but of almoſt all other Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies whatſoever. As of Attempts to ſuborn Witneſſes, and to ſcandalize the Kings Evidence; and to that we shall produce the Record concerning <hi>Readings</hi> attempt upon <hi>Bedlow;</hi> that concerning the Suborning of <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Lane</hi> to Swear Buggery againſt Dr. <hi>Oats:</hi> and the Conviction of <hi>Tasborough</hi> and <hi>Price</hi> to corrupt <hi>Dugdale,</hi> a principal Witneſs as to this Plot.</p>
                              <p>I only mention theſe particulars, my Lords, and certainly as you are a great Court of Record you will take notice of them. It would be a hard thing perhaps to ſpend the time in reading all, ſince all of them are made known to the world already, but we shall in the courſe of our Evidence produce them, and you may read ſuch of them as you pleaſe. All the uſe we make of them is for the proof of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105168:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
general Plot, which is requiſite to be done, for it will be hard to believe the Priſoner Guilty of the Plot, if there were no ſuch Plot at all.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, we shall make appear to you things which have not yet been brought into Judgment. In the year (76.) we shall prove by a Witneſs that was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and diſcourſed with <hi>Anderton, Campion, Green,</hi> and ſeveral other Prieſts and Jeſuits, that they did acquaint him that there would be great alteration in <hi>England</hi> ere long, that the King was a Heretick and Excommunicated, and might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and this Doctrine they continually and induſtriouſly preached. And they further ſaid, if once the King were removed, (who alone ſtood in the way) their Religion muſt needs flourish; for this Reaſon, (as the Witneſſes will ſpeak) that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was on their ſide.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, We shall prove, that they had in <hi>England</hi> men no leſs induſtrious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, ſome whereof have been Executed; <hi>Gavan</hi> by name, who made it his buſineſs to go up and down in ſeveral Counties of this Kingdom, to prove by Scripture, Councils, and Examples, That it was a lawful undertaking to kill His Majeſty. Theſe things I name, as neceſſary in order to introduce our particular Evidence, I am unwilling to dwell longer upon this point of the general Plot. I shall produce the Records, and produce our ſeveral Witneſſes, Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that will give you a full and plain Account of it.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, Having done with the general Plot, I come now to open the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Evidence againſt my Lord, the Priſoner at the Bar. As to him, my Lords, our Evidence ſtands not upon Conjectures, or upon meer Probability, becauſe this Lord is (as we well know) a zealous <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and hath owned himſelf ſo, but we have expreſs particular Proofs againſt his Perſon. My Lords, we have one Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to produce to your Lordships who will prove, that in <hi>September</hi> (78.) there was a Conſult of ſome Prieſts and other Conſpirators at <hi>Tixall</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe, for killing of the King, where my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And by a Diſcourſe in the ſame month, we shall prove what reaſons this Lord did give, why he and their Party undertook the Murdering of the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaid, That he and many Cathol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ck Families had no Recompence for their Loyalty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if any thing fell it was diſpoſed of to Rebels and Traytors. This he reſented deeply; but above all, the Obligation of his Conſcience and of his Religion perſuaded him to it, and confirmed him in his reſolution to go on in this horrid Deſign.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, we will go farther, and prove that this Lord offered 500<hi>l.</hi> out of his own Purſe to carry on the Plot, and particularly this part of it for killing the King. We shall produce to your Lordships a Witneſs to whom he made this offer, as looking upon him to be a faithful man, and having received ſo great a Character of him from one <hi>Evers</hi> a Prieſt, that he thought he might ſafely communicate the matter to him, and the Argument he urged to perſuade the Witneſs, beſides the 500<hi>l.</hi> which he ſaid upon his application to <hi>Harcou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                                 <hi>Ireland</hi> they should pay him, was this, that others as well as he was employed in the ſame Deſign, that it was the only way to eſtablish the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion in <hi>England,</hi> that he would lay an everlaſting obligation upon all the Perſons of that Perſuaſion, and that he should not only have his Pardon, but be Canonized for it.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, This is the ſubſtance of the Teſtimony of the firſt Witneſs which we shall produce againſt my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> and that is ſo expreſs as <hi>I</hi> think it can hardly be anſwered.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, Our next Witneſs ſays thus; (for I shall but open the ſubſtance of what they ſay) In <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> 1678. there were ſeveral Letters from this Lord at the Bar, to the Jeſuits in <hi>London,</hi> in which his Lordship did declare, his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to ſerve them in their great Deſign; and in <hi>June</hi> (78.) the latter end of the month, my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> came to Mr. <hi>Fenwicks</hi> Chamber in <hi>Drury-Lane,</hi> (he went not then by the name of my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> but by the name of Mr. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> of <hi>Effingham)</hi> and there he did receive a Commiſſion from <hi>Fenwick</hi> to be Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter-General of the Army which was to be raiſed for the carrying on the Plot. His Lordship told them he was then going into the Country, but he hoped he should ſoon hear from them, that they had done the buſineſs, at leaſt, that it would be done before his Lordship did return. To which <hi>Fenwick</hi> made anſwer; Your Lordship muſt look after the buſineſs as well as other Perſons, and there will be need of ſome to Countenance it in Town; thereupon the Lord, the Priſoner at the Bar, ſaid, That they had been often deceived by this Prince and been patient with him, but they would bear no longer, but were now reſolved to do the Work without delay, for their patience was worn out. Several other particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the Witneſſes will acquaint your Lordships withal, which I shall not take up your time with.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, We have a third Witneſs as conſiderable and particular as any of the reſt, one that lived three years in the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> Houſe, had his Education there, and was perſuaded by that Lady and by one <hi>Morgan</hi> a Jeſuit to become a Fryer, and to that end was ſent to <hi>Doway;</hi> But not liking to continue at <hi>Doway,</hi> (he will tell you the reaſon why) he eſcaped to <hi>France,</hi> and at <hi>Paris</hi> came to his Brother, a Benedictine Monk there, who adviſed him to go for <hi>England.</hi> But whilſt he ſtaid at <hi>Paris,</hi> this Gentleman, by the means of his Brother and other Prieſts, grew into a great ſamiliarity with my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> who was then in <hi>France,</hi> and who at laſt came to have ſuch a great Confidence in him, that his Lordship could not hold, but told him, that though he had diſobliged all his Friends by his going away from <hi>Doway,</hi> yet he had ſomething to propoſe to him which would be a means to reconcile him to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>s Friends, and bring him into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerment, and into the friendship of all good Catholicks, whom he would oblige by it. The Gentleman was willing to embrace ſo happy an opportunity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know what it was, could procure him ſo great a good; My Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, told him, It was a thing of very great Importance, and,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105168:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after having required from him all poſſible obligations of Secrecy, he told him plainly what great benefits would accrew to himſelf, and what advantage to the Catholick Cauſe, if he would make himſelf and the Nation happy by undertaking to kill the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was an Heretick, and conſequently a Rebel to God Almighty. My Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did believe the Witneſſes did embrace this propoſal warmly, and therefore directed him to prepare to go for <hi>England,</hi> and to go before hand from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Deep,</hi> where he would meet him, and go over with him. But it ſeems my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> met with ſome diverſion, for he did not keep his word with him in coming, and ſo this Gentleman, being diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, went over without him; but fearing to be called upon to the ſame Service, he returned back again ſuddenly, and went into the <hi>French</hi> Army.</p>
                              <p>My Lords, We shall produce theſe Witneſſes againſt the Lord at the Bar, and when they have proved to your Lordships what I have opened, any one, who was not acquainted with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party, would believe they would be at a loſs how to acquit themſelves from this Charge. All manner of foul and indirect practices have been uſed by them to Terrifie, to Corrupt and to Scandalize our Witneſſes; all manner of Objections have been made to our Evidence. If the Witneſs does not come up to ſpeak directly to every Point, we are told, he ſays nothing at all; if he ſpeaks directly, they cry, he is not to be believed. Thus they have a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy anſwer to every Witneſs that has been, or ever shall be produced, either that he ſays nothing Material, or that nothing that he ſays ought to have any Credit.</p>
                              <p>But we doubt not, by this Tryal before your Lordships, if we cannot ſtop their mouths, at leaſt to convince all the World beſides, of the reality of this Plot.</p>
                              <p>It will be no wonder if their Confidence goes on ſtill to frame Cavils, They are uſed to ſcandalize the Government, and they cannot give it over. How often has His Majeſty under his Great Seal, published and declared this Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy? How often has he preſs'd His Parliaments to go on to bring the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators to Punishment, and at the opening of this very Parliament, he ſays plainly, That he does not believe himſelf ſafe from their Deſigns. Your Lordships alſo have Voted the unqueſtionable Truth of the Plot, and ſo have the Commons; yet theſe men are ſo hardy, as ſtill to deny the plaineſt Truth ſo confirm'd as this hath been.</p>
                              <p>Nay, My Lords, Their Malice goes yet farther, for they have been ſo Bold as to whiſper up and down, and induſtriouſly to ſpread Reports before the Trial, as if this Lord at the Bar, and the reſt who are Impeached should certainly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. We do hope to be able to detect the Authors of this great Scandal, and the Commons doubt not of your Lordships Concurrence to aſſiſt them in bringing them to their deſerved Punishment. This is ſure, the firſt time that ever any ſort of men preſumed to Reflect upon the Juſtice of this High and Noble
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105168:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Court. Your Anceſtors, my Lords, did by their Honour, Courage, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, preſerve our Anceſtors: The advantage of which, We, who are deſcended from them, do now enjoy, and We shall never have occaſion to doubt in the leaſt, but that your Lordships will tread in their ſteps. You have in your hands a great Opportunity to make your Zeal for Truth, and for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion famous to Poſterity. No Artifice or Malice can Create the leaſt Jealouſie in us, that ever your Lordships should shew any Partiality or Injuſtice to the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> To your Judgement this Cauſe is ſubmitted, and when we have your Judgement, we doubt not but we shall drive <hi>Popery</hi> out of this <hi>Engliſh</hi> World.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>My Lords,</hi> We shall go on to the proof of our Cauſe, and I hope this will be a happy day to us and the whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt.</p>

                              <p>My Lords, If this would be a material Objection from this Lord, then will it be requiſite for us to obviate and prevent the Objection by shewing firſt, that there was ſuch a grand and univerſal deſign of Papiſts, in which this Lord was to co-operate for his diſtinct share; though perhaps when we deſcend to our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Evidence it will appear, that his part hath been great, and manag'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice as great as any.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I remember very well, when I went firſt into <hi>France,</hi> I came acquainted with Abbot <hi>Montague,</hi> Father <hi>Gaſcoyn,</hi> and ſeveral other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Prieſts and Jeſuits, who often diſcourſed with me, and told me, if I would make my ſelf a Catholick I should have an Employment amongſt them there, and afterwards in <hi>England;</hi> for they did not doubt but the Popish Religion would come in very ſoon; upon which I asked his Lordship the Abbot one day, what reaſon he had to believe it? he told me two reaſons; firſt, that they did not doubt but to procure a toleration of Religion, by which they should bring it in without noiſe; and ſecondly, that the Gentry that went abroad did obſerve the novelty of their own Religion, and the Antiquity of theirs, and the advantages that were to be had by it. Theſe Reaſons Abbot <hi>Montague</hi> gave me. There was one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bennet</hi> and others, that told me the chief reaſon was, their party was very ſtrong in <hi>England,</hi> and in a few Years they would bring it in right or wrong. All this would not prevail with me to turn Papiſt, and I lived among them ſeveral Years. At laſt I had a deſign to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and as I went I had a deſign to go to <hi>Provence,</hi> (and ſo into <hi>Italy)</hi> where there was one Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi</hi> coming tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the Town, and the Jeſuits having a great School there, I was curious to go to the School, and they were very deſirous I should tarry for ſome time in the Town; I did, and they made much of me, and told me much to the ſame ſubſtance, what aſſurances they had of their Religion coming into <hi>England.</hi> At laſt they had a deſire I should diſcourſe with the Cardinal, which I did, and he made much of me, and he it was that perverted me to the Romish Religion; upon this the Cardinal shewed me a pair of Hangings that were in his Houſe, which he ſaid did belong to the Queen Mother, and were bought in <hi>Paris,</hi> and he told me he was acquainted with many of the Nobility in <hi>England,</hi> and that he had great aſſurance the Popish Religion would prevail, and he told me there was but one in the way, and though that man was a good natured man, yet they could not ſo far prevail upon him, but that to accomplish their deſigns they muſt take him out of the way; but at laſt I left this place and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where I lived ſome years in the English Jeſuits Colledge there, and when I had lived there five years, I came to be Prefect of ſeveral Rooms there which are the Scholars Lodgings and places of Study. I have heard it there often diſputed in their own Colledge, both preach'd and privately exhorted, that the King of <hi>England</hi> was an Heretick, and that there was no King really reigning, and who ever took him out of the way would do a meritorious action.</p>

And I doubting of the truth of that Opinion, they did shew me ſeveral of their Books there, and directed me to ſome paſſages of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105168:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Mariana, Vaſquez</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which I have ſince published to the world, wherein they did aſſert it as a true Doctrine, and as Chriſtian Doctrine, what the Fathers told me; and this was never condemned at <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides, my Lords, when I was coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> with my Faculty and Licenſe ſigned by Cardinal <hi>Barberino,</hi> who generally conducts, or cauſes to be conducted all Papiſts to take their leave of the Pope; and before we came away (for there were five or ſix of us together) for a whole month theſe Fathers were exhorting us, That we were not obliged to obey the King of <hi>England,</hi> and that in all private Confeſſions we were to inſtruct all perſons that we thought were capable of any deſign, That they should uſe all their endeavours for promoting the Popish Religion. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>England,</hi> made my application to Dr. <hi>Perrott,</hi> who belonged to the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Ambaſſador, and was chief of the Popish Clergy in <hi>England:</hi> I was kept there ſome months, to ſay Maſs in his Chappel; and afterwards I was ſent into the North, (where there were abundance of Jeſuits and Fryers) to one Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi>'s Houſe, where knowing the Principles of theſe people, I made it my buſineſs to rout theſe Jeſuits away, eſpecially out of Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi>'s Houſe, who had a Kinſman of his own that was a Jeſuit, and uſed to ſerve him in his Houſe, and great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was made againſt me; and there was one Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Serjeant,</hi> in the North, who gave me intimation of it; ond to whom I wrote to ſatisfie him and the Clergy, of the grounds and reaſons why I routed them away; which if he be in <hi>England</hi> now, he can juſtifie. Upon this, I received a ſmart Letter, as a kind of Reprimand for my doing ſo; and he told me, That though they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with me in Doctrine, yet they would endeavour what they could to bring in the Popish Religion. And taxed me sharply for appearing againſt it. I told him how the Jeſuits perverted the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and that by that means they would be the chief men in <hi>England,</hi> though there were none of their Order till Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time. Beſides, My Lords, in <hi>Rome</hi> I ſaw <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, and read them once a month, as I believe; wherein he gave us intelligence of ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that happened in Court; how the Duke and the Queen, and the chief of the Nobility were of their ſide; how they carried matters ſeveral times; the ways my Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> did uſe, and Sir <hi>William Godolphin,</hi> to effect the work; and that they did not queſtion but they should get my Lord Treaſurer <hi>Danby</hi> on their ſide too. This was in <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, and he had ſo much allowance for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. Theſe Letters of his I read ſeveral times in the Colledge. My Lords, afterwards when I came from <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſaw Abbot <hi>Montague</hi> again, and he ſaid he was very glad to ſee me, and that I was a Prieſt; well but, ſaid I, what am I the better? where is the Employment you promiſed me when I should come into <hi>England?</hi> He told me I should have it very ſoon, and he was very glad that I had not made my ſelf a Jeſuit; and he recommended me to Dr. <hi>Goffe,</hi> Confeſſor to the Queen Mother; who ſaid, he would do any thing in the world for me, and he did not doubt but he should get a preferment for me; which Dr. <hi>Goffe</hi> is now

living. Truly when I came into <hi>England</hi> I found all the Popish Clergy of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that I diſcourſed with, of the ſame opinion, that they did not doubt but the Romish Religion would ſoon come in. And beſides, in the North there was gathering of Money, in which I was ordered to be one of the chief men; but I was againſt it: I told them I would do nothing in it, I thought it was illegal to ſend any Money beyond Sea: they told me it was charity only to repair the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege at <hi>Doway:</hi> I told them it was ſtrange that there should be ſo much Money raiſed only to repair one College which would ſerve three or four Colleges; and I perſwaded Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> and all other perſons I had to do with, not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it. As to this raiſing of the Money, I conceive it may be inferr'd, it was for ſome other private buſineſs; and I believe, was for the carrying on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. As for the Gentleman at the Bar, my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> I know nothing of my own particular knowledge, but only this, Therewas one <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Smith</hi>'s Brother, that lived at a place not far off the place where I lived, who was one that contributed in paying the Money that was then Collecting: he was the man that writ a Letter up to my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> to complain of two or three Juſtices of the Peace that were active againſt Popery, upon which there was one that was turned out, that I think is now of the Honourable Houſe of Commons—</p>

No ſaid he, I care not for that Letter, it will ſignifie nothing; for my Lord won't keep by him any thing of any moment. I asked him what he knew about my Lord; he told me he writ another Letter to my Lord to know whether he would make a conveyance of his Eſtate away, and whether he apprehended they were in danger: And he told me, his Lordships anſwer was, that ſeveral did ſo, but he would not, for he expected ſome ſudden change or alteration: I asked him what change or alteration he underſtood by it. Sir, ſaid he, what can be underſtood by it, but an alteration of the Government and Religion? I am ſure ſaid he, my Lord is ſo wiſe a Man, that he would not write ſo without ſome ground. This is all I can ſay to the Gentleman at the Bar, and this is true by the Oath I have taken.</p>

I have ſeen ſeveral Letters which have come from <hi>Paris, Rome,</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> all relating to this, to incourage Mr. <hi>Evers.</hi> and that he should go on to incourage the reſt that were ingaged. For that purpoſe I read ſome of them, and intercepted them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were all directed to me. Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> hath ſent me upon Meſſages, ſometimes by Letters, and ſometimes by word of mouth, and all tended for the introducing of their Religion, that all should be ready with Money and Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings Death. For I did hear nothing till of late about the killing of the King. In particular, there came one Letter to <hi>Evers,</hi> from my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> to shew that things went on well beyond Sea, and hoped they did ſo here. I ſaw another time ſome Letters which were alſo tranſmitted to my hands by a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger that came from <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> which did come from <hi>Paris,</hi> and ſo to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> from whence they came to <hi>Harcourt,</hi> and <hi>Harcourt</hi> had delivered the Letters to have the opinion of ſome Lords: All which contained advice which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Paris,</hi> which they counted extraordinary good. The purport of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105168:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theſe Letters were to shew there was no way could be more likely to do their Work, than if any ſudden death should happen to the King then to throw it upon the Presbyterians, who had killed the old King, and were likelieſt to be thought to have done this, and ſo they might eaſily get the Proteſtants, thoſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to join with the Papiſts againſt the Presbyterians, who would by that become odious, and ſo should weaken the party the more eaſily to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish their deſign. I have of late ſeveral times been in company with Prieſts and other Gentlemen in the Country, when they have had Conſultations both for the introducing their own Religion, aud taking away the Kings life, which they did always intend to be about <hi>November, December,</hi> or <hi>January</hi> (78.) It was late in the Year, but all that Year (78.) this was their Conſultation. I have been ſent to the Jeſuits, ſome of them, particularly to Mr. <hi>Vavaſor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> for ſome Moneys, for there was a general Collection, and there was the ſum of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds at one time which I received, and gave to Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi> and he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to <hi>London</hi> for the carrying on this deſign, and for diſcharging an account of Arms and things received from beyond Sea. And it was agreed that my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> Sir <hi>James Symons</hi> and others, should go in <hi>October</hi> 1678. to diſpoſe of the Arms which they had ſo received, ſome here, and ſome beyond Sea, to the value I heard ſay of 30000. Moreover I did hear that they were to have men raiſed there as well as here. So I have heard from Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gavan</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and I have been alſo by when it hath been diſcourſed that the King of <hi>France</hi> was acquainted with all theſe Deſigns, and that he would furnish us with men, and should not be wanting with all other aid and aſſiſtance, if there should be any alteration, if the King should die or be taken away, or to that purpoſe: I have been ſeveral times put upon to make Foot-Races to draw people together, that they might the better have Diſcourſes together without ſuſpicion. I was likewiſe put in truſt by the Jeſuits all the while the Plot was carrying on, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for two years, all the Letters relating to the Plot came to my hand, ſome of which I opened, and ſome I kept in my own hands, and particularly I had one that came to my hands which was about the Death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> for when I carried it to Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi> he ſaid, There was one of our Enemies taken out of the way; and it was contained in the Letter, <hi>This night Sir</hi> Edmondbury Godfrey <hi>is diſpatched;</hi> which by the date of it was the 12. of <hi>October</hi> 1678. I told him that that would prove a diſcouragement to us, and would be the ruine of all the Deſign; he ſaid, not ſo, it would rather prove otherwiſe, for he was one that was active in punishing lewd and debauched perſons, and it would rather be put upon them than us, as done out of Revenge.</p>

                  <p>Likewiſe when I did hear there was like to be an alteration in the Government, and having ſuch fair promiſes, I was incouraged to it, and was very willing to contribute to the Deſign, and I did then make over an Eſtate which I had of four hundred pound value for that purpoſe, and for the praying for my Soul. And when my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> and I should come to Account, as there was money over and above due to me, I did likewiſe promiſe, becauſe I ſaw money would be wanting, I would give them a hundred pound more. There were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Gentlemen, as Mr. <hi>Heveningham,</hi> Sir <hi>James Symons,</hi> my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Draycott,</hi> Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gerard,</hi> who did to my knowledge contribute towards the carrying on of this Charge, for defraying of Money and raiſing Arms, and paying for them. And I have ſeen Letters from beyond Sea, that have been to Mr. <hi>Evers,</hi> that all things have been ready as to the Arms, and there only wanted Orders how they should be diſpoſed of, and I have been ſeveral times brought to the Oath of Secrecy for fear I should diſcloſe it, and particularly that time that I went away from my Lord <hi>Aſtons,</hi> which was on a <hi>Monday</hi> morning, Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> gave it me about the 18. or 19. of <hi>November,</hi> 1678. And I did then promiſe by all the promiſes I could make, and upon the Sacrament in his Chamber, that I would not diſcloſe it; but having others to adviſe me in it, ſuch as could better do it, that told me ſuch Oaths were better broken than kept, and thereupon I came to diſcover the thing, which I have done to the beſt of my knowledge. I am very loath to charge my memory in particular, about times, or how many were in company, but thoſe that I am ſure of; but there hath been in company at the Conſultation ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, Mr. <hi>Heveningham,</hi> Sir <hi>James Symons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> Mr. <hi>Petre,</hi> Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> himſelf; when there hath been ſpeech about the Deſign, for the introducing of Religion, and for taking order about money to buy Arms, and particularly when my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was by about the Death of the King, and that was about <hi>September</hi> 1678.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I was deſirous to know how things went, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as well as Mr. <hi>Evers;</hi> and I asked what the reaſon was they took away his life? Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> told me, that there was a Meſſage ſent to Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> to deſire him that he would not reveal what he knew concerning the Plot, or any thing of that nature.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>From the Duke of <hi>York.</hi> And <hi>Coleman</hi> did ſend word back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, What was it the nearer? for he had been ſo foolish as to reveal all to Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> who had promiſed to keep it all as a ſecret. But upon the Examination of <hi>Oates,</hi> before Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> as a Juſtice of Peace, he was afraid he would come in an Evidence againſt him; and had shewn himſelf a little too eager, which made <hi>Coleman</hi> afraid he would witneſs againſt him. And the Duke of <hi>York</hi> did ſend word back again, That if he would take care not to reveal but conceal it, he should not come in againſt him, or to that purpoſe: And the next news we heard was the Letter that he was diſpatched.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, in the year (76) I was admitted into the ſervice of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> as Chaplain in his Houſe, and there I came acquainted with one <hi>Bing,</hi> that was a Prieſt in the Houſe. And being acquainted with him, there came one <hi>Kemiſh</hi> very often to viſit him, and one <hi>Singleton,</hi> who told me that I
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105168:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should find that the Proteſtant Religion was upon its laſt legs, and that it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me, and all men of my Coat (for then I profeſſed my ſelf a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England)</hi> to haſten betimes home to the Church of <hi>Rome. My Lords,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had ſtrong ſuſpicions for ſome years before, of the great and apparent growth of Popery; to ſatisfie my curioſity, I pretended ſome doubts in my mind. <hi>My Lords,</hi> after ſome time had paſſed over, &amp; I had ſome converſation with theſe men, I found they were not men for my turn, becauſe being regular men, they were not men that had any great degree of Learning. Afterwards, my Lords, I met with one <hi>Hutchinſon;</hi> I found him a Saint-like man, or one that was Religious for Religion ſake; and him I found not for my turn neither: For, my Lords, my deſign was to deal with their Caſuiſts; that is, thoſe of the Society. After that I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the favour from him, to have ſome Conference with one of the Society, I found they were the men for my turn, becauſe I found they were the cunning politick men, and the men that could ſatisfie me. After that I had ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them, I pretended to be convinced by their Arguments. And, my Lords, after that <hi>I</hi> had thus acknowledged my Conviction, I deſired to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; and accordingly on <hi>Aſh-wedneſday,</hi> 1676. I was reconciled. And ſoon after my Reconciliation, <hi>Strange,</hi> who was then Provincial of the Society, did tell me much after this way; Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> you are now reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and you muſt lay down your Miniſtry, for your Ordination is invalid, and you muſt look upon your ſelf as no more than a Layman. Pray, ſays he, now what courſe do you think to take? I told him, I did deſire to be one of their Society, and to be admitted a Novice into their Order. He ſaid, it was a very honeſt requeſt, and a very honeſt deſire; and he ſaid, he would take ſome time to conſider of it, and he would take till the <hi>Saturday</hi> following. <hi>Saturday</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was ſent for, by one <hi>Fenwick:</hi> I lodged then in <hi>Barbican,</hi> and <hi>Fenwick</hi> came to me, and told me, the Fathers were met at <hi>Wild</hi>-Houſe, and would ſpeak with me. And he alſo told me, they had granted my requeſt, and I should be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. After I was admitted, they told me, I had ſome years upon me, and I could not undergo thoſe burdens they put upon younger men. But what did I think of travelling, and going beyond Sea to do their buſineſs? I did agree to it, and in <hi>April</hi> (77.) I went aboard one <hi>Luke Roch,</hi> Maſter of the <hi>Bilboa</hi> Merchant, bound for <hi>Bilboa,</hi> having their Letters of Recommendation. After I arrived there, which was on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June,</hi> )I can't tell which) I went the <hi>Friday</hi> following for <hi>Validolid</hi> in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and I got thither the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but by the way I opened certain Letters, wherein was made mention of a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance deſigned in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And the Letters did expreſs what hopes they had to effect their Deſign in <hi>England,</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105168:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſpatched, which was the cauſe of great joy to the Fathers there; and afterwards Letters dated in <hi>May</hi> too (but towards the latter end of <hi>May)</hi> came, That they were miſtaken, and deſired the Fathers there, to ſtifle that news. My Lords, there came Letters dated in <hi>June,</hi> wherein they did give an account, That they had procured one <hi>Beddingfield</hi> to be Confeſſor to the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> which <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingfield</hi> by his intereſt might prevail much with the Duke, in order to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Letters came alſo in <hi>June</hi> from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> which gave them an account, That Father <hi>Beddingfield</hi> had aſſured them of the Dukes willingneſs to comply with them, for the advancement of the Catholick Religion, My Lords, after I had ſtay'd ſome time there, and had paſſed through the Country for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Society; I found that in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> ſome Miniſters of that Court had been very ready to advance Money, which Money was returned for <hi>England;</hi> and that the Father Provincial of the Jeſuits of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> by his care and induſtry had advanced Ten Thouſand Pound, which was promiſed to be paid in <hi>June</hi> following, within a Twelvemonth after. My Lords, in <hi>July</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Letters out of <hi>England,</hi> wherein an account was given there, to the Fathers in <hi>Spain,</hi> That they were ſending them a Miſſion of Twelve Students, Four whereof were to go to <hi>Madrid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and Eight to <hi>Validolid:</hi> the Conductors of theſe Twelve Students were, one Father <hi>Croſſe</hi> (that was his true Name) and one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ord,</hi> whoſe true Name was <hi>Armſtrong.</hi> Theſe Miſſioners arrived in <hi>December,</hi> where they had a Sermon preached at their coming, by this ſame <hi>Armſtrong,</hi> wherein the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy were declared to be Antichriſtian, Heretical, and Devillish; in which the Kings Legitimacy was vilified and abuſed; and that his Religion did intitle him to nothing but ſudden death and deſtruction, in that he appeared an enemy both to God and Man. Theſe were the Contents of that Sermon, as near as I remember. My Lords, after the meeting with ſeveral Letters there, in <hi>July, Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> it was ordered, I should return for <hi>England;</hi> and in the month of <hi>November</hi> I came for <hi>England,</hi> at which time I had Letters from the Provincial of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> called by the Name of <hi>Padre Hieronymo de Corduba,</hi> who did in his Letter aſſure the Provincial in <hi>England,</hi> and the Fathers here, That the ten thouſand Pound should be paid (as I ſaid hefore) in <hi>June</hi> following. When I came for <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>London</hi> I was lodged at one <hi>Grigſon</hi>'s, that lived in <hi>Drury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> near the Sign of the <hi>Red-Lyon,</hi> and there I lay till I went to St. <hi>Omers;</hi> and by the Provincial and the Conſultors of the Province, I was ordered a maintenance, and it was paid to this man for entertaining of me. I went and brought theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to this <hi>Strange,</hi> and there was Father <hi>Keins,</hi> lying ill upon <hi>Strange</hi>'s Bed, and <hi>Keins</hi> was ſaying, he was mighty ſorry for <hi>honeſt William,</hi> (ſo they called the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian that was to kill the King) that he had miſſed in his Enterprize: But, my Lords, this I think good to tell your Lordships, they were not ſo zealous for the deſtruction of the King, till the King had refuſed <hi>Coleman</hi> the diſſolving of the long Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:105168:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then they were more intent upon it, though they had ſeveral times attempted it ever ſince the Fire of <hi>London:</hi> but when <hi>Coleman</hi> was refuſed the Diſſolution of the Long Parliament, then were they more zealous for the Deſtruction of the King; but the Deſign for the introducing the Popish Religion, they have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on ſome years before the Fire, by thoſe inſtruments ſome of whom are yet alive. <hi>My Lords,</hi> I left <hi>England</hi> in <hi>November</hi> old ſtile, and <hi>December</hi> new ſtile; for when I came to St. <hi>Omers</hi> it was (as near as I can remember) the 9. or 10. of <hi>December</hi> according to the ſtile of the place. I carryed with me a Packet of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>Strange</hi> the Provincial, and other Fathers that were of the Conſult for the Province of <hi>England</hi> to the Fathers at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> wherein <hi>Strange</hi> did tell them, that they had great hopes of their Deſign taking effect the next year, but as yet it would not be effected; he ſaid, therefore they at <hi>London</hi> thought it fit to ſuſpend it till they ſaw what the Parliament would do. And he did in the ſame Letter declare, That the Parliament would be about a long Bill that had been brought into the Commons Houſe ſome Seſſions before, but he did not Queſtion but that the Catholick Party would evade that Bill. And <hi>My Lords,</hi> in that year ſome time after, we had a Letter from our New Provincial, whoſe true Name was <hi>Whitebread,</hi> and his counterfeit Name <hi>White.</hi> This Father writes to the Fathers at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and therein he does order one <hi>Conyers</hi> to preach upon St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterburies</hi> Day, and he did therein alſo tell them, that he would be as zealous for the carrying on of the Deſign as his Predeceſſor had been, and a Sermon was accordingly preached at the Sodality Church, wherein after he had commended the Saint whoſe Day they celebrated for his great Vertues, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how unworthily he was ſacrificed, he did inveigh againſt the Tyranny (as he called it) of temporal Princes, and particularly of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and when he came to ſpeak of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he looked upon them as Antichriſtian and Devillish, and that it was fit to deſtroy all ſuch as would countenance them. We have done with the year (77.) and we come now to <hi>January</hi> 1678.</p>

                     <hi>Talbots</hi> and other perſons were very zealous in raiſing of Forces, and were reſolved to let in the French King, provided that the Parliament should urge the King to break with <hi>France.</hi> My Lords, likewiſe in <hi>January</hi> (as near as I can remember) <hi>Morgan</hi> was ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a Viſitor (which is ſomething a better place than a Provincial, but only it is but temporary for the time he viſits) and he returns in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> and gives an account how ready the Irish were to vindicate their freedom, and their Religion from the oppreſſion of the English as they called it. My Lords, in <hi>February</hi> ſome were employed to go into ſome parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> to <hi>Liege,</hi> and to ſome parts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> to ſee how the affairs there ſtood, and how their Correſpondencies ſtood, to ſee whether there was not an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Correſpondencies. My Lords, upon their return they found, that the Fathers at <hi>Ghent</hi> were inclined to take into this buſineſs the ſecular Clergy, but the Fathers of St. <hi>Omers,</hi> together with the Provincial, did refuſe the motion, becauſe the ſecular Clergy were more cowardly, and ſought themſelves and not the Intereſt of the Church, or to that purpoſe. My Lords, in <hi>March</hi> we received Letters, that there was a very shrewd attempt made upon the perſon of the King, and that the Flint of <hi>Pickering</hi>'s Gun or Piſtol was looſe, and his hand shaking, the King did then eſcape, for which he received a Diſcipline, and the other a ſevere chiding.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord High Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>You explain not the meaning of what you ſay; that was not <hi>honeſt William,</hi> for he you ſay was <hi>Grove.</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I mean <hi>Pickering</hi> received the Diſcipline, and <hi>William</hi> was chid; for it was <hi>Pickering</hi>'s Flint that was looſe. My Lords, this was in <hi>March,</hi> and at the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> there comes a Letter from <hi>London,</hi> in which there was a Summons to a Conſult here in <hi>London,</hi> and being ſummoned, there went over eight or nine from St, <hi>Omers, Liege,</hi> and <hi>Ghent,</hi> to this Conſult, and I did attend then in their journey.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>The latter end of <hi>March,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> as I remember; they had notice of it in <hi>England</hi> before, but we had notice of it juſt when we were to come. I think it was in <hi>April,</hi> as near as I can remember, I cannot be certain in that, my Lord. We did come to Town in <hi>April,</hi> there the Conſult was held, it begun at the <hi>White Horſe</hi> Tavern, where they did conſult about ſome things of the Society, and afterwards they did adjourn into particular Societies, where they did debate and reſolve on the Death of the King, and that <hi>Grove</hi> should have fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred pounds for his pains, and the other being a Religious man should have thirty thouſand Maſſes ſaid for him. My Lords, after ſtaying in Town a while we returned to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and after I had ſtaid there ſome few days the new Provincial did begin to viſit his Province, and comes over to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> where after ſtaying ſome ſix days he goes over away from thence to <hi>Wotion.</hi> But whilſt he ſtaid at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> I was ordered to go into <hi>England</hi> to attend the Affairs here
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105168:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and for to do ſome other Services that they should imploy me about. My Lords, accordingly I did come over, and it was on the 23. new ſtile, as near as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>I</hi> got to <hi>Calice,</hi> the 24. I got to <hi>Dover,</hi> on the 25. <hi>I</hi> got to <hi>Sittenburn,</hi> but between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Sittenburn</hi> we had ſome Boxes ſeized; for at <hi>Dover</hi> we met with <hi>Fenwick,</hi> who is ſince executed, who went by the name of <hi>Thompſon,</hi> and carried a Box with him, and a little on this ſide <hi>Canterbury</hi> it was ſeized by the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers, and ſeveral little Trinkets in it which were ſeized as French Goods, and he did deſire the Searcher to ſtand his friend, and he would give him ſomething for his pains, and told him where he should write to him in <hi>London.</hi> There was a Superſcription on the Box to one <hi>Blundel,</hi> but he should write to him by the name of <hi>Thompſon,</hi> at the <hi>Fountain</hi> Tavern neer <hi>Charing-Croſs.</hi> We arrived in Town the 17. of <hi>June,</hi> which is the 27. new ſtile; it was upon a <hi>Monday,</hi> and there were Letters which did follow us, wherein were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to be made to Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> for the Poiſoning of the King, and that the Ten Thouſand Pounds which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had promiſed in <hi>January</hi> before, and was accordingly paid in <hi>London</hi> at the time, should be propoſed to <hi>Wakeman,</hi> to poiſon the King; <hi>I</hi> found that <hi>Coleman</hi> did look upon it as too little, and he thought Fifteen Thouſand Pound should be given to him. <hi>I</hi> found that <hi>Langhorn</hi> thought it too much, and that he ought to do ſo great a piece of Service for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and told us he was a narrow-ſpirited man if he would not ingage in ſuch a thing. My Lords, there was Five Thouſand Pounds, as the Books told me, paid, but <hi>I</hi> did not then ſee it paid, becauſe <hi>I</hi> was then ill and not fit to ſtir abroad. My Lords, we are now paſt <hi>June</hi> (78.) In <hi>July</hi> Father <hi>Aſhby</hi> comes to Town, who did revive the Propoſal to Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> but being ſick of the Gout, he haſtened down to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and when he came there, as ſoon as he began to be well, he was adviſed by the Fathers to ſee how the Catholicks ſtood affected in <hi>Sommerſet ſhire;</hi> for they had had an Account in <hi>March</hi> (78.) by Letters from <hi>Berkshire, Oxfordſhire</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that the Catholicks ſtood well affected, and Sir <hi>William Andrews</hi> did ſecure that the people of <hi>Eſſex</hi> should ſtand to their points; and ſo ſeveral men did ſecure that they would have them in readineſs. My Lords, In <hi>Auguſt (I</hi> cannot remember every particular, but refer my ſelf to the Records of the Houſe) about the 26. of <hi>Auguſt, I</hi> find that <hi>Fenwick</hi> went to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and there he was to attend the Provincial home, and to give the Provincial an Account of the Propoſal accepted by Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> but in <hi>July</hi> (if your Lordships pleaſe to give me leave to go back again) <hi>Strange</hi> comes to Town, and falling in diſcourſe about the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> and the Rebuilding of it, he very frankly told me how it was fired, and how many of thoſe concerned were ſeized, and among the reſt told me that the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Guard, as by his order, did receive them, and afterwards willing to diſcharge them, which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to mention before, but upon review of my Papers, I do find, that it was told me his Guard did releaſe the Priſoners that were taken as ſuſpected about the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105168:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fire, and that all the Order they had for it they pretended was from the Duke. But now, my Lords, We return to <hi>Auguſt</hi> again. Upon the 3. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I find, <hi>Ireland</hi> did pretend to go to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and a Letter came from him as directed from thence; but we find by his Tryal and other things ſince, that he went into <hi>Stafford ſhire;</hi> and about the 12. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (as I remember) he was here in Town. The latter part of <hi>July</hi> I communicated with Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> and gave him ſome particular account of Affairs, I deſired him to communicate it to ſome that might make it known to the King; the King had notice the 13. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or the 14. as I remember, and by the 3. of <hi>September</hi> I was betray'd, and was expoſed to the vengeance of theſe men whoſe Contrivances I had thus diſcovered. So my Intelligence did ceaſe wholly the 8. of <hi>September;</hi> Then was I forced to keep private, and upon my Examination, what Information I gave before the Lords and Commons, I refer my ſelf to them.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I was in <hi>Spain</hi> in the City of <hi>Victoria,</hi> and leaving the City of <hi>Victoria</hi> in the month of <hi>June,</hi> I took my courſe to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and paſſing through the City of <hi>Validolid,</hi> going into the Convent of the Dominicans, there came an Irishman, a Prieſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> out of the City to ſeo me, and there he told me, there was a Student of the Jeſuits, by name Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> an Englishman, and I underſtanding this, went into the Colledge of the Jeſuits to ſee Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> and there had converſation with Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> and in the converſation I had with him there he told me that he was a Vicar in <hi>Kent,</hi> and that he was Chaplain to a great Nobleman in <hi>England,</hi> by name <hi>Howard,</hi> and that he went out of <hi>England</hi> by the conſent of the Jeſuits in <hi>England,</hi> being converted by them to the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, and that his going into <hi>Spain</hi> was to fit himſelf for the Society of the Jeſuits, and underſtanding my reſolution was to go to <hi>Madrid,</hi> he did deſire me to carry a Letter to the Archbishop of <hi>Tune,</hi> one <hi>James Lench</hi> an Irishman, who lived at <hi>Madrid;</hi> and further, he lent me four pieces of Eight to defray my Journey to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and deſired me to pay the money to the Procurator of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and in carrying this Letter to the Archbishop, when I came there I got a Dominican Fryer of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by name <hi>Humphry Delphin,</hi> to go with me and ſee the Archbishop at his lodging, and going in, I delivered him the Letter in the preſence of the Dominican, and he peruſed it in my preſence, and in the preſence of a Prieſt that waited upon him, and finishing the Contents of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I ſuppoſe, with a ſmiling Countenance he turned about, and ſaid, Sirs, the Contents of this Letter is, that Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> is deſirous to receive the Order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood from me, or at my hands, and if it be ſo, it will be much in our way, and this man will be a fit man for our purpoſe; for ſaid he further, Dr, <hi>Oliver Plunket,</hi> Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> is reſolved this year, or with the next Convenience, to bring in a French Power into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thereby to ſupport the Roman Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and if it pleaſe God, I my ſelf, without any delay, will go into <hi>Ireland</hi> to aſſiſt that pious Work. All this Diſcourſe between us and the Archbishop, and between <hi>Oats</hi> and me, was in <hi>July</hi> (77.)

Collectors for the levying a competent ſum of money out of every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and Religious Houſe. <hi>My Lords,</hi> the Collectors were by name <hi>John Reynolds</hi> alias <hi>Landy,</hi> and <hi>John Berne,</hi> and arriving at the County of <hi>Sligoe</hi> in the month of <hi>May.</hi>

                  <p>My Lords, In the beginning of the year (78.) I have heard Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Mr, <hi>Thomas Jeniſon,</hi> both Jeſuits, ſpeak of a Deſign they had to gain a toleration of Conſcience for their Party in <hi>England;</hi> and the way then deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get it was, by procuring a great Sum of Money from their Party, and by bribing the then Parliament. I have heard them likewiſe diſcourſe of ſecuring the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Succeſſion, and that (they told me) was to be done, by procuring of Commiſſions to be granted to thoſe of their Party to be ready to riſe upon the Death of the King. I likewiſe have heard them diſcourſe of the neceſſity and uſefulneſs to their Party of the Alteration of the Government eſtablished, and that their Religion could never flourish till that was done, and this Kingdom altered
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105168:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
according to the French Model. In the month of <hi>June</hi> (78) I was at Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Chamber, and there happening a diſcourſe, that the Roman Catholick Religion was like to come into <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> did then ſay, there was but one that ſtood in the way, and that it was an eaſie thing to Poyſon the King, and that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> might eaſily and opportunely do it. I asked Mr. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whether Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was the Kings Phyſician? His anſwer was, No, but he was the Queens, and ſo might have an opportunity to do it. In the month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the ſame year, the day that I came from <hi>Windſor,</hi> I went to Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi>'s Chamber, and I found he was newly come from <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and was drawing off his Boots on the frame of a Table: he asked me, whence I was come? I told him, from <hi>Windſor:</hi> He inquired of me about the Diverſions of the Court, I told him, I underſtood His Majeſty did take delight in Hawking and Fishing, but chiefly in Fishing; and that he went accompanied only with two or three, early in the morning. Then Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> replyed, He were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily taken off, or removed: to which I anſwered, God forbid, being ſurprized at that time; O ſaid he, I ſay not that it is lawful. Then there happened ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption to our Diſcourſe about <hi>Staffordſhire;</hi> then we fell into a Diſcourſe of their Religion that he ſaid was ſuddenly to come into <hi>England,</hi> and he asked me, if I would be one of thoſe that would go to <hi>Windſor</hi> to aſſiſt to take off the King: I told him no; then he told me, he would remit the 20 <hi>l.</hi> I owed him, if I would go to <hi>Windſor</hi> to be one of thoſe that were to take off the King. My Lords, I told him, I would have no hand in any ſuch matter, and that I would not for twenty times 20 <hi>l.</hi> have any hand in the Death of the King; ſaid he, Would you do nothing for the bringing in of our Religion? I told him, I thought it would never come in by blood: I told him further, God forgive me, if the King were taken off, ſo, well and good, but I would have nothing to do with it. He left not the Diſcourſe there, but asked me, if I knew any <hi>Iriſhmen</hi> that were ſtout and couragious: I told him, yes, I did, and named Captain <hi>Levallian,</hi> Mr. <hi>Karney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Broghall</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> all Gentlemen of my acquaintance about <hi>Grays-Inn.</hi> When I named theſe he asked me if <hi>I</hi> would go along with them to <hi>Windſor,</hi> to aſſiſt them in taking off the King, I told him I did not think any man of Eſtate would ingage in ſuch a matter, that I was Heir to an Eſtate, my Brother being a Prieſt, and that Captain <hi>Levallian</hi> was Heir to a very good Eſtate, and therefore I did believe he would not do ſuch a thing, unleſs the Pique which he had to the King or Religion might move him to it. My Lords, be approved of theſe perſons, and ſaid, he knew the firſt two of them, <hi>Levallian</hi> and <hi>Karney;</hi> and he ſet down, as I remember, the other two Names in writing. He told me he was going to the Club, to <hi>Mr. Coleman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Levallian,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Karney</hi> at that time, and then asked me for the Money, the Twenty pounds that I owed him. He told me he wanted Fourſcoure Pounds, and he deſired me that I would return it as ſoon as I came into the Countrey. Now my Lords,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105168:23"/>
the ſame day that I received this Twenty pound of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I went with Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Jeniſon</hi> the Jeſuit, to <hi>Harcourts</hi> Chamber to give the Fathers thanks for the Loan of the Money, and there Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> falling into Diſcourſe on that common Topick of their Religion coming into <hi>England,</hi> he did then uſe that Expreſſion which Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> hath in his Narrative. <hi>If</hi> C. R. <hi>would not be</hi> R. C. <hi>he ſhould not be long</hi> C. R. And he did interpret it thus in Latine. <hi>Si Carolus Rex non eſſet Rex Catholicus non foret din Carolus Rex.</hi> And he did add, my Lords, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Diſcourſe, that if the King were Excommunicated or Depoſed he was not longer King, and it was no ſin, or no great ſin to take him off, and if it were diſcovered who did it, two or three might perhaps ſuffer, but denying the Fact the matter ſoon would be blown over. My Lords, about two Months after the Muſtering the Forces upon <hi>Hounſlowe-Heath,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Jeniſon</hi> did tell me he had a matter of great Conſequence to impart to me, that there was a Deſign on foot ſo laid as that it could not well be diſcovered, and that the greateſt Papiſts, the greateſt Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> were in the Deſign, That the Queen and the Duke were in it, and that ſeveral Lords, by name my Lord <hi>Bellaſis,</hi> my Lord <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> my Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Wardour</hi> and others, I believe my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was named, but I cannot be poſitive in that. At that time my Lords, I did wish I had had a Commiſſion in the new raiſed Levies that were Muſtered on <hi>Hounſlowe-Heath,</hi> he told me he would procure me a Commiſſion from the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and that there was a new Army to be raiſed to bring in the Catholick Religion, but he did ſay he would tell me more particulars after my receiving the Sacrament of Secreſie, and I did underſtand by him that that Commiſſion was not to be ſent till the taking off the King was effected; but being I was ſurp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſed at it, he would not tell me the whole matter, but he deſired me to come and receive the Sacrament at Sir <hi>Philip Tyrwhytts</hi> in <hi>Blomesbury,</hi> and then he would acquaint me with the whole Affair. My Lords, being in <hi>Berkshire</hi> about the Month of <hi>December</hi> (78) at Madam <hi>Halls</hi> in <hi>Shinefield</hi> Parish, one Mr. <hi>Cuffil</hi> a Jeſuit came into our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. It was about the Tryal of <hi>Coleman,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cuffil</hi> did then ſay, That he thought Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was infatuated upon the Diſcovery of the Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

My Siſter <hi>Hall</hi> was preſent at this Diſcourſe, and Mr. <hi>Cuffil</hi> did then further ſay, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did draw a Sentence out of the Scripture, to favour the Popes Authority of Excommunicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Depriving, and Depoſing Temporal Princes, and the ſaying was this, <hi>Quòd Papa habeat eandem Poteſtatem ſuper Reges, quam Jehoiada habuit ſuper Athaliam.</hi> And that there were other corroborating Teſtimonies among the Fathers for it.</p>

               <p>The Lords have ſent us to acquaint this Houſe, That they intend to proceed to the Tryal of <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> at ten of the clock this morning in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Speaker left the Chair, and the Commons came into <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> in the new erected Court.</p>
               <p>And the Managers appointed by the Commons went into the Room prepared for them in that Court, to proceed to the particular Evidence againſt <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About ten of the clock in the morning the Lords came into the ſaid Court in their former Order, and Proclamation being made of Silence, and for the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> to bring his Priſoner to the Bar, they proceeded.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords expect you should go on with your Evidence, and proceed in the Tryal of this Noble Lord.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, if your Lordships pleaſe, I humbly deſire that my Counſel may be near me for the Arguing of what is fit to them to ſpeak to, as to points of Law, for points of Fact I do not deſire it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, you have an Order for your Counſel to attend, and they muſt and ought to attend.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>The Counſel muſt not ſuggeſt any thing to him while the Evidence is giving, they are not to be heard as to matter of Fact.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, they may ſtand within hearing, but not within prompting.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>I aſſure you, if I had all the Counſel in the world, I would not make uſe of them for any matter of Fact.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, will you pleaſe to order them to ſtand at a convenient diſtance, that they may not prompt the Priſoner.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I hope your Lordships will conſider, that a man in a Capital Cauſe ought not to have Counſel to matter of Fact. 'Tis true, he may adviſe with his Counſel, I deny it not; but for him in the face of the Court
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105168:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to communicate with his Counſel, and by them be told what he shall ſay, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, is that which (with ſubmiſſion) is not to be allowed. If your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships order they shall be within hearing, <hi>I</hi> do not oppoſe it, but then <hi>I</hi> deſire they may ſtand at that diſtance that there may be no means of intercouſe, unleſs points in Law do ariſe.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>You were beſt make that exception when there is Cauſe for it, in the mean time go on with your Evidence.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Franc. Winn.</speaker>
                  <p>We did perceive his Counſel came up towards the Bar, and very near him, and therefore we thought it our duty to ſpeak before any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence happened. This Lord being accuſed of High Treaſon, the allowing of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel is not a matter of Diſcretion. If matters of Law ariſe, all our Books ſay, that Counſel ought to be allowed. But we pray that there may be no Counſel to adviſe him in matter of Fact, nor till your Lordships find ſome Queſtion of Law to ariſe upon the Evidence.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, we preſume your Lordships did, from the ſtrength and clearneſs of yeſterdays Evidence, receive full ſatisfaction concerning the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Plot and Conſpiracy of the <hi>Popiſh Party.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It being an Evidence apparently invincible; not out of the mouths of <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Witneſſes only, but of <hi>twice</hi> that number (or more) credible perſons.</p>
                  <p>Upon which we doubt not but your Lordships who <hi>hear,</hi> and Strangers and unborn Poſterity when they <hi>ſhall</hi> hear, will juſtifie this Proſecution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and will allow that this Impeachment is the proper <hi>voice</hi> of the Nation crying out, as when the <hi>knife</hi> is at the throat. By the Evidence already given, I ſay, it is manife<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t that there was a general grand Deſign to deſtroy our <hi>Religion,</hi> our <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Subjects. And 'tis even impoſſible that this Deſign, ſo big, could be conducted without the <hi>concurrence</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> perſons as this Noble Lord at the Bar. It could not be carried on by <hi>leſs</hi> and <hi>lower</hi> men.</p>
                  <p>And it were a <hi>wonder,</hi> that a perſon ſo ſervently affected and addicted (as this Lord is) to that Party, should not be <hi>in,</hi> at ſo general a Deſign of the Party.</p>
                  <p>But this indeed is but <hi>preſumptive</hi> Evidence which will induce a <hi>moral</hi> perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>We shall now produce ſuch <hi>poſitive</hi> Evidence as will make a <hi>judicial</hi> certainty; and will abundantly ſuffice to <hi>convince</hi> your Lordships and <hi>convict</hi> this Lord.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Particulars</hi> you will hear out of the mouths of the Witneſſes, whom we shall call: They will teſtifie what share this Lord had in (almoſt) all the Parts and Articles in our Charge; contriving and contracting for the <hi>Murder of the King,</hi> levying <hi>Arms,</hi> &amp;c. And firſt we call Mr. <hi>Dugdale.</hi>

                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I conceive I have good ground to except againſt this man for a Witneſs; for my own particular, I know myſelf as clear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>You ſwore him to give Evidence as to the general Plot; you did not ſwear him as to the particulars againſt my Lord <hi>Stafford.</hi>

                  <p>'Tis true, my Lords, we did divide the Evidence into two parts, but his Oath was not divided; if your Lordships pleaſe you may ſwear them all over again, if it may be any ſatisfaction, but I think it was never ſeen before.</p>

It was to debate and determine upon the former Reſolutions both beyond Sea and at <hi>London,</hi> before both to take away the life of the King, and to introduce their Religion, of which I was then one. My Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was there preſent, and did with the reſt conſent to it.

                  <p>My Lords, Some times in <hi>September,</hi> my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> being at Mr. <hi>Abnets</hi> Houſe in <hi>Stafford,</hi> came once upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> morning to hear Maſs: I meeting him at the outward Gate of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe when he alighted off his Horſe, after ſome Diſcourſe he turned to me, and told me, It was a ſad thing we could not ſay our Prayers but in an hidden manner, but e're long if things took effect we should have the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion eſtablished. And I at that time did ſeem to be, and really was as glad as any perſon could be. After ſome time, I think it was about the 20. or 21. of <hi>September</hi> my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> ſent for me into his lodging Room, I think it was by his page, or him that waited upon him in his Chamber: and he told me I muſt come to my Lord, and I immediately went to his Lordship, he was juſt then ariſing and dreſſing, he ſent his men out, and told me, he had had a good Accompt from Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> and other Genlemen that I would be faithful and true to their Intentions about the introducing their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. He told me, he was likewiſe concerned himſelf, and that in a very high degree: and for taking away the Life of the King, he offered me at that time for my Charges and Encouragement 500<hi>l.</hi> and that I should go in <hi>October</hi> after to <hi>London</hi> with him (my Lord <hi>Stafford,)</hi> and that I should be with him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>London,</hi> and ſometimes at an Houſe of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s about twenty five miles from <hi>London,</hi> and that I should be under the care of him in <hi>London</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in the Countrey, of one Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> that knew of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. I did then shew as much reſolution to be faithful to my Lord as I could, and that I would be true to what my Lord then engaged me. I after went to Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> and communicated to him what my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> ſaid, and was ſomething in admiration at my Lord's offering me ſuch a Sum of Money, for I doubted of my Lords Ability to make good Payment. He told me, that I need not ſear it, for Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> had Money enough in their hands to def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay that and other Charges, and I should not want Money for the carrying it on. My Lords, I remember that at another time there was a meeting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was a Debate about my going up, and other buſineſſes; my Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> was preſent, and there were ſeveral there beſides, I did not kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w them all then; but in the firſt place they told me I should be made equal with one Captain <hi>Adderly</hi> that is ſince dead, and that I should have a Reward in <hi>London:</hi> I underſtood that the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> my Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> and my Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:105168:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and others were to give me it; and ſpeaking of the Rewards to thoſe that were ingaged, they ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there would be Land enough from the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to ſatisfie all that acted in the Deſign. Another time my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> diſcourſing in a Dining Room in my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe, did expreſs his great Zeal, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he was ſuch an Enemy againſt the King: he ſaid, both he and my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> had been great Sufferers for the King, and for his Father, and that my Lord in particular his Grandfather or his Father had ſpent 30000 <hi>l.</hi> in the Kings Service, and had no Recompence, that he had always shewed himſelf Loyal to the King, but whenever there came any place of Preferment to be diſpoſed of, it was rather given to ſuch as had been Traytors and Rebels to the old King, and likewiſe to the King himſelf than to any that had been had Loyal. He ſaid, this was his chief Motive, if there were not Religion in the Caſe, which was of an higher nature, or to that purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>I was told I need not fear, and particularly my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> told me, I should have a free Pardon for it, for the King had been Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and was likewiſe a Traytor, and a Rebel, and an Enemy to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>There came a Letter to <hi>Evers</hi> from my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> I knew it to be my Lords hand, ſome might counterfeit his hand, but as near as a man

                  <p>My Lords, I have divers Queſtions to ask him, very many, but I humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crave your Lordships Directions, if I ask him any Queſtions now, whether I may not ask him ſome afterwards.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, you may ask Queſtions of the Witneſſes as often as you pleaſe, and when ever you find it uſeful to you, God forbid there should be any time to forecloſe a man from asking a Queſtion that may ſave his life.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I ſay, he ſpeaks of the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or beginning of <hi>September,</hi> which is too great a latitude, and I conceive more than ought to be given in ſuch a matter of importance as this is to me; I deſire he may name the day, for he may name days perhaps that I was not there.</p>

                  <p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> my Lord does deſire, if you can, you would be a little more particular than about the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>September,</hi> if you can remember the day tell it us.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, in the year (67.) there were divers attempts upon the life of the King as the Jeſuits told me, and in the year (74.) there was an attempt upon the account of the Kings withdrawing the Indulgence in (74.) and (75.) in the year 1677. whilſt I was in <hi>Spain</hi> I met with ſeveral letters ſigned <hi>Stafford,</hi> wherein my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did aſſure the Jeſuits in <hi>Spain,</hi> that were of the Irish Nation, how zealous he should appear in the promoting of the Catholick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. My Lords, in the year (77.) I went to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and I came there in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi> My Lords, in that year I being ordered to look over the Papers and put them in order; I found ſeveral Letters ſigned <hi>Stafford,</hi> wherein my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did intimate to the Fathers that whereas there had been ſome difference betwixt him and the Society for ſeveral years, the buſineſs was reconciled by one Seignior <hi>Con,</hi> who came over into <hi>England</hi> in the year (76.) to reconcile the great Difference that was betwixt the Jeſuits and the ſecular Clergy, and between the Benedictine Monks and the Jeſuits. My Lords, my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105168:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this Seignior <hi>Con,</hi> as he does intimate in his letter, does aſſure the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of his fidelity and his zeal. My Lords, in the year (78.) I found letters from my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> wherein he does blame Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s openneſs, and his being too publick in the great Affair, and that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was pleaſed to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſeveral great ſecrets to men, of whoſe Fidelity his Lordship was not ſecure. My Lords, in the year (78.) in the month of <hi>June,</hi> my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar, came to Mr. <hi>Fenwick,</hi> and there received a Commiſſion from him to pay an Army that was to be raiſed for the promoting of the Catholick Intereſt, and he did aſſure Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> that he was going down into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and there he did not queſtion but he should have a good account how the Catholicks ſtood affected, and he did not queſtion but to give a good account how Affairs ſtood in <hi>Staffordſhire, Shropſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and this Commiſſion to my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was, as neer as I can remember, to be Pay-Maſter-General of the Army. My Lords, among other Diſcourſes with my Lord at the Bar, he was diſcourſing about my Lord Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> his Son, and after ſeveral other paſſages, he (Fenwick) was asking of him how my Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> came to have a Jeſuit in his Houſe. My Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did ſay, that my Lord of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> his Father in Law, was inſtrumental in it on purpoſe to oblige the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> for my Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> as I have been told, kept Father <hi>Symonds</hi> in his Houſe, who to my knowledge was a Jeſuit. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Lords, he came to Mr. <hi>Fenwicks</hi> (my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did) by the name of Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Effingham.</hi>

'Tis two years ſince, and I cannot remember the words, but my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did ſay, he was of neceſſity to go into the Country at that time. And there he did write a letter to St. <hi>Omers,</hi> in which he did excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about a young man that was to be ſent to the Jeſuits Colledge, whom he had taken care of another way. And he deſired their excuſe, but he would be as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them as any body for all that. And the ſame hand that wrote that letter,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105168:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by all the comparing I could make in my thoughts, wrote all the other Letters that I ſaw at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and in <hi>Spain.</hi> My Lords, I ſaw my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> at Dr. <hi>Perrotts,</hi> I think verily it was in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> (78.) it was before the riſing of the Parliament, that ſat that Summer, and my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was diſcourſing of a Son he was to ſend over to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and he went over by the name of Sir <hi>John Stafford.</hi> And after this Diſcourſe was over they fell into a Diſcourſe of the Affairs in hand, and my Lord was mighty glad there was ſo good a Correſpondence and Concord; though my Lords, it was not very great for the Jeſuits have an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable Quarrel with the reſt of the Clergy. But my Lord did hope that their fair Correſpondence might tend highly to the advancing the Catholick Cauſe. But my Lords, I have one thing more to ſpeak as to the Diſcourſe at <hi>Fenwicks</hi> Chamber, ſpeaking of the King, he ſaid, He hath deceived us a great while, and we can bear no longer.</p>

                  <p>There was ſome money returned, but it was no great Sum, and it was about private buſineſs; Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> was to receive it; I chanced to have the money in my own keeping; Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> gave it me to pay to Mr. <hi>Morgan,</hi> and the letter in which the Sum was mentioned did give them an Account (for it was out of <hi>Staffordſhire)</hi> that he found things ſtand in a very good ſtate there; but I being not within, Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> called on Mr. <hi>Fenwick</hi> for the money, which I returned to him when he had paid it.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, in the year 1675. I was perſwaded by my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and one <hi>Morgan</hi> that was Confeſſor to the Family, to go to <hi>Doway,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take upon me the Fryars Habit. When I came there, inſtead of Religion, I found nothing but Hypocriſie and Villainy among them, and quickly grew wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſtaying there, and with much difficulty I eſcaped thence to go for <hi>England;</hi> when I came into <hi>England,</hi> I did not think that my Friends would look unkindly upon me, becauſe I refuſed to live in that way that they propoſed to me to live in. I uſed all the means I could to have them reconciled, and made applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, that ſince I could not bear with the life they would have had me lived in, they would contrive ſome way for me, being a younger Brother, that I might live in the world; but they were ſo averſe and inveterate againſt me, that they told me, inſtead of doing any thing for me, they would do me all the miſchief and prejudice they could; and having lived all my time among them, I thought the World would receive a Character of me from them who were my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they would pleaſe to repreſent it; ſo having no hopes in <hi>England</hi> I took a reſolution to go into <hi>France,</hi> where I had a Brother that was a Benedictine Monk, and <hi>I</hi> hoped that he being in good repute amongſt them, might be able to do me ſome ſervice there. When I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> my Brother uſed all the endeavours imaginable to get me to be of that Order; but I having ſo ill a conceit and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Order that I was in before, and thinking all the reſt were the ſame, I was unwilling at all to enter into it. And after I had ſtaid there a while I reſolved to come over into <hi>England.</hi> My Brother uſed all the means he could for my accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, and recommended me to this Noble Lord the Priſoner at the Bar, who lodged then at a corner houſe in a Street which, as I remember, bears the name of <hi>La Rue de Beaufort,</hi> where I was ſeveral times with him in order to come over with him in the Yaught for <hi>England.</hi> After I had been there for a fortnight with this Lord, he underſtanding my condition, by my Brother, and by the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of that Convent, and imagining I was a fit inſtrument to be employed on ſuch an occaſion, propos'd to me a way whereby, as he ſaid, I might not only retrieve my Reputation with my Relations, but alſo make my ſelf a very happy man; and after having exacted from me all the obligations of ſecreſie which I could give him, he at length told me in direct terms, it was to take away the life of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who was an Heretick, and conſequently a Rebel againſt God Almighty. I looked upon it as an extraordinary attempt, and deſired time to conſider of it before I would undertake it. And I gave him this anſwer, I would give him my reſolution at <hi>Diep,</hi> where we were to go on board for <hi>England.</hi> And when I came to take my leave of this Noble Lord at the Bar, he was ſitting upon a bench, and he was troubled with the Gout in his foot at that time. And he told me he had ſome buſineſs to go to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> and that he should not be in ſix or ſeven days at <hi>Diep,</hi> where I was to wait for him. After a while I received a letter at <hi>Diep</hi> from his Lordship, wherein he writ word, That he had altered his reſolution,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105168:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and would go by the way of <hi>Calice,</hi> and that I should haſten to wait on his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship at <hi>London.</hi> I have one thing more to obſerve to your Lordships, when <hi>I</hi> got paſſage from <hi>Diep,</hi> in a Fisher-boat for <hi>England, I</hi> never came neer my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> becauſe being not willing to undertake his propoſal, <hi>I</hi> thought my ſelf not ſafe, even from my own Relations, and therefore <hi>I</hi> made my applications to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and his Grace was pleaſed by letter to recommend me into the <hi>French</hi> ſervice, and by that means <hi>I</hi> avoided his Lordships further impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, it is now about two years that <hi>I</hi> have had the misfortune to be accuſed of this deteſtable Treaſon. <hi>I</hi> have been ſeveral times in thoſe two years a cloſe priſoner, that my Wife and Children were denyed to come neer me; and hardly a Servant permitted to ask how <hi>I</hi> did, but at the door of my Priſon. My Lords, This was a great and an heavy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me; and, my Lords, it was ſo great an affliction to me, that truly <hi>I</hi> did not know how to bear it. 'Tis true, <hi>I</hi> had that comfort, that <hi>I</hi> did hope <hi>I</hi> should ſoon come to my Tryal, and before your Lordships make my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency appear. In order to which, <hi>I</hi> did all <hi>I</hi> could, having heard this Hall was provided for it; and <hi>I</hi> did expect in a very few days to clear my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Lordships and all the World. When <hi>I</hi> had ſettled my mind, and did not foreſee any greater affliction that could befall me, <hi>I</hi> had on the ſudden by ſome of my friends a ſad Meſſage ſent me, That the Houſe of Commons had impeached me of High Treaſon. My Lords, <hi>I</hi> looked upon the Houſe of Commons then (as <hi>I</hi> do now) as the great Repreſentative Body of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> confeſs, my Lords, to be accuſed by them was a load, eſpecially being added to what lay before upon me, more eſpecially to my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>My Lords, I have heard very much of a thing that was named by theſe Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, and that very properly too, to wit, of the Gun-powder Treaſon. My Lords, I was not born then, but ſome years after I heard very much Diſcourſe of it, and very various Reports; and I made a particular inquiry, perhaps more than any one perſon did elſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both of my Father who was a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, my Lords, I was acquainted with one of them that was concerned in it, who had his pardon, and lived many years after, I diſcourſed with him about it, and he confeſſed it, and ſaid, he was ſorry for it then; and I here declare to your Lordships, that I never heard any one of the Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h of <hi>Rome</hi> ſpeak a good word of it: it was ſo horrid a thing that it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed nor excuſed. And God Almighty shewed his Judgments upon them for their wickedneſs; for hardly any of the Perſons or their Poſterity are left that were conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rned in it; and even a very great Family too, that had collaterally ſomething to do in it, is in the Male line extinct totally; and I do think God Almighty always shews his Judgments upon ſuch vile Actions. And I have been told, all thoſe perſons that were engaged in this wicked Act, were all hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry for it, and repented of it before they died, without which I am ſure there is no Salvation. And therefore I think it was not the Intereſt of Religion, but a private Intereſt put them upon it.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, As to the Doctrine of King-killing, and Abſolving perſons from their Allegiance, I cannot ſay the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not hold it, I never heard it did hold it, it may be it does, it may be not, I ſay not one thing or other, but my Lords, there was an English Colledge of Prieſts at <hi>Rhemes,</hi> that tranſlated the Bible, and printed it with Authority according to their Tranſlation, and in their Annotations upon the fourteenth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they do declare their diſlike and deteſtation of that Opinion. They ſay all Subjects ought to obey their Kings as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> mitive Chriſtians did the Heathen Princes of the Empire; and the learned Doctors of the Colledge of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> did upon an occaſion adminiſtred to them about that Opinion, declare the miſtakes that were in it, and owned
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105168:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it to be a damnable Principle. My Lords, I have an Authentical Copy of that Decree of the Sorboniſts, whether it be here or no, I can't tell—Yes, here it is, which does declare that, a damnable Poſition; and there is lately come out a Book, written by a Prieſt of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tryed for his life for being in the Plot, but acquitted of that, in which he ſays, that that Opinion of killing Kings is damnable and herettical, and declared ſo by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lords, This gives me occaſion to believe that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds it not. I do not ſay that it does not, but ſome particular perſons do abhor it which are great in that Church, and which weighs far with me; but that which further moſt of all confirms me in my ill Opinion of it, is the words of our Saviour, when not only he commands us to give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> but aſſerts our Obedience to our Governours in many other paſſages of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; and what I find there, the whole World is not able to alter my Opinion of.</p>
                  <p>I do aſſure your Lordships in the preſence of Almighty God, That I do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly admire when I hear of any thing like it, and I did read with great horror what I found the other day in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> of ſome imprudent people in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of their wicked Principles and Practices.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I do in the preſence of Almighty God, who knows and ſees all things, and of his Angels, which are continually about us, and of your Lordships who are my Peers and Judges, ſolemnly profeſs and declare, that I hate and deteſt any ſuch Opinion, as I do damnation to my ſelf. And I cannot be more deſirous of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to my ſelf, than I am cordial in hating this Opinion.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I know no perſon upon Earth, nor all the perſons in the world put together, nor all the Power they have, can in the leaſt abſolve me of my Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance. And I do acknowledge the King is my Soveraign, and I ought to obey him as far as the Law of the Land obliges any Subject of his to obey him; whether I have taken the Oath of Allegiance, I appeal to your Lordships to be my Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and if I did not take it a thouſand times for my Allegiance to the King, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, I think I should deſerve a thouſand Deaths, and all the Torments in the world for refuſing it.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, Theſe Gentlemen here did begin their Charge, Serjeant <hi>Maynard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Winnington,</hi> with telling your Lordships there was an horrid Deſign to murder the King, to alter the Government, and introduce the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Religon. This they ſay was ingaged in by the Roman Catholicks, that all the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were the Contrivers of it; for they tell your Lordships, the whole Body hath been ingaged in it, and they have given you many Proofs by Witneſſes examined the firſt day, of a General Plot; what Credit you will give to them I leave to your Lordships in the end of the Caſe, but ſtill they ſaid it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105168:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was the Body of the Roman Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> or the Papiſts, or what they call them, that were the Plotters in this Deſign. But I beſeech your Lordships, how am I concerned in it? for I muſt ſay to your Lordships, they have not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered one proof that I am of that Religion. So that though any of you should have ſeen me at the Exerciſes of that Religion, or otherwiſe know it of your ſelves, yet if there be no Proof judicially before you, you are not to take notice of it. I have heard if a man be accuſed of a Crime, and be to be tryed, and no Evidence come in, if every man of the Jury were ſure that the Fact was done, yet they muſt go upon the Evidence produced to them, and not upon their own knowledge. So then no Evidence being produced before your Lordships, about my being a Papiſt, you are not to take me for ſuch an one. But, my Lords, if I were of that Church, and that were never ſo well proved too, I hope I have an advantage in it, that I have kept my ſelf from being poyſoned with ſo wicked a Principle, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with the reſt in ſo ill a thing.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I am here accuſed of having endeavoured to kill the King. I find by the Law, upon reading Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> ſince my Impriſonment, That all Accuſations of Treaſon ought to be accompanied with Circumſtances antecedent, concomitant and ſubſequent; but I conceive, my Lords, there is no tittle of any ſuch thing proved againſt me. The whole compaſs of my life from my infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath been clear otherwiſe. In the beginning of the late unhappy times, the late King of happy and glorious memory, did me the honour to make me a Peer; and thinking that my preſence might rather prejudice him than ſerve him, my Wife and I ſettled at <hi>Antwerp</hi> when the War begun, where I might have lived, though obſcurely, yet ſafely; but I was not ſatisfied in my Conſcience to ſee my King in ſo much diſorder, and I not endeavour to ſerve him what I could, to free him from his troubles. And I did come into <hi>England,</hi> and ſerved his Majeſty faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and loyally, as long as he lived. And ſome of your Lordships here, know, whether I did not wait upon the now King in his Exile, from which he was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily reſtored, which shews I had no ill intention then.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I hope this I have ſaid does shew, that my life hath given no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to this Accuſation, but clear contrary to what theſe (I hope I may call them ſo, and doubt not to prove them ſo) perjured Villains ſay againſt me.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, After I had this misfortune to be thus accuſed, about a month or ſix weeks after, your Lordships were pleaſed to ſend two Members of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Body to me. I do not ſee them at preſent here, to examine me about the Plot, (they were my Lord of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Eſſex)</hi> if they be here, I appeal to them what I did ſay. Theſe two, after they had examined me told me, they did believe, and could almoſt aſſure me, That if I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my Fault, and let them know the particulars of it, your Lordships would intercede with the King for my Pardon; but I then, as I ought, aſſerted my own
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105168:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Innocency. Not long after, the King out of his Grace and Goodneſs to me, ſent ſix of the Council to the <hi>Tower</hi> to offer me, That though I was never ſo guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet if I would confeſs, I should have my Pardon. I did then conſider with my ſelf, I could not imagine what ground there was to believe your Lordships could have Evidence of what there was not, to bring me in Guilty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I was ſo far from being able to make a Diſcovery, that I could not invent any thing that might ſave my life if I would.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I was ſeven days in the Countrey after I heard of the Plot; if I had known my ſelf guilty, I should ſurely have run away. As I came to <hi>London,</hi> when I was at <hi>Lichfield</hi> there met me two of my Lords; They told me, and ſo did a Gentleman of the Houſe of Commons, how much there was in the Plot, which if I had had an hand in it would certainly make me fly for it. I have ever heard when a man is accuſed or ſuſpected of a Crime, Flight is a great ſign of Guilt, and that it is often asked of the Jury, though there be no certain poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Evidence of the Fact, Whether a man fled or no? As that is a ſign of Guilt, ſo Remaining is a ſign of Innocency. If then after Notice, I come to Town, and ſuffer my ſelf to be taken, if after Impriſonment and Accuſation I refuſe my Pardon, and yet had been Guilty, I ought to die for my Folly as well as my Crime.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, 'tis a great Offence to commit Treaſon, and a great Addition to continue obſtinate, when upon Acknowledgment a man can ſave his life; nay, my Lords, if I should have refuſed theſe Offers, and yet known my ſelf Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I had at the ſame time been guilty of one of the greateſt Sins in the world, as being the cauſe of my own Death. And as <hi>I</hi> hold, next to Treaſon, Murder the greateſt ſin, ſo I hold of all Murders Self-murder to be the greateſt: nay, I do not think any man living can pardon that Sin of Murder. And I do profeſs to your Lordships in the preſence of Almighty God, that if I could immediately, by the Death of this impudent Fellow <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who hath done me ſo much wrong, make my ſelf the greateſt man in the world, that is or ever was; I profeſs before God I would not; I cannot ſay my Charity is ſo great, but that I should be glad to ſee him ſuffer thoſe Puniſhments the Law can inflict upon him for his Crimes, but his Death I would not have. Blood is ſo great a Crime, and <hi>I</hi> know every man is careful of giving his Voice in the Caſe of Blood, I should be very cautious my ſelf; and if I were a Judge I would rather ſave twenty Guilty, than condemn one Innocent. I bleſs God I have not the leaſt deſire of the Death of any man, and would not for all the world have the innocent Blood of all the word lye upon me.</p>
                  <p>I beg your Lordships pardon that I have troubled you thus long: I shall now as well as I can, apply my ſelf to my particular Defence. I do, my Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can go on to it, deſire I may have ſuch Depoſitions as have been taken
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105168:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againſt me; and the liberty to look on your Journal Book, when I have occaſion. I do particularly deſire the Depoſitions of <hi>Oats,</hi> upon which I was committed, by my Lord Chief Juſtice; the two Depoſitions of <hi>Stephen Dugdale,</hi> taken at <hi>Stafford</hi> before two Juſtices of the Peace, Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vernon;</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Depoſitions taken before, I think it was Mr. <hi>Warcup</hi> and Sir <hi>William Poultney,</hi> or ſome other two Juſtices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was made by <hi>Turbervile,</hi> and then I shall compare their Teſtimonies together: And I hope shall give you a clear account that they are perjured perſons. How without theſe to go on to my juſt Defence I cannot well tell.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, We do not object againſt it; but, my Lords, <hi>I</hi> think it is out of time of to deſire it. What was ſworn, and is entred in your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Journal, was ſworn above two years ſince. My Lord, or any man elſe might repair to them, they are matters of Record, and for ought we know were never denyed to any, eſpecially if they deſired it in the Houſe; but after two years time, and after three weeks time given to prepare for this Tryal, when my Lord could not but know what Witneſſes would be examined before your Lordships, for him to come now and deſire ſuch and ſuch Depoſitions may be produced, which if by Law he might be allowed to do, he might have done before, is to no other purpoſe, under favour, but to gain time, and to cauſe our Evidence to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And therefore we muſt humbly pray it may not be admitted: My Lords, <hi>I</hi> think it is an unuſual thing, My Lords the Judges are neer your Lordships, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe they will inform your Lordships. If a man be tryed at the Aſſizes, for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105168:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him to deſire a Coppy of the Informations remaining in Court, by which he may except againſt the Witneſſes, is what the Court does not uſe to grant: But if your Lordships proceedings vary from the common proceedings of other Courts, then I reſort to what I ſaid before. Whether your Lordships will think this a proper time when he might have had it in the Parliament that was firſt Diſſolved, and then in the Parliament that was laſt Diſſolved. Now to deſire thoſe Copies at this time, is to put off the Cauſe, for that which perhaps he cannot be furnished with in a day or two.</p>

                  <p>I would add but one word, if your Lordships pleaſe to give me leave. My Lords, you have the Learned Judges near you, who will inform you Whether ever, when a man was accuſed of a Capital Offence, and the Evidence againſt him had been fully heard, by the Court and by himſelf, he was admitted to require from the Proſecutors, the Copies of Examinations formerly taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other Perſons? Does my Lord intend to have time to peruſe thoſe Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and to have the Copies of them, that he may conſult in private with his Counſel to find out Exceptions, and with his Witneſſes to make them good? My Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>I</hi> muſt ſay that in my short Experience (and <hi>I</hi> have attended a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time upon the greateſt Court for Trial of Offenders) <hi>I</hi> never heard ſuch a thing asked by a Priſoner, either at the Bar of the Kings Bench, or at the Aſſizes. <hi>I</hi> ſpeak with all the tenderneſs imaginable, becauſe we are in a matter of Blood, and God-forbid but the Lord at the Bar should have true and equal Juſtice done him. But if <hi>I</hi> take my Lord right, this ſeems but an Artifice to delay the Trial, of which it is our duty to be very cautious. Indeed I have ſeen the Judges, upon trial of a Criminal, call for the Depoſitions, or Informations from the Clerk, or the Juſtice of the Peace who took them, and cauſed them to be read; but for a Priſoner to call for Examinations at the Bar from the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, <hi>Et ex Debita Justitia,</hi> to demand them, is a thing, which as it never has been, ſo <hi>I</hi> think will not be admitted at this time, eſpecially when we are now almoſt at the end of the Cauſe, and with all Modeſty and Submiſſion to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, <hi>I</hi> look upon it as a very ſtrange and unreaſonable Demand.</p>

                  <p>Let us underſtand your Lordships demands, that when my Lords are withdrawn, I may know what Queſtions to put to them, and acquaint them with your deſires: The one is the Journal of the Lords Houſe, which is always before their Lordships, and you might have had Copies long ſince. The next thing you ask is an Affidavit of <hi>Dugdale,</hi> if this Affidavit is entred into the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that ſupplies your Demands, if it be not entred there, where shall we find it?</p>

                  <p>My Lord, will your Lordship give me leave to tell you, you ought to be provided with ſome particular exception, and not to make your demand in general. If your Lordship will ſay <hi>Dugdale</hi> did ſwear ſuch and ſuch things, which are contrary to what he now affirms, we know what to make of it; but to hunt after an Affidavit, that we know not where to find, to pick ſomething out of it, that I do not underſtand.</p>

                  <p>Before your Lordships withdraw, I hope you will pleaſe to hear us a few words, which we think may be for the Service of this Court. My Lords, what Evidence is before your Lordships, 'tis in your Lordships pleaſure what of that you shall pleaſe to communicate to my Lord <hi>Stafford;</hi> but for this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he ſpeaks of as remaining in our hands, and which he takes upon himſelf to appeal to us for, admits of another conſideration. My Lords, if we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of any thing in theſe <hi>Affidavits</hi> that were for my Lords Advantage, and knew where they were, we would redily produce them; but for my ſelf, I muſt anſwer, and I think my Companions will ſay ſo too, that we do not know where theſe <hi>Affidavits</hi> are, nor of any Variation in thoſe <hi>Affidavits</hi> from what is now ſworn, but whatever they were, they were taken for the Information of the Houſe of Commons, who are the Proſecutors in this Cauſe, and who are no Judges. Now if my Lord will bring any Witneſs that will ſay this Witneſs of ours did before a Juſtice of Peaee depoſe ſo and ſo, and ſays the contrary now, there might be then juſt reaſons to look after theſe <hi>Affidavits</hi> and to have them produced, but upon a bare imagination that there is a Variance where in truth there is none, and the Truth may otherwiſe be known; to deſire that theſe <hi>Affidavits</hi> that never were before you should be produced, whether ſuch a Suggeſtion is to be admitted, I humbly ſubmit it to your Lordships Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, if theſe Gentlemen that are the Managers for the Houſe of Commons will aver to your Lordships, that there is no Variation in them, I will ſubmit to them and be quiet; if they will ſay it was not debated in the Houſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he should amend or no.</p>

take it upon you to aver that there is no Variation between thoſe Affidavits upon which you grounded your Impeachment, and the Evidence you have given upon the Trial of your Impeachment, he will not give you the trouble.</p>

                  <p>I beſeech you let me ſay one word, my Lords, I have been thus long a Priſoner, I was as far from being proceeded againſt now, as any of the reſt of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> till <hi>Turbervile</hi> came in with his Diſcovery, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I am now called the ſooner (which I am glad of, and I give the Gentlemen thanks for it) upon the Affidavit of <hi>Turbervile,</hi> I deſire that Affidavit; and though it be true the Houſe of Commons give no Oath, yet they appointed two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe that were Juſtices of the Peace of <hi>Middleſex</hi> to take it upon Oath, and he deſired the next day to amend it; and I put my ſelf upon them, whether this be not true.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, whether your Lordships will think fit to conſider by what ways and means the Houſe of Commons informed themſelves, in order to Impeachments, I ſubmit to you; and for thoſe things that ſtill remain in the hands of the Commons, I ſuppoſe you will be pleaſed to conſider how you can ſend for them to inform you. We would not be miſtaken in the matter; let not any one that hears us think that we are conſcious there is the leaſt Variation, nay we are confident, if the thing were produced, it would turn to my Lords pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; but what is done in this Caſe, may be a Preſident for the future; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot without reſorting to the Houſe, conſent to deliver any thing the Houſe took for their Information. Therefore if your Lordships ſtand upon it, and incline to have it done, we muſt reſort to the Houſe to ask their leave whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we shall do it or no.</p>

                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot tell what my Lords will incline to do; but I deſire when you are gone back, you will conſider how far it will make the matter eaſie to my Lord.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, we can give no Anſwer to that till we have attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Houſe.</p>

                  <p>I deſire your Lordships to conſider what a piece of cunning he hath put upon both Houſes, to paſs by his villifying our Witneſſes, which I may ſay was not comely. But if he makes any Queſtion, it muſt be put to the Houſes upon ſuppoſition to be a Queſtion, and ſo he would bring things only to this iſſue to put off the Cauſe for to day. He ought to put that which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be ſomething of a Queſtion. Let him inſtance in particulars, and make out his Evidence, not ſeign things to put off the Cauſe; for ought I ſee 'tis to no other end, and 'tis a Jeſuitical trick I think.</p>

                  <p>It is uſual in theſe Caſes for the Gentlemen of the Houſe of

Commons to ſtay till the Lords are withdrawn, and expect their Lordships Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; perhaps they may ſo order it that you need not go back.</p>

                  <p>I deſire before your Lordships withdraw, that it may be taken notice of by your Lordships, that for the matter of the variation of the year we do admit it. My Lord is not pleaſed to mention any other particular matter of the <hi>Affidavit,</hi> but only ſays in general that it is contrary to what he ſays to day; if my Lord would tell us wherein, perhaps we should admit it, or anſwer it, or take it into further conſideration; but to make ſo general an Allegation, and give your Lordships no particular account, we ſubmit whether ſuch a ſuggeſtion ought to be regarded.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord High Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>Is there any further variation, beſides the variation of the year?</p>

                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>I cannot ſay there is my Lord, I do not know it; but I do really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in my Conſcience there is, from what I have heard; but however I inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and demand your Judgment.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Fr. Win.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I humbly deſire one word as to the Objection that hath been made, that he hath prayed your Lordships to grant him the ſight of ſuch and ſuch Papers. The nature of this Cauſe, my Lords, we know is ſuch, that there was never the like number of Papers known, as to the General Plot; and my Lord, that is the Priſoner at the Bar, may as well demand to morrow ſuch a particular Paper, and the next day another, that he hath heard of in the General Plot; and where will the end of this be? So that if the thing be granted upon the variation of the time that it was immediately rectifyed, and he cannot produce any grounds that may ſatisfie your Lordships why he should have that Paper, you may as well ſuffer him to demand any other Paper after, and ſo never end the Cauſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>Your Lordship hath been told, and you shall find it, that you shall have as fair and equal an Hearing as is poſſible, and nothing shall be denied you that is juſt and reaſonable to ſafe your Life, or make your Defence. But pray, my Lord, for ſo much as is upon the Journal, which you may reſort unto, you may eaſily know what anſwer my Lords will give to that; but for this other thing, if it be only the variety you alledge of the Time and the Year, and you do deſire it to look for other Exceptions, and you pray the help of the Lords to ſee ſuch a Paper, that you might make inquiry after other varieties, Do you think they are to help you to find out Exceptions to the Witneſſes?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not deſire their Lordships to help me to find out Exceptions; but I have told your Lordships of one Exception to the <hi>Affidavit</hi> which theſe Gentlemen acknowledge to be true, and the other <hi>Affidavit</hi> is, that he Swears I ſpoke to him at <hi>Doway</hi> in the year (72) or (73) which I can diſprove; and then I ſay he Swearing ſeveral things falſe, he is no credible Witneſs.</p>

                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis admitted to your Lordship that he did miſtake the time.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>It is admitted that he ſaid he ſpoke to me at <hi>Doway.</hi>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>I never ſaw it, and a great many of the Managers ſay they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw it.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe Gentlemen ſay I did it to put off the Cauſe, I am far from it: for though I am in a condition very unfit to manage my Defence, faint and weak with ſpeaking ſo long, and hardly able to ſpeak any more, yet I deſire to finish this night, and if I ſee it now, it will be enough, I shall not deſire to have a Copy to adviſe with my Counſel, or any body elſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons will you obſerve, my Lord, as weary as he is, would make an end of the matter preſently, if you would but ſend for the <hi>Affidavit,</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Foley.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, it is not in our hands here, if the Houſe of Commons will order it, it may be done, we cannot order it of our ſelves.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Powle.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, this is a Paper that does properly belong to the Houſe, and I do think, that none of us here that are Managers for this Trial, will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it shall be delivered without reſorting to the Houſe for their Opinion; for though I do verily beleive, and am fully perſuaded, that what this Noble Lord at the Bar does object, will not appear to be ſo; For I think there is not any thing of my Lord <hi>Staffora</hi>'s ſpeaking with this Witneſs at <hi>Doway</hi> mentioned therein; yet how far the Preſidents of this may reach in other Caſes, I think, is worthy the Conſideration of the Houſe. And we cannot preſume to offer any thing in it to your Lordships, until you be pleaſed to give us leave to go and reſort thither.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then the Lords withdrew, and after an Hours and an Halfs ſpace returned, and Proclamation was made for Silence.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord Viſcount <hi>Safford,</hi> my Lords have conſidered of the Demands you made; and my Lords, upon the Debate of the Reaſons of your Demands, are come to this Reſolution. Your Lordship did demand in the firſt place, that you might have a ſight of the Journal, and have the Papers lodged in the Houſe of Peers: My Lords take notice that this Demand which your Lordship now makes, is a Demand that was granted you long ago, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years ſince; you have an Order entred upon the Books, that your Lordship should have Copies of every thing in that Houſe, and if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship have not taken out Copies, and if any thing is miſſing to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that is yet there extant, 'tis your Lordships fault. However, my Lords will command their Journals to be brought hither, that your Lordship may make that uſe of them that may be of moſt profit to you. For the other
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105168:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Demand touching the Affidavit ſuppoſed to be taken from <hi>Turbervile</hi> by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace, that my Lords upon Conſideration had, do find that there is no Obligation at all upon them as a Court, to concern themſelves in that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore my Lords have made no Order in that Point, but your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship muſt come provided as well as you can, and the Court can do no more to help you in it. For the reſt, my Lords did take notice that your Lordship ſaid before they were withdrawn, That you found your ſelf very Faint and Weary, and that you were much ſpent in Diſcourſe, and Tired with what already you have done. My Lords are extreamly willing to give your Lordship all the Favour and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation poſſible, for the Recollecting your ſelf, therefore my Lords will not now put you upon it, to go on to make your Defence, but will give you time till to Morrow.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>I humbly give your Lordships thanks for your kindneſs and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to me; but here I profeſs, and call Almighty God to witneſs, rather than I would have it thought I am willing to put it off, I would have ſunk down Dead at the Bar. But, my Lords, there was another Demand that I made: Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships ſay, I shall have Copies of all the Journals, and that you cannot help me to the Affidavit of <hi>Turbervile,</hi> I ſubmit to it without ſaying one word more; but I deſire that I may have brought hither to Morrow the Journals, and other Papers in the Lords Houſe, but I deſire alſo the two Affidavits of <hi>Dugdale,</hi> taken the one the 24. the other the 29. of <hi>December</hi> following, which Depoſitions were taken before Mr. <hi>Lane,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vernon,</hi> in <hi>Stafford</hi> Town, when <hi>Dugdale</hi> was in Priſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>Look you my Lord, This is all under the ſame Rule: What Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſoever there is before the Court of Peers, that you shall have; whatſoever Evidence is not in that Court, you ought to come provided of; the Court is not to ſtay, nor to help you to Evidence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I beg your pardon, <hi>Dugdale</hi> made an Affidavit then, and ſays the clean contrary now; I deſire nothing but Juſtice, and <hi>I</hi> am ſure <hi>I</hi> shall have all Juſtice from your Lordships.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>Produce it, and alledge what you will for your ſelf, it shall be heard.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>How then shall <hi>I</hi> be able to make my Defence, if <hi>I</hi> have not thoſe Papers, which <hi>I</hi> humbly concieve by the Law, ought to be brought? Theſe Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons ſay, That <hi>I</hi> could not have <hi>Turbervile's</hi> Affidavit becauſe it was in the Houſe, and they could not give it without conſent of the Houſe, but this was examined before a Juſtice of Peace, and returned to the Council: Sure <hi>I</hi> shall have that? <hi>I</hi> was examined by my Lord of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> upon that Affidavit twice <hi>I</hi> think, therefore that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and neceſſary; and <hi>I</hi> know your Lordships would not have me come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelf without Weapons.</p>

                  <p>Look you Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, in a Caſe of this conſequence, and of this Vital Importance to a Man as this is, where is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience if there should be a days reſpite, and the Court should Adjourn till Friday, if my Lords be moved in it, I make no direction, but what inconvenience will be in it? Will it not be every way as well?</p>

                  <p>Your Lordships are the Judges, and will do as you find it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; but this I ſay, it is very unuſual, and ſcarce to be Preſidented, that when the Proſecutors have given an Evidence, the Priſoner should have time, a further conſiderable time, to give his Anſwer to it; the Priſoner knows before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hand the general Scope and Drift of the Evidence; therefore for him to have time till to morrow is a favour; but to have more than that, even a whole day to intervene, is very unuſual.</p>

                  <p>If that be all, and the matter depend upon what is uſual, I do ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with my Lords leave, to inform you, that my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> had two days time after the Proſecution to give his Anſwer to what was ſaid againſt him.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> William Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>That was an Evidence upon Twenty Eight Articles, this but upon Two Heads; and that was after a long Examination of many days.</p>

                  <p>My Lords I had prepared my ſelf for my Tryal as well as I could, and had written down a few things that I intended to ſay; and I profeſs before God as I am a Man, and as I am a Chriſtian, of all I intended to ſay I have in a manner made uſe of very few words; but as to what I had to ſay upon the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I was forced to lay all aſide, becauſe I wanted theſe Papers; I have not eaten to day, and being forced to lay aſide all that I had written, I shall need a whole day to write; however I ſubmit my ſelf to your Lordships in that matter.</p>

                  <p>But we muſt deſire your Lordships, as we are entruſted by the Houſe of Commons, to Manage this Tryal, to take notice, that as we do not expect your Lordships should take the Meaſures from our Deſires, much leſs do we expect you should do it at the only inſtance of the Priſoner. 'Tis a great advantage to this Lord to chooſe his own time when he will pleaſe to anſwer our Evidence. We do know very well, that in this Caſe there have been Attempts to Suborn Witneſſes, and that we shall prove in due time, and Attempts to deſtroy Witneſſes too; So that there hath been too much time loſt already, and I think to morrow is a very convenient time for him to make his Anſwer. And I muſt obſerve to your Lordships, that the Priſoner hath gained his end of not making his Anſwer this day by raiſing an Objection, which in my Thoughts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried no great weight in it, though when it was made, your Lordships were pleaſed to Adjourn upon it: But ſeeing he hath got his Point of deferring the making Anſwer till to morrow, there can be no reaſon he should gain a further day, ſince the Depoſitions may be ready by to morrow as well as by the next day. And therefore we deſire your Lordships will be pleaſed to go on in the Tryal to morrow.</p>

                  <p>My Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> this is the time appointed to hear what your Lordship hath to ſay in your Defence, and to call your Witneſſes.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, yeſterday my Lord Viſcount <hi>Stafford</hi> was pleaſed to make mention of an Affidavit of Mr. <hi>Turbervile</hi> taken before two Juſtices of the Peace, wherein he was pleaſed to ſay there was ſome Amendment made, and ſo indeed we did then acknowledg there was. But he had a deſire to ſee it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our acknowledgment, becauſe he was informed that that which <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> ſwore then, differed from what <hi>Turbervile</hi> ſwore yeſterday. My Lords, at that time we had not the Affidavit, nor was it proper for us to produce it, for indeed it remained in the Juſtice of Peace's Hands that took it; but now that his Lordship may have full ſatisfaction, and not only his Lordship, but alſo all that are preſent at this Tryal. I do inform his Lordship, that the Affidavit is in the hands of a Member of the Houſe of Commons, Sir <hi>Will.

                  <p>Not at all, my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is not proſecuted upon that Statute, but upon the Common Law, and the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> which was only Declarative of the Common Law.</p>

                  <p>Whether I can be proſecuted after ſo many days?</p>

                  <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>The Law is very clear. If you were proſecuted upon the 13<hi>th.</hi> of this King for any leſs Offence than Treaſon, you could not be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted after ſix months, but if you be proſecuted for Treaſon either upon the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> or 13. <hi>Car.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> there is no time limited, and God forbid there should.</p>

                  <p>I beſeech your Lordships Judgment, whether there be not a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, I think 'tis in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th.</hi> that ſets the time, after which no man shall be proſecuted for any thing of Treaſon; I deſire a quarter of an hours time to look into the Statute.</p>

                  <p>Pray Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons, my Lord does ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he hath ſome kind of Objection in Law to make, which he cannot make out of himſelf; will it be amiſs to let his Counſel make and propoſe the Queſtion for him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, we rather would have my Lord propoſe the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; for your Lordships know, till a matter of Law is propoſed, he cannot be admitted to have Counſel. If he deſires time to recollect himſelf about the Objection, we can't oppoſe it. But we deſire that he may propoſe the Objection, and after if it be any doubt in matter of Law, your Lordships will aſſign him Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to be heard to ſpeak to it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Franc. Winn.</speaker>
                  <p>This would be a way for a Priſoner to have the Advantage of Counſel, when they ought not to be allowed; for 'tis but to ſay, he hath ſome doubt which he cannot propoſe himſelf, and ſo let in his Counſel to make Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections for him. If any Queſtion of Law do ariſe, and that Queſtion is ſtated, you will allow the Priſoner Counſel to argue it, but at this rate he may make the like pretences in every part of his Defence, and ſo obtain that Counſel shall manage his whole Defence for him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe my Lord does intend an Objection as to the time of the Proſecution, but he does not know how to make it. He ſuppoſes he is proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105168:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after the ſix months, which he thinks is the time limited for the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I pray, my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> will your Lordship take time to recollect your ſelf, and make an Objection fit for Counſel to be heard upon, and you shall have it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>I beſeech you, I may have the Statute-Book with me, for I have none my ſelf, my Lord.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>With all our hearts, we do not oppoſe it.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then my Lord withdrew into the Room provided for him, and within a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour returned.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>

                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I do confeſs I have been very much miſtaken ever ſince I was firſt committed to the <hi>Tower:</hi> For I did conceive that they would have proceeded, as I thought, I was impeached upon the Statute of the 13<hi>th.</hi> of this King. I humbly deſire your Lordships Judgment, whether I ought or no, to be proſecuted upon that Statute?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>The Gentlemen have told you already: They proſecute you upon the Statute of 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> and upon the Common Law.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>And they lay aſide that Statute?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>What Statute?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>The 13<hi>th.</hi> of this King.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>What ſay you, Gentlemen, once more?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Fr. Winn.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, we have declared already to his Lordship, and if my Lord had looked well upon the Articles of Impeachment, he could not have put that Queſtion, but would have found himſelf impeached for Treaſon at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, declared by the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>So then they lay that aſide of the 13<hi>th.</hi> of this King.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Maynard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>We do not mention any Statute, but we mention the Crime, and that Crime is againſt the Common Law declared by the Statute, to wit, The attempting the King's Death, and the Subverſion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, There is no doubt but the attempting the King's Death is a great and hainous Crime, but, my Lords, I do not find that in the Impeachment, there is any Overt Act at all. And whether I shall anſwer to a Treaſon not proved by any Overt Act ſworn by two Witneſſes, I ſubmit to your Lordships. But, my Lords, becauſe your Lordships and the Houſe of Commons, may not think that I propoſe theſe things out of a deſire of delay; if your Lordships pleaſe, it may be ſaved to me with all other points of Law, I will go on to my proofs.</p>
               </sp>

                     <hi>L.</hi> H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, all theſe things shall be ſaved to you, pray let us hear your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>

                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>By all means, my Lord.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordships <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> ſaid, if I underſtand him aright, (and I ask him again) that he knew ſomething of the Plot, 15 or 16 years ago.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>What ſay you, Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> you hear the Queſtion. Did not you ſay you knew of the Plot 15 or 16 years ago?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Dugdale.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I did ſay it, and did explain my meaning in it. I did ſay there was among us ſuch a preparation to be made againſt the King died, of Arms and Money, that neither should be wanting.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>I beſeech your Lordship to ask what proportion of Arms was to be provided.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>What proportion of Arms was to be provided?</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I never heard it nominated how many abſolutely. I have heard of ſome Numbers. I heard of late of 30000. that were to be raiſed beyond Sea, what the whole number in <hi>England</hi> was, I have forgot, but <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> have heard Mr. <hi>Gavan,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſay, That if there was occaſion, they should have at leaſt 200000 to aſſiſt them, that was of Men, and I ſuppoſe they had Arms as well as Men.</p>

He tells you there was ſuch a thing, it might be ſo, or it might not be ſo, I am not concerned in it, then 'tis out of Doors as to what concerns me: I conceive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, if the Gentlemen conceive otherwiſe they will ſay ſo. Then, my Lords, the next thing is, How long ago it is ſince I firſt ſpake to him about this Plot, and I beſeech your Lordships he may mention time and place.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I did name there was a Conſult at <hi>Boſcobel</hi> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> but <hi>I</hi> do not remember that <hi>I</hi> did name my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> in any Conſult in <hi>Auguſt</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively; but as I ſay now, the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> or the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> But <hi>I</hi> did name that there was a Conſult at <hi>Boſcobel</hi> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> (78.)</p>

                  <p>My Lord, <hi>I</hi> ſubmit to your Lordship and the reſt of my Lords here, whether when that Queſtion was asked by my Lord <hi>Stafford, I</hi> did not ſay, That the firſt time <hi>I</hi> entred into correſpondency with the Conſulters, they told me, my Lord was to come down then, and <hi>I</hi> should receive Orders from him? <hi>I</hi> had heard of my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> before, but not to enter into any Conſults with him, till he came down, the latter end of that Summer.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I do poſitively averr, here are two Witneſſes, that ſay, he ſwore, I was there at the Conſult in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Now it concerns me to prove, that I was not there in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſince he ſaid abſolutely I was there in <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you I can prove I was not there not all the whole Month. In the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> I came from <hi>London,</hi> from my own Houſe; on <hi>Tueſday</hi> or <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 6. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I went to my Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi>'s, and that night I went to <hi>George Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> the next night I went onwards towards <hi>Bath;</hi> when I was there I went over and ſtaid with my Noble Lord, the Marqueſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> there I ſtaid two or three days, and I went thence to another place hard by there, and then I came back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to <hi>Bath,</hi> and went back again afterwards to my Lords Houſe; and the firſt or ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> I went from my Lords Houſe to <hi>London.</hi> Then it this be acknowledged, I need ſay no more; if not, I'll prove it by ſufficient Witneſſes: So then I was not there the whole Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> he ſays he ſpoke with me. I was not there till the 12. of <hi>September.</hi> Now I beſeech your Lordships how that could poſſibly be the beginning of <hi>September.</hi> I ſubmit to you, whether then he be a Witneſs fit to be heard, that shall ſweat poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively what hath no colour of truth in it, I alſo leave to you. And if they object I was not where <hi>I</hi> ſay <hi>I</hi> was in <hi>Auguſt, I</hi> will prove it.

I profeſs before God it is true as that the Sun shines, I have often and often, I cannot tell how many times, when I have been very dry at my Lords Table, and ſeen him by me, not called for Drink, I did deteſt him as ſo mean a Knave, that I often refuſed to take Drink at his hands.

                  <p>I do own, my Lord, thus far, he was in my chamber that morning; but, my Lord, I can prove what I ſay to you. <hi>My Lords,</hi> that 20. of <hi>September</hi> in the morning, I was in my bed, and there comes a Servant of mine that hath ſerved twelve or fourteen years, and he comes in to me, and ſays, Yonder is <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> very deſirous to go to this Race; it ſeems he ſays he went along with me to this Race.</p>

                  <p>'Tis the point, for he ſaid juſt now, he went with me, as I apprehended him. But I tell your Lordships, my Servant came and told me, <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> deſires that you will ask my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> leave that he may go before to the Race, my Lord is angry with him already for his medling in Races, and he dare not ask himſelf. My Lords, I was a little concerned in the Race, for I had betted ſome money, and I thought with my ſelf, should I ask my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> leave for him to go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Lord will not deny me, but perhaps will take it ill to be asked; ſo I was not over willing to do it. But I bid my Servant call him in, and when he came, I asked him ſome foolish Queſtions about the Race, as who he thought would win, and the like; but I told him I would get leave of my Lord for him. My Lords, I did go to my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> and told him, My Lord I am ſending my Servant before to the place of the Race, but I am afraid he does not well know the way, shall <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> go along with him? My Lord gave him leave to go; but, my Lords, I dreſſed me, and did not ſpeak one tittle more to this <hi>Dugdale,</hi> but he went away before, and I was hardly or but juſt dreſt when he was gone.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, about eight or nine of the clock in the morning, I came to go to my Lords Chamber, and <hi>I</hi> came through my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Hall, and coming through, I met Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> coming to me, and ſaid, he had one favour to deſire of me. He ſaid, he would fain go to the Race, but, ſaid he, I do not know how to go, for my Lord is very angry with me, and if I should ask him, he would be worſe, for he is diſpleaſed that I have medled ſo far in theſe matters already: Therefore I deſire ſome means may be uſed that I may go, and I deſire that you would ſpeak to my Lord, to get leave for me to go; for Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> is there, and hath a great deal of money in his hands, and divers people will give mony to bett; and ſo it will be a great loſs and prejudice to me not to go. So I did promiſe him, my Lords, and went into my Lords Chamber, and told him; and when I had ſpoke to my Lord, my Lord bid him come in, and when he came in, my Lord asked him ſeveral Queſtions about the Race; my Lord asked him what hopes he had, for he ſaid, a great deal of money was laid by ſeveral people; he replyed, he could win, but he wanted money to bett; ſays my Lord, I will bett Twenty pound for <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> ſake though I were ſure to loſe. And then after ſome diſcourſe to that purpoſe, my Lord told him, he would ſpeak to his Lord. After my Lord was dreſt, he went out of his Chamber, and went to my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> to ask him leave for <hi>Dugdale;</hi> and my Lord bid me make my ſelf ready to go to the Race. About nine or ten of the clock I was ready to go, and coming down the back ſtairs, my Lord met me; go, ſays he, to <hi>Etching</hi>-Hill, and ſee what Bets there are, and take <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> with you to shew you the way, for I have asked his Lord leave for him to go. So <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> went along with me to the Stable, and took out his Horſe; mine was not ready, but I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him in half a mile, and it was eleven of the clock ere we were at <hi>Ridgley.</hi> I asked ſome queſtions about one Mr. <hi>Gerard;</hi> and I think about Twelve of the Clock we were at the Race, and I ſtaid till One with him, and Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> who was a party concerned in the Race, and there were ſeveral Betts laid; I was watchfnl when my Lord should come, leſt he should want me: So I left them, and went to the Room where my Lord was to dine; and when I went to my Lord I left him betting. About 2 of the Clock the Lords and Gentlemen all went to Dinner (that were there) and when we had half dined,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105168:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
betwixt two and three, <hi>Dugdale</hi> came in, and we ask'd him how the wagers went? he ſaid he would bet Gold to Silver if he had it, but he had betted away all his Money. I know not how much. So there was a Gentleman that was Servant to my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> one <hi>George Hobſon</hi> by name, he lent him two Guineys and odd Money, and I lent him ſome forty or fifty Shillings out of my own Pocket, which I told him I would not lend unleſs he would give it me at the Hill again, before the Race began, becauſe I was fearful my Lord should go to <hi>Stafford</hi> again, from my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s that night. About 4 or 5 a Clock I went up to the Race, and demanded my Money, and he paid it me before the Race begun, and after the Race was done <hi>I</hi> loſt him. My Lord went home, and <hi>I</hi> waited on him. This was about 5 or 6, and about the mid-way towards my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe he went into the Coach, and I got on Horſeback, and we got home about 6 or 7 of the Clock as I ſuppoſe. But at night after Supper I enquired for <hi>Dugdale,</hi> how he took his looſings, and how he did after it? They told me he was gone to Bed, ſo <hi>I</hi> ſaw him no more that night. The next morning my Lord bid me come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, for he would go to <hi>Stafford</hi> that morning, where we dined, at Mr. <hi>Abden</hi>'s, and from thence took our way to go to my Lords own Houſe.</p>

I was going, ſaid I, I am going to my Lord, from <hi>Dugdale,</hi> to deſire him to own him as his Servant, ſaid he, I have been with my Lord juſt now, and he ſaid, he will not own him as his Servant; it was his own act and deed. So Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> and I came back to him, and told him. So he ſat down in the Chair, and then roſe up again, and ſwore, He would be revenged of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> if ever it lay in his power.</p>

This was three or four days before he begun to peach. He bid me come ſuch a day, and he would pay me part of the money; and when I came thither, he told me, it was reported, That he should be a Peacher; and that there was a ſpeech, how that he should have two hundred pounds for informing, that there were Fourteen Prieſts in the Country; but he takes a Glaſs of Drink, and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> ſays he, by God, I wish this may be my Damnation and my Poiſon, if I know of any Plot, or any Prieſts.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I have very little to ſay concerning <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> as to any thing of the Plot, but in reference to what he should relate concerning Mr. <hi>Sambidge</hi> and me in the Narrative which he depoſed upon the Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman:</hi> He ſaid then he did receive a Letter concerning the death of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundbury Godfrey,</hi> which was dated the 12. of <hi>October,</hi> as I remember; and that he did communicate the Letter to Mr. <hi>Sambidge</hi> and me immediately the next <hi>Tueſday:</hi> Whereas I will aſſure you, my Lords, I never heard neither by Letter nor word of mouth from him nor any other, till it was publickly known.</p>

                  <p>He takes notice that <hi>Dugdale</hi> at the Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> did depoſe touching a Letter dated the 12. of <hi>October,</hi> which should come down to <hi>Tixal,</hi> intimating the death of Sir <hi>Edmnndbury Godfrey,</hi> and that he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that with the Parſon of <hi>Tixal</hi> and another; which Parſon comes now to ſay, He did communicate no ſuch a matter to him.</p>

                  <p>I was not preſent at the Tryal; but if the Narrative of the Tryal be truth, he did ſay ſo.</p>

                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>

                  <p>Yes, my Lords, he knows very well I did; he did requeſt me to go to him. My Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> I was loth to go to, becauſe I had no familiarity with him, nor Intereſt in him; but he did requeſt and urge me ſo much, that I did go by much motives and perſuaſions from him, and I did ſpeak to my Lord; ſo I told him the Meſſage I had was from Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who would requeſt of my Lord that he would own him for his Servant; for if he did not, he knew not what to do with himſelf: but if he did, he might be free from the Gaol and from the Oaths, and eſcape the Troubles that were upon him. So my Lord replyed to me, 'Tis his own act and deed, and I have nothing to do with him, and let the Juſtices do what they will with him; which were Sir <hi>Walter Bagott</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kinnerſley.</hi>

                  <p>My Lords, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was taken at an unſeaſonable time of night and brought to me the next morning by the Watch, as the other Witneſſes have told your Lordships, and I took him away to <hi>Stafford,</hi> where there were ſeveral other Juſtices of the Peace; there we offered him the Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, which he took. After the taking of theſe Oaths, we told him, that he was a likely man to know ſomething of the Plot, and it was a very proper time for him to diſcover it to us that were Juſtices: he at that time did deny the knowledge of it, that is all <hi>I</hi> can ſay.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Kinnerſley.</speaker>

                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords</hi> I came to <hi>Stafford</hi> the latter end of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> I am not certain which, but I think it was this time two years. The Deputy-Lieutenants met about the Militia of the County. They told me that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was in Town, and was under an Arreſt: the occaſion of his coming to Town, was his refuſal of the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he had ſince taken. I propoſed to them the ſending for him, for I thought this was a fit opportunity to get ſomething of him about the Plot. They ſeemed to approve of what I ſaid; but withal, I told them it was not good to ſend for him till the Evening late, that the people of the Town might not take notice of his coming. At night we did ſend for him, and the Gentlemen deſired that I would examine him at the end of the Table: ſo I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him up, and told him, I was ſorry he was fallen into that misfortune to be Arreſted, and that Mr. Mayor had not dealt well with him or us to take that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him: that now he had taken the Oaths, I looked upon him as one of us, and would do him any kindneſs I could. He ſaid, truly for his part, he was born a Proteſtant, and of Proteſtant Parents; and it was his misfortune to fall into the Houſes of Papiſts, but he never liked their Religion. I then told him, Sir you may do your ſelf a kindneſs, ſerve God and oblige your King and Country: I
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105168:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
am very confident you know of this horrid Plot; pray do not ſtifle your Conſcience with any Oath of Secrecy, but let it come out. Many I told him, ſtrained their Conſciences to ſerve their Intereſts, but you may clear your Conſcience, and at the ſame time promote your true Intereſt. He replyed, as he hoped to be ſaved he knew nothing of it. And this is as much as I know of the matter.</p>

I told him I was not well, I was poorer than I uſed to be. He told me again, I should not want any money that he had; and if I would pleaſe to be ruled by him, and do what he would have me, he would furnish me with money. And he took his Handkerchief out of his pocket, and bid me, if I wanted, take money there. I took none, but told him, <hi>I</hi> would not meddle nor make with any thing that night. Then he told me he could furnish me with money, and put me in a way to get money, if <hi>I</hi> would come in as an Evidence againſt my Lord <hi>Stafford.</hi>

                  <p>My Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are a great many other Witneſſes which I could call; but it is to no purpoſe, and ſo I shall call no more as to <hi>Dugdale.</hi> I conceive upon the whole matter, his Reputation and Credit are gone, for he is forſworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Juſtices of Peace, in that he ſaid there was no Plot, and wished he might be damned if he knew of any Plot. I conceive 'tis alſo proved, that upon the Twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> when, he ſays, I did communicate with him about the Kings Death, he was only then with me upon his own deſire, and my ſervants were by; there was nothing diſcourſed of, but about the Foot-Race. And likewiſe as to what he ſwore in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that I was at ſuch a meeting at <hi>Tixal,</hi> he is forſworn, for I was not there; and ſo I hope that Witneſs is laid aſide, no Creature will give any Credit to him, neither your Lordships, nor the Houſe of Commons.</p>

                  <p>He did ſo in the Council, and he is clearly Perjured in that, and ſo not to be believed. And I ſay beſides, after that Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> had conſulted with himſelf and poſſibly with ſome others what his Narrative should be, and what he should accuſe Perſons of, and did only accuſe me of ſeeing ſome Letters ſigned <hi>Stafford,</hi> and now he comes to give Evidence he knows more, of my having a Commiſſion: After this rate, it may be he may know a great deal more to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when he hath invented it: And 'tis a great ſign he did not know of any more, if he did know of that; for I never had any Correſpondence with the Jeſuits, nor any buſineſs tranſacted with them theſe twenty four or twenty five years. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at <hi>Ghent</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuits were deſired to do a little thing for me, and they refuſed it me: it was to ſend over a man that was to be a Witneſs in a Suit I had beyond Sea. And I never writ one Letter to a Jeſuit ſince, nor he to me that I know of, nor never had to do with them that I know of: I never heard of <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks</hi> Name nor <hi>Harcourts</hi> till I heard of the Plot, nor of <hi>Johnſon</hi> nor <hi>Thompſon</hi> Jeſuits: and if any can prove it, I will acknowledge my ſelf guilty of all that is ſaid againſt me. And for that Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> at firſt ſaid, He only ſaw Letters of mine, and after comes and accuſes me of a Commiſſion, I appeal to your Lordships if there can be any truth or belief in him. I cannot ſay more than what <hi>I</hi> have ſaid already, and <hi>I</hi> do challenge Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> at the day of Judgment to ſay, if ever he ſaw me in his life till I was committed, or if <hi>I</hi> did ever go by any Name, but that of <hi>Stafford, I</hi> will be content to dye immediately.

                                          <head>The Information of <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> Gent. late ſervant to the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> of <hi>Tixal,</hi> concerning the Plot againſt our Soveraign Lord the King, as followeth.</head>
                                          <p n="1">1. THis Informant ſaith, that preſently after one <hi>Howard</hi> Almoner to the Queen went beyond the Seas, he was told by <hi>George Hobſon</hi> (Servant to the ſaid Lord <hi>Aſton)</hi> that there was a Deſign then intended for the Reformation of the Government to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion.</p>
                                          <p n="2">2. He informeth that in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> 1678. he met in <hi>Tixal,</hi> nigh the Lord's Gates, the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> who ſaid to this Informant it was ſaid
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105168:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they were troubled for that they could no ſay their Prayers but in a hid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ſuddenly there would be a Reformation to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and if there was but a good Succeſs they should enjoy their Religion. And upon the 20<hi>th.</hi> day of <hi>September</hi> laſt, the ſaid Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> told this Informant that there was a Deſign in hand, and if this Informant would undertake the Deſign, he should have a good Reward, and make himſelf famous.</p>
                                          <p n="3">3. Upon the aforeſaid day immediately after, this Informant went into the Chamber of Mr. <hi>Francis Urie alias Evers</hi> (a Jeſuit) in <hi>Tixal-Hall,</hi> and asked him what the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> meant by thoſe words, and after he had made him to ſwear ſecreſie upon his knees, he told him he might be a perſon imployed in the work, and have a good Reward that would make him famous: and then he told him he muſt be inſtrumental with others in taking away the Kings life; and that it should be done by shooting or otherwiſe. And that this Informant need not to fear, for the Pope had excommunicated the King, and that all that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by him were Hereticks, and they might kill them and be cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd for Saints in ſo doing.</p>
                                          <p n="4">4. The Informant ſaith, that the ſaid <hi>Evers</hi> and <hi>Hobſon</hi> both ſaid, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was as well to kill the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> as the King.</p>
                                          <p n="5">5. That <hi>George North</hi> (Nephew to <hi>Pickering,</hi> and Servant to the Lord <hi>Aſton)</hi> lately told this Informant that they had taken his Uncle (meaning <hi>Pickering)</hi> and put him into <hi>Newgate,</hi> and thought the King deſerved ſuch an execrable death as was intended him, becauſe of his Whoring and Debauchery.</p>
                                          <p n="6">6. That Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Bennyfield</hi> had a packet of Letters delivered to him from the Poſt-houſe, which he feared the Lord Treaſurer had notice of, and therefore he delivered them to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Duke delivered them to the King, and that the King gave them to the Treaſurer, after he had read them, but that the King did not believe them, and therefore it was happy, or elſe the Plot had been diſcovered.</p>
                                          <p n="7">7. That he had received many Packets of Letters for <hi>Evers,</hi> ſome of which this Informant broke up, and found them to be, and tend to the Eſtablishing of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, &amp;c.</p>
                                          <p n="8">8. That he had received ſeveral Sums of mony himſelf, and knew of divers others that were imployed to put forth mony, which was and is for the Jeſuits uſe.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I find by this here, that preſently after one <hi>Howard</hi> Almoner to the Queen went over, <hi>George Hobſon</hi> Servant to my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> told <hi>Dugdale</hi> there was a Deſign to Reform the Government, &amp;c.

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I do not ſay I knew <hi>George Hobſon</hi> before he came to be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> which was in the year (78.) but that this was only a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to me, that the Plot had been ſo long carrying on.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>He ſays upon his Oath preſently after the Almoner went over, he told him ſo. Now the Almoner went over; years before that, when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation came out to Banish the Queens Servants for being Papiſts.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>I heard it there, I never knew <hi>George Hobſon</hi> before he came to be Servant to my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> but I did not tell it as a Diſcourſe at that time, or that it was more than what I had from him, that there was ſuch a Deſign ſo long before.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>He ſays preſently after the Almoner went over, in his Oath, which was I think in the year (72.) or (73.) or rather in the year (75.) about the end of the year (74.) as I remember, and he ſays preſently, three years after; is that preſently? E'n now the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and how long that was we can't tell, and now three years is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, you muſt obſerve that <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſays, that he did hear it from <hi>Hobſon</hi> after he came to my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Service.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>But he ſays preſently after the Almoner went over, and 'tis impoſſible, for he did not ſay it till three years after, and ſo there is no truth in him.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Dugdale.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, it was that <hi>Hobſon</hi> told me that preſently after the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner <hi>Howard</hi> went over, there was ſuch a Deſign carrying on.</p>

                  <p>You diſtinguish not, and therefore don't comprehend. 'Tis one thing if <hi>Dugdale</hi> had ſaid, that preſently after there was ſuch a Deſign, <hi>Hobſon</hi> told him ſo.</p>

                  <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>But it is not that preſently after he heard the Diſcourſe, but <hi>George Hobſon</hi> told him, that preſently after the Almoner went over, there was ſuch a Deſign.</p>

               <p>Then the Information was read again.</p>

                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you know when <hi>Howard</hi> the Almoner went over?</p>

And I ſaid, it was ſad we could not ſay our Prayers, but in private. Truely my Lords, I cannot ſay, I did not ſay this to him; but if I did ſay it, I do not remember it, or that ever I thought ſo much; for I was ſo much of a contrary Opinion, that I thought thoſe of that Religion ſaid their Prayers too openly, and have chid them for it. And why should I ſpeak it to him whom I did not know what Religion or what Profeſſion he might be of? And preſently after I ſpoke of theſe things, he ſays, he went to know what the Deſign was, and then Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> told him of the Plot, and yet yeſterday he ſaid he knew it ſixteen years ago. How can all this be true? And beſides, it ſeems I could have no great power with him to perſuade him, for it ſeems he miſtruſted my ability to pay, and he had reaſon, for I should hardly have parted with 500<hi>l.</hi> in the Condition I was then in to any one, but I have no more to ſay to him now. There is a third Witneſs, one <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervill,</hi> I deſire to ask him a Queſtion.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I have the Affidavit, if you pleaſe I shall give you an account what I did upon it, and Sir <hi>Thomas Stringer</hi> another Juſtice of Peace. My Lords, after that Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> had given his Evidence to the Houſe of Commons <hi>Vivavoce,</hi> he tendred to them this Information that I have in my hand, The Houſe of Commons after it had been read thought it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to have it ſworn to before two Juſtices of Peace. Whereupon Sir <hi>Thomas Stringer</hi> and my ſelf withdrew into the Speakers Chamber, Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> came to us, we read over the Information to him again, and after we had read it over it was ſigned and he ſwore it. In this Information when we then took it he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red there, that he came to my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> in the year 1673, and came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> 1676. After we had ſworn him, we carried this Information into the Houſe again. The next morning, my Lords, he came to me, (I being one of the Juſtices that had ſworn him) and told me that ſearching among his Papers the laſt night for a Letter, which he had ſaid he had received from my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> ſent to <hi>Diep,</hi> though he could not find the Letter he looked for, yet he found that the preciſe time that he went to live with my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> was 1672, and the preciſe time of his coming into <hi>England</hi> was 1675. And he deſired me to acquaint the Houſe of Commons with it, that this Circumſtance of time might be altered. Whereupon my Lords, I did acquaint the Houſe of Commons with it, how he was miſtaken in that point of a Circumſtance of time, and that he came of his own accord and deſired me to move the Houſe in it; I moved the Houſe, and they did direct we should withdraw again, and take his Information again, and that he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105168:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should amend it, he amended it, and made the (73) (72) and the (76) (75) and then afterwards we ſwore him to it again <hi>de novo,</hi> and this is the matter of Fact con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Affidavit.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, he came to me, for I did not know any thing of it that he was miſtaken, but he came to me the next morning aſſoon as ever I came to the Houſe, before indeed I entred into the Houſe and told me of the miſtake and told me the reaſons how he came to recollect himſelf, and find out the miſtake.</p>

                           <p>WHo ſaith, That being a younger Brother about the Year <hi>1672,</hi> he became Gentleman Uſher to the Lady <hi>Mary Molineaux,</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> and by that means lived in the Houſe of the ſaid Earl about three Years, and by ſerving and aſſiſting at Maſs there, grew intimate with <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Morgan,</hi> Confeſſor to the ſaid Earl and his Family, who was a Jeſuit, and Rector over all the Jeſuits in <hi>North-Wales, Shropshire,</hi> and <hi>Staffordshire:</hi> And he, during the three years time, often heard the ſaid <hi>Morgan</hi> tell the ſaid Earl and his Lady, that the Kingdom was in a high Fever, and that nothing but Blood-letting could reſtore it to Health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> would flouriſh.

And he heard the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> tell the ſaid <hi>Morgan,</hi> and others publickly and privately, That when Religion ſhould be reſtored in <hi>England,</hi> which ſhe doubted not but would be in a very ſhort time, ſhe would perſuade her Husband to give <hi>300 l. per annum,</hi> for a Foundation to maintain a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery; and this Informant was perſuaded by the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> to become a Fryar, the ſaid Lady en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And Father <hi>Cudworth,</hi> who was than Guardian of the Fryars at <hi>Doway,</hi> ſome days before his eſcape thence, told this Informant, That if he should not perſevere with them, he should loſe his life and friends. And further added, That this King should not laſt long, and that his Succeſſor should be wholly for their purpoſe. And Father <hi>Croſs,</hi> Provincial of the Fryars, told this Informant, That had he been at <hi>Doway</hi> when this Informant made his eſcape thence, he should never have come to <hi>England:</hi> And this Informant finding himſelf friendleſs, and in danger in <hi>England,</hi> went to <hi>Paris,</hi> where one of his Brothers is a Benedictine Monk, who perſuaded this Informant to return for <hi>England;</hi> and in order thereunto,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:105168:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
about the latter end of <hi>November 1675.</hi> he was introduced into the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> that he might go for <hi>England</hi> with his Lordship, and three weeks he attended his Lordship, and had great acceſs and freedom with his Lordship, who gave him great aſſurances of his Favour and Intereſt to reſtore him to his Relations eſteem again. And ſaid, That he had a piece of ſervice to propoſe to this Informant, that would not only retrieve his Reputation with his own Relations, but alſo oblige both them and their Party to make him happy as long he lived. And this informant being deſirous to embrace ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py an Opportunity, was very inquiſitive after the means, but the ſaid Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> being ſomewhat difficult to repoſe ſo great a Truſt as he was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to him, exacted all the Obligations and Promiſes of ſecreſie, which this Informant gave his Lordship in the moſt ſolemn manner he could invent: Then his Lordship laboured to make this Informant ſenſible of all the advantages that would accrue to this Informant, and the <hi>Catholick Cauſe,</hi> and then told this Informant in direct terms, that he might make himſelf and the Nation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, by taking away the Life of the King of <hi>England,</hi> who was a Heretick, and conſequently a Rebel againſt God Almighty. Of which this Informant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Lordship to give him time to conſider, and told his Lordship that he would give him his Anſwer at <hi>Diep,</hi> where his Lordship intended to ship for <hi>England,</hi> and to take this Informant with him; but this Informant going before to <hi>Diep,</hi> the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> went with Count <hi>Gramont</hi> by <hi>Calice,</hi> and ſent this Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant orders to go for <hi>England,</hi> and to attend his Lordship at <hi>London,</hi> but this Informant did not attend his Lordship at <hi>London,</hi> but went into the <hi>French</hi> ſervice, and ſo avoided the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s further importunities in that Affair. And this Informant further ſaith, That one <hi>Remige</hi> a <hi>French</hi> woman, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Papiſt, who married this Informants Brother, lived with the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> all the time this Informant reſided there, and ſome years ſince, and was the great Confident of the ſaid Lady; and the ſaid <hi>Remige</hi> was for the moſt part taken with her Ladyship into <hi>Morgan</hi>'s Chamber when the Conſults were held there, where he hath often ſeen Father <hi>Gavan,</hi> Father <hi>Towers,</hi> Father <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans,</hi> Father <hi>Sylliard, Roberts, White, Owens, Barry,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> and other Prieſts and Jeſuits, meet and ſhut themſelves up in the ſaid <hi>Morgan</hi>'s Chamber, ſometimes for an Hour, ſometimes for two Hours, more or leſs; and at the breaking up of the ſaid Conſults, have broke out into an extaſie of joy, ſaying, They hoped ere long the <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> would be eſtablished in <hi>England,</hi> and that they did not doubt to bring about their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign notwithſtanding they had met with one great Diſappointment, which was the Peace ſtruck up with <hi>Holland;</hi> ſaying, that if the Army at <hi>Blackheath</hi> had been ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> King, when he was with his Army near <hi>Amſterdam, Holland</hi> had certainly been conquered, and then the <hi>French</hi> King would have been able to aſſiſt us with an Army to eſtablish Religion

in <hi>England.</hi> Which expreſſions, with many others, importing their confidence to ſet up the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> they frequently communicated to this Informant. And the ſaid <hi>Morgan</hi> went ſeveral times into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and ſeveral other parts of <hi>England,</hi> as this Informant hath juſt cauſe to believe, to give and take meaſures for carrying on the Deſign, and the ſaid <hi>Remige</hi> and her Husband having firſt clandeſtinely ſold their Eſtate, and fled into <hi>France</hi> about <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June</hi> laſt, for fear of diſcovery. This Informant by many Circumſtances, being aſſured that the ſaid Mrs. <hi>Remige</hi> was privy to all or moſt of the Tranſactions of the Plot. And he ſaith, that about <hi>May</hi> laſt was two Years, he was preſent at Maſs with the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> in <hi>Vereſtreet,</hi> when the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> did ſay Maſs in his Prieſtly Habit, after the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Lordships, he ſays he was threatned that he should have his Brother diſinherit him, and which afterwards was compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Now I shall shew that this is impoſſible, for he had no Inheritance to loſe, nor was to have none; for his Brother, who is elder than he, this man
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105168:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being by a ſecond Venter, hath Children, as I shall make appear by another of his Brothers, who is here. And this not being ſettled upon him who was by the ſecond Venter, could not come to him, but for want of Iſſue of that Brother, muſt go to the Uncle. So he ſwears he was diſinherited of an Eſtate when he was to have no Eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor could have. Call Mr. <hi>John Turbervill</hi>

                  <p>My Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> your Lordships Defence took up yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; All the day was employed in hearing your Lordships Witneſſes to impeach the Credit of the Teſtimony that hath been given againſt you. Your Lordship hath excepted againſt <hi>Dugdale,</hi> becauſe you were not at <hi>Tixall,</hi> as he ſays you were; neither the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> nor the beginning of <hi>September</hi> till the Twelfth; and when you were there, you never ſent for him to your Chamber, but your Man upon his own deſire brought him, and when he came there, the buſineſs was to deſire you to get leave that he might go to the Race; and there was no opportunity of private Diſcourſe, becauſe your Men were in the Room all the while; That <hi>Dugdale</hi> hath often ſaid he knew nothing of the Plot; that he ſwore falſly when he ſaid he told of the Letter about the death of Sir
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105168:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Edmunbury Godfrey</hi> before it was known he was killed; and when he ſaid, that <hi>Hobſon</hi> told him preſently after the Almoner went over, which was three years before <hi>Hobſon</hi> came to my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Service. Your Lordship hath likewiſe objected, that he hath corrupted perſons to ſwear falſly againſt you, and others, as <hi>Robinſon</hi> the Upholſterer, againſt your Lordship, <hi>Morrall</hi> the Barber againſt Sir <hi>James Symons,</hi> and <hi>Holt</hi> the Blackſmith to ſwear that one <hi>Moor</hi> carried away <hi>Evers.</hi> Your Lordship hath endeavoured to diſcredit <hi>Oats,</hi> by his ſaying he knew nothing of any other perſons that were concerned in the Plot, and after accuſing the Queen: Your Lordship hath Impeached the Credit of <hi>Turbervill,</hi> by proving, that you came home by <hi>Diep,</hi> and not by <hi>Calice,</hi> as he ſays you did; That you had never the Gout while you were in <hi>France,</hi> nor, as your Page ſays, for theſe ſeven years; That my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> was not at my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s in the year 73. and there you left off.

                  <speaker>Porter.</speaker>
                  <p>He came there, and asked me how my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> did, and ſaid he was extremely troubled that he was in that Affliction, for he did verily believe, that neither he, nor the reſt of the Lords were in the Plot, and the Witneſſes that ſwore againſt him, he believed were perjured, and could not believe any thing of it.</p>

                  <speaker>Porter.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, my Lords, I told him if there were ſuch a thing as a Plot, he having been beyond Sea, muſt certainly know of it; he told me, as he hoped for Salvation, he knew nothing of it, neither directly nor indirectly, againſt the Kings Sacred Perſon, nor the Subverſion of the Government. And he further ſaid; Although I am a little low at preſent, and my Friends will not look upon me, yet I hope God Almighty will never leave me ſo much, as to let me ſwear againſt innocent Perſons, and forſwear and damn my ſelf.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March</hi> laſt, I was walking in <hi>Grays-Inn-Walks</hi> with Mr. <hi>Turbervill,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> and he dined with me a day or two after, and there Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> and I were talking of the Diſtractions of the Times, how Trade was ruined, how the whole Kingdom was out of order, and he was a little touched at ſome things, and cryed out, <hi>Go! Dam me, now, there is no Trade good but that of a Diſcoverer, but the Devil take the Duke of</hi> York, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, <hi>Plot and all, for I know nothing of it.</hi>

                     <hi>L.</hi> H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>That is odd, that he should ſay it was a good Trade to be a Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, and at the ſame time ſay, he knew nothing of the Plot.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Yalden.</speaker>
                  <p>This I underſtood to be his meaning; he curſed himſelf and them, becauſe he knew nothing of the Plot to diſcover, for he would have got money by it (as I underſtood) as well as others.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I did not make this Complaint, nor did I deſire it should be made; but ſpeaking this in the Room, ſome body carried it to my Lord.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Turbervill.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, now he hath done, let me ſpeak, I pray; Mr. <hi>Yalden</hi> did ſay in the hearing of Captain <hi>Scudamore,</hi> who is here, he had got a great many Clients here, but you, ſays he, have got nothing but a pack of Rogues.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Yalden.</speaker>
                  <p>That is a miſtake.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>This is fine work. But, Gentlemen, will you call Captain <hi>Scudamore</hi> now, or will you ſtay till afterwards?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Fr. Winn.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> deſires it may be now, and we do alſo deſire it upon this occaſion, Captain <hi>Scudamore</hi> is a man of Quality, and will
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105168:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give you a true account. We did not think to have interpoſed in my Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s Evidence, but he having impeached our Witneſſes of a Miſdemeanor, we conceive it fitteſt to clear it at this time.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>My Lord <hi>Steward,</hi> I humbly conceive, That it was reſolved in the Lords Houſe, the day before yeſterday, that no Book should be ſent for out of the Court, and it was done upon the Judgment of all the Judges of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>My Lords, I would only acquaint your Lordships, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Book, that my Lord does make mention of, was in the hands of our Clerk, we did not know of it when it was firſt diſcourſed of; but now underſtanding that here it is, we deſire it may be delivered in to any body that hath occaſion for it.</p>

                  <p>My Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> In this Council-Book, as far as we can inform our ſelves by the Table of it, there is nothing at all of it; it muſt be the Council-Book in <hi>September.</hi>

                  <p>Why did not your Lordship ſend all this while to the Council Table for any thing that was material, but give the Court the trouble to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted upon your Inquiries?</p>

                  <p>My Lords, you may do what you pleaſe, I did not know any ſuch thing would have needed to be urged. I have proof enough without the book; The uſe I should have made of it, is this, I do appeal to ſome of your Lordships (you that were of the Council) I do appeal to which of you that were by, whether Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> did not ſay at the Council Table, he had been at <hi>Madrid,</hi> he went from <hi>Vallidolid</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and there did preach ſomething at the Jeſuits Colledge at <hi>Madrid,</hi> (what it was I cannot tell) when <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was by.</p>

                  <p>If any of my Lords of the Council do remember it they may Teſtifie.</p>

                  <speaker>
                     <hi>L.</hi> Privy Seal.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I shall tell your Lordships as much as I remember of it: Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> was examined about his Journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> and (amongſt the reſt) ſome Queſtion hapned to be asked, whether he had ſeen <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> he ſaid he had ſeen one that was called ſo, that he knew him not, but he was pointed to one that they ſaid was <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> that I heard.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I thank you.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>You hear what is ſaid, Dr. <hi>Oats.</hi>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oats.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, ſuppoſe I did ſay ſo, I think there is no crime in it.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>'Tis not objected againſt you as a Crime, but as a miſtake in your Oath, there was no ſuch man there.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I would not be miſunderſtood in the Evidence I give; I did not ſay that <hi>Oats</hi> ſaid he knew him, but that he knew him not, and only was told ſuch a man was he.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oats.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>It was made apparent, that I did not know him, becauſe I miſtook his Perſon.</p>

                  <p>I do ſtand upon it, That upon his Oath, (and <hi>I</hi> have reaſon to believe he did ſo, becauſe <hi>I</hi> am ſo informed) he ſaid it was <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>

                  <p>I shall now put your Lordships in mind that he ſwore, but my Memory is bad, and my Eyes much worſe, that he ſaw me receive a Commiſſion, and it ſeems he ſaw what it was too: Now it is ſtrange, that amongſt ſo many Commiſſions that were given, none should be extant; I deſire him to shew the Commiſſion he ſaw me receive.</p>

                  <p>I do not believe he can shew my Commiſſion; for I am ſure there was none; I deſire him to shew any one of my Letters he talks of. He ſays, he came over, feigning to be a Papiſt, when he was not, and that they shewed him preſently all my Letters, and now he is come to diſcover the Plot; I ask him, did he keep any one of my Letters?</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Into Dr. <hi>Perrot</hi>'s Lodging. Dr. <hi>Perrot</hi> had a Kinſman there that waited on him; and when my Lord came in, he was in haſte to ſpeak with Dr. <hi>Perrot,</hi> and he offered me half a Crown to fetch Dr. <hi>Perrot</hi> to him, and <hi>I</hi> made him this Reply, <hi>I</hi> was no Porter.</p>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105168:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Name till the Plot, then I will confeſs my ſelf guilty of all. Indeed, when firſt I heard of the Plot (they ſaid) there was one Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> diſcovered it, but I did not know any ſuch man.</p>

                  <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I shall give you Evidence that he was a poor Fellow, ſince he gives me occaſion to prove it, nay, that he was ſo poor, that he was brought down to accept of 6 <hi>d.</hi> I will prove it by the party that gave it, now he puts me upon it: But, my Lords, this Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> ſays he ſaw ſome of my Letters, I deſire to know what was in them; Did he take any Notes? What was in them?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>Did you when you had a ſight of theſe Letters at St. <hi>Omers,</hi> take any Notes out of them?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Oats</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>What Notes I did take, if I did take any, I have not now in being, but I do not remember that I did take any. Beſides, my Lords, we could keep no Papers by us, but what we communicated to our Superiours, and therefore it was ſtill their care to look after their Papers themſelves; and in that Circumſtance of time, if they had known I had taken Notes out of their Papers, it would have been prejudicial to me, and indangered my life.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. <hi>Stafford.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I infer this one thing further, upon what this Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> tells you, He did ſeemingly profeſs himſelf of the Catholick Religion, and I do ſtand upon it, that hereupon he is no competent Witneſs in that which he offers againſt me: For he being of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (for I think he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes himſelf ſo, and wears that Habit) I ſay, any man, let him be who he will in the world, Church of <hi>England</hi> man or other, that shall pretend himſelf to be a Papiſt, for what end ſoever it be that he ſo pretends, and diſſembles with God Almighty, which he muſt do to a great height, in receiving that Sacrament, which is by your Lordships and the Houſe of Commons declared to be groſs Idolatry, is not eaſily to be eſteemed a Witneſs. <hi>I</hi> appeal to your Lordships, to the Houſe of Commons, and every body, whether ſuch a Fellow, that will abhor his Religion, let him do it for any ends in the world, be a man to be credited; and eſpecially ingaging in ſuch a way, to ſuch an height, in that which his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells him is idolatrous, is not a perjured Fellow, and no compleat Witneſs? No Chriſtian, but a Devil, and a Witneſs for the Devil. And I appeal to the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105168:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole Chriſtian World, if a Proteſtant of the Church of <hi>England</hi> should come to be a Servant to a Catholick and pretend himſelf a Papiſt, and were not ſo, whether he were fit to be countenanced; as it did once happen to me at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> fore the King came in, one that was a Proteſtant came to be my Footman, and he profeſſed himſelf afterwards to be a Catholick; and when I found he was not ſo, I told him what a Villain he was, and he ought to be punished ſeverely. I deteſt ſuch diſſembling with God, and I think by the Laws of God and Man, and the Holy Scriptures, ſuch a perjured man is no Witneſs. I am ſorry I have troubled your Lordships ſo long. But now if you pleaſe to give me leave, my Lords, I will give you my Reaſons why I called him now: when <hi>I</hi> did remember how he had diſſembled with God Almighty, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>I</hi> did conſider with my ſelf, ſure this Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> muſt have been, ever ſince he hath returned, of a very ſevere, ſtrict and ſober life; for a man that hath ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled with God, ought to shew himſelf of an exemplary, peaceful, pious, civil life, to teſtifie the truth and reality of his Repentance. But laſt night when I came home, and was ſiting by the fire ſide extreamly weary, my Daughter here comes in, and asks me if I had heard what had paſſed between Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> and the Lieutenant; how he called the Lieutenant Raſcal and Goaler: ſure then, ſaid I, to my ſelf, this is not the quiet, civil, ſober man, that ſuch a one that hath lived as he hath done, ought to be. And this is the reaſon I ſpeak of it, that he should call him vile Names, Goaler and Raſcal; it did not become a man of his Coat to do it: whether it was ſo or no, I do not know, but Mr. Lieutenant, I ſuppoſe, will ſatisfie your Lordships.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Lieuten.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords <hi>I</hi> was deſiring Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> that he would keep the people down, becauſe there was a great croud; and ſeeing a great many people come in, he told me, they were Witneſſes that were to come in: ſaid <hi>I, I</hi> believe half of theſe are not Witneſſes; and the door opening ſo often, <hi>I</hi> could keep this place in no order; ſo <hi>I</hi> deſired they would ſtand away that were not Witneſſes: why, ſays he, you are but a Goaler; then <hi>I</hi> told him, if it were not for his Coat, and <hi>I</hi> were out of this place, <hi>I</hi> would break his head. Then he called me Raskal.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, <hi>I</hi> do ſay this to your Lordships, a man that hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled with God Almighty in ſo high a nature, as he ackowledges himſelf to have done, ought to be a man of a very ſevere life afterwards, and not ſo paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and cholerick, as it ſeems this fellow is.</p>

                  <p>For this man, truly, <hi>I</hi> shall ſay no more; <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> have ſaid enough to make him appear a perſon not fit to be believed. <hi>I</hi> would only ask <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> a Queſtion, if you pleaſe; 'tis but a little, <hi>I</hi> won't hold you long. <hi>I</hi> only ask, and if he deny it, <hi>I</hi>'le prove it, whether he was not a Priſoner at <hi>Stafford</hi> for Debt, when he made the firſt Affidavit?</p>

                  <speaker>L. Staff.</speaker>
                  <p>For a very great Debt, my Lords, ſome hundreds of pounds, and he was a fellow not worth a Groat: And, my Lords, Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> ſays <hi>I</hi> offered him half a Crown, and he refuſed it. <hi>I</hi> call <hi>Ellen Rigby</hi> to prove he was ſo poor he begg'd for ſix pence.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> will ſave my Lord the trouble of proving any ſuch thing. My Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> ſays <hi>I</hi> was a poor man, and had not ſix pence in my pocket; <hi>I</hi> can make it appear to the Houſe of Lords, that ſometime ſince <hi>I</hi> came in upon this Diſcovery, <hi>I</hi> have not had two pence in my pocket, and ſometimes <hi>I</hi> have not had ſix pence: but a mans Pȯverty is no objection againſt his Honeſty.</p>

                  <p>Where is <hi>Ellen Rigby</hi> to prove, whether she did not give him ſix pence? But then, my Lords, pray ask him whether he did not ſwear at a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tryal, he had ſpent ſix or ſeven hundred pounds more than he got?</p>

But, my Lords, <hi>I</hi> had a Friend of mine preſented me with 100 <hi>l. I</hi> name not his Name; but if that be queſtioned, he is a Peer of this Houſe, and will juſtifie it. <hi>I</hi> had 100 <hi>l.</hi> for my Narrative. <hi>I</hi> had 100 <hi>l.</hi> for taking ſome Jeſuits; which is 300 <hi>l. I</hi> had for ſome other Copies that <hi>I</hi> printed, a matter of 50 or 60 <hi>l.</hi> And now <hi>I</hi> can make it appear, that as to thoſe Sums which <hi>I</hi> received in groſs, <hi>I</hi> have ſpent them all, and more in this Service, for <hi>I</hi> have none of the money now by me.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I do not know for the preſent that I have any thing elſe to trouble your Lordships with. I remember theſe Gentlemen when I asked them if they had any more Evidence to give in, ſaid No, unleſs I should give them ſome occaſion; and now I deſire your Lordships, if they bring any new Evidence, that I may have time to anſwer it.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, before we go about to ſum up our Evidence we shall have occaſion to call ſome Witneſſes, and that will be to fortifie what our Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have ſaid, to diſcover what kind of Witneſſes have been made uſe of againſt them, and to falſifie what my Lords Witneſſes have ſaid in ſome particulars. Theſe will be the three Heads for which we deſire to call Witneſſes. And becauſe (my Lords) we will not trouble you with making one intire Narration of what they can ſay, or to what purpoſe we call them before they come, we deſire the favour that we may acquaint your Lordships with it, ſtill as we call them; for that we think will be the way more clearly to be underſtood. My Lords, we shall begin to make good by other Witneſſes, ſome things ſaid by Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> (for he was our firſt Witneſs, and therefore in order of time we will firſt begin with him.) My Lords, the Priſoner at the Bar was pleaſed to object—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I would not interrupt him; but I would ask whether there were more than two heads that he proceeds upon to fortifie their own Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and to falſifie mine.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> W. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I think we may comprehend all under thoſe two heads: But, my Lords, you obſerve, one great matter my Lord did inſiſt upon yeſterday, was this. That he, it is true, hath ſeen Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> at my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s (though by the way I muſt ſay this, my Lord at the firſt did not ſeem to know him.)—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>I did not know him in his Peraiwig.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Stew.</speaker>
                  <p>Do not interrupt them, my Lord, for they muſt have the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that you had, to go on without interruption.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>We muſt have the ſame freedom my Lord had. I will do his Lordship that right, he did afterwards recollect himſelf, and ſay, His Perriwig had made that alteration in him, that he did not know him. But my Lord was alſo pleaſed to ſay yeſterday, That though he did know him, yet he looked upon him as ſo mean and inconſiderable a fellow, that he did purpoſely avoid all diſcourſe with him; and that ſometimes when he was a dry at my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s he would not ſpeak to him to help him, nor to call one to help him to drink. My Lord, was pleaſed yeſterday alſo to deny that ever he had any Converſe with him but only that one time, when indeed Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did deſire to make uſe of my Lord, that by his interpoſition he might have leave to go to the Foot-Race. My Lords, your Lordships very well perceive we are now going about to prove a matter moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſing within my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Family; and what Witneſſes we shall have from thence, your Lordships may eaſily imagine will not be very favourable to us: and if
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105168:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we have not many to this point, your Lordships will take into conſideration, that thoſe who can give the fulleſt proof here, muſt be thoſe of the Family, and the Religion of the Family. But, my Lords, we will call one or two that I believe will give you ſatisfaction that my Lord the Priſoner was no ſuch ſtranger to Mr. <hi>Dugdale;</hi> that they have been ſeen together, and alone together; and that is the firſt thing we deſire to call Witneſſes to.

                  <p>My Lords, I shall tell you how this thing is. There was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that this <hi>Hawkins</hi> was a very good running Foot-boy; and this was ſpoken of at my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s at Dinner or Supper, I don't know which, nay ſeverall times about that time; it was when my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> was Treaſurer, and his Son my Lord <hi>Dunblain</hi> was much for Foot-matches, and I had a minde to have a Foot-boy to make a match with him; and I believe <hi>Dugdale</hi> at Dinner or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per did ſay that he was a good running Lad, and I might deſire to ſee him, and <hi>Dugdale</hi> did bring him to me I believe into my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Parlour; but there was at leaſt ſix or ſeven in the Room beſides.</p>

                  <speaker>L. <hi>Stafford.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>So he denied it then.</p>

                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> VV. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray, Sir, at that time did he ſay he knew any thing about my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> and why my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> did uſe him ill?</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> objected Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was too near the VVitneſs, and deſired he might go down; and it was ordered accordingly.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Fr. VVin.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, we would ask this man what does he know of <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>'s concealing himſelf after he had heard of the diſcourſe about the Plot.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Anſell.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I know not that, my Lords; he was fearful of coming in company: what his diſcourſe was, I do not know.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> VV. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, now if it pleaſe your Lordships, we will go to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother particular. Yor Lordships will pleaſe to remember, that yeſterday there were two Witneſſes called by my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> that is <hi>Sambidge</hi> and <hi>Philips; Sambidge</hi> was the old Gentleman that was deaf, and a little paſſionate too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was once ſummoned to <hi>Litchfield</hi> Court. Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> was the Miniſter of <hi>Tixal.</hi> And both theſe did teſtifie, That whereas Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> had ſworn at a former Tryal, that he did give notice before them of the death of Sir <hi>Edmunbury Godfrey</hi> upon Monday, which (as I take it) was the 14. of <hi>October,</hi> there was no ſuch notice given in their preſence. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did affirm, they were by, and that he gave notice before them &amp; others. This was made uſe of by my Lord to invalidate the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that he should go and affirm at a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tryal, that he did give notice of the death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two days after he was killed, before any one knew of it; and <hi>Dugdale</hi> muſt needs know it from the Jeſuits: and both of theſe Gentlemen being now in Court, do deny that they heard of it at that time. My Lords, we shall prove to you here, that he did give notice of it at that time, and that they were both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. For Mr. <hi>Sambidge,</hi> it is not ſo ſtrange he should not obſerve it, he was very deaf, and he could hardly hear yeſterday; and as he was deaf, ſo he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſionate. As for Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> I cannot ſay that as to him, but perhaps he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105168:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cannot at that diſtance of time remember; but we will prove by undeniable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that notice was given that Munday, and that theſe perſons were by when it was given.</p>

Your Lordships pleaſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> was killed the Twelfth of <hi>October;</hi> he was found the Thurſday following, which was, (as I take it) the 16. or 17. of <hi>October.</hi> We will prove now, that the noiſe and knowledge of the Murder was in the Countrey about <hi>Tixal,</hi> before he was found here near <hi>London.</hi> Now we only bring this as a Confirmation of this matter, that it was revealed at the Alehouſe, and ſo it went about the Countrey. And for this we call <hi>Edward Birch</hi> Eſquire, and <hi>John Turton</hi> Eſquire.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I did not hear any thing of the death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> till the Saturday-Poſt; but I preſume that which theſe Gentlemen call me for, is this: <hi>I</hi> did hear before Thurſday, <hi>I</hi> think Tueſday was the firſt day, that there was a Juſtice of Peace of <hi>Middleſex</hi> killed, and it was thought the Papiſts murdered him; and this on Tueſday and Wedneſday was all over the Countrey, that is, Tueſday after his death: for I'll tell your Lordships how I came to take notice of it; for hearing ſuch a report in the Countrey, <hi>I</hi> did not ſo much take notice of it, but being at the Kings Bench Bar, at the Tryal of <hi>Green, Berry</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> for the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> I found upon the Evidence that the Body was not found till the Thurſday after he was killed; that made me recollect my ſelf as to what <hi>I</hi> had heard in the Countrey: and as I ſtood at the Bar, <hi>I</hi> told ſeveral Gentlemen that I did perfectly remember, before Thurſday it was

I was at both of them; and one of the days, which I cannot be poſitive in, there was one Mr. <hi>Whitehall,</hi> a Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> called me from the company, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeak with me by my ſelf. Said he, Do you hear any news? No, ſaid I. Do you hear nothing, ſaid he, of a Juſtice of Peace that is murdered? (I then had not heard of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfreys</hi> being miſſing.) No, ſays he, don't you hear he is murdered? Do you know him? Yes, ſaid I, how do you hear it? ſays he, 'tis a report about us; but <hi>I</hi> did not then believe it; but the next Poſt-day, which was Munday, <hi>I</hi> did hear it; it was either Tueſday or Friday, one of thoſe days.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I do know him very well, though I have not ſeen him often: for indeed, my Lords, he behaved himſelf ſo the firſt time that I ſaw him, that I believe I shall never forget him. My Lords, I am better acquainted with his Character than his Perſon, though I know the man very well; and truly the firſt time that ever I was in his company, he gave me no incouragement ever to deſire it again; for if you pleaſe, I'le tell you how I came to know him. He told your Lordships that he came into <hi>Cheſhire</hi> at a Cocking; it was at that time that I ſaw him, for upon the Sunday after the Cocking, I was invited to a Neighbours, about two miles from home. We were ſet down to Dinner, and we had not ſat
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:105168:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
long; but this man comes into the Room where we were; there was an empty place at the lower end of the Table, and he ſits him down, and began a diſcourſe to ridicule the Lords day, in ſuch a manner as <hi>I</hi> never heard the like. And the reſt of his diſcourſe was full of a great deal of Contempt of God Almighty, and all that was ſacred. All his diſcourſe at Dinner was very prophane. It was not in mine own Houſe; and becauſe it was not taken notice of by the Maſter of the Houſe, and he coming under the protection of a young Gentleman, I did not what elſe I should, for I should have made him hold his tongue, or have uſed it to better purpoſe. The whole of his diſcourſe was ſo Atheiſtical and prophane, that <hi>I</hi> never heard the like in my life. When dinner was done, he uſed a great many intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to draw the Company into play, by asking what would they ſay if they should ſee ſuch and ſuch things to be done; and at length he pulls out a great many Dice out of his pocket, and behaves himſelf in that manner, as people do that would draw in others to play; and they that had better skill in it than I, ſaid that they were all falſe. When I ſaw this, I deſired him to leave our Room, or to forbear; for, ſaid I, if this be the entertaintment of the day, <hi>I</hi> muſt leave the Company: then they commanded him to deſiſt. This is all that <hi>I</hi> do know of my own knowledge. But <hi>I</hi> shall acquaint you what <hi>I</hi> believe, for <hi>I</hi> have heard it from very conſiderable perſons, whom <hi>I</hi> dare credit; for the man run much in my mind, becauſe <hi>I</hi> never ſaw ſo ill a man in my life. Coming home, <hi>I</hi> was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome of my Family: ſays <hi>I,</hi> Yonder <hi>I</hi> met with the ſtrangeſt fellow that <hi>I</hi> ever ſaw in my days, he is fitter to be hanged than any thing elſe. Oh, Sir, ſaid they, there is ſuch a fellow hath cheated I know not how many at the Town where the Cocking was. The next day, <hi>I</hi> think it was, or shortly after, <hi>I</hi> had occaſion to go to that Town; and many people came and complained to me of his Cheats, to a very great degree. They asked me what they should do: ſaid <hi>I,</hi> you have nothing to do, but indite him for a Cheat. Why, ſaid they, will you take no courſe with him? Said <hi>I,</hi> What courſe can <hi>I</hi> take? <hi>I</hi> am turned out of the Commiſſion of the Peace, elſe <hi>I</hi> know enough to bind him to the good behaviour. After this <hi>I</hi> had occaſion to go into <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and there <hi>I</hi> found he was better known than truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There were very loud Complains againſt him, and ſome would have given Twenty pound to meet with him. <hi>I</hi> heard afterwards, he went into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and he changed his Name where ever he went: but he ſoon diſcovered himſelf, and all thereabouts he goes for a notorious Cheat. This is all <hi>I</hi> can ſay of him.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, Be pleaſed to give me leave to ſay one word: <hi>I</hi> aſſure you, if <hi>I</hi> had thought this man had been ſuch a fellow as now he proves, <hi>I</hi> would not have brought him before you. <hi>I</hi> never knew what he was in my life, nor heard of his Name till Saturday laſt.</p>

                  <p>It may be ſo, my Lord. But your Lordship muſt take notice, that this is the man that gave the moſt important Evidence, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> should corrupt him to ſwear againſt you for money.</p>

                  <p>Give me leave to obſerve upon that, my Lords, That if <hi>Dugdale</hi> knew him to be a cheating fellow, he might think him the liker to take money to forfwear himſelf.</p>

But we deſire an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Peer of this Houſe may give ſome account of him, and that is, the Noble Lord the Earl of <hi>Maclesfeld;</hi> I think he may be known to your Lordships.</p>

                     <hi>E.</hi> of Maclesfeld.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I have nothing to ſay againſt this man but what he ſaid to me, and before a Juſtice of Peace too; for I did take this man when he had run away from my Lord <hi>Gerard.</hi> He had cheated many of his Servants; I catched him on the way running to play his tricks ſomewhere elſe, and I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted him; but though I was a Juſtice of Peace there, yet becauſe it was in a manner my own caſe, I would not commit him, till I had carried him before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtice of Peace. So the man comes up to me, ſays he, My Lord, have you a mind to have your Son-in-law bubbled? I have been only teaching him how to avoid being cheated: I acknowledge my ſelf to be a Cheat, and I would teach him to avoid them. I am going now into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> and that was all I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Lordship. I am a Rogue I confeſs it. And upon this a Juſtice of Peace comes in, and while they were examining of him, we bid ſome that were by to ſearch him, and they found in his pocket falſe Dice; and truly the Juſtice nor I did not know whether they were true or falſe. Says he, You don't know what to do with theſe, but I do. This is all I can ſay; but in all the three Counties of <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire, Cheſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> there are ſeveral men that I ſee here, that know his Life better than I do; for 'tis his common practice: and I believe, my Lords, the Judges muſt know him, for it was his common practice at all Aſſizes and great Meetings to play theſe pranks.</p>

                  <p>The firſt time I was employed was preſently after the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey;</hi> and it was by one Mr. <hi>Pleſſington,</hi> that was in cuſtody about that matter. And he ſent me on Sunday morning, to the Marqueſs of <hi>VVincheſters,</hi> to deſire him, to conſider what a charge he lay at. And my Lord did ſend him word, he could not expect to be diſcharged ſo ſoon. The Tueſday after he was diſcharged. And afterwards coming unto me, I told him, I was glad he had ſo good friends to get out ſo ſoon. He told me, were I in the ſame condition, I should have as good or better. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Pleſſington</hi> and I were as good friends as any about the Town. I was his Barber, and Barber to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and we were all great cronies. And <hi>Pleſſington</hi> told me, if I could find a way to take off his Evidence, or deſtroy him, I should have ſeven hundred pounds. I went to inquire out where I might have a ſecurity for the Money. And Mr. <hi>Reeves,</hi> an Apothecary in <hi>Chancery-lane,</hi> did profer me his Note, and ſo did Mr. <hi>Dewy</hi> the Scrivener. But I did not, nor had the Money. And ſeveral times, particularly at the Tryal of Mrs. <hi>Price,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tasborough,</hi> they would have had me ſworn quite blank, That he would have hired me to have ſworn againſt them. And afterwards they would have had me own I was forſworn, and they would get me a Pardon.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I have had Four pounds in hand, and that I had by reaſon poverty came upon me.

And there I received a Letter from my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Agent, That if I would call at <hi>Stafford</hi> and come up with my Lords Witneſſes they would bear my charges up to <hi>London.</hi> I have the Letter in my Pocket.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, We will go on now to another matter. My Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was pleaſed to object, That Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did talk much of Letters, and proceedings, but was able to shew none of them. My Lords, we will give an account how that comes about. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> as in part hath been proved already, was apprehenſive of being accuſed for the Plot; nay I think we shall prove, he was afraid he had been in the Proclamation againſt thoſe Traytors and Jeſuits that were fled; We shall prove, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to ſecure himſelf, and his then friends (for he was not then come over to make any diſcovery) did burn a great many Letters and Papers that did relate to thoſe proceedings, and did not leave any thing remaining, hoping thereby to prevent a diſcovery. We will call Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that were by when it was done, and I think that will be ſome anſwer to this objection. Call <hi>Elizabeth Eld,</hi> and <hi>Anne Eld.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot poſſibly ſay to the time, I burnt ſome Writings for him when he went away, he deſired me to burn them, he did not tell me what Writings they were. He ſaid, the times were troubleſome, and if he should be ſick upon the Road where he was going, he would not have all his Papers ſeen, but he deſired me to burn them. And I took and burnt them all but one Book; and my Siſter asked if that Book should be burnt, he ſaid, no, there was nothing of Treaſon in it; I asked him if there were any thing of Treaſon in the others, and he ſaid, Do you think there was?</p>

                  <p>Not to trouble you longer (my Lords) upon this, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships will be pleaſed to remember, yeſterday my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was pleaſed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by way of Evidence, as if Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a man of an ill Reputation in theſe particulars, That he had defrauded my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> that he was a mean man, run in arrear to my Lord; and that being in neceſſity, he became a fit inſtrument to give falſe Evidence. We shall shew, That Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a man of Eſtate; that both before, and ſince he came away from my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> he hath made it his buſineſs to deſire my Lord to come to Accompt; that he hath preſſed him, and that he does believe, and hath reaſon ſo to believe, that there is Money com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> to him, and that a conſiderable ſum. Now, my Lords, if we shall make it appear, that he hath made it his buſineſs to come to Accompt with my Lord, I hope it will not be ſuppoſed that he is afraid of it, or ſo needy, or ſo mean.

                  <p>In <hi>January</hi> laſt, I went along with Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> at his requeſt, to the <hi>Tower,</hi> with one Mr. <hi>Noble</hi> a Barreſter of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Boſon</hi> of <hi>Lyons-Inn,</hi> in order to the making up Accompts between Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and my Lord <hi>Aſton;</hi> for he told me he was going thither for that end: When we came thither, we met with one Captain <hi>Hawley,</hi> who belongs to the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and we deſired him to go to my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> and tell him, Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> was there, in order to make up his Accompts with him. He went and brings an anſwer back again, That my Lord was not at leiſure to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:105168:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then, nor none of us from him. And Mr. <hi>Hawley</hi> ſaid, he was then going up with the Lords to Nine-pins. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> faid, he was very ill uſed, for he had been ſeveral times there before, and he could not be admitted to ſpeak with him. He hath a little Book ſays he (meaning my Lord) wherein there is an Accompt made up under his own hand of almoſt Two or Three hundred Pounds, which ſum I cannot ſay, but one of them I am certain of, which he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed ſeveral times that he had it, (but I can prove that he hath it) if he will be pleaſed to produce that Book, we need not be a quarter of an hour in making up the Accompt. He did ſpeak of ſome other ſums he had to place to Accompt too, but ſo much was made up already. But Captain <hi>Hawley</hi> ſaying he would not ſpeak with him, nor any of us from him, I did take the liberty to ſay to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Hawley,</hi> That it was hard his Lordship and his party should abuſe Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> at that rate, to make him his Debtor: for now I underſtood by what Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſaid, my Lord was his Debtor. And ſaid I, if I can perſwade Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> he shall publish his Caſe, for the Proteſtant Intereſt ſuffered by it, That he should be made a Debtor to my Lord when he was not ſo. And <hi>I</hi> believe Capt. <hi>Hawley</hi> told my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> what I did ſay, for when he came back again from my Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> he ſaid my Lord did acknowledge he had that Book, and it was ready to be produced, but he would ſtay till a Councellor of his came out of the Country, and till he had ſpoke with the Lieutenant; for he would not ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> unleſs the Lieutenant were by, and in three or four days time he would ſend for him; but I never heard that he ſent for him ever ſince. If it pleaſe your Lordships, I have one thing more that I remember: There was a young man that belonged to my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Family, that heard Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was at Captain <hi>Hawley</hi>'s Chamber, and came to ſee him, and paid a very great reſpect to him, and would ſtand bare to him, though Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> deſired him to put on his Hat ſeveral times. Some of us asked him, whether Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was thought to be ſuch a Knave, when he lived with his Lord, as they would have made him ſince. No, ſaid he, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was as honeſt a Gentleman as ever lived in our Family. I remember my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s man ſaid this to us then.</p>

For my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> had a Book or Books in his cuſtody which he would ſtand by, and they would determine the buſineſs between them; that my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> was almoſt Two hundred pounds in his debt.

and can ſpeak materially to other particulars beſides this of <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Reputation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he was a perſon who was preſent when he made his firſt diſcovery of this Plot, and was very inſtrumental in prevailing with him to do it.

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Southall.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>There was the latter end of <hi>November</hi> (78.) a Report that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was gone away from my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s, ſuddenly and ſtrangely, and it was the common report in the Country that he was in the Plot, and was fled for it. In the beginning of <hi>December</hi> I went through a Town called <hi>Great Heywood,</hi> a Mile and a half from <hi>Tixal,</hi> where my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> dwelt. I called at Mr. <hi>Thomas Whitby</hi>'s Houſe, the Gentleman that was up here lately, and he was telling me, <hi>Dugdale</hi> was come again and apprehended by the Watch at <hi>Heywood</hi> upon ſuſpicion. He told me further, he would make no confeſſion of the Plot, though he had been under Examination before Sir <hi>VValter Bagott,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kinnerſley,</hi> and I think he ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas VVhitgrave.</hi> But he told me divers paſſages by which we both ſuſpected he might be concerned and know of the Plot. We thought ſo from the various reports and rumors we had heard in the Country, and from thoſe great grounds of ſuſpicion that were given us. As I returned from <hi>Heywood,</hi> I reſolved I would ſpeak with <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> the firſt opportunity, for I had a ſtrong perſwaſion I could prevail with him to make a diſcovery of the Plot, but before I did ſpeak with him, there was one <hi>Goldſmith</hi> my Kinſman, had ſome difference fallen out between him and Mr. <hi>Anſell,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> touching a Deed, the deciding of which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Mr. <hi>Dugdale.</hi> And he deſired me to go to Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to <hi>Stafford</hi> with him, I was very glad of the opportunity. <hi>Anſel</hi> was to bring one <hi>Hanſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goldſmith</hi> was to bring me, and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was to bring one Mr. <hi>Gerrard,</hi> that was concerned in the Premortgage, that we might all have diſcourſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I promiſed to meet them at the time appointed, and accordingly the 23<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> two days before <hi>Chriſtmas-day,</hi> I came to the place in <hi>Stafford,</hi> where <hi>Dugdale</hi> was, about Ten a Clock in the Morning, where they met according to their promiſe. We had not been in the Houſe longer than a quarter of an hour, but the Kings buſineſs, which I thought was a buſineſs of greater weight than any particular buſineſs, did ſtick much upon me, and I reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before I ſpoke to the particular buſineſs about which we all met, I would firſt ſpeak to Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> to put that in execution which I had reſolved. After a short ſpace of time I deſired Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> that I might ſpeak with him in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber privately between him and me; he told me, if I would go into the next Chamber to his, he would come to me. Accordingly I went, and ſtaid a short ſpace of time, and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> came to me. I deſired him to make the Door to, which he did, and I began thus with him. Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi>

for ſome Years laſt paſt, ſince I came to be acquainted with you, I have always had a good eſteem of you, and you a good report in the Country where you live, and now there is an opportunity put into your hands to ſerve his Majeſty and his Proteſtant Subjects, if (as an honeſt man ought) you will diſcharge your Duty. Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> replyed, Sir, what do you mean? Why ſaid I, I mean this in a few words, Here is a Plot diſcovered in <hi>London,</hi> and if it be in <hi>London,</hi> I conceive it hath been in part acted at <hi>Tixal,</hi> and if there, of neceſſity, you having ſuch a Government and Rule over that Houſe, it is impoſſible but you muſt know it. He looked upon me very earneſtly, and gave me a ſmile, but anſwered me not; I replied to him again thus, ſaid I, There is a natural Allegiance which every Subject owes to his Soveraign, and by that it is required, that if any Subjects know of any Plot or any Conſpiracy againſt his Perſon and Government, they ought in Conſcience to diſcover it, therefore Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> ſaid I, diſcharge a good Conſcience, and tell what you know, for it is commonly ſuſpected you are concerned in the Plot. He anſwered, I have taken the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy. When and where ſaid I? Before his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace at <hi>Stafford,</hi> ſaid he. Then ſaid I, there is not only that natural Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which every Subject owes to his Prince, but the Oath of Almighty God lies upon your Conſcience, therefore diſcharge a good Conſcience; and tell your knowledge. He ſtood pauſing a little while, and by and by, ſaid he, If I should make any diſcovery, how should I be ſecured of my Life? You need not Queſtion that, ſaid I, nor his Majeſties Gracious Pardon which he hath promiſed in his Proclamation; Have you ſeen the Proclamation? Yes, ſaid he. Said I, you have but a short time, a day or two to diſcover in, for this is the 23<hi>th,</hi> and as I do conceive, you ought to diſcover before the 25<hi>th;</hi> he ſtood pauſing a while about the time, ſaid I, you need not queſtion his Majeſties Gracious Promiſe, and to incourage you thereto, there is not only an aſſurance of Pardon, but a promiſe of Reward of Two hundred pounds. Said he, if I do diſcover any thing of my knowledge, I matter not, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire (I don't know which it was) his Majeſties Money, ſo I may be ſecured of my Life. Upon this, my Lords, ſaid I, Sir, you need not queſtion his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Gracious Promiſe, my Life for yours, if you have not his Pardon, but I will take ſpecial care about it, for I will ſend up a Letter to <hi>London,</hi> directed to ſome of the Lords (which <hi>I</hi> accordingly did) and <hi>I</hi> will alſo ſpeak to Captain <hi>Lane,</hi> who is a worthy Gentleman to interpoſe in it too. Then ſaid he, <hi>I</hi> will make a diſcovery of the Plot. Then, my Lords, he told me firſt ſome particular paſſages relating to this Lord at the Bar, and alſo concerning Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> and Mr <hi>Peters,</hi> now in Cuſtody, and ſome other particulars; <hi>I</hi> wished him that he would ſpeak no more at that time. And when <hi>I</hi> parted with him, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>I</hi> conſulted with my ſelf what <hi>I</hi> ought to do, in point of Law; <hi>I</hi> knew, <hi>I</hi> muſt diſcover, that a further diſcovery might be made of what had paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105168:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us. Then I went to Mr. <hi>Freek,</hi> who was either Mayor or Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Stafford,</hi> and told him he muſt come with me to Serjeant <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s. He asked me what to do. I told him when he came he should know: he accordingly came, and took short Notes of a further Diſcovery, and Mr. <hi>Freek</hi> he certified it up to Mr. <hi>Chetwyn,</hi> who was then at <hi>London.</hi> Upon the day following the 24<hi>th.</hi> I roſe and went to one Mr. <hi>Vernon,</hi> one of His Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, and told him what had happened, and he ſent for Captain <hi>Lane</hi> another of His Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, and they took an Examination of him. I have done, my Lord, with reference to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and the time.</p>

                  <p>Truly, my Lords, I can only tell what he ſaid at the firſt Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he told me the firſt time my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> ſpoke with him was at <hi>Tixal</hi>-Hall, nigh to the Gate-Houſe, betwixt the Gate and the Hall. My Lord was going into the Hall, and my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> told him, it was a very hard thing, or to that purpoſe, that they could not ſay their Prayes but in private, and after told him the ſame day or night t'one, that they had ſome work to do, and he might or muſt be inſtrumental in it. This was the effect of what he told me paſſed the firſt time. Another time I think he told me he was to have five hundred pounds to kill the King.</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105168:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and if there be a good ſucceſs we ſhall enjoy our freedom. And that upon the <hi>20th.</hi> day of <hi>September, 1678.</hi> the ſaid Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> told this Informant, That there was a Deſign in hand, and if he would undertake in it, he ſhould have a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, &amp;c. and make himſelf famous. The ſame day this Informant went up into Mr. <hi>Francis Evers</hi> Chamber to know what my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> meant by his words; and he firſt made him ſwear ſecreſie upon his knees, and then told him, That he might be a perſon employed, and have a good Reward, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf famous, if he would ſtand inſtrumental with others in taking aatay the Kings Life, by Shooting or otherwiſe, and need not fear, for that the Pope had Excommunicated the King, and that all that were Excommunicated by him were Hereticks, and they might Kill them, and be Canonized for Saints in ſo doing. And that the Deſign was as well to Kill the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> as well as the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>December</hi> the <hi>29th. 1678.</hi> This Informant ſaith, That ſince the <hi>20th.</hi> day of <hi>September</hi> laſt, the ſaid Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did promiſe him Five Hundred Pounds as to the carrying on of the Plot, and that Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> should give him inſtructions about the ſame. And that the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> told him, he did not doubt of his fidelity, for Mr. <hi>Evers</hi> had given him a good character to be truſty. And that the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> told this Informant, That there was a Deſign to take away the Life of the King, and the Life of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others were to be imployed in the Deſign beſides this Informant. And that this had been throughly conſidered of to be the fitteſt way for the eſtabliſhing of the Romiſh Religion.

                  <p>My Lords, we will examine no further as to Mr. <hi>Dugdale:</hi> But will conclude with this Witneſs, and I think he ſpeaks fully to him. The next Witneſs we called was Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> and your Lordships have been pleaſed to obſerve, That what Exceptions have been made againſt him, have not been ſo much by Witneſſes produced, as by oppoſing one part of his Teſtimony to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what he ſwore at one time to what he ſwore at another, to which we shall give an Anſwer when we come to ſum up our Evidence; for there will be no need of Witneſſes to what is objected againſt Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> but only of Obſervations; but as to the third Witneſs <hi>Turbervill,</hi> we have ſomething to anſwer of Witneſs, and ſome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  <p>My Lords, That will be when we come to make our Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, we shall not anſwer that by Witneſſes; when we come to ſum up our Evidence, I doubt not but we shall give a ſufficient Anſwer to that Objection. But to go on with what is to be anſwered by Teſtimony, your Lordships will be pleaſed to remember, That <hi>Turbervill</hi> did inform your Lordships, That he had ſome converſe with my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> being introduced by ſome of the Fathers. My Lords, we shall call a Gentleman that had happened to be there at that time, that will tell you though he did not know my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> yet he knew that <hi>Turbervill</hi> did converſe much with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord in that place where my Lord does acknowledge his Lodging to be. He will give you ſome further account how <hi>Turbervill</hi> went to <hi>Diep</hi> in expectation of my Lord, and how he had a Meſſage from the Lord, though he did not know my Lord <hi>Stafford.</hi> He will give you a further account how Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> was earneſt with him to go to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> and then told him, he might go over with my Lord at that time. The uſe we make of theſe particulars we will forbear to mention till we ſum up our Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. We deſire to examine Mr. <hi>Thomas Mort.</hi>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Mort.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Yes, my Lords, I knew him, it is now five years paſt ſince we were in <hi>Paris.</hi> He and I had been intimately acquainted, before we lived in the ſame Family. I was ſeveral times in company with him, and many times in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers company, which was a Monk, and I heard him ſay his Brother had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention he should be of the ſame Order. And ſome time after that he altered his reſolution, and deſigned for <hi>England,</hi> and I had ſuch a deſign too to go from <hi>Paris,</hi> where I was an Apprentice. And being acquainted with him I reſolved to go over with him, and he told me, his Brother the Monk had introduced him into the favour of a Lord, as I take it, it was my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> as well as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. And that there was a Veſſel to come to <hi>Diep,</hi> a Yaught, and we should go thither to go over with my Lord. And Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> told me, we muſt make as much haſt as might be, for it were better to be there a day or two too ſoon than too late. We went to <hi>Diep,</hi> and when we came there, the Veſſel was not come. And when we had been there a fortnight, or thereabouts, we were
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:105168:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
put to a great deal of inconveniency by reaſon of our long ſtay there, and, I think, if I miſtake not, I or ſome of the Company ſaid, Curſed is he that relies or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on a broken Staff, alluding, as I believe, to my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s Name. Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> told me, if we did go to <hi>Calice,</hi> we might go over with my Lord; but how or by what means he underſtood the Veſſel would be there, and my Lord go that way, I know not. But we did not go thither, we had another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; there was a ſmall Veſſel whether a Fish-Boat, or a Coal-Veſſel I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, a very little one it was, but we took the opportunity, and came over in it.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, my firſt acquaintance with him, was at my Brothers Houſe in <hi>Glamorganſhire.</hi> When I came there, my Brother shew'd him me, and told me he was a very worthy man, but his Friends had caſt him off, becauſe he would not take Orders in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. He lived at my Brothers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a year; and when he came thence, my Brother writ a Letter of Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to my Father to receive him there, and do him all the kindneſs he could. He came to my Father's, and ſtay'd there near half a year, or thereabouts, I cannot tell to a Month or ſo. Since, I have known him often in this Town, and been in his company; and I never knew, nor heard, but that he behaved himſelf like a worthy honeſt Gentleman; but as to any thing of the Plot, I know nothing.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, he lived ſome time in my Neighbourhood; I never knew him guilty of any ill action at all, but a perſon of a very fair Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He acknowledged himſelf a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, and was pleaſed to give me the liberty to talk to him. I found him inclinable to hearken to me, and to thoſe Reaſons I offered to him; and I found he had a mind to quit that Religion, being convinced by the Arguments I gave him, and as ſeveral times he hath ſince told me, thoſe were ſome of the great motives of his coming over from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Communion.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Matthews.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>One was the hazard I told him of, in his living in the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion as to Salvation; another was the excellency of the Doctrines of our Church, its Principles and Practices.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I think we have but one matter more, which we should have mentioned before, but that our Witneſs was not come: but I hope we shall have the favour of ſome Honourable Lords that do know the thing, and I think there are many more that can prove it. My Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> who is very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, it may be, may not remember matters exactly, I blame him not; Oblivion is the great infirmity of old age. He was pleaſed to ſay Yeſterday, he had ſo good health, that he had not been lame, I think he ſaid for theſe Forty years; but at laſt his Page ſaid for the laſt Seven years; and I shall confirm our proof to that time. My Lords, I think there are ſome Honourable Lords here, that have ſeen this Noble Lord, that ſays he was not Lame in ſo many years very near about the time he was confined and impriſoned, go Lame and come Lame to the Houſe, and eaſe himſelf by holding up his Legg ſometimes. My Lords, I do not ſay, the Circumſtance is very material, but only to shew my Lord may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get himſelf, which I shall impute to his old Age.</p>

                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>I will acknowlede it, if your Lordships pleaſe, I did ſay I had not been lame with the Gout ſo long, no more I have not. I was troubled with the Sciatica many years, but 'tis above eight or nine years ſince that, and I took ſo much Opium that that and my going to the <hi>Bath</hi> cured me. I have often come lame to the Houſe out of wearineſs and old Age, but if ever I put my Foot upon a Stool for the Gout, or was ever ſo lame as to put my Foot upon a Cushion to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:105168:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eaſe it, I will admit what he ſpeaks to, I'll acknowledge thus much to ſave time.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>Seeing my Lord is pleaſed to go off from it, I'll call no Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to it.</p>

                  <p>I go off from nothing, I was lame three or four years when the King came in: I went to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and afterwards into <hi>Germany,</hi> and what with Opium and the <hi>Bath</hi> I was cured, and I have not been lame theſe eight or nine years. I have not had the Gout in my Foot for theſe many years, and I never was ſo lame to put my Foot on a ſtool to my remembrance.</p>

                  <p>Your Lordship is to proceed thus if you pleaſe; Your Lordship is to recollect and recapitulate all the Proofs you have made; and you are to enforce them as well as you can, and make ſuch Obſervations upon them as are for your own advantage: and this your Lordship muſt do for the Fact: If there remain a doubt in Law which you may have occaſion to move, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel may be demanded; and if it be conſiderable and worthy of debate, you may have Counſel heard to ſpeak to it. But the Proceſs is cloſed, no more Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are to be heard: There remains only Obſervations upon the Fact or Law to be made.</p>

                  <p>No, I think not: 'tis agreed on both ſides, all is done: But my Lord, I would not have your Lordship to underſtand me ſo, that if ſo be you have yet any material Evidence, that you think it does concern you to produce, and you have it ready to Morrow, before you ſum up the Evidence; I believe then, if you move my Lords, they will let it be heard: Otherwiſe I think here is an end of Witneſſes.</p>

If his Lordship have any Witneſſes to any material part of his Defence, though he hath bound himſelf up, I should not be againſt hearing of them. But if his new Witneſſes are only to the Reputation of our Witneſſes, then perhaps we muſt have ſome other Witneſſes brought to diſcredit his, and we not knowing who theſe new Witneſſes of his would be, may need perhaps ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day to bring Teſtimony againſt them, ſo that I know not when the matter can have an end. Your Lordships know, there is a Rule in the Civil Law, <hi>In teſtem, teſtes, &amp; in hos, ſed non datur ultra;</hi> And I hope beyond that you will not go; Truly, for my own part, I did not expect any other Witneſſes, but thoſe he was pleaſed to name laſt night, in relation to the matters of Accompt; If he pleaſe to call them, we shall hear them; but for any other, conſidering it would prolong the Tryal to another day, and this Cauſe hath had four days already for Hearing, we hope they shall not be admitted.</p>

                  <p>Come, Mr. Lieutenant, do you know any thing about Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts between my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale?</hi>

                  <p>My Lords, laſt Summer was 12 month <hi>Dugdale</hi> came to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> would not ſpeak with him, unleſs I were by; ſo they brought him to my Lodging, and he shewed me the Books of Accompts, Itold them I did not underſtand Accompts, but if they would have me be by I would get ſome body to be preſent that did, and have them adjuſted. Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> ſaid he whould come another time, but from that time to this I never heard of him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, <hi>I</hi> shall not trouble you with any more Witneſſes. My Lords, <hi>I</hi> have now done my Evidence. <hi>I</hi> shall as well as my weak memory and old Age will give me leave ſum it up, ſomething (as well as I can) of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given againſt me, and for me. Truly, my Lords, <hi>I</hi> am able to do it very imperfectly for want of underſtanding, and truly for want of ſleep, but <hi>I</hi> do not doubt, but that according to the Law, as <hi>I</hi> am informed it is, ſince <hi>I</hi> can have no Counſel in matter of Fact, or to adviſe me in any thing of that nature, yet <hi>I</hi> am alſo informed by the Law, your Lordships who are my Judges, are my Counſel. And <hi>I</hi> do not doubt but your Lordships, when you take it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, will ſupply any defects which <hi>I</hi> shall commit, which <hi>I</hi> believe will be many, <hi>I</hi> shall ſpend your Lordships time as little as <hi>I</hi> can, though theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Houſe of Commons believe <hi>I</hi> deſire to protract it, yet <hi>I</hi> profeſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God <hi>I</hi> do not. And <hi>I</hi> declare before them all, and your Lordships, <hi>I</hi> am ſo ſatisfied of my own Innocency that <hi>I</hi> would never beg a moments time of delay; and <hi>I</hi> know your Lordships will take care of the Life of the meaneſt Subject; and though <hi>I</hi> have had the honour to ſit among your Lordships as a Peer, yet <hi>I</hi> ask not for your favour, but with your juſtice too; <hi>I</hi> shall therefore ſum up my defence as well as <hi>I</hi> can. For the firſt Witneſs <hi>Dugdale</hi> he ſwore <hi>I</hi> was at a Conſult at <hi>Tixal</hi> in the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> or the beginning of <hi>September, I</hi> have ſufficiently proved that in all <hi>Auguſt I</hi> was not there, nor till the 12. of <hi>September. I</hi> have proved that his firſt Oath was, <hi>I</hi> was there in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and a man that will ſwear falſe in one thing is not to be credited in any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>I</hi> have made it appear to your Lordships, that upon the 20. of <hi>September,</hi> when he ſays he was in my Chamber and <hi>I</hi> ſent the Page to call him, that it is falſe, it was only he deſired he might come to me to get leave that he might go to the Race, my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> being angry with him for it. This <hi>I</hi> conceive is proved ſufficiently by two Witneſſes, my Man and my Boy, and this <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> have
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:105168:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proved as poſitively as can be done. My Lords, 'tis true, 'tis objected againſt me, That I had ſaid <hi>Dugdale</hi> was never ſeen alone with me in my life, 'tis true, and 'tis true <hi>Anſell</hi> ſwears he brought a Footman to me, but he ſwears it was in the Morning when it was at Supper, and does not ſay that he was alone with me. My Lords, <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwore that he told Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sambidge</hi> of the death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> on the <hi>Munday,</hi> ſome ſwore he ſaid it was on the <hi>Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> but they deny that ever he told it them, and ſo he is forſworn in that. And my Lords, whether he be a man of any great Credit I think I have proved enough to your Lordships. 'Tis proved by two Witneſſes <hi>Holt</hi> and <hi>Morrall</hi> that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them money to ſwear, as likewiſe he did to another, one <hi>Robinſon,</hi> whom I do believe by the Information that was given of him to be a wicked ill man and not to be credited, but being ſo, my Lords, he was the fitter for <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s turn. And yet he had ſo much Conſcience, though he was a poor and needy fellow, he would not ſwear a mans Life away for money, the other two are without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the one they ſay is an idle fellow, and t'other a man but of an indifferent Reputation, how far that will move with your Lordships, I ſubmit it to you. I ſuppoſe 'tis alſo clear by my Witneſſes that <hi>Dugdale</hi> is a man of no Reputation, having forſworn himſelf in ſeveral particulars, and I ſubmit the Credit of all he ſays to your Lordships upon that.</p>
                  <p>The next Witneſs, my Lords, is Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> whether he be a Doctor or no I know it not, he would not own it here, he, my Lords, ſwears that he ſaw a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion delivered to me to be Pay-maſter of an Army to be raiſed, God knows when, I never heard when, or where, I ſuppoſe it was in the Clouds, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew where elſe. Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> all along before ſwore only that he believed I was in the Plot, now he ſwears I was in it, at Mr. <hi>Fenwicks</hi> Chamber a man I never ſaw in my life, nor heard of till this diſcovery. And that he ſaw Letters ſubſcribed by my Name; but that, my Lords, I conceive is no Evidence at all, for he never ſaw me write nor does know my Hand, nor does he pretend to know me then, and when he had told your Lordships he had a Letter of mine, he pretended to look for it, and then ſaid he had loſt it, that is, never had it. But beſides, my Lords, his Evidence now does not agree with his former, for I do appeal to your Lordships that were in the Houſe then, that he ſwore the firſt time, He only ſaw my Name to Letters, afterwards he ſwore (that is ſome days after he had ended all his Evidence, and knew no more than he had put down then, afterwards he remembers what he knew not before, and ſwears) a Commiſſion he ſaw delivered to me: So his Memory increaſes as he hath time to invent, and perhaps by another time it might be much more. But, my Lords, I think that one particular, his ſwearing before your Lordships, as 'tis entred in your Journal, that he had no more to ſay againſt any body, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards naming the Queen, and now me to have a Commiſſion, I conceive is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Perjury. My Lords, Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> told your Lordships, That he had never
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:105168:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
been a Papiſt in his Heart but ever feigned it; truly my Lords I cannot poſſibly give over that point, That a man that feigns himſelf to be a Papiſt or any thing that in the opinion of Proteſtants is ſo wicked a thing as that, is fit to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he shall not heartily repent himſelf, and own it to God and Man as an ill thing to diſſemble ſo. But yeſterday he with a ſmiling Countenance, and as it were in deriſion, owns that which muſt be a very great offence to God Almighty to pretend to be of an Idolatrous Church. I appeal to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships whether he be a fit Witneſs, I conceive he cannot be thought a Chriſtian, nor to believe in God. I know many wicked and infamous perſons have done many wicked things, and yet have been Witneſſes, but never did any wicked man own a wicked thing, that he might have concealed, with boaſting of it, that ever was credited in any thing; for if he had ſaid I do acknowledge I did diſſemble with God and my own Conſcience, but I ask God forgiveneſs, it was for a good End and a good Intention, it had been ſomething (though that could not have atoned for ſo ill a thing) but shewing no Repentance, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an impudent affronting of God Almighty, I think he is not a fit Witneſs, I appeal to your Lordships and the whole Chriſtian World if he be. I cannot believe your Lordships will condemn me for an Opinion which I will go to my death with, and it ſtands upon me ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Witneſs, my Lords, is <hi>Turbervill,</hi> and he ſays, in the year (75) he often diſcourſed alone with me for a fortnight together at <hi>Paris.</hi> My Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants he owns he never ſaw them, and how he could come for a fortnight together, and not ſee my Servants, <hi>I</hi> refer it to your Lordships conſideration whether it be poſſible. For I'le tell your Lordships, when <hi>I</hi> had been a few days at <hi>Paris</hi> my Landlord came one day to me, and ſaid, You do not do well to ſuffer any body to come to you without your Man be by, for there came yeſterday a Frenchman to ſpeak with you, and <hi>I</hi> do not know him, and he went ſtrait up to your Chamber without any body with him, 'tis a dangerous thing, ſaid he, for <hi>I</hi> know that Frenchmen and people have come up, and been alone with perſons, and put a Piſtol to them, and made them deliver their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for fear of their Lives, therefore pray, ſaid he, do it no more. From that time, which was a few days after, <hi>I</hi> came to <hi>Paris</hi> the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> no Chriſtian Soul was permitted to come to me without my Servants, how then could he come to me for a fortnight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and none of my Servants ſee him? My Lords, this Gentleman very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy the next day after he had made an Affidavit againſt me would needs mend it, and Sir <hi>William Poultney</hi> did acknowledge that he made Affidavit one day, that he came to my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s in the year (73) and the next day amended it to (72.) Now <hi>I</hi> humbly conceive, my Lords, a man that ſwears one thing to day, which he forſwears to morrow is not to be believed; And the truth of it is, as his Brothers prove to your Lordships, he came to my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:105168:106" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the year (71) and ſo he forſwears himſelf in every thing, and is in no wiſe to be believed. He ſwears to your Lordships I writ a Letter to him to acquaint him that I would go by <hi>Calice,</hi> and not by <hi>Diep;</hi> but I have proved I went by <hi>Diep,</hi> and I aſſure your Lordships I have not been at <hi>Calice,</hi> I think, theſe twelve or fourteen years. I conceive theſe things are very manifeſt and clear proofs againſt him that he hath not ſwore one true word. He ſwears that my Lord <hi>Powis,</hi> my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and his friends, perſwaded him to go to <hi>Doway</hi> to to be a Frier, but not liking it he came over again and was in danger of his life by them; but the Evidence is ſufficiently ſtrong in proof that he afterwards was at my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s and was well received, that he lay in the Houſe, and was not in the leaſt injured by them. And for his other Relations his Brother proves he was not ill uſed by them. They gave him Seven Pound to be gone and trouble them no more. He ſays, I ſaid, he was a Coward, and I'le tell you why I ſaid ſo, becauſe a Captain, that is now out of <hi>England,</hi> told his Siſter ſo, who told me, But that is not very material. My Lords, there is one Witneſs more, <hi>John Porter</hi> that ſwears to your Lordships this one thing, That this <hi>Turbervill</hi> ſwore to him at ſuch an Alehouſe, he knew nothing of the Plot. And then my Lords there is Mr. <hi>Yalden,</hi> and he is a Gentleman of Reputation, he ſaid in his company, there was no Trade good but that of a Diſcoverer, God damn the Duke of <hi>York, Monmouth,</hi> Plot and all, for I know nothing of it. Truly, my Lords, whether he got no money by it or is known ſince he hath been a Diſcoverer, telling what he knew not ſo many Months ago; and therefore I ſubmit it to your Lordships what he is.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, theſe people that ſwear againſt me, there is not one of them a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any Quality or Condition, and whether they have not rather ſworn for money than the truth, by things that are known, and need no proof, I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve when I come to it to argue that point in Law; Whether a man that ſwears for gain is a credible Witneſs or no?</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I have as well as I can ſummed up that little Evidence that was given againſt me, I cannot better do it in ſo short a time, for indeed I had but a very short time laſt night, and I have not ſlept, I had the Cramp ſo much in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity that my next Neighbour heard me roaring out. My Lords, I ſubmit my ſelf to your Lordships, and doubt not but that the matters charged upon me will appear to your Lordships ſufficiently anſwered. And I beſeech your Lordships well to conſider that one thing againſt Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> his diſſembling with God Almighty, and his impudent owning of it. This I do inſiſt upon, and I proteſt before God Almighty, if I were a Judge, I would not hang a Dog upon ſuch Evidence. My Lords, I have many points in Law to offer to your Lordships, and when you pleaſe I should do it, I'le name them to you.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I would not interrupt my Lord, but I think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is no interruption, ſince his Lordship broke off and was going on to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther point. But I think I ſee one of the impudenteſt things that ever was done in a Court of Juſtice; Whileſt we are Trying a Perſon here for a Popish Plot, I do ſee a proſeſſed Papiſt ſtanding in the Body of your Houſe, and that is Sir <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Gaſcoyne.</hi>
                  </p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I do conceive I have cleared my ſelf to your' Lordships of what I am accuſed of. My Lords, The Courſe of my whole Life hath been otherwiſe, I defie any Creature in the World to ſay, That I ever uſed one diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient or diſloyal word of the King, or did any ſuch Act. I waited on the King that now is in the Unhappy War that is paſſed, when I was in a low condition enough as to Fortune, and my Wife and Family were thereby reduced to great Streights, for my Wife and Children lived ſome five or ſix years upon ſome Plate and Jewels that we had, whereas if I would have come, and been at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and joined with that party, I could have ſaved my Eſtate, and lived quietly as others did. But my Conſcience told me, I ought to wait upon the King, and offer him my perſonal Service, when I could do him no other. I have shewn how the Witneſſes have forſworn themſelves, I shall now, if your Lordships pleaſe, deſire your Opinion in ſome points of Law. And though perhaps I may name to your Lordships many things that are impertinent, or not to the purpoſe, I beg your Lordships pardon, 'tis out of the weakneſs of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and I hope you will not think ill, neither your Lordships, nor the Houſe of Commons, if I should, through Ignorance, move things impertinent. The firſt Point of Law is this,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I conceive there is no Example or Preſident for it, That Proceedings Criminal ever did continue from Parliament to Parliament, and this is continued to three.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>Speak out my Lord, and go on</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Secondly, my Lords, I do not queſtion the power of the Houſe of Commons in the leaſt, but, my Lords, I know they Impeach when they find Grounds for it without diſpute, but I queſtion whether any man, by the known Laws of this Kingdom, in Capital Caſes, can be proceeded on, but by Indictment firſt found by the Grand Jury, and not by Impeachment by any Perſon, or other body of Men.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>Thirdly, my Lords, <hi>I</hi> conceive there are many defects in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment or the Impeachment (Indictment there is none) There is no Overt Act alledged in the Indictment or Impeachment, <hi>I</hi> know not well what it is called. And, my Lords, by the Act of Parliament in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 10. nothing from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth is to be Treaſon, but according to the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which includes an Overt Act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:105168:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fourthly, my Lords, <hi>I</hi> deſire that <hi>I</hi> may prove that by Law they are not com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petent Witneſſes, for they ſwear for money. But my Lords, <hi>I</hi> forgot one thing to ſay to Your Lordships as to the Evidence, that theſe Gentlemen did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to prove <hi>(I</hi> do not ſpeak whether they did or not) a general Plot of the Papiſts, whether they did not, <hi>I</hi> am not concerned in it, for <hi>I</hi> ſay they have not proved me a Papiſt, which <hi>I</hi> ſubmit to Your Lordships; and though any man may know me ſo in his private knowledge, yet they having not given any proof of it, 'tis not to affect me.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, There is is one Point of Law more, That no man can be condemned for Treaſon, as <hi>I</hi> conceive by one Witneſs, and there are not two Witneſſes to any Point. Theſe are the Points of Law, <hi>I</hi> humbly beg your Lordships pardon for the trouble, and deſire your Opinion in them.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, Before we make anſwer to what my Lord hath ſaid, <hi>I</hi> do humbly deſire, That for the Objection which he hath made againſt Mr. <hi>Southall,</hi> proved by a Noble Lord of this Houſe (though <hi>I</hi> muſt obſerve it was not of his own knowledge, but by Hear-ſay, and that matter of Hear-ſay contrary to the Act of Oblivion) to the end there may no doubt remain of Mr. <hi>Southall</hi>'s Credit, that a Noble Lord of this Houſe, and a Gentleman of the Houſe of Commons (who both know Mr. <hi>Southall)</hi> may be heard to his Reputation.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, What <hi>I</hi> have to ſay concerning this Mr. <hi>Southall</hi> is, That he hath been often employed both by my Brother and my Mother, and they have ſo good an Opinion of him, that they employ him ſtill, and therefore we take him for an honeſt man, and an able man, or he would not be ſo much truſted and employed, and <hi>I</hi> take him to be a very good Churchman, for if he was not <hi>I</hi> would not employ him.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> L. Gower.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, <hi>I</hi> have been near 7 years of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> but did not know Mr. <hi>Southall</hi> till this Popish Plot was diſcovered. After that <hi>I</hi> came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him (being a Juſtice of the Peace in that County) in Court, where <hi>I</hi> found him to be the moſt zealous Proſecutor of the Papiſts in that Country, no man like him. <hi>I</hi> likewiſe found ſeveral Popish Prieſts, had by his means, been apprehended, and impriſoned, and one of them ſince convicted, who by the way ſtill remains unexecuted in <hi>Stafford</hi> Goal. What Opinion ſome may have
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:105168:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heard or had of him formerly, I cannot tell, but this I know, that he hath more than once come to deſire my Aſſiſtance, that he might proſecute the <hi>Papiſts</hi> the moſt effectual way upon the Statutes made for that purpoſe, and that he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to me that he had not met with good uſage elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I take Opinion to be grounded upon Principles, and I do obſerve that thoſe of this Country, who do believe this <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and know Mr. <hi>Southall,</hi> and are principl'd for the Preſervation of the King, the Proteſtant Religion, and the Government, do at this time ſpeak well of him, and thoſe who are not ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipl'd ſpeak otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I was ſurpris'd when I heard my Name mention'd upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I have told your Lordships all the matter of Fact that upon the ſuddain occurs to me, (with my own Opinion, which I offer with all ſubmiſſion) and had I had notice, I might poſſibly have recollected more, which I would freely have declared to your Lordships, but this is all that I can now ſay.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, if your Lordships pleaſe, I would ſay one word, if you will give me leave, I am very ignorant, and beg your Lordships pardon for troubling of you, I humbly deſire to know, whether after the Points of Law are argued, I may ſpeak ſomething not concerning the Evidence of the Plot, but concerning my ſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, we shall not oppoſe the ſaying any thing he can for himſelf, but we muſt conclude, and have the laſt word.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, the Gentlemen that are for the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> muſt conclude. My Lords will give you all the favour they can, but they muſt have the laſt word.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not oppoſe it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore you will do well to ſay all you have to ſay together. For the Points of Law, my Lords will give no Judgement till the Commons have anſwered them, and they I ſuppoſe will firſt ſum up the whole Proofs, then you may ſay what you have to ſay, for they muſt make an end. Gentlemen, will you ſpeak firſt to the Law?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>No, my Lords, firſt to the Fact.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>Go on then.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>William Jones,</hi> One of the Committee appointed to manage the Evidence, began to ſum up the ſame as followeth:</p>
               <p>MAy it pleaſe your Lordships, We have now done our Evidence, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and that which I have in Charge at this time, is to remind your Lordships of our Proofs, to anſwer the Objections that have been made againſt them, and to make ſome Obſervations upon the whole.</p>
               <p>My Lords, The Members of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> that were appointed for
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105168:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Service of the Management of this Tryal, thoſe of them (I mean) who began the firſt day, made a Diviſion of our Evidence into two parts, the one, that which concerned the Plot in general, and the other what related to this Lord in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>My Lords, as to the Plot in general, we did call ſix Witneſſes, I know ſome of your Lordships have taken Notes, and you have their Names, they were <hi>Smith, Dugdale, Prance, Oats, Denis</hi> and <hi>Jeniſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, becauſe I will ſave as much of your time as I can, I will not take upon me to repeat what each Witneſs ſaid as to the Plot in general; but when I come to the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Evidence which immediately concerns my Lord, I muſt beg your favour that I may be more particular. I will ſay thus much for the Proofs of the Plot in general, That there was by thoſe Witneſſes ſo much fully proved, that made it moſt apparent, That there was a general Deſign amongſt the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to introduce their falſe Religion into this Kingdom, That the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had ſeveral Meetings to that end, That they endeavoured to do it by ſeveral ways, by raiſing of Armes, by collecting of Monies, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning againſt the Kings Life; nay, they had ſo far advanced their Deſigns, and were in ſo much readineſs, as they thought it time to appoint Officers not only for their Army, but for the Civil Government, as if the Work were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready accomplished.</p>
               <p>Your Lordships were told by one of the Witneſſes of a <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> and of a <hi>Lord Treaſurer,</hi> (Lords now in the <hi>Tower</hi> yet to be tried) and you were told alſo of Officers for the Military part, a General, a Lieutenant-General, and this Lord at the Bar to be Pay-Maſter of the Army.</p>
               <p>I shall, my Lords, deſire to take notice to your Lordships, That this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, though it was to be finally acted by other Hands, yet was it firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and afterwards carried on by the Prieſts and Jeſuits. You will find them preparing for it, by making Sermons to juſtifie that Doctrine (which I confeſs this Noble Lord denies) of the lawfulneſs of killing Kings. You will find the Prieſts and Jeſuits, in their Diſcourſes as well as Sermons, urging and incouraging their Diſciples and Votaries, to go on with their Deſign of killing our King, and giving that common Reaſon for it, That He was an <hi>Heretick,</hi> and it were meritorious to take him out of the way.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I take notice of theſe particulars in the general Plot, becauſe it may give great light to, and add much to the Confirmation of the particular Evidence. And, my Lords, (I think) I may take leave to ſay, That the Plot in general hath been now ſufficiently proved. And if we conſider what hath been proved at former Tryals (upon which many of the Offenders and Traytors have been executed) what hath been published in Print, and above all <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, written all with his own hand, and for that reaſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be falſified; we may juſtly conclude, that there is not a man in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:105168:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> of any underſtanding, but muſt be fully convinced of the truth of the Plot in general. I shall ſpare to mention the Reſolutions and Declarations of Two Parliaments, and of both Houſes in thoſe Two Parliaments without (as I remember) one diſſenting Voice, expreſſing their full ſatisfaction of the Reality of the Plot; ſo that I think now none remain that do pretend not to believe it, but two ſorts of perſons, the one thoſe that were Conſpirators in it, and the other thoſe that wish'd it had ſucceeded, and deſire it may ſo ſtill.</p>
               <p>But, my Lords, I will be the shorter on this part; For perhaps it will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, You have offered a fair Proof of a general Plot, here are Records, Votes of both Houſes, Papers and Evidences printed, and Witneſſes <hi>Viva voce</hi> to prove it; but what is all this to my Lord <hi>Stafford?</hi> My Lords, it goes a great way to him; I do not ſay to be a convincing Evidence, but to make the particular Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt him highly credible.</p>
               <p>Your Lordships cannot imagine, That there are ſuch a ſtore of Lords and great Men amongſt that Party (though there be too many) that they should have great Choice for great Offices. Your Lordships hear how the other great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were diſpoſed of, and truly I think the Merit of this Lord amongſt that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might very well intitle him to an Office as great as this of <hi>Treaſurer</hi> of War, or <hi>Pay-Maſter</hi> to the Army. But what is the Evidence of the general Plot (may ſome ſtill ſay) to my Lord <hi>Stafford?</hi> what do you mention the raiſing an Army? what do you mention the collecting of Money? what do you mention the providing of Arms for? Yes my Lords, they are very uſeful, for they give a a fair Introduction to prove againſt this Lord that he was to have this Office. If it be proved by other Witneſſes than thoſe who ſwear directly againſt this Lord, That there were Arms provided, that there was an Army to be raiſed, and the reſt; It proves at leaſt that there was Occaſion for ſuch an Officer as the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Witneſs proves my Lord was to be.</p>
               <p>My Lords, For the other matter that relates to the Conſultations of the Prieſts and Jeſuits, and their Sermons and Diſcourſes; I deſire your Lordships to obſerve that alſo, which if you do, your Lordships will eaſily perceive what a great influence even that matter hath upon the particular Evidence, and how credible it renders the Teſtimony of the particular Witneſſes. Your Lordships will find, when my Lord was at <hi>Tixal</hi> (as <hi>Dugdale</hi> gives you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt) there was <hi>Evers</hi> the Jeſuit, and other Prieſts ſtill at my Lords Elbow, and egging him on to this buſineſs. Your Lordships will find where <hi>Oats</hi> ſpeaks of him, it is at <hi>Fenwick</hi>'s Chamber, who was a Jeſuit, giving him ghoſtly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Your Lordships will find, that at <hi>Paris,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> ſpeaks of him, there were Father <hi>Sherborne,</hi> Father <hi>Nelſon,</hi> and Father <hi>Anthony Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi> Still the Prieſts are about my Lord; and when my Lord is among them, or but newly come from them, then he utters the Treaſon of killing the King. And doubtleſs this trayterous purpoſe of his did ariſe from their Counſels. So that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:105168:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though our Witneſſes ſpeak of my Lords Diſcourſes at ſeveral times about killing the King, yet they make them flow from one and the ſame Fountain, the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prieſts and Jeſuits.</p>
               <p>But now, my Lords, to come to the particular Evidence, I think I may ſay, if ever Evidence was convincing, this is ſo. We have brought three Witneſſes which ſpeak each of them that which is ſufficient to prove my Lord Guilty, and they ſpeak of Overt Acts too, as I shall obſerve anon.</p>
               <p>His Lordship was pleaſed at the beginning of our Evidence to deſire that the Witneſſes might look him in the Face, and for that he cited two Statutes, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he intended the Statutes of 1. &amp; 5. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. which Statutes, or at leaſt one of them, do ſay, That there shall be in Caſe of High Treaſon two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to accuſe, and thoſe two Witneſſes brought face to face at the time of the Tryal. And my Lord hath had the benefit of thoſe Laws, he hath had two, nay three Witneſſes to prove him Guilty, brought face to face before your Lordships, and if theſe three, or any two of them, deſerve to be credited, my Lord in this Caſe is Guilty of High Treaſon. My Lords, I muſt beg the favour of looking upon my Paper of Notes, for the truth is, the Witneſſes are ſo many, and the proceeding hath held ſo long, that it is impoſſible for my weak memory to retain all that was ſaid.</p>
               <p>My Lords, the firſt Witneſs we began withall was <hi>Dugdale.</hi> And I know your Lordships did take notice what he ſwore, but it will be my Duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind your Lordships, That he tells you, That he had heard of a general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of making preparations to be ready againſt the Kings Death, and this for ſeveral years paſt. But as to the matter of haſtening the Death of the King, that was but a late Counſel. He tells you, I think, that about the latter end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> 1678. <hi>Evers</hi> and other Jeſuits were at <hi>Tixal,</hi> That there was a Conſult then about the Kings Death, and that (by the means of <hi>Evers,</hi> who was a very great Man among them, but ſince fled, and is mentioned in the Impeachment) he was admitted to that Conſult, and heard particularly what every man ſaid; and he does take upon him to ſay, That at that time the matter of taking away the Kings Life was propounded, and that my Lord, the Priſoner at the Bar, did conſent to it.</p>
               <p>My Lords, He tells you further, That upon a <hi>Sunday</hi> Morning my Lord came from <hi>Stafford</hi> to <hi>Tixal</hi> to <hi>Maſſe;</hi> my Lord was pleaſed to obſerve that we do not prove him a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but we prove my Lord came to <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and that I think is one good Proof of his being a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwears my Lord did then complain, That they had not the free Exerciſe of their Religion, that they could not ſay their Prayers openly; What were they? Not the Prayers of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> not thoſe contained in the Liturgy of our Church. He could not complain of any reſtraint as to them, but complain he did that they had not the free Exerciſe of their Religion, but he did hope, if things ſucceeded well, in a short time, it would be otherwiſe. This is particularly ſworn by <hi>Dugdale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:105168:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
My Lords, His Lordship was very much unſatisfied, That <hi>Dugdale</hi> was not particular in point of time, he did talk of ſome matters to be in <hi>Auguſt</hi> or <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> but could not fix to any day. But your Lordships will remember, that as to one particular, and which mainly concerns his Lordship to anſwer, he comes to a day, or within a day, for he ſwears poſitively, That upon the 20. or 21. of <hi>September</hi> he was ſent for to my Lords Chamber, the Servants were put out, that there my Lord did propoſe to him in expreſs terms, the matter of Killing of the King. He would have him be an Actor in it, and he offered him a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of 500 <hi>l.</hi> to perform it. For this which is the moſt material part of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Evidence againſt my Lord, he is certain 'twas either on the 20. or 21. of <hi>September;</hi> and he tells your Lordships how he comes to remember the time, by a good Token, by the Foot-Race that was then to be run; and I do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that my Lord does deny, but rather acknowledge that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was in his Chamber at that time. 'Tis true, he does deny ſome other Circumſtances which I shall anſwer anon. And here I do think <hi>Dugdale</hi> undertakes to ſwear to that which will amount to an Overt Act, and a damnable one too, that is the offering 500 <hi>l.</hi> to kill the King.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Dugdale,</hi> it ſeems, was not willing to depend upon the promiſes of my Lord for ſo much money, his Lordship had not that credit with him; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs to <hi>Evers,</hi> and deſires to be ſatisfied from him whether he might rely upon my Lord for ſo much Money, <hi>Evers</hi> told him he might be ſure to have the Money, and that there was enough in <hi>Harcourts</hi> and other mens hands for the carrying on that bleſſed deſign, and that he should have it thence. <hi>I</hi> might, my Lords, remember to your Lordships how <hi>Dugdale</hi> does particularly ſwear concerning another diſcourſe he had afterwards with my Lord. That my Lord complained of the great loſſes that had been ſuſtained by him and his friends for the King, how in particular my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Father had loſt 30000 <hi>l.</hi> and what reſentments my Lord had of it; he ſaid that places of profit were rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thoſe that diſſerted the King, and were Rebels and Traytors, than on thoſe that did him faithful Service; and what does he conclude from thence? He is very angry with the King, and does ſay that next to the Cauſe of Religion (which was the ſtrongeſt motive with him to take away the Kings Life) the Kings ingratitude to his Loyal Subjects was that which did moſt offend him.</p>
               <p>I shall not trouble your Lordships with other particular matters which were to ſerve as incouragements to the Deſign, as that there was to be a Pardon from the Pope; that my Lord did write a Letter to <hi>Evers,</hi> which was shewn to <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> wherein he ſays, That things did ſucceed very well abroad, and he hoped they would do ſo at home. I shall only obſerve that <hi>Dugdales</hi> Evidence, as to my Lords damnable Deſign of killing the King, is poſitive and full. And if this be to be believed (as I hope we shall shew there is no reaſon but it should
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:105168:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be) then here ſurely is one ſufficient Witneſs to prove my Lord guilty of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Treaſon.</p>
               <p>My Lords, The next Witneſs we called for againſt my Lord was Dr. <hi>Oats;</hi> and I think Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> is not only poſitive, but he is poſitive in that which moſt certainly will amount to an Overt Act, nay I think to more Overt Acts than one. The Doctor tells your Lordships, That having been at St. <hi>Omers</hi> and in <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſaw ſeveral Letters that were ſubſcribed <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford;</hi> he did not then know my Lords Hand, but he ſaw the Letters, and he tells you the effect of thoſe Letters. And I remember in one of them there is this Expreſſion, That my Lord (the Priſoner at the Bar) does give Aſſurance to the Fathers that he is very zealous and ready to do them ſervice.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> tells you, my Lords, That afterwards coming into <hi>England,</hi> my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did write a Letter, I think it was to his Son, but ſure I am the Doctor ſaid, he had the carriage of it to the Poſt-houſe, that he ſaw my Lord write it, he read the ſuperſcription, and he ſwears that the Hand which writ that Letter was the Hand which ſubſcribed to all the former. And ſo then joyning the one to the other it amounts to as good an Evidence as if he had known my Lords Hand from the beginning.</p>
               <p>But that which comes home to my Lord, is that which Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> ſaw, and that which Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> heard; and they are theſe particulars which I now mention.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaw a Commiſſion directed to my Lord to be Pay-maſter of the Army, he ſaw it delivered to my Lords own Hand and my Lord accepted it. Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> read the Commiſſion, and he tells you by whom it was ſigned <hi>Johannes Paulus Oliva,</hi> a perſon ſubſtituted by the Pope to iſſue out Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he tells you the Contents of it, and of this he ſwears he was an Ocular Witneſs.</p>
               <p>He tells you of another Matter he heard my Lord ſay, as conſiderable as the other, That when my Lord had received the Commiſſion, my Lord declared that he was to go down into <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> where he was to put things in readineſs. What were thoſe things? He had now a Commiſſion by vertue of which in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and the other places, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was to prepare and gather Monies for that Army which he was to pay. So much Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> doth ſwear he heard from my Lords own mouth.</p>
               <p>But there is one thing further which I had almoſt forgot. He doth ſwear that my Lord was privy to, and approved of, the Matter of killing of the King. For he doth ſwear he did hear my Lord ſay at that time, <hi>He hoped before he returned, Honeſt William</hi> (who was <hi>Grove</hi> that was executed for this Attempt) <hi>would have done the buſineſs.</hi> And what that buſineſs was every
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:105168:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man who hath heard of <hi>Groves</hi> Treaſon muſt needs underſtand.</p>
               <p>There is but one thing more that I remember of Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Your Lordships that have a better advantage to write than we, who are crowded together, may have taken Notes of more; but this one thing I do obſerve, Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> doth expreſly ſwear, that my Lord bore a very ill mind towards his Majeſty; for my Lord did in his hearing complain, <hi>That the King had deceived them a great while, and that they would bear with him no longer, he ſhould deceive them no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, Our third Witneſs was Mr. <hi>Turbervill,</hi> who doth give you an account, that he being firſt ſent to <hi>Doway,</hi> and intended to be entred there in one of the Societies, (he was ſent by my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> and my Lady <hi>Powis,</hi> and ſome of his Relations of that Religion, for that purpoſe) he did not like the Company, he was not pleaſed with the Exerciſes of that Religion, and that with much difficulty he eſcaped thence and came for <hi>England:</hi> But finding he was not well look'd upon here, nor well received by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, he went over to <hi>France.</hi> That being at <hi>Paris</hi> he came into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the three Fathers I named before, Father <hi>Sherborn,</hi> Father <hi>Nelſon,</hi> and Father <hi>Turbervill,</hi> the laſt whereof he tells you was his own Brother. That by the means of theſe Prieſts he was brought acquainted with my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> and doubtleſs they were able to make him intimately acquainted with my Lord. And it did prove ſo; for he tells you, after ſome time, that in a lower Room of my Lords Lodging my Lord propoſed to him the buſineſs of killing the King. That he did not at all like it, was very unwilling to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, but my Lord bid him conſider of it, and that he should give him his Anſwer at <hi>Diep,</hi> having enjoyned him ſecrecy; but my Lord after ſent him word he would go by <hi>Calice;</hi> and the Witneſs afterwards went into <hi>England,</hi> and from thence into the <hi>French</hi> Army. And this is the ſubſtance of what <hi>Turbervill</hi> depoſeth.</p>
               <p>And, my Lords, I think it will not be doubted by any man that will conſider theſe three mens Teſtimonies, but that here are two Witneſſes, if not more, to prove my Lord Guilty of Treaſon.</p>
               <p>But my Lord has been pleaſed againſt them to make ſeveral Objections; ſome have been by Witneſſes which he hath produced to incounter the Proofs that we have offered; and ſome of them have been by Obſervations that he hath made upon what hath been ſaid by our Witneſſes and his. I will keep to Order as much as I can not confound the Order and Method of his Defence.</p>
               <p>The Witneſſes he firſt brought were againſt <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and of them his Lordship was pleaſed to begin with his Daughter, the Lady <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and his Niece Mrs. <hi>Howard.</hi> Your Lordships, I preſume, are pleaſed to obſerve what they were called to. They did teſtifie, that, being at
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:105168:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s Tryal, they did hear <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwear (ſays my Lady <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter)</hi> that my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was to come down into <hi>Staffordſhire</hi> in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was then to receive Orders from my Lord, and he ſwore (as she was pleaſed to ſay) that there was a Conſult in <hi>Auguſt</hi> at <hi>Tixall,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was there preſent. Mrs. <hi>Howard,</hi> for I put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was pleaſed to ſay that she was preſent at that Tryal, and there <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwore my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did come down in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> and that my Lord was at the Conſult in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, I will not make Objections neither to the Religion of theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor to the Relation to my Lord, though thoſe be matters that are to be conſidered. But that which I shall obſerve to your Lordships, is this, That they do not agree one with another; For my Lady <hi>Wincheſter</hi> ſays, <hi>Dugdale</hi> did ſwear that my Lord was to come down in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi> ſays, that he ſwore he did come down then. Now there is a great difference betwixt ſwearing an intention that a man was to come down, and ſwearing the very Act that he did come down at that time. By which your Lordships may obſerve how hard a matter it is for Witneſſes that are preſent at a Tryal (eſpecially at a Tryal which did not directly, though it might in conſequence concern another Perſon of their Relation) to take notice exactly of things.</p>
               <p>And truly, my Lords, theſe Ladies being of that Religion might have ſo much concern upon them for Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> the Popish Phyſician, and in him for other their friends of that party, that they might not have ſo much liberty of thought as to obſerve exactly all circumſtances ſworn to by the Witneſſes, and therefore it is no great matter if they are miſtaken in them. But I believe if any one do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Print (though it be no Evidence nor offer'd as ſuch) he will find no ſuch thing was at that time ſworn, for it is not ſo printed, and thoſe that took notes did not underſtand it ſo.</p>
               <p>My Lords, The next Witneſs my Lord is pleaſed to bring is his Servant <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe;</hi> and what is it that he teſtifieth? He ſaith, that he was with my Lord the whole time that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was in my Lords Chamber, and he doth not remember that ever <hi>Dugdale</hi> was there but once, and he doth not remember that ever my Lord bid him go out of the Room.</p>
               <p>My Lords, it is a very hard matter for a man to come thus in the Negative, to remember how often <hi>Dugdale</hi> was there, eſpecially there being no more occaſion to take notice of it then, than here appears to be, and that after ſo long a time. And it is a very hard matter for a Servant to gain Credit, by ſaying his Maſter never bid him go out of the Room in his life. Theſe things may be done or ſaid, and yet eſcape the memory of a Servant of more Age and of leſs inclination to favour his Maſter then this perſon appears to be of and to have. Therefore I think there will be but a very ſmall matter made of what he ſaid, no force at all in it, and I believe your Lordships will give very little regard to it, but rather believe
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:105168:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe Witneſſes that ſwear poſitively, that they have ſeen him with my Lord and ſpeak to a familiarity at that time between them. This young man <hi>Furneſe</hi> was my Lords Servant, and of his Religion; and it is conſiderable whether we have not reaſon to be afraid that more than ordinary Practice has been uſed to prepare Evidence on my Lords behalf, which I shall have occaſion to ſpeak to when I come to the other Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>His next Witneſs, my Lords, was his Boy <hi>George Leigh,</hi> who is Fifteen years of Age now, and was Eight years old when he came to my Lord Seven years ago. And he atteſts the ſame thing, and to the ſame purpoſe with the other. And I think I may leave him with the ſame Anſwer, for we are nothing more concerned with him than we were with the other. Only one thing I would obſerve, to shew that his Memory was imperfect, he doth not remember that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was with my Lord at all that day, which my Lord himſelf doth acknowledge he was, and the other Witneſs agrees. So that there cannot be any great weight laid upon what he ſaith.</p>
               <p>My Lords next Witneſs was <hi>Thomas Sawyer,</hi> and he is one of my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Servants, that I deſire to obſerve of him firſt. And what does he ſay? He ſaith, That <hi>Dugdale</hi> went away for Debt. The contrary to which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently proved, for we, by our Witneſſes, made it manifeſt, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> went away for the matter of the Plot; the fear and dread he was in upon that ſcore: and the circumſtance of his being apprehended by the Watch at Night in his Flight, and how he was put to take the Oaths, do manifeſtly prove this. But he ſays another thing, which I deſire may have no weight with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> should threaten, that becauſe my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> would not own him for his Servant, he would be revenged of him. Truly, if my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> were here to be tried, it would have ſome weight. But to think if it were true, that he had ſo ſworn, that therefore he would be ſo wicked as to do miſchief to another man, that he would be revenged of every man of that Religion, or of every man that came to my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe; That cannot be imagined. So I cannot ſee what great ſtreſs, my Lords, the Priſoner can lay upon it, as to the preſent Tryal, which concerns my Lord <hi>Stafford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, My Lords, I deſire to obſerve, that he ſays further, That when <hi>Dugdale</hi> went away there was a diſcourſe of a Plot; (this he helps out <hi>Dugdale</hi> in;) and that there was a diſcourſe of the killing of a Juſtice of Peace. So that certainly it does shew, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was apprehenſive of the Plot. And as to that which he is pleaſed to ſay, That <hi>Dugdale</hi> should deny his knowledge of the Plot, and take Drink, and with Execrations forſwear it; it will be no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Objection at all. For I shall have occaſion to shew hereafter, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> at that time was very far from revealing the Plot, he had been ſo long ingaged in, he was in apprehenſion of the danger of his own life, and <hi>Southall</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:105168:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tells you how and when he revealed it, and by what inducements he was prevailed upon to do it.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs my Lord called was <hi>Philips,</hi> the Miniſter of <hi>Tixal;</hi> and truly all that I can accuſe him of, is, want of Memory, and that is no fault in a man, that perhaps is very ſtudious and careful in his Imployment as I hope he is. He tells you, that whereas <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwore at a former Tryal, that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> with the death of a Juſtice of Peace of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on the <hi>Munday,</hi> that he did not acquaint him with it, that is, he does not remember it, for no man that ſwears a Negative, can ſwear more. But whether Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> Evidence be of any conſequence to us, we ſubmit to your Lordships conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when we oppoſe to his want of Memory, two Witneſſes that ſwear he was by when this News was told; and we are told likewiſe, as a confirmation of that, by two Gentlemen of Quality, that the report of ſuch a thing was ſpread abroad all over that Country; before it was poſſible for it to come by the way of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Intelligence, whether therefore what Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> teſtifies proceeds from any other cauſe, than want of memory in Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> I muſt leave to your Lordships conſideration.</p>
               <p>But this I would obſerve to your Lordships, that when Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> was asked by my Lord, whether or no <hi>Dugdale</hi> were a perſon likely to perjure himſelf, he could not ſay ſo: Nay, being asked of what Reputation he was of, he ſaid, by ſome, he was very well ſpoken of, by ſome but indifferently; but I do not remember, that he ſaid, he was ill ſpoken of by any. So I think Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> has rather advanced than prejudiced Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Reputation and Credit.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I think I may lightly paſs over the three Juſtices of Peace that were brought to give an Account of <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s behaviour before them, and not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them diſtinctly, becauſe they ſwear all to the ſame purpoſe, That Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> was apprehended upon ſuſpition of the Plot, that he took the Oaths, that he was invited and urged by them to make a diſcovery of the Plot, which he then denied to have any knowledge of: For all this will be anſwered, when we come to re-mind Your Lordships of Mr. <hi>Southall</hi>'s Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>His Lordship was pleaſed in the next place, to offer to prove <hi>Dugdale</hi> an ill Man, by endeavouring to ſuborn Witneſſes: And in the firſt place he called <hi>Robinſon,</hi> who teſtified a very unlikely thing, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> should call him in the Street, and bring him to an Houſe, and offer him Money to ſwear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Lord <hi>Stafford;</hi> which Money he had in an Handkerchief, but did not tell him what particulars he should ſwear to: Nay, and this after he had told him he could ſwear nothing. And it does not appear, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> had any manner of knowledge of him, or that this Gentleman, <hi>Robinſon</hi> had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of my Lord <hi>Stafford:</hi> So that it was a very rash and preſumptuous thing, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> should attempt a man that he knew not, and a very imprudent thing,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:105168:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he should ſuborn a Witneſs, to ſwear againſt a man that the Witneſs to be ſuborned did not know. But I shall ſay no more of him, becauſe I think upon the Account that has been given of him by a Noble Earl of this Houſe, and an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Member of the Houſe of Commons, if he had ſaid things in themſelves probable, he deſerves not in the leaſt to be believed.</p>
               <p>My Lords, next Witneſs upon the ſame Head of Subornation was one <hi>Morral,</hi> a poor Barber; and what ſays he? He teſtifies that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> did offer him 50 <hi>l.</hi> to ſwear againſt Sir <hi>James Symons</hi> and ſome others. My Lords, whether this be probable or no, we muſt leave to your Lordships. We have called Witneſſes that prove him a man of no Reputation, one that runs up and down the Countrey, a kind of Vagabond, and I think, (upon the Endeavours that have been proved to have been uſed as to others) it is no very hard matter to bring a man of his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſay as much as he hath done.</p>
               <p>The next Witneſs is <hi>Samuel Holt</hi> the Blackſmith; and he tells ſuch a Story, that if it were true, would be ſome Diſparagement to <hi>Dugdale,</hi> and what is that? He ſays that <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſent a Man and a Horſe for him, to bring him to the <hi>Star</hi> in <hi>Stafford;</hi> and there offer'd him 40 <hi>l.</hi> to ſwear that one <hi>Moore</hi> carried away <hi>Evers.</hi> My Lords, how this Story comes in I cannot imagine, why Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> should bear any ill will to <hi>Moore,</hi> or what should induce him to intice this man to ſwear againſt <hi>Moore,</hi> or what elſe was in it, it doth not appear. But no matter what it is for; we prove againſt this man by two Witneſſes, <hi>Rawlins</hi> and <hi>Lander.</hi> By the Firſt, that he is a man of ill Reputation, very zealous to ſupport the Plot, and cry down Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> ſaying, that he was a Rogue and all they were Rogues that took part with him. And by the other Witneſs <hi>Lander,</hi> that <hi>Holt</hi> did make an Aſſault upon him, and would have killed him for being ready to appear againſt my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> at his intended Tryal. So that he is a man that has more Zeal than Honeſty. Zeal in no good matter, namely to hinder the Truth from coming out againſt my Lord <hi>Aſton;</hi> and therefore we have little reaſon to wonder: Nay, all the reaſon in the world to believe, that he ſays that which is untrue about Mr. <hi>Dugdale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, There was another Witneſs, Mr. <hi>Lydcott,</hi> that ſaid, he was a Fellow of <hi>King's Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> He has offered no proofs that he was ſo; and truly it is very improbable he should be ſo: For I hope Fellowships in the Univerſity, eſpecially in one of the chief Colledges (as this is) are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon more deſerving, and leſs ſuſpitious Perſons than he appears to be: A Man that owns himſelf the continual Companion and Secretary of one ſo famous in the Popish Party as my Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> is: A Man that pretends he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of his Company; and a man that owns, that two years ſince, he was taking of Notes at a Tryal for this Plot, not only for his own curioſity, but for the ſervice of his Lord, who was concerned in the Accuſation. That this Man should be a Fellow of <hi>King's Colledge,</hi> ſeems ſtrange, and till it be better proved
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:105168:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will hardly be believed; nor will he deſerve any Credit. It is true, he doth acknowledge himſelf a Proteſtant, and to be of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated as he ſays a Presbyterian; but when he was asked when he received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment laſt, I do not remember, that he gave your Lordships any Anſwer.</p>
               <p>This Witneſs ſays, that he was at the Tryal of the Five Jeſuites; and there <hi>Dugdale</hi> did ſwear, that he gave notice to Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sambidge</hi> of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Death: And this they would make to be a great Fault in <hi>Dugdale,</hi> becauſe neither <hi>Philips</hi> nor <hi>Sambidge</hi> remember it. Now whether <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſwore true in that or no, does not depend upon <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s own Credit alone; but you have heard other Witneſſes have made it appear, that he did ſwear true: So that we need not ſay any thing more to this Witneſs, nor to <hi>Gifford,</hi> who teſtifies to the ſame purpoſe; becauſe that point, as to the report of the death of the Juſtice of Peace is by other Witneſſes clearly proved.</p>
               <p>And as for Mr. <hi>Sambidge,</hi> I do not wonder much, that he should ſay, he did not hear it, becauſe he could hardly hear what was ſaid to him by the Court, or any of the Officers ſet near him on purpoſe. But, My Lords, I deſire your Lordships to take notice, that he was a very angry Witneſs; he ſaid, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had a Controverſie with <hi>Dugdale,</hi> that <hi>Dugdale</hi> had cited him into <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> Court, and had there a Suit againſt him for Defamation; and he ſaid that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Dugdale,</hi> which, unleſs better proved, muſt needs make <hi>Sambidge</hi> much ſuſpected: He ſaid, that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was the wickedeſt Man on Earth; but what proof he offer'd of that, or whether he did inſtance in any one particular, I leave it to your Lordships Memories.</p>
               <p>My Lords, There is another Proof relating to Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> not out of the mouth of a Witneſs, but out of a Paper, which I deſire to give an Anſwer to. It was an Objection, the Priſoner at the Bar was pleaſed to make to <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Information, taken the 24. of <hi>December</hi> 1678. before the Juſtices in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, wherein he had ſaid to this purpoſe; Preſently after one <hi>Howard,</hi> Almoner to the Queen, went over, he was told by <hi>George Hobſon,</hi> that there was a Deſign, &amp;c. This, ſaith my Lord, is moſt impoſſible to be true: For you ſay, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Almoner was gone away, <hi>Hobſon</hi> told you this, whereas <hi>Hobſon</hi> went away with the Almoner; and he came not to live with my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> till many years afterwards.</p>
               <p>This my Lord is pleaſed to offer as a falſification of <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Teſtimony; but, my Lords, I do deſire to obſerve that this is an Information taken before two Juſtices of Peace in the Country; and if you look upon it, you will ſee it was written by a Country Clerk, and not very skilfully done. 'T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s rather short Notes of an Examination, than a compleat Examination. And your Lordships will pleaſe likewiſe to obſerve, that this is not really an Expreſſion that is clear one way or th'other, but capable of two Senſes, that is to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either it may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>Hobſon</hi> told him there was a Deſign ever ſince the Almoner <hi>Howard</hi> went
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:105168:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
away; or it may import <hi>Hobſon</hi> told him preſently after the Almoner went away that there was a Deſign. Read but the words with a different Comma, and it makes the Senſe one way or t'other. Now it is plain <hi>Dugdale</hi> could not intend that <hi>Hobſon</hi> told him ſo as ſoon as the Almoner went away, becauſe <hi>Hobſon</hi> went away with the Almoner. And it was better to his purpoſe, that <hi>Hobſon</hi> should tell him ſo after his return than before, for that shews the Deſign had been long a carrying on.</p>
               <p>Therefore it being a doubtful Expreſſion that may refer either to the Time he told it to him, or to the Matter he told him of, and being taken in the latter Senſe, the Objection faileth: I think this Matter can have no weight at all in it to falſifie a poſitive Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>My Lords, the next Witneſs we did call, and which was objected againſt by my Lord was Dr. <hi>Oats;</hi> and truly I muſt obſerve, that his Lordship was not pleaſed to call any one Witneſs materially to falſifie Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> his Teſtimony; and I muſt likewiſe obſerve, that Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> is in the material part of his Evidence ſupported by other Evidence.</p>
               <p>When Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> gave Evidence at former Tryals, it was the common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the men of that Religion, that Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> had never been in <hi>Spain,</hi> nor had ever any Credit with the Prieſts or Jeſuits, but was a mean contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible perſon, and that all he ſaid was improbable. But now your Lordships have heard that Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> even by the Teſtimony of <hi>Dennis</hi> a Popish Prieſt (that is ſo to this day) was in <hi>Spain,</hi> was according to what he ſaith, brought up in the Colledge of the Jeſuits, that he was in ſuch eſteem there, that the Archbishop of <hi>Tuam</hi> commended him very much in the preſence of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> and ſpoke of what expectation there was of him. So that <hi>Dennis</hi> the Prieſt doth ſupport Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> in ſome parts of his Evidence. I do not ſpeak of that part of it which concerns this particular Lord, but of his Teſtimony touching the general Plot.</p>
               <p>There is another thing wherein Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> is ſupported by another Witneſs, and that is the Eſteem and Intimacy he had with the Jeſuits. For Mr. <hi>Jeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſwears, that Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> was a man in eſteem among them, that he was at <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Chamber, and had diſcourſe with <hi>Ireland,</hi> and did appear to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently imployed by them. And I take theſe two Witneſſes to be a great ſupport to Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> as to the General Matters which he evidenceth of the Plot.</p>
               <p>What now doth my Lord object againſt Dr. <hi>Oats?</hi> He call'd no Witneſſes againſt him, but only an Honourable Earl of this Houſe, I think I may name him, the Earl of <hi>Berkely:</hi> And that which his Lordship was pleaſed to teſtifie againſt him was,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> That being examined at the Houſe of Lords after he had given a long Evidence againſt many perſons, he was asked this Queſtion, whether there
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:105168:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were any more Perſons of Quality he could ſpeak againſt, or could accuſe, and he ſaid no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, your Lordships will be pleaſed to obſerve, that this was after he had accuſed my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> my Lord was ſecured in the <hi>Tower</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that upon Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> his Teſtimony, and ſo he could not exclude this Lord. But that which it is brought for (I ſuppoſe) is to make him a perſon of no Credit; For after he had ſaid this, he proceeded to an Accuſation of the Queen. My Lords, I humbly conceive this may receive a very fair Anſwer. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, my Lords, I appeal to your Lordships Memories (for, I think, the Matter was before you all, or at leaſtwiſe before ſome of your Lordships) that the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> made of the Queen was not poſitive, nor of his own certain knowledge, but Words which he heard ſpoken in a Room in which he was not himſelf, but coming in afterwards, he ſaw the Queen was there. So it was not poſitive, but circumſtantial proof, and queſtionable whether what he teſtified would amount to the proof of one Witneſs.</p>
               <p>And I muſt obſerve in the ſecond place, it might not be ſo clear to Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> whether the Queen were a Perſon capable of an Accuſation, ſo as to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded criminally againſt, the King and the Queen are to ſome purpoſes but one Perſon in Law. 'Tis true, ſome Queens have been tryed for Treaſon; but whether Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> underſtood that She might be brought to a Tryal may be a Queſtion.</p>
               <p>But, that which I rely upon as an Anſwer, and which I deſire may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is, that Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> had given an Accompt of a great many perſons, and a great many things he had ſworn againſt ſeveral perſons, ſome of which were executed, ſome to be tryed, and his <hi>Narrative</hi> againſt them, and of the whole Plot conſiſted of a great number of particulars. Here is a Queſtion comes to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor on a ſudden, <hi>Have you any more to ſay, or can you ſpeak againſt any other?</hi> 'Tis poſſible a man that had ſaid ſo much, and of ſo many, might not upon an inſtant recollect whether he had ſaid all, or againſt all that he could ſay: Nay, 'tit eaſily to be imagined he could not on a ſudden comprehend all he had ſaid or could ſay. Therefore that the Anſwer of a man to ſuch a Queſtion put ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to him, having ſo much in his mind, and having ſaid ſo much, should be taken ſo very ſtrictly, and to hold him as perjured, becauſe he did not at that inſtant time remember this particular of the Queen, I think is a ſevere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>His Lordship is pleaſed further to object againſt Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> that he is of no Credit; why? Becauſe he went to be of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, and ſo was of that Religion which is Idolatry: I ſuppoſe his Lordship will not call that Religion Idolatry at another time, and in another place; but it ſerves his Lordship upon this particular Occaſion, to call it ſo; but ſuppoſe Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> did, out of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, or for want of being well grounded in his own, turn to another Religion,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:105168:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he is not the firſt man that hath done ſo: There have been Men of great Fame in our Church, and of great Learning too, that have changed their Religion more than once. I think he that knew that Famous Man Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> could not but know he was firſt a Proteſtant, and afterwards a Papiſt, and afterwards a Proteſtant again: So that unleſs my Lord could accuſe the Doctor of ſome great Crime, or Immorality, it will be hard, that the matter of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Religion, should hurt his Teſtimony. I am ſure, it was happy for us he did change; without that, we had not had the firſt knowledge of the Plot, nor of many particulars which he could not come to know but by occaſion of that Change.</p>
               <p>My Lord was pleaſed to object, that the Doctor was a man ſubject to Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and he brought in the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> to ſpeak of ſome hot Words that paſſed between them. My Lords, I will allow the Doctor to be a Man of Paſſion: Nay, if my Lord pleaſe, a Man that is not of the deepeſt reach; but your Lordships will obſerve, that Paſſionate Men are not often malicious; and that a Man who is not of a deep Judgment, could never have contrived and invented a Narrative conſiſting of ſo many particulars, and they ſo coherent, if they were falſe: And if his Narrative be not true, he muſt be indued with more Subtilty and wicked Policy, than upon Tryal we can find in him: So that what my Lord hath objected as to his Infirmities, is no diminution to the truth of what he ſays, but rather a Confirmation of it.</p>
               <p>My Lords, The laſt Witneſs whom my Lord endeavoured to impeach is Mr. <hi>Turbervill;</hi> and againſt him my Lord thinks he hath a great advantage: But, my Lords, by that time I have re-minded your Lordships of what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, and what was before proved in Anſwer to my Lord's Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> will ſtand as clear in this Court, as any of the former Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Your Lordships will be pleaſed to take Notice, That Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> was at the beginning, when he came to the Houſe of Commons, a little uncertain, as to matter of Time: For when he had made in his Affidavit, the times to be (73) and (76) he craved leave to alter it to (72) and (75.) Surely, my Lords, this will be far from being any Imputation to Mr. <hi>Turbervill;</hi> becauſe, Firſt, he gives the Reaſon how he came afterwards to underſtand the Time bettter, by viewing his Papers and Letters; he likewiſe gives you an Account, and ſo did Sir <hi>William Poultney,</hi> when he did this, the next Morning, before any Man in the World had queſtioned him upon it: So that it shews the Man's Care and Conſcience both, when he is ſo careful, even in matters of the ſmalleſt Moment to ſet things right.</p>
               <p>There is no Man that knows the Practice of the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> but knows, that for a Man to mend his Anſwer after it is ſworn in a point of Time, or other Circumſtance, is no diſparagement to him: Nay, to do it before the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:105168:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other Party did except or take notice of it, is no Objection, but rather a Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him: And your Lordships will be pleaſed to take notice, that one of the times rectified, is of 7 or 8 years, the other of 4 years ſtanding. And I do not think the worſe of a Witneſs that is not poſitive, in a time, when that time is ſo far elapſed.</p>
               <p>The next matter is, That this man was never with my Lord; how was that proved, for 'tis a Negative? Why, my Lord is pleaſed to call his own Servants, <hi>Furneſe</hi> and the Boy <hi>Leigh,</hi> and what ſay they? they never ſaw any ſuch man. My Lords, I deſire your Lordships to obſerve, That Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by greater Confidents than either of theſe Servants. Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> came in the company of the Prieſts, and you hear the Boy deny that he knew <hi>Anthony Turbervill,</hi> but not that he knew Father <hi>Turbervill,</hi> nor doth my Lord himſelf deny it, nor doth either Maſter or Man deny my Lords correſpondency with the other two Fathers. And it might be very eaſie for Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> to come in the company of the Prieſts, and the Boy not take particular notice of him. And 'tis as little an Objection what my Lord ſays, that <hi>Turbervill</hi> himſelf ſaid he did not know the Boy; how many are there that come to the Houſes of another; and unleſs they Lodge there or dine there often, do not remember the Servants of the Houſe: And 'tis no greater an Objection, to ſay, the Servants did not know him: The Prieſts they knew him; they were his Guides; they were the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt to gain him Admittance, not only into my Lord's Houſe, but into my Lord's Heart.</p>
               <p>My Lords, Your Lordships will be pleaſed likewiſe to obſerve, They have alſo gone about in very little matters, to diſprove Mr. <hi>Turbervill,</hi> as that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſays, he was not well uſed by my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> and his Lady, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Doway;</hi> that he was very well uſed; and as one Witneſs (I think <hi>Minhead)</hi> ſays, he was permitted to lie in a Room near my Lord's Chamber. My Lords, Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> does not pretend to ſay, that my Lord <hi>Powis</hi> shut him out of doors; but what Reproaches or unkind Words might paſs between them in private, <hi>Minhead</hi> might not hear: So that to ſay, that he lay in my Lord's Houſe, is no Anſwer to this Matter. And for the other Witneſs (his Brother) that ſpeaks of his Kindreds being kind to him, that, under favour, does not at all diſprove him; for, what was the kindneſs? His Brother and Siſter were ſo kind as to give him Seven Pounds never to ſee him more; a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when a younger Brother lies upon a Family, that the trouble of his ſtay there is redeemed at the price of Seven Pound. This was a very great kindneſs, a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs indeed that one would ſcarce deny to a Stranger, if in Poverty. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the leaſt matters I can remember, becauſe I would have nothing ſtick with your Lordships.</p>
               <p>Then Secretary <hi>Lydcott</hi> (the Fellow of <hi>Kings Colledge)</hi> was called again; but indeed, my Lords, he was ſo out in his Arithmetick, ſo miſtaken in the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:105168:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Year; and uſed the New Stile (the <hi>Romiſh)</hi> ſo much more than ours, that it makes me ſuſpect he is not ſo great a Proteſtant as he pretends to be. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us his Book, which he was not then prepared to produce; but becauſe we do not hear of him, nor of his Book ſince, we ſay no more of him.</p>
               <p>My Lords, <hi>John Porter</hi> my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Butler comes next, and what does he tell your Lordships? Why, that Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> came not to <hi>Powis</hi>'s Houſe (it ſeems he did not appear there) but that he came to a Victualling Houſe hard by; and he telling <hi>Turbervill</hi> he muſt know ſomething of the Plot, he denied that he knew any thing. To the ſame purpoſe, or rather to leſs, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably, does <hi>Yalden</hi> (the Gentleman of <hi>Grays Inn,</hi> as he calls himſelf) teſtifie, who ſays, that walking in <hi>Grays Inn</hi> Walks, he had diſcourſe with <hi>Turbervill;</hi> and that he then ſwore, there was no Trade good now but that of a Diſcoverer; and damned himſelf becauſe he could make no Diſcovery. Truly, my Lords, this looks in it ſelf to be ſomething prepared for the purpoſe: It is not probable, that a Man that should uſe thoſe horrid Oaths, and should have ſuch a mind to be a Diſcoverer, should diſable himſelf ever to be ſo by ſwearing he knew nothing.</p>
               <p>But I will not only anſwer that matter, with ſaying 'tis improbable; but I shall deſire Your Lordships to remember, that Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> a Gentleman of the ſame Houſe, and of good Reputation, does ſwear, that <hi>Turbervill</hi> did acquaint him, that he could diſcover a conſiderable matter; and this was above a year ſince. And Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> a Member of the Houſe of Commons does confirm it, that he did ſeveral times acquaint him, that he could make an important Diſcovery; and gave him ſeveral reaſons, why he thought not fit to do at that time, becauſe of the Dangers which might ariſe from ſome Great Men; and therefore till he had a more convenient Opportunity, he would not diſcover. But as ſoon as the Parliament ſate, very early he did begin to diſcover: So that I shall oppoſe the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> to the Teſtimony of my Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Butler, and Mr. <hi>Yalden;</hi> the latter of whom, ſpeaks ſo improbably, and of a Diſcourſe half a year ago; whereas Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> ſpeaks of what Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> ſaid above a year ſince, and Mr. <hi>Arnold</hi> of a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er time.</p>
               <p>My Lords, It hath been ſometimes objected, that Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> was a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to my Lord; and it was too great a Truſt to commit to a Stranger; too great a Secret for a Stranger to be acquainted with: My Lord's deſign of the King's Death was too great a matter to lodge with one, with whom my Lord had no more Acquaintance than he had with <hi>Turbervill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Lordships will be pleaſed to obſerve who they were that did intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him, and who probably gave the beſt Character of him: they were the three Prieſts; and I do not wonder when theſe Prieſts had brought my Lord up to ſuch a purpoſe, that they should prevail with his Lordship to give Credit
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:105168:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to, and deal with a Man that was not very unlike in his Circumſtances to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſuch a buſineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For your Lordships will obſerve, he was a man that was very ſtout; for againſt my Lord's reflection upon him as to Cowardiſe in deſerting the Army, Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> hath produced the Certificate of his diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which gives him a very good Character. Beſides, he was a man indigent, and therefore I think there could not be a fitter man choſen for the purpoſe, if he had been ſo void of all Grace as to undertake it. And that Prieſts having gotten a man ſo qualified, as they thought him, were not likely to let ſlip ſuch an opportunity.</p>
               <p>But, My Lords, to come to that which is the ſum of the buſineſs, and which my Lord lays more weight on than all the reſt; and that is the Affidavit which Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> ſwore before the Juſtices of the Peace (which was in effect what he informed the Houſe of Commons) and in that Affidavit, beſides his alteration of Times (which I have ſpoken to already) it is objected that he does ſay that which is manifeſtly untrue: For he ſays my Lord came by the way of <hi>Calice</hi> with Count <hi>Gramont,</hi> neither of which my Lord did do.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I will not mention the Maſter of the Yacht, nor the Witneſſes from the Admiralty which make out that my Lord came from <hi>Diep,</hi> and not from <hi>Calice.</hi> Nor do I deny that my Lord came by himſelf, and not with Count <hi>Gramont,</hi> and therefore 'tis moſt certainly true, that what <hi>Turbervill</hi> ſwore, as to thoſe two particulars, was not true. Yet if your Lordships pleaſe to obſerve the Circumſtances, tho' what he ſwore herein was not true, it will appear a very innocent miſtake.</p>
               <p>For in <hi>Turbervill</hi>'s Affidavit he tells your Lordships, that he came away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my Lord to <hi>Diep,</hi> and came from <hi>Diep</hi> to <hi>England</hi> before my Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> left <hi>Paris.</hi> Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> tells you, afterwards my Lord came from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> with Count <hi>Gramont;</hi> Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> could not poſſibly be thought to ſpeak this of his own knowledge, becauſe he does in the ſame Affidavit tell you too, that he came away before my Lord, and had not his paſſage with him. So that, my Lords, I deſire you would obſerve, it could be no deſign of his to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this of his own knowledge: For if it were, he took a very ill courſe to diſcloſe in the ſame Affidavit that he was abſent, and ſo could not ſpeak of his own knowledge. And, my Lords, ſuppoſe a man did ſwear ſuch a man and he were in ſuch company, and that he came home and left the man there, and that afterwards the man ſaid ſuch and ſuch things in that company, what should I ſay of this Oath? I might well ſay the words of his Oath were not proper, or that he was unweary in expreſſing himſelf; but I could not ſay, nor would any man juſtly be able to ſay he had a deſign to make the World believe he heard him ſay ſo, becauſe he ſwears in the ſame breath he came away before the Words were ſpoken. If Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> had underſtood how ſtrict and nice a man ought to be in expreſſing himſelf in an Affidavit, he would have ſaid (as he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:105168:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had been told) my Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame by <hi>Calice,</hi> and that Count <hi>Gramont</hi> came with him, as he underſtood. 'Tis true he hath not put in thoſe words, but I beſeech you, when the matter it ſelf will bear it, nay, when 'tis moſt apparent that Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> could have no other meaning than to relate what he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by others, and what he could not know himſelf, what corruption, what obliquity can there be in this Oath? All that can be ſaid is, it was not cautiouſly worded; but it does certainly diſcloſe ſo much in it ſelf, that every one that hears it muſt ſay, That he did not take upon himſelf to ſwear it as of his own knowledge, becauſe he tells you he was not there, ſo that it was rather want of knowledge how to expreſs himſelf properly, than any corruption in his Oath, or forſwearing himſelf.</p>
               <p>But ſays my Lord, how should he come to know this? Why Mr. <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> ſaid he had a Letter whereby he knew my Lord would come by the way of <hi>Calice,</hi> but where is that Letter? Is it neceſſary to keep, or does any man almoſt keep Letters of no greater concernment than this, that my Lord writ him word how he would go by the way of <hi>Calice,</hi> and this after five years, and after he was in the Wars, and where I have heard he was taken Priſoner. To be ſure he was much tumbled up and down from place to place. And under all theſe Circumſtances might not ſuch a Letter be loſt? But, my Lords, I beſeech you, are there not ſome Proofs that look much this way, made out by another Witneſs? Does not Mr. <hi>Mort</hi> tell you ſomething of this Nature? Firſt he agrees as to the matter of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord lying about ſuch a Street in <hi>Paris,</hi> he tells you he was with Mr. <hi>Turbervill,</hi> and that he himſelf walked about <hi>Laxenburgh</hi> Houſe whilſt Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> went to ſpeak with that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord: he does ſay he believes his Name was my Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> but he is not poſitive; and the times which he ſpeaks of do agree with what Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth. And there is one thing, which tho' I should not mention upon any other occaſion, becauſe it was but a foolish Joke, yet I shall crave leave to ſpeak of it now. He tells you, That one day, while they were at <hi>Diep</hi> in expectation of my Lords coming, and hearing that he went another way, they had this piece of minute Wit upon it, <hi>Curſed is he that relies upon a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Staff:</hi> whereby he thinks was meant the Name of <hi>Stafford.</hi> So then, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> beſeech you, if <hi>Mort</hi> ſay true, are not here footſteps, and a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereon to ground a belief, That there was a Correſpondence between <hi>Turbervill</hi> and my Lord, and that Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> had an Information that my Lord would come by the way of <hi>Calice.</hi> And one thing more <hi>Mort</hi> ſays, that <hi>Turbervill</hi> told him, if he would make haſte to <hi>Calice,</hi> he might go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with my Lord. And here I would obſerve, how should Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> come to know that my Lord went that way? and how should he tell <hi>Mort</hi> that he might go over with my Lord from <hi>Calice,</hi> unleſs he had receiv'd ſome ſuch Information? Therefore, my Lords, taking into Conſideration what is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:105168:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
confirmed by <hi>Mort,</hi> and taking into Conſideration the whole ſcope of the Affidavit, I cannot ſee that there can be any material Objection againſt Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> for ſaying, That my Lord came by <hi>Calice</hi> in the Company of Count <hi>Gramont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lords, I have done now with the Witneſſes, and I told you as I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long (becauſe I would not trouble you with a double Repetition) what Evidence we have given in contradiction to thoſe Witneſſes which my Lord hath brought in order to defame our Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>But, my Lords, I am to acquaint you, That beſides theſe particular Anſwers, your Lordships have had men of very great Credit brought to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the Reputation of Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Mr. <hi>Turbervill.</hi> As to Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> we have brought men that have known him a great while; one hath ſworn what Opinion even my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> himſelf had of him: for it ſeems he lived with ſo much Credit there, that he would not believe any ill of him. You have heard from other Witneſſes how he did behave himſelf. It was objected ſometimes Tradeſmen were not paid; but what then, can a man pay without Money? I believe there are ſome Lords here, whoſe Stewards are very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men, and yet the Tradeſmen ſuch Lords deal with, are not always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily paid.</p>
               <p>He was, as you obſerve, believed to be in the Plot, and my Lord's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſay he ſeemed much troubled about it, he went away upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and was ſo much concerned, that he burnt his Papers, which I make uſe of for two Purpoſes, The one to shew that he did apprehend he was in great danger; the other to shew what was the Reaſon why the Letters and Papers he ſpeaks of are not now produced, becauſe he looked upon himſelf, and them who were then his Friends, to be in ſuch danger by them, that he burnt them.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I know your Lordships will take notice that there hath been a very good Account given you, how it was that <hi>Dugdale</hi> came to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to make a Diſcovery of the Plot, it was with great difficulty; there were indeed perſuaſions uſed by ſome of his Friends to bring him to it. The Juſtices, as they themſelves have ſworn, endeavoured the ſame thing, but all without ſucceſs. Then the Coroner Mr. <hi>Southall</hi> (who tho' he was no great, yet ſeems to be a very underſtanding man) takes him in hand, and he had the good Fortune to ſucceed. I call it Good, not only for Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> but for the Nation. I shall not trouble your Lordships with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Arguments Mr. <hi>Southall</hi> uſed to him, but 'tis plain (if you believe Mr. <hi>Southall,</hi> whoſe Credit is now ſupported by an Honourable Lord, and by a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Houſe of Commons) that <hi>Dugdale</hi> did at the firſt time that he did make a Diſcovery, depoſe as much in ſubſtance againſt this Lord, as now he does. And from thence I deſire to make one Obſervation, and that is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:105168:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
'Twas impoſſible it could be a Contrivance among the Witneſſes themſelves to depoſe the ſame Crimes againſt this Lord; for Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> never knew Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> till <hi>Dugdale</hi> was brought up, which was long after Doctor <hi>Oats</hi> his Accuſation of this Lord; nor could <hi>Dugdale</hi> know what Evidence <hi>Oats</hi> had given here, for <hi>Dugdale</hi> was a cloſe Priſoner in <hi>Stafford</hi> Gaol before <hi>Oats</hi> accuſed this Lord, and long after. And yet the firſt Evidence <hi>Dugdale</hi> gives againſt this Lord doth in ſubſtance concur with that given by Doctor <hi>Oats.</hi> So that ſince there could be no Intercourſe nor Conference between them, but as much diſtance as from the Priſon Doors in <hi>Staſſord</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> there could be no Contrivance between them for both of them to accuſe this Lord of the ſame Matters. And this I deſire may be looked upon by your Lordships as a Matter of great Weight to ſupport the Credit of the whole Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And <hi>Dugdale</hi> does ſeem to be a perſon of an unqueſtionable Credit, and every one that hears him muſt obſerve, he does give his Evidence with great Mc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and all probability of Truth.</p>
               <p>There is another thing, my Lords, that I would pray your Lordships to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; Theſe Witneſſes, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Doctor <hi>Oats,</hi> do give ſuch an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence as is impoſſible to be given, unleſs it were true; for other Witneſſes when they are put out of the Road, and asked Queſtions they did not expect, are commonly to ſeek, and muſt pump for an Anſwer, and then anſwer with great difficulty and warineſs. But theſe two Witneſſes do not only anſwer with readineſs when you ask them any Queſtions, but what is contained in every new Anſwer doth add a further probability and confirmation to what they ſaid before. And I muſt needs ſay of them, I think it were impoſſible for any men in the World to contrive a Story of ſo many particulars, and ſo conſiſtent in every part of it, and yet the ſame should be falſe; and, which is more, after ſo many Tryals, not one material Circumſtance of what they ſay contradicted by any ſolid proof.</p>
               <p>My Lords, There may be other particulars which I may have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I know not whether I obſerved that my Lord objected that we do not prove him a Papiſt, I hinted ſomething before about his coming to Maſs to my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s at <hi>Tixal,</hi> which is one ſort of proof of his being of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Religion. Beſides his perpetual Converſation with that Party, and his Endeavours to promote their Religion and Deſigns, all which have been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved: I think alſo my Lord deſerted the <hi>Houſe of Peers,</hi> for that he would not take the Teſt appointed by the late Act, your Lordships beſt know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did ſo or no. But, my Lords, let him if he will be a Proteſtant, for this time, let that be ſuppoſed: If he were a Proteſtant, and should be guilty of the Offences proved upon him, he would not deſerve the more Favour from your Lordships.</p>
               <p>My Lord hath been likewiſe pleaſed in further proof of his Innocency to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:105168:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alledge that after the Plot was diſcovered, he had ſeven Poſts time to have eſcaped, and yet never fled. My Lords, 'Tis true, he might have fled, ſo might <hi>Coleman</hi> too, that <hi>Coleman</hi> that left ſo fatal an Evidence againſt himſelf and all his Party under his own hand, and for that had reaſon to believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very Guilty, and ſo might the Jeſuits have eſcaped too, but that they had hopes the Oath of Secreſie and the means they had uſed to conceal their damnable Deſigns would have been a ſufficient Security againſt revealing it. They had that opinion of their Prieſts, and of the Fidelity and Conſtancy of thoſe that had been ſeduced by them, and recommended by them, that they apprehended nothing leſs than a Diſcovery. And thoſe other perſons that were executed did all ſtay about the Town after the Plot was diſcovered, as well as this Lord ſtaid in the Countrey.</p>
               <p>My Lord did very much complain, That our Witneſſes were not poſitive in point of Time, I think <hi>Dugdale</hi> was poſitive enough as to the time of the Offer of 500 <hi>l.</hi> but for other matters he would not confine himſelf to a Month, he talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the latter end of one Month, and the beginning of another, I think he is the more to be believed; for I conceive unleſs a Witneſs hath ſome notorious Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in his memory to ſatisfie him about the certainty of the time (ſuch as was that of the Foot-race as to the time of the Offer of 500 <hi>l.)</hi> it is rather a mark of preſumption than of ſincerity for a Witneſs to be too poſitive as to the time. And is there ſo great a diſtance between the latter end of one Month, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of another, that a Witneſs need to be poſitive as to the very day? but ſays my Lord, you talk of the beginning, it was the 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> ere I came thither; Does not every man count that till the middle of a Month, 'tis the beginning of a Month ſure, in common ſpeech it is ſo. Therefore I look upon that as a matter ſcarce worth the mentioning, I am ſure not worth the ſerious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering.</p>
               <p>But, my Lords, I muſt obſerve thus much, That what my Lord complains of as a fault in our Witneſſes, his own Witneſſes are guilty of. For I appeal to your Lordships, when they came to ſpeak of Times, whether they did not talk at the diſtance of a Month, or Months, and ſometimes of Years, and leſs certain in point of Time than ours.</p>
               <p>But, ſays my Lord, (for I am ſtill anſwering his Objections, and you muſt take them as I find them) here is mention made by Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> of Letters, of many Letters, shew me ſome of thoſe Letters? shew me the Letter you carried to the Poſt-houſe? My Lords, were thoſe Letters written to Dr. <hi>Oats?</hi> Did they belong to him? Or is it poſſible that my Lords Letter delivered by the Doctor to the Poſt-houſe, should now be shewn by the Doctor, or that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters writ to the Superior of the Society of the Jeſuits should be produced by one that was a Novice of that Society? Does Dr. <hi>Oats</hi> talk of any one Letter written to himſelf? You will then, I ſuppoſe, ſee no reaſon to expect thoſe
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:105168:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Letters should be produced by him that were not written to him, and the cuſtody whereof belonged to others.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I muſt obſerve to You, that there have been great Endeavours uſed to Invalidate our Teſtimony, we have had Witneſſes called againſt Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and my Lord hath had that Advantage to do it, which perhaps was never given in any Caſe before, and which I hope will never be again. The Evidence hath been Printed and Published to the World before it hath been given. I ſay not that it was not neceſſary in this Caſe, which was a National Cauſe, and the Cauſe of our Religion; but I do ſay it would not be fit to be done in other Caſes, for the notifying of the Evidence is the way to have it falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and corrupted.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe Advantages, my Lords, I appeal to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Memories what conſiderable contradiction hath been given. It is true ſome Witneſſes to that end have been brought before your Lordships, but thoſe Witneſſes have been rendred incredible, by more credible perſons; and I would deſire your Lordships to obſerve, That tho' my Lord hath failed of proving any Subornation in our Witneſſes, yet we have proved much Subornation endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Agents.</p>
               <p>Your Lordships have the Record againſt <hi>Redding</hi> before you, and what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that hath to the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> every one does remember, and my Lord is mentioned in that Record. And I might likewiſe mention the buſineſs of <hi>Cellier,</hi> and what therein related to the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and I'le name but two Witneſſes more that have been attempted upon this Nature: There was <hi>Wright</hi> the Barber, all the Applications were made to him that could be, Money given, Letters writ, Inſinuations that he was not to Swear, he was but to Write, and that was eaſily done: or if he would be ſo kind to Swear it, he should never come into open Court, only go before a Juſtice of Peace. So that your Lordships will obſerve by what ſteps and degrees men were endeavoured to be Suborned. And then <hi>Launder</hi> tells you what was offered to him to perjure himſelf, how he was brought to <hi>Tixall,</hi> and what endeavours were uſed to make him Swear againſt our Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are plain, both by Records and particular Proofs upon Oath. But, my Lords, leſt we should want proof of all, This very Lord (I pity him for it) hath been ſo unfortunate as to bring that Paper out of his Pocket, which <hi>Wright</hi> ſays he had money to frame, and was to Swear to. It ſeems my Lord had the Command of it, it ſeems to have been prepared for ſuch a good time as This, and the producing of this Paper is as full a Confirmation of this point as can in reaſon be expected.</p>
               <p>My Lords, I have been I fear too long already, and yet I fear, I have omitted as many particulars as I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>My Lords, The Evidence is ſo ſtrong, that I think it admits of no doubt,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:105168:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Offences proved againſt my Lord and the reſt of his Party are ſo foul that they need no aggravation. The Offences are againſt the King, againſt His Sacred Life, againſt the Proteſtant Religion, nay againſt all Proteſtants, for it was for the Extirpation of all Proteſtants out of theſe Three Nations. I mean not of every one that is now ſo, but of every one that would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo, every one amongſt us (if theſe Deſigns had been accomplished) muſt either have turned his Religion, or turned out of his Countrey, or have been burned in it.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Deſign that appears with ſo dreadful a Countenance to Your Lordships, to this great Aſſembly, and to the whole Nation, that it needs not any words I can uſe to make you apprehend it. If the matter be fully proved (as I ſee no reaſon to doubt but that it is) I am ſure your Lordships will do that Juſtice to Your King and Countrey as to give Judgment againſt theſe Offenders, which will not only be a Security to us againſt them, but a Terror to all others againſt comitting the like Offences.</p>

Secondly, He ſays I have proved my ſelf a Papiſt becauſe I have not taken the Teſt. My Lords, the Teſt was ſince I was in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and whether I will take it or not, I do not yet know till it be offered me. The Third is this, That this Letter was in my Pocket which I produced to you, my Lords, I knew nothing what was in it, it was given into my hand as I ſtood here at the Bar. Fourthly, He ſaid <hi>Hobſon</hi> did go out of <hi>England</hi> with the Almoner, he did not ſo. Another thing he ſays, that I ſaid <hi>Oats</hi> was an infamous perſon becauſe he went to a Church that I ſaid was Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, I only ſaid it was ſo adjudged by Act of Parliament. I find, my Lords, theſe things he is miſtaken in, and that, my Lords, made me very willing to put You in mind of them.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, the Learned Perſon that ſpake laſt, hath left very little for me to ſay in the Summing of this Evidence; But becauſe this Noble
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:105168:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lord hath been pleaſed to alledge ſeveral Reaſons, from whence he would infer at leaſt a great improbability that he should be guilty of the Treaſons whereof he ſtands Accuſed, I shall crave your Lordships patience, that I may give Three or Four words in anſwer to thoſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, In the firſt place this Noble Lord was pleaſed to begin, and afterwards to continue his Defence with making proteſtations of his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency; We very well know your Lordships ſit now in the Seat of Juſtice, and whatſoever credit or regard your Lordships pleaſe to give to the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Peer in another Caſe, your Lordships will proceed here only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your Proofs and your Evidence <hi>(ſecundum allegata &amp; probata)</hi> and therefore all we shall ſay to this, is, that we hope our Proofs are ſo clear and evident, as will leave no room to your Lordships to believe this Noble Lords Proteſtations.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, my Lord is pleaſed to alledge, and withal to lay ſome weight upon it, the voluntary ſurrendring of himſelf to Juſtice, and he laid it down as a Rule, that as Flight is an argument of Guilt, ſo the Surrendring of a mans ſelf to the Trial of the Law, is an argument of Innocency.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, We admit the Rule generally to be true; but in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Caſes it may be otherwiſe; for a Man that is not very confident of his own Innocency, may yet be very confident of the ſtrength of his Party; and whether the conſideration of the circumſtances of Affairs, as they then ſtood, and the power and prevalency of the Popish party at that time, might not reaſonably create ſuch a confidence in this Noble Lord, we muſt leave to your Lordships Judgment.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, We do conceive that thoſe Perſons who contrived Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundbury Godfrey</hi>'s Murder, had ſo great Confidence in the favour and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſome of their Party, that they thought themſelves able to out-face Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>And we verily believe, they intended it as an example to deter all Men from medling ſo much as with the taking an Examination concerning this Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Plot.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I deſire to be underſtood aright in this, I lay nothing of the Death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> to the Charge of this Noble Lord, I only uſe it as an Argument of the preſumption of the Popish party at that time.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, In the next place, my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> did obſerve from my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> that in the Tryals of Treaſons we ought very much to guide our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the Nature and Circumſtances of the Fact (the Concomitants and ſubſequents, as he termed them) with Reference to the Perſon accuſed, whether they were likely to induce or deter him from ſuch an Attempt, and here he was pleaſed to raiſe ſome Arguments from the whole courſe of his Life, and did deſire your Lordships to conſider thoſe Circumſtances therein that
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:105168:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might make it improbable or impoſſible, that he should commit a Treaſon of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>He deſired alſo your Lordships to remember that he was deſcended from an Honourable Family, and that his Anceſtors were very worthy and very deſerving Perſons, and ſuch as had often ventured their Lives in defence of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; And here he did likewiſe mention his own Services to the laſt King, and our preſent Soveraign, in the late Wars.</p>
                  <p>It is not my part, nor will I derogate any thing from the Merits of this Noble Lord, much leſs from the Honour of his Family; but in Anſwer to this we shall deſire your Lordships to conſider, that this Noble Lord (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is pleaſed to diſown it at preſent) is notoriouſly known to be a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick (as they call themſelves) and ſuch we conceive we have ſufficiently proved him to be, in the courſe of our Evidence: And as there is nothing in the World ſo much as a miſguided Conſcience that can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the beſt of Men into the worſt of Actions, ſo we think the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of that Religion are ſuch, as are more likely to pervert Men from their Duty and Allegiance, than any other Religion or Perſwaſion whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>And if the Zeal of this Noble Lord did engage him to endeavour the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of that Religion in this Kingdom, we may eaſily believe that his Reaſon did ſuggeſt to him, the means by which it muſt be effected, which could be no other but Blood and Confuſion.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, The laſt thing I shall take notice of, is, what my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> was pleaſed to ſay in General as to the Doctrine of Killing and Depoſing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which his Lordship was pleaſed to call a private Opinion, and not the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But by the way, my Lords, give me leave to obſerve, that this Noble Lord did upon this occaſion fully own (and I much commend his Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity in it) the reality of the Gun Powder Treaſon, ſince we know, how much that Party have endeavoured to render it Incredible; and as length of time hath ſo fully manifeſted the particulars of that Execrable Deſign, that it hath brought ſuch as are of that Perſwaſion to confeſs the truth of it; ſo, we hope, this days Tryal will convince both the Age we live in, and all Poſterity of the Truth and Reality of this preſent Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But to go on with that Point from which I did digreſs, I am not I confeſs much verſed in the Canons and Councils of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but, my Lords, this I know, the moſt famous and celebrated Writers of that Church, eſpecially of the Society of the Jeſuits, have publickly avowed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Doctrine; And we know in all times, when there hath been occaſion to put it in practice, it hath never failed to have been attempted; and we likewiſe know that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Pope have
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:105168:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
always avowed the Acts when they have been done: From all which we might very reaſonably conclude, that it is the Doctrine of that Church ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>But, my Lord is pleaſed to ſay, and admit for Truth, That a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny private Writers do hold the contrary, I believe it to be ſo, but I do alſo believe, that it is the Policy and Artifice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to leave this Point of Doctrine in ſome meaſure undetermined, that ſo they may make uſe of it as the occaſion ſerves; For if it ſucceeds, then it is owned and juſtified, if it miſcarry, then the Doctrine is but a private Opinion, and the Plot but the Practice of particular Perſons that are either deſperate or diſcontented. And I am fully of Opinion, that This Horrid Conſpiracy which is brought this day in Judgment before your Lordships, wants nothing but Succeſs to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize it.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, As to what concerns the Evidence, it hath been ſo fully ſtated to You, and the Objections that were raiſed to invalidate it, ſo well anſwered, that I will not trouble your Lordships with any Repitition of what hath been ſaid already: All we have further to deſire, is, That your Lordships will pleaſe to take our Evidence into your Conſideration, and to do thereupon what shall be agreeable to Juſtice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Maynard.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, as to Matter of Fact I shall ſay nothing but only this (and I wish it may be ſpoken with Gratitude to Almighty God,) that the Diſcovery of this Plot is rather the Work of God than Man. It was firſt his Act in prevailing upon <hi>Oats</hi> to make the Diſcovery; and when he ſtood ſingle almoſt, what came to ſupport his Credit but the Letters of <hi>Coleman,</hi> which were like a Tally to what <hi>Oats</hi> had ſaid, for what <hi>Oats</hi> informs is in a great part made good by his Letters. Then when <hi>Godfrey</hi> was murther'd, how came that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery out, but by the voluntary Confeſſion of one engaged in the whole Plot, I mean <hi>Bedloe?</hi> So that though theſe men had engaged themſelves by wicked Oaths, yet their own Conſciences witneſſing againſt them in themſelves, they could not forbear coming in to teſtifie againſt themſelves. I shall ſay no more, than that we ought to acknowledge the Hand of God in the Diſcovery with great Thankfulneſs; for it is He and He alone that out of his own Grace and Goodneſs hath done it, and thereby preſerved the Life of our Prince to us, and in Him us too.</p>
                  <p>But as to the Matter in Law.</p>
                  <p>My Lord has been pleaſed to mention firſt this, That there is no Overt Act. I wonder that my Lord should be ſo much miſtaken. When it is charged in the Articles, and proved to his Face he received a Commiſſion,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:105168:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Is not that an Overt Act? He is charged in the Articles of Impeachment with Contriving the Death of the King, and being at ſeveral Meetings and Conſults about the King's Death, and H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ing Perſons to Kill the King; And are theſe no Overt Acts? Therefore as to that my Lord is miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, another Exception that is taken, is, That there is no Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I conceive that an Impeachment of the Houſe of Commons is more than an Indictment. And there cannot be any doubt of that, the Impeachment of the Houſe of Commons having always been received and proceeded on by your Lordships.</p>
                  <p>But that which is moſt inſiſted upon, is, That this Charge that is made againſt this Lord was preſented in another Parliament. It is true, but under favour, what is once upon Record in Parliament may at any time afterwards be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded upon. It is a ſudden Objection, but I conceive it hath been done. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in a Caſe of this Nature, when the Life of the King, when our own Lives, and our Nation, and our Religion lies at ſtake, if there were not a Precedent, I hope You would make a Precedent. But under favour, Reaſon is for it, the Charge is before You, the Proof is made, and we pray You will judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Evidence hath been.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, as to theſe Matters of Law, I think they are of ſo little difficulty, that my Lord will not deſire to have Counſel aſſigned him, I am ſure his Counſel will not deſire to ſpeak to them.</p>
                  <p>For this laſt Matter which Mr. Serjeant ſpoke of, and which was firſt named by the Priſoner, I deſire your Lordship to conſider what it is. Says my Lord the Priſoner, there was an Impeachment begun in the Long Parliament, and this is now the Third Parliament in which I am brought to my Tryal. It is very true, there was a General Impeachment in the Long Parliament, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular one was in the laſt, and this Lord was pleaſed to plead in the laſt. It may be he was not ſo well adviſed then as he is now.</p>
                  <p>But my Lords, How can this be a doubt, when your Lordships have reſolv'd, and have ſent it down to the Commons; and it is there entred in their Book, as the Law and Conſtitution of Parliaments, that not only Impeachments but all Judicial proceedings continue from Parliament to Parliament, in the ſame ſtate that they were in at the Riſing of the laſt Parliament.</p>
                  <p>This is now become the Law of Your Houſe, and it is under favour, being ſo, the Law of the Kingdom; and You having thus declared it, and ſent it to the Commons, I hope the Commons had very good reaſon to proceed upon this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment at this time.</p>
                  <p>The next matter is concerning the Overt Acts, I think there are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Overt Acts in proof and ſufficient in the Impeachment. Will any man

Will any deny that the ſending for the Witneſs and offering him money in order to hire him to kill the King is an Overt Act? and (which anſwers to all) will any man deny that the meeting and conſulting of ſeveral men together, about killing the King and changing the Government is an Overt Act.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, Theſe are all Overt Acts, and I cannot but think it was without advice of my Lords Counſel that he made theſe Objections; for indeed theſe ſeveral Overt Acts are laid in the Impeachment as fully as they are made out in proof.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, there is another Objection that my Lord is pleaſed to make, and that is, that there is but one Witneſs to a particular Fact.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. H. Steward.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, What ſay you to that?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Jones.</speaker>
                  <p>That, my Lords, is of little weight, with ſubmiſſion; for our Impeachments, and our Proofs run to this, that my Lord had a Deſign and Intention to deſtroy the King, this was to be done by Force, and this was to be done by ſecret Aſſaſſination. Now if ſeveral Witneſſes come and prove each a diſtinct Act, under this Head of killing the King, it is ſo many Proofs or Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>For, my Lords, if a man shall intend to kill the King, and shall buy a Knife in one County at one time, and ſend for a man out of another County at another time, whom he shall hire to kill the King, and theſe diſtinct Acts are proved by ſeveral Witneſſes, if they concur to the ſame general Treaſon, they are all but parts of that, and ſo are ſo many Witneſſes to the whole. And ſo I am ſure it was reſolved in the Caſe of others of the Conſpirators in the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and before that in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Henry Vane.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>My Lords, in this Caſe here is firſt a Proof, that he accepted a Commiſſion, which I do not uſe as an Act for the levying of War only, but as a Deſign to change the Government and deſtroy the King. Here is meeting and conſulting how to do this wicked Work, I mean, to kill the King, that is another Overt Act; Here is offering money to one of the Witneſſes for that end, that is a third Overt Act; and there is attempting another of them though not with Money yet with Promiſes of Reward in general, that is another Overt Act, all which are to this end, the Killing of the King. And I am ſure of it your Lordships cannot but receive ſatisfaction from my Lords the Judges, that it hath always been ſo held, that though there need Two Witneſſes to prove Treaſon, yet there needs no more than one to one Act, and another to another, if the ſeveral Acts fall under the ſame Head of Treaſon.</p>

                     <hi>Sir</hi> Franc. Winn.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I crave your patience but for a word or two, and this Noble Lord will have little Reaſon to ſay his Objections in point of Law are
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:105168:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of any weight. I confeſs he had ſaid a great thing, if it were true, that the Articles of Impeachment did not alledge an Overt Act; for then indeed they had been appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently defective. But under his pardon, that is not a point of Law but a point of Fact. Let us therefore reſort to the Articles themſelves. In the 2<hi>d</hi> Article it is alledged that he with the reſt did moſt wickedly and traiterouſly agree, conſpire, and reſolve to Impriſon, Depoſe and Murther His Sacred Majeſty, and to deprive Him of his Regal State and Government. And then the ſame Article alledges farther, that they did contrive and conſult to effect the Murther of the King, by Shooting, by Poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by Stabbing. All theſe particulars are expreſſed, ſo that when my Lord ſaid the Articles were therein defective, all we can ſay, is, that he was miſinform'd.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, there was another Exception taken, that this is the Impeachment of another Parliament. I muſt not now repeat how this Point was agreed by both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes at a Conference. But it was then declared upon ſearch of Precedents in all ages, that it was the Law of Parliaments, which is the Law of the Land, that if once an Impeachment by the Houſe of Commons were lodged in the Houſe of Lords, tho' that Parliament were diſſolved, the Impeachment remained in the ſame ſtate. It was the Cauſe of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> who only change their Repreſentatives in a new Parliament. It has been alſo objected, that this Proſecution ought to have been upon an Indictment. As if an Accuſation of the Houſe of Commons, who are the grand Inqueſt of the Nation, were not as effectual to bring Offenders to Juſtice as the finding of a particular Jury. My Lords, I should wonder to hear this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made, were not my Lord to be eaſily excuſed for his knowing the Law no better. None who know any thing in the Law would have urg'd ſuch a thing. His Counſel, I dare ſay, did not ſuggeſt this matter to him.</p>
                  <p>It is true, my Lords, when a Peer comes to be Tried by way of Commiſſion, or in <hi>Parliament</hi> when it is not at the proſecution of the <hi>Commons,</hi> there an Indictment is firſt found in the proper County, and brought up before the Peers by <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and upon that they proceed. But whether the Party be Peer or Commoner, if he be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach'd for any Crimes, ſurely no one can deny, but that by the conſtant uſe of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> the Lords have proceeded to Trial, and have given Judgment thereupon without an Indictment found. So that this Exception will be of no force at all.</p>
                  <p>As for the remaining Objection, that there are not two Witneſſes to prove any one Overt Act, the Kings Perſon would be in no manner of ſafety, if that Doctrine should be once allowed. Conſpiring to kill the King is the Treaſon laid in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, and the ſeveral Overt Acts are ſo many ſeveral Evidences of that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Words themſelves if they ſignifie an intention to do an Act, and expreſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be done <hi>in futuro</hi> are a ſufficient Overt Act, &amp; a legal Evidence of Treaſon. Then we prove by another Witneſs, not words of encouragement only but offers of money, and they are both to the ſame kind of Treaſon tho' not to the ſame Act and at the ſame time. And if there muſt be 2 Witneſſes to every ſingle Act the King of <hi>England</hi> is not only in a far worſe condition than any other Prince, but than any one of his own Subjects, Treaſons may be committed every day with Impunity,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:105168:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and unleſs the Traytors be as great Fools as Villains, he shall never be ſafe from them, nor capable of punishing them.</p>
                  <p>I muſt ſay it, and I ſay it with commiſeration to the Condition of this Noble Lord, that his Exceptions in Law are as weak as the Anſwers he has given to our Evidence. We hope no doubt in Law remains with you, and that we have given your Lordships full ſatisfaction of the reality of the Plot, and a convincing Evidence of the great share which my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> had in it, and we humbly pray your Lordships Juſtice.</p>

If my Lord at the Bar will ſay they have taken Money to ſwear, that is purely a Matter of Fact, which he ought to prove, and that which is ſaid and not proved ought to go for nothing; let him prove his Caſe to be ſo, and then we will give him an Anſwer.</p>

But I deſire your Lordships to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to plead by my Counſel; if not, I ſubmit to you. I confeſs here is a piece of Law that I never heard of before, that the Houſe of Commons and your Lordships at a Conference, have adjudged it to be the Law of Parliaments, that Impeachments shall continue from Parliament to Parliament.

                  <p>My Lords, I do think under favour, if a Priſoner in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Cauſe do deſire Counſel, he muſt not only alledge matter of Law to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:105168:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that Deſire; but that which he doth alledge, muſt be alſo a matter of ſome Doubt to the Court: For if he do alledge matter which in it ſelf is not Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, he shall have no Counſel allowed him. If your Lordships are not ſatisfied that it is the Law of your Houſe, that Proceedings upon Impeachments do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue from Parliament, we cannot anſwer that, it lies in your Lordships breaſts, it is not what we are to argue. becauſe it is a matter that concerns the Law and Rules of Parliaments. Is there, my Lords, any doubt of any other Point that is urged? Is there any doubt of this thing, whether if one Witneſs ſpeak to one point of Fact and another to another upon the ſame ſort of Treaſon, but that theſe be two ſuch Witneſſes as the Law requires? I pray then, my Lords, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the conſequence of that doubt: A man shall talk with twenty Perſons about a Deſign to kill the King in one and the ſame Room one after another, by taking them into a Corner ſingly, and if ten or all twenty come to prove it, here is but one Witneſs to each Diſcourſe. This would be a matter of dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, but I hope will remain no manner of doubt with you, nor is it fit to be argued.</p>
                  <p>As to the Hiring of Witneſſes to Swear, I think that can be no point of Law till it be ſo proved in Fact. Doth his Lordship think, that when His Majeſty out of His Grace and Bounty allows a Maintainance to His Witneſſes, that that is an Objection to their Teſtimony. Doth not every man allow his Witneſſes a a Maintainance, and yet it never was thought a thing to take away their Evidence. It may be every one doth not give ſo large an allowance as the King, becauſe his Dignity is not ſo great. But can it be an Objection to the Houſe of Commons? Have we that are the Proſecutors maintained them? If His Majeſty have been bountiful to His Witneſſes, what is that to this Cauſe of the Commons? If my Lord can prove any thing of Bribery in us, as he has proved for us againſt himſelf, it may be an Objection. But till that Fact be proved, I hope there is no ground for a Queſtion in Law; and if there be no doubt in Law, I hope there will be no need of Counſel.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, We in the Houſe of Commons do never ſuffer any Counſel to tell us what is the Courſe of our Houſe and the Law of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; if your Lordships think fit to allow it, 'tis in your own power, but we who are intruſted with the Management of this Cauſe by the Houſe of Commons have no direction to conſent to ſuch a thing.</p>

But if your Lordships do think that the Points urged by my Lord are not debateable in Law, I have ſo high an Opinion of your Lordships Judgment, and ſuch a mean opinion of my own Talent, that I shall not undertake to Argue <hi>Extempore</hi> in this great Aſſembly, in a Cauſe of ſo high a Nature.</p>

                  <p>Why, if you are provided for it, you are to maintain that by Law every Overt Act ought to be proved by two Witneſſes, if you are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſpeak to it and my Lords will hear you.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>It is true, my Lords, there have been ſome publick Reſolutions concerning that Point, therefore I shall be the warier what I ſay in that; But, my Lords, it is a matter that has been thought of great import one way or other, but I do profeſs at this time I am not able to undertake a Solemn Argument upon that Point.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>No, my Lords, I am not for my own part at preſent, for it is impoſſible we should foreſee what would be the Point, and to apply our ſelves to ſtudy an unforeſeen Caſe before it be agreed, ſtated, and judged worthy of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, cannot be expected from us. I have always obſerved it in the <hi>King's-Bench.</hi> If the Priſoner urge any thing and the Court think it debateable, they firſt agree and ſtate the Caſe, then Aſſign Counſel, whom they do not urge to deliver an Opinion preſently, but give them time to prepare for it.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>VVallop,</hi> it is not believed that this Point is moved, but by your Advice that are of my Lord's Council, and you should be ready to maintain the Advice you give, therefore if you are ſo, ſpeak.

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Truly, my Lords, it is a Point that has, as I ſaid before, received ſome Settlement, but whether ever in this Court or no, I cannot tell.

                  <p>My Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> My Lords, ſince they have been withdrawn, have conſidered of one Point, of that point chiefly which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship did move touching the neceſſity of two Witneſſes to every Overt Act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as Evidence of High Treaſon, that is the point you have deſired Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to ſpeak to, and that is the point your Counſel deſired to know whether it was a doubtful or debateable point before they would argue it, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon my Lords did withdraw to conſider it. And my Lords have directed, that all the Judges that aſſiſt them, and are here in your Lordships preſence and hearing, should deliver their Opinions, whether it be doubtful and diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or no.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then all the Judges conſulted privately together, and afterwards gave their Opinion <hi>Seriatim,</hi> beginning with the Lord Cbief Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs</hi> being abſent.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice North.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I do here deliver my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and I am cleàr in it, That if there be ſeveral Overt Acts or Facts which are Evidences of the ſame Treaſon, if there be one Witneſs to prove one ſuch Overt Act at one time, and another Witneſs to prove another Overt Act at another time, both the Acts being Evidences of the ſame Treaſon, theſe are two ſufficient Witneſſes of that Treaſon,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:105168:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and will maintain an Indictment or an Impeachment of Treaſon. I never knew any doubt made of it in any Inferiour Court of Juſtice, and I have known it often reſolved.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Chief Baron Montague.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, where ever Treaſon is to be proved to every Overt Act, two Witneſſes, as I conceive, are not required. If ſo be there are two Witneſſes to ſeveral Overt Acts conducing to a proof of the ſame Treaſon, I think they are Witneſſes in the Judgment of the Law ſuch as the Statute requires.</p>

                  <p>I am of the ſame Opinion with my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> and my Lord Chief Baron, That if there be ſeveral Overt Acts done at ſeveral times tending to the ſame Treaſon, theſe ſeveral Acts being ſeverally proved by ſeveral credible Witneſſes, though but by one Witneſs at each time to each Act, the ſaid ſeveral Acts being Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the ſame Treaſon; theſe are ſufficient Witneſſes of that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo proved, and will maintain an Indictment or (as I conceive) an Impeachment.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, if ſeveral Witneſſes ſpeak to the ſame kind of Treaſon, although they ſpeak to ſeveral Overt Acts and give Evidence of ſeveral times, the one of them ſpeaking to one time and the other to another time, yet keeping ſtill to the ſame kind of Treaſon, they are ſuch two Witneſſes as are required by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> and this I do take to be the conſtant Opinion of the Courts below.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſtice Dolben.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I am of the ſame Opinion, and I know it hath been many times ſo reſolved, I have been preſent when Sentence hath paſſed upon Perſons by whom the ſame Caſe hath been urged, and it hath been ſo reſolved. And it hath been moved in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and that was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Opinion of the Judges there; particularly in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Henry Vane.</hi> It was upon ſolemn Debate reſolved, and divers times it hath been held, that the ſame Treaſon may be proved by two Witneſſes to ſeveral Overt Acts, though one ſpeak of Words or Actions that were ſpoken or done at one time and in one place, and another ſpeak of Words or Actions at another time and in another place, thoſe are two good Witneſſes in Treaſon within the intent of the Law, and if the Law were otherwiſe 'twere ſcarce poſſible to convict any man of Treaſon, and therefore I take it to be very clear.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Juſtice Raymond.</speaker>
                  <p>I am of the ſame Opinion, That where ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are brought to prove the ſame Treaſon, one Witneſs to each of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:105168:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Circumſtances is ſufficient, and this, I conceive, hath been always the Opinion of the Judges.</p>

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Baron Atkins.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I am of the ſame Opinion, That there muſt be two Witneſſes in the Caſe of Treaſon is a matter without Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but there are ſeveral Overt Acts that may contribute to the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Treaſon. If a man deſigns to kill the King, and buyes Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at one place at one time, and a Piſtol at another place at another time, and promiſes a Reward to one to aſſiſt him to do the thing at a third place and a third time; theſe are ſeveral Overt Acts, but if the Law requires that each be proved by two Witneſſes I do not well ſee how any man can be Convicted of Treaſon. In the Caſe of Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> and others, this very Queſtion was ſtarted but was not thought worthy of Debate, if it should be otherwiſe it would touch the Judgments which have been given upon this kind of Proof, and what would the Conſequence of that be, but that thoſe perſons who were Executed upon thoſe Judgments have ſuffered illegally; And therefore I am of Opinion that it is not requiſite there should be two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to every Overt Act.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I am of the ſame Opinion, it is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Conſpire the Death of the King; Now each of the Witneſſes is a Witneſs to prove that Treaſon, the one ſays he offered him ſuch a Reward, in ſuch a place, that is one Witneſs to prove that he Conſpired the Death of the King, and another ſays, that he offered him ſuch a Reward in another place, that is another Witneſs that he Conſpired the Death of the King. For the Party is indicted upon one particular Overt Act, but he is indicted for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Conſpiring the Death of the King, and each of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But this is the firſt time that I have heard it hath been made a Queſtion, that to the ſame Treaſon there muſt be two Witneſſes to every Overt Act. It hath been adjudged always accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law, that to prove Treaſon there muſt be two Witneſſes, but to any Overt Act there needs but on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>My Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> By the uniform Opinion of all my Lords the Judges, there is no colour to doubt the Law in that point which you deſire to argue; So that as to that point you muſt reſt ſatisfied, you are not to have Counſel to ſpeak to it.

                  <p>My Lords, I hear a ſtrange Poſition, I never heard the like before in my life, and 'tis what he ſaid, if I am in the wrong I beg your Lordships pardon and his too. He told your Lordships the Reaſon why the Law should be ſo, was becauſe elſe a great many of thoſe perſons that have already been Executed muſt have been acknowledged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly cut off and put to Death, that is an Argument I hope will not weigh with your Lordships or any body, for 'tis better that a Thouſand perſons that are Guilty should eſcape, than that one Innocent perſon should die, much more then that it should not be declared, that ſuch a Judgment was not well given.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I did Yeſterday receive an Order from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, and upon that and ſome other things that I have to trouble your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships with, I did petition for this favour, which I humbly thank your Lordships for granting. If I be impertinent I shall beg your Lordships pardon, and I hope you will be pleaſed to conſider my Weakneſs at all times, eſpecially in this condition I am now in, but I hope by your Lordships favour to be in an happier one quickly. For the matters of proof I shall offer not a tittle, but, my Lords, this Order which I received does ſay, That the Lords Aſſembled in Parliament have ordered, that my Counſel shall not be heard touching the continuance of Impeachments from Parliament to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; but I hope my Lords, you will pleaſe without Offence, to let me offer to your Lordships my own Conceptions about it, which I shall do as briefly as I can.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I do not conceive by this Order, That your Lordships ſay it does or it does not continue: You have given no Judgment as I know of in it, when you have I shall acquieſce, but I hope your Lordships will reſolve that it does not. And, my Lords, my reaſons for it are two; the firſt is, becauſe one of the Managers for the Houſe of Commons, as I take it Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> ſaid theſe words, and your Lordships may remember them, That if there were no ſuch Preſident your Lordships would make a Preſident, whether you will or no that I muſt ſubmit to your Lordships, but then there is none yet. The next thing is, my Lords, this, whether an Impeachment be to be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in Parliament without an Indictment: this, my Lords, I humbly hope your Lordships are reſolved, it ought not: For I ſee not how truely, my Lords, it can be, by the little reading which I have had in the Law, I never found any man proſecuted in a Legal way but by an Indictment, I may be miſtaken, and I beg your Lordships pardon for troubling you with my miſtakes, but I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read of any that were proſecuted upon an Impeachment; ſo then the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal uſual word being Indictment, I hope your Lordships will not alter the form, for I hope you will keep that great Maxim of your Noble Anceſtors, <hi>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutare,</hi> and whether this be a Change of the Law or no, I ſubmit it to your Lordships.</p>
                  <p>A third thing is this, Your Lordships do not think fit that my Counſel shall plead to that Point, whether Words do amount to an Overt Act, for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Counſel to that likewiſe I do not pretend, but I hope your Lordships
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:105168:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will give me leave to ſay this, I never heard that Words did amount to an Overt Act, if your Lordships judge otherwiſe, I ſubmit, but till then I hope it shall not conclude me.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome other Points which I did offer to your Lordships, and I humbly beſeech you to know, whether my Counſel shall be heard to them; 'tis true, one of them, which was, whether two Witneſſes in ſeveral places did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a legal Teſtimony or no, your Lordships did not declare one way or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: If you ſay you acquieſce in the Opinion of the Judges, I muſt ſubmit, but till Judgment is given, I beſeech your Lordships to give me leave to tell you my weak thoughts about it. <hi>I</hi> did not hear what the Judges ſaid all of them, but as <hi>I</hi> apprehend they were all of one Opinion; 'Tis true, one of them that ſpoke laſt, <hi>I</hi> think it was Judge <hi>Atkins,</hi> did ſay it did amount to a legal Teſtimony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe elſe thoſe Juries that have found ſome Guilty upon the ſame ſort of Evidence should be perjured; but if this were not ſo, then upon the ſame grounds, under your Lordships favour, thoſe Juries that acquitted ſome upon ſuch Teſtimony were perjured, but <hi>I</hi> muſt believe it to be otherwiſe till your Lordships have declared it as your Opinion, for that reaſon will not hold, for the ſame reaſon will be for the perjuring the one, as for the perjuring the other. And the ſame Juries for the moſt part tryed thoſe that were found guilty and thoſe that were acquitted.</p>

                  <p>Is this all your Lordship will pleaſe to ſay?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>No, my Lords, if you would give me leave <hi>I</hi> would trouble you a little farther, if it were an Offence <hi>I</hi> would not ſay a word. My Lords, <hi>I</hi> do conceive <hi>I</hi> am not concerned in the general Plot of the Papiſts; for <hi>I</hi> am not proved to be ſo, and whatſoever <hi>I</hi> may be in my ſelf, as <hi>I</hi> conceive, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is of hearſay, <hi>I</hi> hope your Lordships will not go upon that, but upon what is proved <hi>Secundum allegata &amp; probata,</hi> and that common Fame will condemn no man, if it do, then no man is ſafe, but <hi>I</hi> muſt ſay there is not one word of proof offered that <hi>I</hi> am a Papiſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> hope, my Lords, <hi>I</hi> have cleared my ſelf to your Lordships and made my Innocency appear, by making appear the perjury of the Witneſſes, and the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of thoſe things they ſaid againſt me. Againſt <hi>Dugdale I</hi> have proved it by two of his own Witneſſes, the one was <hi>Eld</hi> the woman that ſwore for him, That he took up a Glaſs of Cyder and wished that it might be his Poyſon if he knew any thing of the Plot, the other was <hi>Whitby,</hi> who ſays, he had given my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Father warning long ago what a Knave he was. So 'tis clear, for Dr. <hi>Oats I</hi> hope from his Contradictions againſt himſelf as well as <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who does contradict himſelf, at one time <hi>Auguſt,</hi> at another time the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> or the beginning of <hi>September:</hi> And <hi>I</hi> hope your Lordships will give no credit to <hi>Oats</hi>'s Teſtimony, for he ſaid before your Lordships he had declared all he knew, ('tis true <hi>I</hi> was then accuſed, but not for having a
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:105168:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Commiſſion as he now ſwears) and afterwards he accuſed the Queen, ſo here is <hi>Oats</hi> againſt <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Dugdale</hi> againſt <hi>Dugdale;</hi> and for <hi>Turbervill</hi> I have proved by his Affidavit, firſt he ſwears one thing and then another, and the truth of it is, his Brother proved him falſe in his laſt Oath, that it was (7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>My Lords, 'Tis not my part to make any Queſtion, nor do I, whether a Plot or no Plot; for I am not concerned in it: If what I shall ſay now be impertinent, I humbly beg your Lordships pardon. My Lords, I have been by the moſt of my Friends, at leaſt every one that came to me, particularly by my. Wife and Daughter that is near me, perſuaded to tell all that I knew, and I do here in the preſence of Almighty God declare what I know to be true.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I do believe ſince the Reformation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to (what it is now Eſtablished) the Church of <hi>England,</hi> thoſe of that Religion have had ſeveral wicked and ill Deſigns and Plots: I do believe they had a Deſign in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, <hi>Babbington</hi>'s Plot, (that is a long time ago) how far it was to take away the Queens Life I can't tell, but a Plot it was: I do believe there was another in her time, called, Earl of <hi>Weſtmorland</hi>'s Plot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was a Rebe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ion in the North, for which ſome fled and ſome were Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that was a very ill deſign: As for thoſe poyſonings of her Saddle and the like, I take them to be but ſtories.</p>
                  <p>In King <hi>James</hi>'s time, in the firſt year of his Reign, there was a wicked Plot compoſed by Actors, ſome of one Religion, ſome of another, there was my Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> my Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> my Lord <hi>Brooke,</hi> and others ſuch, they were condemned all of them, ſome fled, as <hi>Markham</hi> and <hi>Bainham,</hi> thoſe Lords and Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> were Reprived and kept long in the <hi>Tower.</hi> But Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was afterwards upon that ſame Judgment Beheaded, and the Lords dyed in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lords, Next to that was the Execrable Treaſon that I ſpoke of at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, the Gun-powder-Treaſon: And I proteſt before Almighty God, I did from my Infancy deteſt and abhor thoſe men that were engaged in it, and I do think, and always did think, the Wit of Man nor the Devils Malice, can't invent an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for it: For the men concerned they all acknowledged it, confeſſed it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beg'd pardon of the King and God, and all good men for it, that is all I shall ſay to that now.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, Since his Majeſties happy Reſtauration I do conceive, and I think I may ſafely ſay it, (for you all know it, he was gracious and good to all Diſſentersd particularly to them of the Romish Church, they had Connivance and Indulgence in their private Houſes, and I declare to your Lordships, I did then ſay to ſome that were too open in their Worship that they did play foul in taking more Liberty upon them than was fitting for them too, and that brought the misfortune upon me which I will not name.</p>

                     </gap>, it was not long ago that your Lordships at your own Bar did allow all the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> to give ſome Reaſons to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships why thoſe Laws that were againſt them should be repealed, as well Proteſtant Diſſenters as thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and why they should have ſome kind of Toleration; among whom you did permit thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh Religion</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too, I forget their Names. And I remember particularly one of the forts of them, an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> I think, did urge for a Reaſon, that which is a great truth, that they held Rebellion to be the Sin of Whitchcraſt, I believe it is as bad as any Sin can be.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, that came to nothing at that time, but, my Lords, I believe that after that all of all Religions had Meetings among themſelves to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get that Toleration which they propoſed humbly to your Lordships, there I will never deny, my Lords, that my Opinion was, and is, that this Kingdom can never be happy till an Act of Parliament paſs to this Effect; it was my Opinion then, and I did endeavour it all I could that the Diſſenting Proteſtants might have a Comprehenſion, and the other a Toleration; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be my Intention, and I think it was no ill one; for if that be a true Copy of the Commons Votes which is in Print, there is ſome ſuch thing deſigning there as a Comprehenſion; and I was of Opinion that it were ſufficient that ſuch as were of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſerve God in their own Houſes, and privately in their own Way, not in publick, and that for it they should pay ſomething to the King out of their Eſtates, but truly not much; That they should be ſeverely punished if they or any of them did endeavour to perſuade any Subject to their Opinion, or did come to Court, or enjoy any Office whatſoever, though it were but that of a Scavenger, but that they should pay their proportion to all chargeable Offices; That I profeſs, my Lords, was my Opinion, and I confeſs to your Lordships 'tis ſo ſtill. I was in ſome hopes that it would have been done in that Seſſions, becauſe I was afraid it was unlikely to be done at any time elſe. I confeſs to your Lordships I was heartily and cordially againſt the Teſt, becauſe it hindred thoſe juſt and honeſt things that were for the Good of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, there was the firſt or or the ſecond Day brought into your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Houſe, the Record of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Tryal, and for the Letters in it, I do my Lords, declare to your Lordships, I never read of one of them before, but I have read them ſince they have been in Print; And when I read them firſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorily over, my Opinion was, and is, That <hi>Coleman</hi>'s endavouring by Money out of <hi>France,</hi> and keeping off the Parliament to get a Toleration, was that which he could not juſtifie by Law, how fat it was Criminal, that I do not know, I am not ſo skilled in the Law, I think it was not juſtifiable, but he hath paid for it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely ſince.</p>

This I profeſs is true, and I hope I am no Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in it; for I do value the Parliaments Sitting to be the only means to keep this Kingdom quiet.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, 'Tis very true by <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters, and what I have ſeen in print ſince, I do believe there have been ſome Conſultations for a Toleration; and if I had known as much then as I have ſince I have been in the <hi>Tower,</hi> I had perhaps prevented many things; for, my Lords, I hold <hi>England</hi> to be a great and an happy Body; but it is as other great Bodies are, it may be now, as you know before it was, over-grown or ſick; it was then, and <hi>I</hi> pray God it be not now, but <hi>I</hi> hold nothing can cure it but that old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſician, the King, your Lordships and the Commons in Parliament aſſembled. But if <hi>I</hi> had known any ſuch Deſign, as <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letters do hint, <hi>I</hi> would not have continued in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lords, For that damnable Opinion of King-killing, if <hi>I</hi> were of any Church whatſoever, and found that to be its Principle, <hi>I</hi> would leave it. My Lords, this is as true as <hi>I</hi> can ſpeak any thing in the world, <hi>I</hi> beg your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships pardon for troubling you with my impertinencies, and hope you pardon it to my weakneſs. My Lords, <hi>I</hi> do profeſs before Almighty God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Lordships my Judges, <hi>I</hi> know no one tittle nor point of the Plot; and if <hi>I</hi> did <hi>I</hi> hold my ſelf bound to declare it. For the preſent <hi>I</hi> shall ſay little more, unleſs the Managers give me occaſion; if they will reply, and make any Objections <hi>I</hi> deſire <hi>I</hi> may anſwer them. <hi>I</hi> know the great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages <hi>I</hi> am under, when theſe Gentlemen, who are great Scholars and Learned Men, reply upon me, who have thoſe great helps of Memory, Parts, and Underſtanding in the Law, all which <hi>I</hi> want. And therefore <hi>I</hi> hope your Lordships will dot conclude me upon what they or I have ſaid, but will be pleaſed to debate the matter among your ſelves, and be as well my Counſel as my Judges.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, when <hi>I</hi> offer to your Lordships matter of Law, I did in no wiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the matter of Fact.—</p>

But we deſire your Lordships to conſider whether this practiſe of having things written down for the Clerk to read, may not introduce a Cuſtom, which may in time grow inconvenient for future Example.

                     <stage>(Reading out of his Paper.)</stage> My Lords, when I offered Matter of Law to your Lordships, on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt, I did in no wiſe admit the Matter of Fact to be true that was alledged againſt me, and ſo I deſire to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. And I hope your Lordships will not lay the leſs weight upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of my Witneſſes becauſe they are not ſworn; for the Law does not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be ſworn, which is no fault of mine, nor ought not to turn to my Prejudice.</p>
                  <p>I muſt appeal to your Lordships Judgments in point of Fact, how far the Kings Witneſſes are to be believed againſt me, conſidering the whole matter, and my Counter-proof.</p>
                  <p>Next I ſubmit to your Lordships Judgments this point, That the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being founded upon the Common Law, and the Statute of 25<hi>th. Edw.</hi> 3. and not upon the Statute of 13<hi>th.</hi> of this King, two of the Witneſſes, <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervill,</hi> do only ſwear Treaſonable words ſpoken by me, and not my Overt Act; for they ſwear only that I promiſed them Money and Rewards to kill the King. Now I humbly pray your Lordships Judgment, whether bare
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:105168:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpeaking of words be an Overt Act, and Treaſon at the Common Law, or upon that Statute; and whether there be more than ſpeaking of Words in a Conſult, or otherwiſe proved by <hi>Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Turbervill,</hi> I appeal to you; then the other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Oats,</hi> is but a ſingle Witneſs, who ſpeaks of the receiving of a Commiſſion.

You have had the Opinion of the Judges, and there is no more to be ſaid in it. As to that, whether Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments continue from Parliament to Parliament, and the other thing, whether Proceedings may be upon an Impeachment without an Indictment; theſe are matters of the Courſe and Conſtitutions of Parliaments, my Lords will conſider of them by themſelves, and will permit no Counſel to argue them. For the other Point, That words are no Overt Act, that reſts for their Opinion in another Caſe, when it shall come, for they have now no ſuch Caſe before them.</p>

I was, my Lords, committed by my Lord Chief Juſtices Warrant, on the 20. or 21. of <hi>October,</hi> (78.) <hi>Friday,</hi> the 25. of <hi>October,</hi> I was brought to your Lordships Bar, I was Impeached; I do not remember the day, my Lords, the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> in one Parliament Articles exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, in another Parliament <hi>I</hi> was brought upon theſe Articles exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and being called to your Lordships Bar, the Articles were read to me, and I gave in my Anſwer, that was ſometime in <hi>May</hi> (79.) and in the end of <hi>May</hi> the 27. (if I miſtake not, if I do, I deſire it may be rectified by your Books) I with the other Lords, were brought to this place in order to our Trial. We ſtaid ſome time there, and then were remanded by your Order to the <hi>Tower,</hi> where I continued till <hi>November</hi> twelve month after, without having heard any thing concerning it; ſo that I was firſt Impeached in one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Articles brought againſt me and pleaded to in a ſecond, and now brought to my Trial in a third; and what your Lordships will ſay upon this, I ſubmit to you, and whether theſe be Proceedings according to Law, your Lordships will judge.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I humbly conceive that <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſays, That Juſtice shall be denied nor delayed to no man, whether it hath not been delayed to me, let your Lordships judge. If you ſay the Prorogation of the Parliament is the cauſe of that delay, I hope your Lordships will give me leave to ſay, That from the 5. of <hi>December</hi> to the 30. when the firſt Parliament was Prorogued, or during the Seſſion of the other Parliament, there was time enough ſure wherein I might have been brought to my Trial; and if theſe proceedings be lawful and juſt, there is no man living, but may be kept off from time to time, till ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents happen that their ends may be gained. I leave it to your judgment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may be only my Caſe now, or of ſome of your Lordships in future Ages, to be accuſed of things that you never heard of before, and not brought to juſtifie your ſelves, but kept in Priſon.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, There is a Statute, I have forgot where it is (but ſuch a one I have read) that though the King by his great Seal, or little Seal, command that Juſtice should be delaid or denied, yet however the Judges shall not obey it, but proceed. So I hope there is no pretence of delay on my part, and the benefit of that Statute shall not be denied me. And that Statute of the Great <hi>Charter,</hi> which coſt ſo many of your Anceſtors their Lives to maintain, I hope you will never go from. Now, your Lordships Noble Anceſtors amongſt other things, took great care that Juſtice should be denied or delayed to none; and this I deſire you to take into Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>I am in your Lordships Judgment either to be Acquitted or Condemned. I hope your Lordships will, and I know you will lay your Hands upon your Hearts, conſult your Conſciences and your Honours, and then you will do what is Juſt and Equitable I doubt not.</p>

My Lords, Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> ſaid I came by the name of Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but that I did to my Letters ſign <hi>Stafford;</hi> ſurely, my Lords, if I was ashamed to own my Perſon, I should have been as much ashamed to have owned my Name. He ſays he ſaw me take a Commiſſion, and whether that be an Overt Act, your Lordships are to determine. Upon the whole matter, I conceive, there is nothing proved againſt me, but words, nor pretended to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only by <hi>Oats.</hi> And whether you will credit a man that ſo diſſembles with God, as I have told you, I appeal to your Lordships, and beg you to conſider of it.</p>
                  <p>That theſe Witneſſes have ſworn for Money, if you ſend to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer Office and ſee what Money they have received, you will find by the great Sums that 'tis ſo, and then <hi>I</hi> hope you will not allow them to be heard, nor credit any that ſwear for gain. I had a Suit in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> that had like to have gone expreſly againſt me, only becauſe one of my Witneſſes was to gain 8 <hi>l.</hi> if the Suit went for me. But pray conſider how much theſe men have had. And for the point that there are not two Witneſſes, I beſeech your Lordships, give me leave to put you in mind, That not many Years ago, you paſſed an Act againſt Frauds and Perjuries, wherein you were ſo careful to preſerve mens Eſtates, that you required three Witneſſes to prove a Will of Goods or Lands, above 100 <hi>l.</hi> and will you allow but one Witneſs to take away a mans Life for Words? Though your Lordships will never commit Treaſon, yet no man can preſerve himſelf from the Misfortune that happens to me, of being falſly accuſed.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, my Lords, the Managers have given an Anſwer to the Buſineſs of the Money, by ſaying, The King may give as liberally as he pleaſes, but to give ſo great Sums, whereby Men Poor before, are now become Rich, I think will be an Objection againſt their Credit.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, I have ſaid what I do think convenient, though I think much more might be ſaid by an abler man to your Lordships, for the clearing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I hope I have done it, nay, I am confident I have; and this I have done for the Memory of that Great and Bleſſed King, who firſt made me a Peer, that it may not be ſaid, He did me the Honour Forty Years ago to call me up to this Dignity, and I should fly in the Face of his Son in ſo horrible a manner as theſe men would make me. I do owe it to the Honour of my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, I think, I may ſafely ſay, were both Honourable and Worthy Perſons: My Father was a learned man, and a wiſe man, as I may appeal to ſome of your Lordships who knew him well; I ſay, I owe it to their Memory, and to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Family from whence I ſprang, which all the world knows what it is. And I should be an infamous man to dishonour them ſo much as to bear their Name, and commit Treaſon. My Lords, <hi>I</hi> owe it to my Wife, who hath been a very kind Wife to me as ever Man had: She is Heireſs at Law to the great
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:105168:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Eſtate of that great and unfortunate Man <hi>Stafford,</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who was cut offin the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and all his Eſtate, if it were not for that Attainder, would have come to her.</p>
                  <p>I may be impertinent in telling your Lordships what it was, but I do not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it, when I reckon it would have been at this day Two hundred thouſand pounds a Year, for it was Seventeen thouſand pounds a Year in thoſe days Penny Rent, beſides other Emoluments. This is an extravagant thing to ſay, but 'tis true, ſomething thereof does<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remain to her, which I now enjoy. I owe it to all my Children, eſpecially to my Eldeſt Son, who is a young Man, and I may ſay of far better Parts and Hopes than his Father, and whom, I hope, will ſerve his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I owe it to all my Friends and Relations, for I would not have it ſaid after-my Death, my Wife was the Widow of a Traytor. I owe it to all theſe, but above all I owe it to God Almighty, then when I come to be judged by Him, I may give a good account of what he hath intruſted me with, that I may not appear as an infamous Man who knows he hath a Body, but not his own, and yet should throw it and his Soul away together. And if I should have committed this Execrable Treaſon, I should have been Guilty of my own Murder: Firſt, in the committing a Crime worthy of Death; and then in not Confeſſing to ſave my Life. I hold Murder an extraordinary Crime, the worſt next to Treaſon: And I know, if I should not prevent my Death by confeſſing all I knew, I should have been guilty of Self-Murder, the worſt of Murders. <hi>I</hi> know your Lordships will lay to Heart, what an execrable thing Murder is and the Blood of Innocents; and I hope there is none of the Houſe of Commons, but after this Evidence, will clear me. I am ſure none of them would have me punished for that I am not Guilty of. I do not blame theſe Gentlemen of the Houſe of Commons for Proſecuting, nor the firſt for Impeaching; for they had, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, Reaſons great enough for it upon what Evidence they had before them, before they knew what the Witneſſes were. I know your Lordships will not in the leaſt point vary from Juſtice, or the Law of the Land, and I deſire you to lay the whole matter to your Hearts; I have not the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of the Partiality of any Man in the Houſe, nay, I profeſs, if I had an Enemy and he were not here, I would beg of you that he might come. I have cleared my ſelf before your Lordshships, and I hope I shall not be run down by the wicked Rabble, which where it will end, God knows. It began in the late times againſt my Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and ſo continued till it ended in that moſt Execrable Fact, one of them that ever was done. A wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beginning it was, and it had a wicked end. For ſince our Saviours Death and Murder by the <hi>Jews,</hi> never was ſo execrable a Murder in the World; and whoever had an hand in it without an extraordinary Repentance, can have no thoughts of Salvation. I never could ſerve the King, 'tis true, but in my deſires, and I never diſſerted him in Thought, Word, or Deed to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:105168:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my knowledg in my life, much leſs did I ever contrive or conſent to his Death. I do in the preſence of God, Angels, your Lordships, and all Men, declare, I do know no more of the Plot, or any ſuch thing than any one here does. That thoſe of the Romish Religion had meetings, I believe, to obtain thoſe ends that I ſpake of before: <hi>Coleman</hi> went too far, how far he was Criminal in it I cann't tell. Meetings, I ſay, there were, but I was never at one of them, nor do <hi>I</hi> know what was done there. I do leave it to your Lordships to do Juſtice, as I know you will, and with all ſubmiſſion I reſign my ſelf up to you.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, ſome thing that my Lord hath ſpoken hath been reſolved againſt him, that is about two Witneſſes to each Overt-act; ſome things are not to be diſputed about the Law and Courſe of Parliaments, ſome things were not to be ſaid now, becauſe he had ſaid them before. My Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we had concluded our Evidence, and he is pleaſed to take up the time with repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>For the other matters that my Lord is pleaſed to diſcourſe of, all he ſays is but his Obligations, and how unreaſonable it were for him to do it; the Queſtion is whether he hath done it or no; if he hath, his Obligations are an Aggravation of his Crime, not an Excuſe. His Relations, his Family, and other things are nothing before your Lordships now in point of Judgment, nor is there any thing new ſaid to day, that was not ſaid before.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, <hi>I</hi> should not add one word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>further, were it not that this Noble Lord is pleaſed upon his Memory, or rather without, to ſay ſomething of me, and that was, that ſpeaking of the Continuance of Proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For there was no need of urging Preſidents, when your Lordships upon a Conference with the Commons, did declare it to be the Law of Proceedings in Parliament, and did then fortifie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with many Arguments. <hi>I</hi> know my Lords Memory is not very good; <hi>I</hi>'m ſure in this he is very much m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſtaken.</p>
                  <p>My Lord hath been pleaſed to complain he hath received much diſturbance, and that the Noiſe and Shouts have been ſo great that they have occaſioned ſome l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſtraction in him. My Lords, <hi>I</hi> am ſure his Lordship cannot mean us; for <hi>I</hi> appeal to your Lordships, and all that have heard this Tryal, whether he hath received the leaſt diſturbance or interruption from us, or whether we have
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:105168:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not treated him with that reſpect that becomes his Dignity, and the Diſcretion that ought to be in the Managers of the Houſe of Commons. But I muſt needs ſay, that his Lordship hath received diſtraction from thoſe Friends or Counſel of his that put thoſe many Papers into his Hand; for he hath read one after another that do contain the ſame matter over and over again. Theſe I confeſs were ſufficient to diſtract him, or any other that should make uſe of them. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath been pleaſed to go off from the matter of Law, to the matter of Fact, and backward and forward, ſo that it is impoſſible to follow him: And as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact we shall decline to follow him; for though we have not given his Lordship any diſturbance, yet we ſubmit to your Judgment whether it be Regular, or according to the Courſe of Proceedings, when his Lordship hath ſum'd up his Evidence, and we that are the Proſecutors have concluded ours, he should begin that work again, which if it should be admitted we were to reply, and he might rejoin upon us, and ſo there would be no end of Proceedings.</p>
                  <p>And, my Lords, I hope, though this Lord hath had the favour to do it, yet it shall not for the future be brought into Example, for it will make Tryals endleſs.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, for the matter of Law, there is nothing that deſerves an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, for though the Law does admit the Priſoner Counſel in matters of Law, yet it muſt be in things doubtful: And if there be any thing of that in our Caſe, I ſubmit it to your Lordships. I am ſure I have heard nothing new but what hath been over-ruled already, unleſs it be a matter of Law which riſes upon a matter of Fact, and that not proved, to wit, the Corruption of Witneſſes. The laſt day all was ſaid by his Lordship he could ſay, and all ſaid by us that we thought fit to ſay, and now to begin the ſame matter again, I think ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. We shall not follow his Lordship in that way of Proceedings, and hope it shall never fall into Example.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I have only one word to ſay to your Lordships, and that is in relation to the Proceedings of the Commons in this Cauſe; for if the Cauſe had not been of an extraordinary nature, we should have ſtood upon it, that the Priſoner ought not after the Proſecutors had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to have taken a liberty of reading and repeating what we had ſaid over and over again. We know, my Lords, there are are a ſort of men in the world, who are willing to lay hold of any pretences to cavil at our Proceedings, and therefore we have let my Lord take all this liberty, that ſo his Party might have no colour of Complaint. His Lordship was pleaſed to ſay the laſt day, that he had not a Witneſs more to produce, nor a Reaſon to give, as I underſtood him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt own that we have been very tender to him in all our Proceedings. One thing my Lord inſinuates to day, which I cannot forbear taking notice of,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:105168:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as if we had delayed him, which is without cauſe; we had uſed all diligence in preparing our ſelves, and were ſoon ready when the King was pleaſed to let the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſit, and therefore it can be no imputation on us; and truly if my Lord conſiders the weight of the Evidence, I fear he will think his Tryal comes ſoon enough now.</p>

                  <p>What can your Lordship ſay for your ſelf, why Judgment of Death should not be given upon you according to the Law?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lord Stafford.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I have very little to ſay, I confeſs I am ſurprized at it, for I did not expect it; but Gods will be done, and your Lordships, I will not murmur at it: God forgive thoſe that have ſworn falſly againſt me. My Lords, I conceive I have ſomething to ſay for reſpit of Judgment; I have been at many Tryals in my Life, but I never ſaw any Tryal where the party tried did not hold up his Hand, which <hi>I</hi> was never asked to do; <hi>I</hi> thought it had been a very material point in the Law, That by the holding up of the Hand he might be known to be the Perſon. I have read, lately, ſince <hi>I</hi> had the misfortune to be thus accuſed, Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> upon the Pleas of the Crown, and he ſays that Miſnomer, the not giving a man his right name, or addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is likewiſe a juſt Cauſe to arreſt the Judgment. There is likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Queſtion how far it may be valued <hi>I</hi> know not, <hi>I</hi> ſubmit it, as <hi>I</hi> do all, to your Lordships. Though <hi>I</hi> am tried upon the Act of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> yet there is nothing more in that Act, than what is included in the Act of the 13<hi>th.</hi> of this King: And I humbly conceive, my Lords, by that Act, and the laſt Proviſo in it, a Peer that is accuſed and found Guilty of the Crimes therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is to loſe his Seat in Parliament; thoſe are the words, and ſince 'tis ſo put down in the Act, it is ſo to be underſtood, and that is all the punishment. And I humbly demand your Lordships Judgment upon theſe points, whether it be ſo or no?</p>

                  <p>Then the Lords adjourned into the Parliament Chamber, and the Committee of Commons returned to their own Houſe; and the Speaker having reaſſumed the Chair, the whole Body of the Houſe went with their Speaker to the Bar of the Houſe of Lords, to demand Judgment of High Treaſon againſt <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> upon the Impeachment of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament, in the name of the Commons in Parliament, and of all the Commons of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Commons, with their Speaker, went back to their Houſe.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lords took into conſideration what Judgment was to be given upon <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> and it was moved that he might be beheaded. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome debate, the Judges were asked, whether if any other Judgment than the uſual Judgment for High Treaſon were given upon him, it would attaint his Blood? The Judges were of opinion, that the Judgment for High Treaſon appointed by Law, is to be drawn, hanged, and quartered, and in the Courts and Proceedings below, they can take no notice of any Judgment for High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that.</p>
                  <p>Then Sir <hi>Creſwell Levinz,</hi> the Kings Attorney-General, deſired to be heard on his Majeſties behalf, which the Houſe gave leave for him to be; who ſaid, he knew no other Judgment by Law for High Treaſon, but Drawing, Hanging, and Quartering; if any other Judgment were given, it would be prejudicial to His Majeſty, and be a Queſtion in the inferiour Courts as to his Attainder of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon their Lordships ordered, That the <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ordinary Judgment of Death upon the Lord Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi> as the Law hath appointed in Caſes of High Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>And a Meſſage was ſent to the Houſe of Commons from their Lordships, by Sir <hi>Timothy Baldwyn</hi> and Sir <hi>Samuel Clark.</hi>

                  <p>The Committee of Commons appointed for the Management of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the Priſoner, with the reſt of the Commons, went into <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> to the Court there erected, to be preſent when the Lords gave Judgment of High Treaſon againſt him, upon the Impeachment of the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

After a short time their Lordships were adjourned into <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> coming in their former Order into the Court there erected, where being ſeated, and the <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> being on the Wool-ſack, attended by <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> principal King of Arms, the <hi>Uſher</hi> of the Black Rod, Eight of the Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants at Arms kneeling with their Maces, the Ninth Macer making proclamation for Silence; which being done, the <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> gave Judgment upon the Priſoner as followeth.</p>

                              <p>THat which your Lordship hath ſaid in Arreſt of Judgment, hath been found by my Lords upon due Conſideration had of it, to be of no moment at all. It is no Eſſential part of any Trial, That the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſhould hold up his Hand at the Bar; there is no Record ever made of it when it is done; the only uſe of it is to ſhew the Court who the Priſoner is, when that is apparent, the Court does often proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, though he refuſe to hold up his Hand at the Bar; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the omiſſion of that Ceremony in this Caſe is no legal Exception, as all the Judges have declared.</p>
                              <p>And as to the Proviſo's in the Statute of the <hi>13th.</hi> year of this King, their Lordships do find that they are in no ſort applicable to this Caſe, foraſmuch as the Proceedings againſt your Lordſhip are not grounded upon that Statute, but upon the Statute of the <hi>25. E. 3.</hi> And yet if the Proceedings had been upon the latter Statute, the Proviſo's therein could have done your Lordſhip no ſervice at all.</p>
                              <p>My part therefore which remains, is a very ſad one: for I never yet gave Sentence of Death upon any man, and am extremely ſorry that I muſt begin with your Lordſhip.</p>
                              <p>Who would have thought that a perſon of your Quality, of ſo Noble an Extraction, of ſo conſiderable Eſtate and Fortune, ſo eminent a Sufferer in the late ill Times, ſo intereſted in the Preſervation of the Government, ſo much obliged to the Moderation of it, and ſo perſonally obliged to the King and his Royal Father for their particular Favours to you, ſhould ever have entred into ſo Infernal a Conſpiracy as to contrive the Murder of the King, the Ruin of the State, the Subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion, and, as much as in you l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet the Impeachment of the Houſe of Commons amounts to no leſs a Charge, and of this Charge their Lordships have found you Guilty.</p>
                              <p>That there hath been a General and Deſperate Conſpiracy of the Papiſts, and that the Death of the King hath been all along one chief part of the Conſpirators Deſign, is now apparent beyond all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of doubting.</p>
                              <p>What was the meaning of all thoſe Treatiſes which were publiſht about two years ſince againſt the Oath of Allegiance, in a time when no man dreamt of ſuch a Controverſie? What was the meaning of Father <hi>Conyers</hi>'s Sermon upon the ſame Subject, but only becauſe there was a Demonſtration of Zeal, as they call it, intended againſt the Perſon of the King? which the ſcruples ariſing from that Oath did ſomewhat hinder.</p>
                              <p>To what purpoſe were all the Correſpondencies with Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? The Collections of Money among the Fathers abroad and at home? What was the meaning of their Governing themſelves here by ſuch Advices as came frequently from <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Saint Omers?</hi> And how ſhall we expound that Letter which came from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to aſſure the Fathers here, that all things were in a readineſs there too, as ſoon as the Blow ſhould be given?</p>
                              <p>Does any man now begin to doubt how <hi>London</hi> came to be Burnt? Or by what ways and means poor Juſtice <hi>Godfrey</hi> fell? And is it not apparent by theſe Inſtances, that ſuch is the frantick Zeal of ſome Bigotted Papiſts, that they reſolve, No means to advance the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cauſe ſhall be left unattempted, though it be by Fire and Sword?</p>
                              <p>My Lord, As the Plot in General is moſt manifeſt, ſo your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips part in it hath been too too plain. What you did at <hi>Paris,</hi> and continued to do at <hi>Tixal</hi> in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> ſhews a ſettled purpoſe of mind againſt the King; and what you ſaid at <hi>London</hi> touching <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Will,</hi> ſhews you were acquainted with that Conſpiracy againſt the Kings Life which was carrying on here too: And in all this there was a great Degree of Malice; for your Lordſhip at one time called the King Heretick and Traytor to God; and at another time you revil'd him for miſplacing his Bounty, and rewarding none but Traytors and Rebels.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="275" facs="tcp:105168:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                                 <hi>And thus you ſee that which the</hi> Wiſe man <hi>forewarn'd you of is come upon you,</hi> Curſe not the King, no not in thy heart: for the Birds of the Air ſhall reveal, and that which hath wings will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the matter.</p>
                              <p>Three things I ſhall preſume to recommend to your Lordſhips con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. In the firſt place, Your Lordship now ſees how it hath pleaſed God to leave you ſo far to your ſelf, that you are fallen into the ſnare, and into the pit, into that very pit which you were digging for others. Conſider therefore, that God Almighty never yet left any man, who did not firſt leave him.</p>
                              <p>In the next place, Think a little better of it than hitherto you have done, what kind of Religion that is in which the Blind Guides have been able to lead you on into ſo much ruin and deſtruction as is now like to befall you.</p>
                              <p>In the laſt place, I pray your Lordſhip to conſider, That true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is never too late. A devout penitential ſorrow, joyn'd with an humble and hearty Confeſſion, is of mighty power and efficacy both with God and man.</p>
                              <p>There have been ſome of late, who have refus'd to give God the Glory of his Juſtice by acknowledging the Crimes for which they were condemned; nay, who have been taught to believe, that 'tis a mortal Sin to confeſs that Crime in publick, for which they have been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in private; and ſo have not dar'd to give God that Glory which otherwiſe they would have done.</p>
                              <p>God forbid your Lordship ſhould reſt upon Forms; God forbid your Lordship ſhould be found among the number of thoſe poor miſtaken ſouls whom the firſt thing that undeceives is Death it ſelf.</p>
                              <p>Perhaps your Lordship may not much eſteem the Prayers of thoſe whom you have long been taught to miſcal Hereticks: But whether you do or no, I am to aſſure your Lordſhip, That all my Lords here, even they that have condemned you, will never ceaſe to pray for you, that the end of your life may be Chriſtian and Pious, how Tragical ſoever the means are that muſt bring you thither.</p>
                              <p>And now my Lord, this is the laſt time that I can call you My Lord; for the next words I am to ſpeak will Attaint you.</p>
                              <p>

I do here in the preſence of God Almighty declare, I have no Malice in my Heart to them that have condemned me; I know not who they are, nor deſire to know; I forgive them all, and beſeech your Lordships all to pray for me. My Lords, I have one humble Requeſt to make to your Lordships, and that is, my Lords, That the little ſhort time I have to live a Priſoner, I may not be a cloſe Priſoner, as I have been of late, but that Mr. <hi>Lieutenant</hi> may have an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that my Wife and Children and Friends may come at me. I do humbly beg this Favour of your Lordſhips, which I hope you will be pleaſed to give me.</p>

                  <p>My Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> I believe I may, with my Lords leave, tell you one thing further, That my Lords, as they proceed with Rigour of Juſtice, ſo they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with all the Mercy and Compaſſion that may be; And therefore my Lords will be humble Suitors to the King, that He will remit all the Puniſhment but the taking off your Head.</p>

               <p>There were two Writs to the Sheriffs both alike <hi>verbatim,</hi> one delivered in <hi>London,</hi> the other in <hi>Middleſex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the Sheriffs doubting whether that was a ſufficient Authority for them to execute the Priſoner by Beheading only, the Sentence of Death being otherwiſe given, petitioned the Lords in Parliament to take the Premiſes into conſideration, and to make ſuch Order as ſhould be agreeable to Right and Juſtice, as by the following Petition appears.
