            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE late Learned Mr. <hi>H. Wharton,</hi> when he publish'd the History of the Troubles and Tryal of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> in the Year <hi>1695,</hi> finding that all the Papers to be printed with that Work could not be brought within the compass of one Volume, reserv'd these for a Second Part: If God had pleas'd to continue his life, they had been publish'd much sooner, together with such an account of them as he would have thought necessary: But he was preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in so good a Work by that stubborn and incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Distemper of which he dyed. In his Last Will all the Manuscript Papers relating to Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> are order'd forthwith to be deliver'd to his Father, (the Reverend Mr. <hi>Edmund Wharton,</hi> now Rector of <hi>Saxlingham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi>) that so he might cause them to be transcrib'd, and fitted for the Press: In complyance therefore with that his dying Request, these Papers are now sent into the World.</p>

               <p>So soon as I was admitted to the Chancellorship (which God know's I little expected) I thought it my Duty to reform the University, which was extremely sunk from all Discipline, and fallen into all Licentiousness: Insomuch that divers of the Governours there complained to me, that if remedy were not applied in time, there would scarce any face be left of a University. Hereupon I resolved within my self to set close to a Reformation. And though I understood most of the Defects of the University (as having lived there many years, and for divers of them a Governour): Yet the first thing I thought fit to do, was to lay <note place="margin">Order taken for weekly Letters from the Vicechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour.</note> a Command upon the <hi>Vicechancellour</hi> for the time being, that he should give me an account by Letters every week of all necessary Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which happened in the University, pertaining to Exercise or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: with a Promise, that he should weekly, without fail, receive a Letter from me, expressing what I dislik'd or approv'd, and with Directions what should further be done for the good of That Place. This Course I constanly held, and found so much good by it, that I resolved, as often as I made a New Vice-Chancellour, to renew the like Charge, and to pursue it with like diligence. Which, when time serv'd, I did, and shall (God willing) so continue to do, as long as I shall live <hi>Chancellour</hi> of the University.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Statutes</hi> of the University had lain in a confused heap for some <note place="margin">Concerning the making and settling the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</note> Ages, and extremely imperfect in all kinds. The Reformation of the Abuses, which grew thereby, and the reducing of the Statutes into Order and Form, with the Addition of some New, for the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the Present times, had been often attempted, and particulary by <hi>Cardinal Woolsey</hi> and other Great Men in their several times; but was never brought to any perfection; nor indeed to any thing at all: But the business left, where it was first undertaken. I did ever foresee, that it was not possible to make a Reformation, or settle That Body, unless the <hi>Statutes</hi> were first perfected. And yet it was evident also, what great difficulties attended That work: For it had been twice undertaken during my own time in the University; and both times it came to nothing. At the Last time it was attempted, I was Named in <hi>Convocation</hi> one of the <hi>Delegates</hi> my self. By which means I had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to see, where the difficulties and impediments lay, but was not then able to remove them. Afterwards coming to be Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and finding my Lord the Earl of <hi>Pembrock</hi> much troubled at some unworthy proceedings There; I told him, he would never have remedy, until the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the University were reduced into a Body
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54616:10"/>
and setled: And withal acquainted his Lordship, wherein the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties lay. Hereupon, at his entreaty, I set down, what way was to be taken and followed for effecting That work: And began at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Delegacy below in Convocation. Which Delegacy was no sooner nam'd, and my Directions sent unto them, but my Lord of <hi>Pembroke</hi> died, and I was chosen Chancellour after him, and took up this work, where it was then left, and resolved to go on against all Difficulties, which were like to oppose me in the Body of that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity: Which, being very sick, was desirous enough to be well, but not pleased with the sourness of the Cure. Besides, such Bodies never want Factions; and many There, that were willing enough to have a Cure, were not so well pleas'd, it should be wrought by my hand. But This and many other Difficulties I overcame with Care and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and went on with the work.</p>

                     <p>AFter my hearty Commendations &amp;c. I am given to understand, <note place="margin">To Dr. <hi>Tolson</hi> the Vicechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty about two disorderly Sermons.</note> that on <hi>Sunday</hi> last I was wellcomed into my Chancellourship of <hi>Oxford</hi> with two very ill Accidents, in either Sermon one. The first, I hear, was committed by one of <hi>Exeter</hi> College, who preach'd direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against all Reverence in Churches, and all Obeysance, or any devout gesture in or at the receiving of the Communion. And if this be true, belike we shall not kneel neither.</p>
                     <p>The other, as I am informed, was by one Mr. <hi>Tucker</hi> of your own Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; who was not content only to justifie the <hi>Five Articles,</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Arminianism,</hi> but he would needs lay an Aspersion upon the <hi>Synod of Dort.</hi> In both which he hath directly gone against his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties both <hi>Proclamation</hi> and <hi>Instructions,</hi> prohibiting all men of all sorts for a time to preach either way concerning them; that so those unhappy Differences, likely to rend this Church, as well as others, might sleep first, and dye after.</p>
                     <p>I know not, whether Mr. <hi>Vicechancellour</hi> did convent these men or no. If he did, your labour is past: If he did not, then I pray do you: and take two or three <hi>Doctors</hi> to you. I would not be too sour at my first coming-in: And yet I would not have Sermons of such ill example lead the way into my Government There. I hope, a strict <hi>Monition,</hi> that they run no more into these Errours, will serve the turn for this first time. But if you find, that it will not, then I pray go so much farther, as the carriage of the men and the merits of their cause shall require.</p>
                     <p>I know, <hi>these Sermons</hi> were provided before I was <hi>Chancellour,</hi> but yet I know too, that the blame will fall on me more than upon another man, if such things as these pass without Censure. I pray, as you shew'd your Love to choose me, so be careful to maintain my honour in upholding the Peace and the Government of the Place. For God knows, what blustring may follow upon That unhappy accident of Mr. <hi>Tucker's.</hi>

                     <p>AFter my hearty Commendations &amp;c. your Deputy, Dr. <hi>Tolsen,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">To Dr. <hi>Frewin</hi> Vicechancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, about ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities.</note> hath done very well in some Business in your absence, which I hope you will perfect. Now I have a little more Business for you, in which I must desire you to have a special Care.</p>
                     <p>I am given to understand, that <hi>Formalities</hi> (which are in a sort the outward and visible Face of the University) are in a manner utterly decayed, not only abroad in the Streets, but also in the very <hi>Schools, Convocation</hi> and <hi>Congregation-houses,</hi> and at <hi>Latin</hi> Sermons: In somuch that strangers, which come thither, have scarce any external Mark, by which they may know they are in a University. If this go on, the University will lose ground every day both at home and abroad; and especially with his Majesty, who is a great Lover of <hi>Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> in all Seminaries of good Learning. And he hath already given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> strict charge to look both to this and other particulars in their several times.</p>
                     <p>I pray therefore call the <hi>Heads</hi> of Colleges and Halls together with the <hi>Proctors,</hi> and read these Letters to them; and with my Love remembr'd to them all, let them know I am welcom'd into my <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellourship</hi> with many complaints from very great men. I hope, all are not true: And I hope, such as are, you and they will All in your several Houses joyn pains and hearty endeavous to see them rectifi'd, as I shall in due time severally propose them.</p>
                     <p>At this time I think it necessary, the <hi>Heads</hi> should fairly bespeak their several Companies to fit themselves with <hi>Formalities</hi> fitting their <hi>Degrees,</hi> that when the <hi>Act</hi> comes, (God bless you with Health, that it may hold with honour and safety) the University may have Credit by looking like it self: And then I doubt not but it will be it self too. For it will not endure but to be, as it seems. And I desire you would bespeak your <hi>Companies</hi> fairly. Both, because I presume, most men There in their generous and liberal Education will be such lovers of <hi>Order,</hi> that they will run to the practice: And because I heartily desire, that as I am chosen <hi>Chancellour</hi> with a great deal of unexpected Love; so I may be enabled ever to Govern with a like measure of it. My heart ever was, and I hope ever shall be, set to do That Place all the good I can. And I shall take it for one of God's greatest Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

blessings upon me, if I may have your joint Concurrence to perfect the good I wish. And I will not doubt, but that you do so love and honour That our Venerable Mother, that you will cheerfully afford me This assistance.</p>
                     <p>When you have made this Entrance for <hi>Formalities</hi> at the Act, (for which I now give time and warning) then the better to settle them, and all other Points of Government, I pray take care to go on with the Delegacy for the <hi>Statutes,</hi> that there may be a setled and a Known Body of them. My ever honoured Predecessour began That work with Care. I know, you will give me leave to pursue it to your good and His honour. In the next long <hi>Vacation</hi> it were happy, if that <hi>Body of Statutes</hi> might be finish'd. But whether it can or not, I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray you against <hi>Michaelmas Term</hi> look the Register, and provide such Tables, as were wont to be published upon <hi>S. Mary's</hi> doors, for observance of the known Statutes, and that then you proceed to the execution of them accordingly.</p>
                     <p>I know, you and the Governours There will pardon me this Care, when you shall know what lies upon me here, and what begins alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be expected from me by a most Gracious Prince, who is very Zelous of the honour of That Place. And this yet I shall promise and perform. I will not be sudden upon you, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>AFter my hearty Commendations &amp;c. This is the first Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <note place="margin">My first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Convocation.</note> which I have had to trouble the Convocation. And before I begin with the Business, I think it very fit to give you all very hearty thanks for the great Love and undeserved Favour, which you would needs bestow upon me, quite beyond my Expectation, and cross to my desires. Yet since it hath pleased God so to dispose both of you and me in this business, I shall endeavour to the utmost of my power to answer your expectation, and to discharge the burden of this Honour to as much advantage of That Venerable Mother of my self and you, as the best understanding I have can lead me to. And whensoever any thing shall come to your knowledge, in which I may do That Body service, I hope you will not fail to acquaint me with it, and in such time as the opportunity of doing what is fit may not be lost. Else I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54616:11"/>
may be disenabled to serve you by your own default. But these are but Verbal Thanks; and I have desired to be as real as I might; and therefore shall trouble you with no more of this.</p>
                     <p>The Business I am to acquaint you with is, to let you know, that <note place="margin">A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </hi> bestowed upon the <hi>Hebrew=Reader:</hi> Whose Patent I caused to be sent, and approved by you, before I would suffer the Seal to pass. And now it is pass't, and That Place so both enriched and honoured, I hope you will take care that the <hi>Reader</hi> thereof, as well as the rest, do the Duty of his Place. For the study of That Language is too much neglected, and not without the great prejudice both of That Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity and the Church.</p>
                     <p>Since this, I have received from you the Book of Verses in honour of the Prince, which I have likewise delivered to his Majesty, with a full representation of your humble and dutiful Respects to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and of your hearty Prayers both for himself and his Royal Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Which he, with all Grace and Favour accepted. I could hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily have wish'd, the Book had been here any time of the last week, that it might have prevented the <hi>Christning.</hi> But howsoever, 'tis very welcome Now.</p>
                     <p>It is not long, since I writ to Mr. Vicechancellour about some care <note place="margin">The observing of Formalities.</note> to be taken for <hi>Formalities,</hi> both against the Act, and so after to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at <hi>Michaelmas Term.</hi> And I make no doubt, but all men will be willing to continue the honour of That Place, and in That kind. It is the <hi>Hedg</hi> and the <hi>Fence</hi> of those things, which are of far greater consequence. In those Letters I omitted one thing, which I think fit now to be remember'd. It is a great Abuse, and long continued against the Degree of a <hi>Master of Arts.</hi> I know, 'tis very fit, that <hi>That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> upon which the Orders of the University do so much rely, both in Convocations, Congregations, and elsewhere, should be had in more esteem than it is. But this can no ways so well be done, as by their due Obedience to Governours in their several Places, and by their own Valuing and Esteeming themselves above all Inferiours. And for my part, I shall do my best to keep up the price they set upon themselves. For 'tis a great dishonour to That Place, that in all Publick Assemblies, yea and when they meet in open street, <hi>Bachelours of Art,</hi> nay <hi>Boys,</hi> will not know their places. I hope, the Delegacy will so order the <hi>Statutes,</hi> which they have in hand (to the lasting honour of my most Worthy and Honourable Predecessour) as that the <hi>Degree</hi> of a Master of Arts shall hereafter be better esteemed in That Place; which is the only way to recover the ancient Credit of it Abroad.</p>
                     <p>The last thing which I have at this time to recommend unto you, is, <note place="margin">The not spoll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Game.</note> that you would All be careful, that the University may stand right in his Majesties Good Opinion for not spoiling His Game. There was very lately a Complaint made to me about it: and I, fearing the worst, writ to the Vicechancellour: But he gave me so discreet and so sufficient an Answer, that I not only did, but had cause to think all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54616:12"/>
was well. Since this, I find that Complaint, or some other, hath gone farther. I heartily pray you therefore to take the best care you can, especially You, that are Governours and in Office, to look to the Abuses tho, and then with Gods assistance I will take care, that no man's <hi>sinister</hi> Report shall do you prejudice Here. Thus not doubting of the Love, and Affection, the Care, and the Moderation of any man for the Good and the Honour of That most noble Body; I leave you all to the Grace of God, and shall ever rest,</p>

               <p>AGainst the beginning of your Term, and so for Direction of all the year, I shall be bold to give you these few Advertisements following, till the <hi>Statutes</hi> may be perfected.</p>
               <p>First, I pray keep it in memory with the Heads, that there be no <note place="margin">Certain Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements given the Vicechancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour at Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note> more <hi>Gowns</hi> made out of the ancient Fashion of the University. Secondly, That no Man have his Degree, till he hath done all his Exercise, under what pretence soever. Thirdly, That you admit none to <hi>Cumulate.</hi> Fourthly, That no man be suffer'd to proceed <hi>Bachelour</hi> of Divinity that is not Master of Arts, unless he have staid full 14 years, since his being Bachelour of Arts: nor any <hi>Bachelour</hi> of Law to be Bachelour of Divinity, unless he have spent as many years in the University, as he should have done, if he had gone the longer and the more chargeable way by the Arts. Last of all, You shall do very well to make <hi>Congregations</hi> fewer, and let them draw their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

together, and not trouble the whole University and your self so often for every Boy's business.</p>
               <p>I pray, be strict in these; and if it be the cause, you have fewer <hi>Doctors</hi> the next year, the matter is not great. For if there be none for a year or two, there are enough already for a longer time. And for my part, I am as willing there should be none, as to have the University disordered by them.</p>
               <p>THis day I received a complaint from <hi>Oxford,</hi> concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, <note place="margin">An Order De accumulandis Gradibus. <hi>Octob. 11. 1630.</hi>
                  </note> which I had advised should be put upon <hi>Dispensations,</hi> which were then grown too common in all kinds, to the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the University. But in the consideration of this Point there arose some Debate concerning the Dispensatiens <hi>de accumulandis Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus,</hi> by reason, that some were come to the University to <hi>Accumulate,</hi> which dwelt in remoter parts, and were now ready to do their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, and could not be sent back without their Degrees, but it must needs tend to their great disreputation, charge, and prejudice. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof there was earnest suit made to me by Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> then the Kings Professour in Divinity, and by Mr. <hi>Bell,</hi> Esquire-Bedell in Arts, that this restraint <hi>de accumulandis Gradibus</hi> might not be sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly put upon the University: but that there might be a Day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd and warning given, that so no man might be taken upon the suddain; As appears by Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> his Letter, which hereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. In the mean time I presenty settled this Difficulty with such a moderate Restraint as in short time effected, what I intended, and presently took off all further muttering in the University.</p>

                     <p>I Received Letters from you this week. They found me at home <note place="margin">
                           <hi>My Answer to Dr.</hi> Prideaux <hi>his Letter</hi> de accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulandis gradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note> under some Indisposition of body by reason of a Cold caught in my Court-Attendance. I thank you heartily for your Love, and expression of readiness to join in the necessary upholding of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that famous University, whose flourishing shall ever be the first and at the highest in my desires.</p>
                     <p>For the particular you mention <hi>de Accumulandis gradibus,</hi> I am not only content, but thank you for your Interposition: Because as my desire is to Propose nothing, but that which is Just and Honourable for that Place; so I am very willing to Propose it in such manner, as no man of quality may have just cause to except against.</p>
                     <p>In my Indisposition (of which I am not yet free) I must crave your pardon to be Brief, and not write that over again, which I have written in that Point to Mr. Vicechancellour, who, I think, will call you and the rest of the Heads again, and read my Answer, which I make no doubt will settle this business. Yet this I must tell you, Mr. <hi>Balye</hi> (howsoever you write an honest and an able Gentleman) hath very far and more ways than one forgotten himself to Mr. <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellour,</hi> and not spared me. For my part I pity his <hi>Passion,</hi> and shall pass it by, if Mr. <hi>Vicechancellour</hi> be satisfied. And this I do for his <hi>Father's</hi> sake, and in hope, that he will make this his Warning; else I would quickly make him know, that my Proposals there are far from Tricks to catch him or any others. You shall discharge your Love to his Father, and your Care of him very freely, if you shall chide him into better Temper.</p>

The main of my Answer I hope you will expect from Mr. Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellour, in regard of my present Weakness. And I shall end in a constant belief, that for the Government of the University, and all necessaries incident thereunto, I shall find you very ready and real, as you promise. For which, as I now give you thanks, so of it I shall be ready to give you testimony; and for it to shew you all such respects, as may be due, or fit from the Place I bear; and with as much Favour, as to any Governour in that place. So I leave you to the Grace of God, and shall rest,</p>

                     <p>IT seems there are but two rubbs appearing in this first Meeting. <note place="margin">A Clause of my Letters to the Vicechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour <hi>de sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione Gradûs Baccalur. in SS. Theologiâ. Octob.</hi> 15. 1630.</note> The one about a Statute for nine years allowed (it seems) for men not Masters of Arts to be Bachelours in Divinity. I pray search, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be such a Statute or no. If there be not, I think it fit my Order should hold. If there be, I will not violate it; but think it very fit, it should be abrogated. For since seven years is required of a Master of Arts, and Resident in the University, where he may study; I think fourteen years is little enough for a Bachelour of Arts or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-graduate abroad, who as he went away young, and with less grounds of Learning; so his time being taken up in preaching, must needs be less able for Controversy-learning. And this is all I shall say for That.</p>
                     <p>For Cumulation, I must needs profess, I never lik'd it. And it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, <note place="margin">De gradibus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulandis.</note> of and in it self, an unnecessary Delay of the first Degree, or a needless Hast of the Second. There are two things objected, which makes me take it into second consideration. The one is, that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity Records have been search'd, and that time out of mind Cumulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been admitted, yea and sometimes by a Statute, provided, that all Exercise for both Degrees were performed. I pray therefore, desire in my name so much patience of the Heads, as to have these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords viewed by all or some of them appointed thereto by your selves. And if you find it so, then I shall be contented to do, as hereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. But give me leave to tell you by the way, That though I dislike Cumulations in themselves, yet I do it much more for that, which I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54616:15"/>
observed, when I was so happy, as to live among you. For then it was common (and some are yet living who Cumulated so) either quite to Dispense with the Exercise of Bachelour of Divinity, (which is the great and necessary exercise of the Town) or turn it but into a Sermon Neither of which I shall endure.</p>
                     <p>The other is, that if I intend to hold the strictness of this Course, it might seem fit, that a time had been prefixt, before it be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that so no man might be taken upon the sudden, as Mr. <hi>Balye</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hodges</hi> are reported to be. To this, I must needs confess, that a long Custom, though never so bad, especially if time out of mind, should have a Warning-peal before 'its dissolution, and that no man should be struck on the sudden. My Answer therefore is, that either I did give warning at the last Act to the former worthy and careful Vicechancellour, or else very fulness of it in my thoughts thrust it out, and made me believe I had written it, if I have not. And which of these is true, my bad Memory will not ascertain me. Next therefore I think it very fit, there should be both a time prefixt, and notice given. Both which I shall thus far leave to your consideration. First then, because the Records are with you, I pray call the Heads, and view them touching this point of Cumulation. Then if you find the Wisdom of our Ancestors in former times, when Government was stricter, and Degrees not so frequent, to have allow'd them, I shall then leave you fairly to represent, what you find and think. Provided, that there be no Dispensation for any Exercise, the least, but that all be done as Statute requires. And provided likewise, that none be admitted to Cumulate upon any pretence, that are resident in the University, or that live within 30 miles, and may so come without great either trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or charge. And whatsoever you shall upon view of these Records by mutuas consent agree unto, I shall not without great reason vary from. And at this Meeting you may take it into deliberation, what is fit to be done for Mr. <hi>Balye</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hodges.</hi> For I have no will to prejudice any man upon a sudden. Neither did any man give me the least notice, that Mr. <hi>Balye</hi> liv'd at charge in town for that purpose. And for notice given, I know not what more can be done, than that Publication of it be in every College, that so they, which are abroad, may know by their Residing friends, what to trust to.</p>

by, as being able to supply, by word of mouth, such circumstances, as I may chance to omit, and your Lordship be willing to be informed of. We are All bound to praise God, and to pray for the Continuance of Your Happiness, that so throughly set your thoughts to Reform that, which is amiss amongst us, and to recover that Lustre of the University which latter times had somewhat neglected.

Fourteen years might well be required (as your Lordship intimates) in Supplicants of That condition. And if so they Pass, it may be held a Favour. Mr. <hi>Balye</hi> accounts himself made by your Lordship's Goodness. He hath been well chid, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his folly to Mr. Vice-Chancellour, who, he hopes, is satisfied. That <note place="margin">The Act Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</note> untoward Question the last Act was never approv'd by me, in those terms it pass'd, but I stand not to execute. Now I understand by your Loving and Fatherly Advertisement, what will be expected of me, I shall by God's Grace take a Care hereafter, that no such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Exception be given. Two things yet remain concerning my Place, which I make bold to tender also to your judicious consideration. The neglect of Divinity disputations for Term these five years last past, through tergiversations of the Actors. And the Proceeding of divers in Law of late, to the prejudice of Divinity.

Which God (who well saw the weightiness of the work) would, should be no other than your Lordship's, though your Lordship would not. There were others more Powerful: Your Lordship would have been our Friend however. It would be envious, you were sickly, and the like. But the Infallible Eye saw you, and what it purposed to effect by you, whilst you walked thus under the Fig-trees (that we may so speak) and Covert of your excuses. Truly it was strange to see such backwardness at the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and yet now such Readiness and Skill in the Execution. We see it, and must with all gratefulness acknowledge, amongst your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold and great Occasions both for Church and State, no pains spared, no opportunity omitted, either by Word or Letter, that may any way advance the business in hand. From this Zeal of your Lordship to Learning and the welfare of the University, there is no ingenious breast amongst us, but takes fire, and would be glad to be seen though amidst the dependance of so worthy an Enterprize. Our selves, in an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Distance, are even angry with our selves, that we have not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to signifi'd to your Lordship our forwardness in our Places. But now we assure your Lordship, as we have not been altogether negligent for the time past, so from henceforward to be industrious in what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us, in taking notice of Formalities, in laying hands upon the reigns and liberty of Dispensations, and looking to the performance of other Duties. As for the point of Dispensations, and Proceeding of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelours, which now draws on, somewhat it may seem to be out of the way of the Proctours. But it is so poor a thing to the Universal

good, that we would request your Lordship, not to entertain so much as a thought, that we make the least account of it. And since we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand your Lordship's Desire, we shall put on resolution to make stop of all manner of Dispensations (we mean for defect of time, or of that nature) and this without any mincing of the matter, or deriving the Cause or Envy farther, than our selves. Truly it would be a foul Shame for any, more for us, to be found either backward or luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm to Good Order, when our Chancellour himself is seen to press so nobly for it. Besides the reward, that we may look for, that when in after-ages your Lordship's Honours shall be recorded, and this Reformation amongst the rest, I, and amongst the chiefest, (O it hath a <hi>Genius,</hi> and must live!) we also may claim to have our Names read for those, in the time and circuit of whose office so great a work was undertaken.

And the rather, because I find, that the Right Honourable my late Predecessour, the Lord <hi>Steward</hi> upon view of these Writings, declared in a Letter of his, the Right to be in the College. And for that the Provost and Fellows of <hi>Queen's College</hi> have not only made this Claim to their Right of Choice, but have also from time to time made actual Choice of the several Principals succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, whensoever That Place hath been void, and have at this time made their humble suit unto me for Confirmation of their Right: I am very willing to preserve this their Right unto them: And do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Pray and Require you, as my Deputy there, to give Mr. <hi>Ayrie,</hi> whom the Provost and Fellows have lately Chosen, Admission into the Principality of the said Hall, and all such Rights, as are thereunto belonging.

In my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessour's time.</note> Treatise touching the Question of Bowing at the Name of JESUS, an Argument, wherein Mr. <hi>Widdowes</hi> foolishly, and Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> scurrilously, have already, to the scandal and disquiet of the Church, exercised their Pens. His Grace hath formerly shew'd his dislike of them both, and hearing, that you take up the Bucklers in a Theme of so small necessity, and of so great heat and distemper, which will draw on new Replies, (for <hi>Prinne</hi> will not sit down, as an idle Spectatour) and beget bitterness and intestine contestations at home amongst our selves, he is much offended, that you do stickle and keep on foot such questions, which may better be spoiled and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced, than maintain'd and draw into sideings and partakings. And therefore I am wish'd to advise you to withdraw your self from these or the like domestick broils; and if your Treatise be at the Press, to give it a stop and check, and by no means to suffer the same to be divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For if you do, notwithstanding this Admonition, proceed in the same intention of publishing it, you will repent you, and perhaps draw more on your self of trouble and discontent, than you will reap Credit or Advantage by the pursuance of so useless an Argument. If

you were out of your Cell, and saw the World abroad, you would not meddle with things of this nature, wherein the Governours and chief Pilots of the Church discern more harm and tempest to the Church, than you, that are unacquainted with Ecclesiastical Estate, and the well ordering of it, can any way by Speculation attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; no more, than a Scholar, that can read a Lecture of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orical Musick, is able to play on a Lute or a Viol by his Bookish Rules, and proportions of Sounds, which are there taught.

                     <p>AFter my hearty Commendations, &amp;c. I have made all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient <note place="margin">My Letters sent with his Majesties to the University about Fees. <hi>July</hi> 4. 1631.</note> speed I can, (as you well know) to have the Body of the Statutes of the University digested into Order, and made fit for present use, as occasions might be offer'd, and still heartily pray you for the quickning of that work. For by that Delay, which hath been made, a great inconvenience hath been like to arise to the prejudice of the Privileges of the University. For whereas I thought the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ordering of <hi>Fees</hi> in the University, if any thing be amiss there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, might have staid, till that Body of Statutes had been drawn up, and then have been rectifi'd under the Head belonging to it; it seem's now far otherwise. For I find, that a Friend of the University's gave intimation to some Heads of Colleges of some things, which might be very prejudicial to your Privileges, if they did proceed. I knew his Majesty had given out a <hi>Commission</hi> to Examine <hi>Fees,</hi> and that the Commissioners were quick and strict; but I had never seen the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; nor did I so much as dream, that the Universities were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; or that his Majesty had any purpose, they should that way be look'd into. And therefore when Dr. <hi>Bancroft</hi> came unto me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Mr. Vice-Chancellour and divers of the Heads of Houses upon the aforesaid information, to make search after the <hi>Commission,</hi> and privately to acquaint me with it, and to desire my Endeavour with his Majesty, that no foreign Commission might come in, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the University Privilege; I was much troubled at it. And the more, because I found, things had been so privately carry'd from the knowledge of the <hi>Chancellours</hi> of both Universities. But it fell out exceeding well, that I had notice of this business. For within few days after, my Lord of <hi>Holland,</hi> upon like Information, had speech with me about it. But his Majesties resolutions for proceeding put us both to seek what course to take, till at last we resolved to go Both together to him, and humbly to move him in the University's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, that no <hi>Foreign Power</hi> might be sent to the prejudice of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. And after much Debate, his Majesty was at last very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleass'd to grant our requests: Provided, that each University respectively would meet, and by themselves reform, whatsoever was found amiss in any Fees received and taken by any in the University, of what Office or Condition soever. And that this <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Fees should be made according to the Letter and Tenour of his Commission. Hereupon he presently called for Mr. Secretary <hi>Cook,</hi> and commanded him to direct a Letter to the <hi>Chancellours</hi> of both the Universities, to give them Order for this business. Which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his Majesty you shall find here inclosed: And the like are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">His Majesties Letters to be Register'd</note> gone to <hi>Cambridge.</hi> And I must, and do pray and require you, that they be published according to Course, and Register'd, and Obey'd in all Points, as is fitting: Assuring you, that if this be not done, his Majesties Commissioners will reform whatsoever you do not. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54616:19"/>
And for my part, I think 'tis happy we came so timely to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it. For if the Commissioners had once entred upon it, it would have been a matter of far greater difficulty to take them off, than it was now to stay them. And certainly, if ever it be my hap to know That honourable Personage, that gave the first Information I shall give him hearty Thanks for his Love to the Universities. For this breach once made upon your Privileges might have laid open a wider gap in many other particulars of like nature.</p>
                     <p>When you have Register'd these Letters of his Majesty, I must pray you to send the <hi>Original</hi> back to me. And for the Business it self, because his Majesty look's for a speedy reformation, the best Counsel I can give you is this: That the <hi>Delegates,</hi> which have the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The <hi>Delegates</hi> to settle present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Business of Fees.</note> of the Statutes now before them, may, by your direction and command, take the Head about Fees next into Consideration, and settle that business presently, that the other University may not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strip us in Obedience to his Majesty.</p>
                     <p>Thus not doubting of your Care herein, nor of the University's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; and expecting as present remedy of this Abuse, as may be made, I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest,</p>

Counsellour, We greet you well. We have long had a gracious Intendment for the good of our Subjects to rectifie the Proceedings of all Courts and other Places, as well within Liberties as without, in matter of their Fees and Duties which they Challenge. To this purpose We have granted a Commission to some Lords of our <hi>Privy Council</hi> and others, to Examine what they find amiss, that a remedy may be found for the Abuse, where and in whomsoever it is, and the Fees of all Officers, and Courts reduced to that which they were found to be allow'd in the Eleventh year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memory: And this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission we shall pursue, till we have setled those things with Honour and Justice to the great ease of all our Loving Subjects. Now whereas you, taking notice of this our Intendment to reduce the Fees of both our Universities, (where you are our Chancellours) as well as other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the same Standard, have made humble suit to Us, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission may not trench upon the Liberties granted to the Universities by our Royal Progenitors: These are first to let you know, that We will as carefully preserve the Rights and Privileges of our Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as We or our Progenitors have given or confirmed them: And then, that our further VVill and Pleasure is, that presently (to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our Commission) you write expresly to your Deputy-Governours in either University, to VVill and Require them in Our Name, to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and reduce all Fees given to Officers, Readers, Bedels, Registers, or others, for Degrees, or any thing else, to That quantity which they bore in the said Eleventh year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For the Abuse is great and burdensome unto them, which bring up their Sons in Learning: And We will remedy it by Our Commission, if you (according to your Places) do not see it remedy'd to our hands. And We are the more Careful for Our Universities; Because we have not forgotten, that Our Royal <hi>Father</hi> of ever blessed Memory gave Bountiful Gifts to supply divers wants There, which We assure Our self were not given, but with an intent, that when they were possessed, the Fees should lessen, at least return to that just proportion, to which we have limited them in our Commission. So We grant your Suit, not to break the Liberties of our Universities, by sending another Power upon them: But withal, We require you both, to send to our several Universities rsepectively, that VVe may have present Redress of this Abuse; and that a Table may be made according to the elevene th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and hung up in the Congregation, and in some convenient place in every College and Hall, that every man may know, what Fees he is to pay, and no man presume to take beyond the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance in that Table, as he will answer it at his Peril: And we shall look

Which Statutes of this Delegacy, and the Appeals were they once settled, would ease half of the business of the University, and repay all the pains that is or can be taken about them. Next, I pray call the Heads together, and give them warning concerning their several Companies, That no man of what degree soever (and therefore much less Youths) be suffered to go in Boots and Spurs together with their Gowns. And if any Head of a House permit it in his own College, whither my Authority reaches not, I shall complain where he will be unwilling to Answer.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54616:24"/>
That both the <hi>Proctours</hi> should in the next Convocation resign their Offices, and Two other of the same Colleges be put in their Places: And that <hi>Thomas Ford</hi> of <hi>Magdalen-hall, Giles Thorne</hi> of <hi>Baliol</hi> College, and <hi>John Hodges</hi> of <hi>Exeter</hi> College, should be banish'd the University: And that Doctor <hi>Prideaux,</hi> Rector of <hi>Exeter</hi> College, and Dr. <hi>Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> Principal of <hi>Magdalen,</hi> should then and there receive, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King and the Lords, a publick and sharp Reprehension for their misgovernment and countenancing the <hi>Factious</hi> Parties. The Lord Viscount <hi>Dorchester,</hi> then Principal Secretary of State, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to deliver this Sentence from the King, which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and gave the Reprehension as was enjoyned: The King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self then publickly Declaring, that Dr. <hi>Prideanx</hi> deserved to lose his Place more than any of the rest, but was content to spare him, partly because he had been His ancient Servant, and hoped he would look better to himself for the future, and partly because I intreated Favour for him. As for <hi>Francis Hide,</hi> who had been Proctor the former year, and was as <hi>mutinous</hi> as any of the rest, he was out of the University when the Summons came for their Appearance before the King, and so kept himself till the Hearing was past: Yet nevertheless so much appeared against him, as that afterwards he was glad to come in, and make his submission, that he might escape so. Then his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty commanded Secretary <hi>Dorchester</hi> to write a Letter for Him to Sign, and to be sent to the University, and in <hi>Convocation</hi> to require the performance of this Sentence in every particular. This Letter was written and sent accordingly; and the Tenor of it follows in <hi>haec verba.</hi>

                     <p>TRusty and wellbeloved, We greet you well. Having at full <note place="margin">His Majesties Letter sent to the University after the great Hearing at <hi>Woodstock, Aug.</hi> 24. 1631.</note> length, and with good Deliberation, heard the Cause concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the late great Disorders and Disobedience to Government in That Our University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and being moved by the greatness of the offences to Punish some persons according to their several Demerits, and to Order some things for the more settled and constant Government of That our University hereafter: Our Will and Pleasure is, That you forthwith upon the receipt hereof, call a Convocation for performing and registring these Our Sentences and Decrees, as followeth.</p>
                     <p>And first, We pronounce your <hi>Appeal</hi> to be just, And return <hi>Tho.</hi>

Secondly, Because the <hi>Proctours,</hi> which should have been Assistants <note place="margin">The Proctours <hi>Bruche</hi> and <hi>Doughty</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> to the Vicechancellour, and Helps for upholding of Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, have most unworthily behaved themselves in countenancing all manner of Disobedience, in receiving <hi>Appeals</hi> in case of manifest perturbation and breach of Peace, and by their cunning practicing after these Appeals received, especially <hi>Thorne's,</hi> whose Contumacy was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, and his Sermon base: Therefore for them, Our Pleasure and Command is, as was yesterday delivered unto themselves, that they shall presently resign their Office in Convocation according to Course, as if their year had been fully expired, and the two Colleges, of which they are, may name two others to succeed in their Office the rest of the year, to be chosen and settled according to your late Statutes made in that behalf. And for the Execution of this, you are (as we have before order'd) presently to call a Convocation, and publish this Our Sentence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For <hi>Francis Hyde</hi> of <hi>Christchureh,</hi> and <hi>Richard Hill</hi> of <hi>Brazen Nose,</hi> we require, that so soon as they return to Our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, <note place="margin">

                     <p>Now for the things which we think fit to settle presently in That Government, they are these.</p>
                     <p>First, VVe Command, that if the Vicechancellour for the time being <note place="margin">Every man to give in a true Copy of his Sermon at the Demand of the Vicechancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Oath.</note> think fit to call for any Man's Sermon, which upon his own hearing, or complaint made by any other, seems <hi>offensive</hi> in any kind, the <hi>Party</hi> of what <hi>Degree</hi> soever he be, shall deliver a true and perfect <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py</hi> to the Vicechancellour upon <hi>Oath,</hi> which when he hath perused, he shall Convent him, if he find cause, either by the Statute of <hi>Le cester,</hi> (as it is call'd) or by the later Statute of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Secondly, That if the Vicechancellour find cause to Command any man <note place="margin">Any man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Prison by the Vicechancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to submit</note> to <hi>Prison,</hi> the <hi>Party</hi> so Commanded and sent by a Beadle, shall (for so the Statutes require) presently submit, and go quietly to <hi>Prison:</hi> And if they do not, That Refusal shall be as a Breach of the Peace, and not have any Appeal</p>

                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:54616:25"/>
Thirdly, We Command, that the Delegates, which at this present <note place="margin">The <hi>Delegates</hi> commanded to draw up the first two Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Appeals before they Proceed.</note> are in hand with the Statutes, make all the speed that possibly they can, for the finishing of that Great and Excellent Work; yet so as that present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they lay all other Statutes aside, till they have drawn up two Perfect and sufficient Statutes for Causes of Appeal, the one in matters of Instance, and those things, that belong to the Chancellour's Court There; the other for all kind of Appeals in other Causes whatsoever; and that they keep as near to the ancient Statutes of our University as possibly they can, so as they may also meet with all the present Inconveniences. And likewise that they presently draw up the form of <note place="margin">A weekly Meeting every <hi>Monday</hi> of the Heads of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and Halls.</note> another Statute for the weekly Meeting every <hi>Monday</hi> in Term and out of Term of all the Heads of Colleges and Halls, that shall be in Town, to consider of the Peace and Government of our University, as occasion, may arise: That so all things may be deliberately put (when there is Cause) to the Convocation according to such Directions, as we shall give to your Chancellour, from whom you shall receive them. And these Our Letters shall be your sufficient Warrant on this behalf. Given under Our Signet, at Our Honour of <hi>Woodstock</hi> the 24th day of <hi>August</hi> in the seventh year of Our Reign. <hi>1631.</hi>

In confidence, that through these Clouds by your Lordship's goodness and mediation the Royal favour of my

most gracious and blessed Sovereign will shine upon me. <hi>Nemo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiens erubescit,</hi> saith <hi>Tertul.</hi> No man is ashamed to relate the story of his offence, when he is come to himself, and begins to thrive in the way of a better opinion and judgment. It hath been my great grief and misery, but to be thought to be possessed with that damned Spirit of opposition, which in Publick exercise I have cryed down and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, or to give fire to any <hi>factious Spirit</hi> to rebel against Authority and the breath of Heaven. <hi>Omnis sermo ad forensem famam à domesticis emanat authoribus,</hi> saith the Orator. I know no malice can truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Credit of my words. I thank my God, I have been often an occasion of Peace, and quietness within my College; Never was before engaged in any such mad affront, for which I shall ever condemn my self upon the Theater of my own Conscience, and suspect my Leaders. How easy a thing is it for some men in some eminent and leading places to give occasion to quiet and temperate Spirits to Rebel against their own Conscience and ingenuity! Therefore (saith St. <hi>Austin</hi>) might the Example of <hi>Cato</hi> have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, when he slew himself, <hi>Non quia solus id fecerat,</hi> not because he alone had done so, <hi>Sed quia vir doctus &amp; probus habebatur,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was esteemed to be a learned and an honest Man. Two glorious Titles, which touch and confine the hearts and affections of all good men, if they sometimes prove not false fires, to delude the World and cheat the weaker in their opinions. I must not much trespass upon your Lordship's many serious and weighty affairs. How glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would I enlarge and unbowel my self in any Style of true and hearty submission! <hi>Mihi fama posthac vilius constabit.</hi> So beseeching the continuance of your Lordship's favourable respect, and good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of me, I shall be ever bound to pray for your Lordship's prosperity and happiness.</p>

                     <p>IT hath added some degrees more to my Sorrows, that I have not <note place="margin">Another Letter of Mr. <hi>Hill's</hi> to me about Dr. <hi>Prideaux.</hi>

                     <p>True it is, that the Example of Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> my Father (whom with Reverence I am to name) too much ruled within my breast. For I could not in any Charity believe, that he, who had been so often Vice-Chancellour, would any way seem to betray or mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Authority and Power of that place. Besides (that every man may rather bear his own burthen) I confess that my own fancy doted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54616:26"/>
so much upon that late 8th Edict, mistaking it both in its end and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. For it is impossible that any one Decree can in it self be so round and full; as to meet so closely with all manner of Offenders in all circumstances and several Degrees of offences: much less seem any way to confine and bind the hands of authority from punishing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to discretion, even by virtue also of that general statute of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which sweetly runs through all, and indeed is the golden Chain or main tye and link of all.</p>
                     <p>By this, may it please your good Lordship, there was no malice here, but Error, and such an Error, that begot both in my self and others a strange mad stupidity, that one among ten could not be able, or so happy upon the suddain to look up to that power which is the rule and perfection, the life and Crown of all.

                     <p>AFter my hearty Commendations, &amp;c. I am very sorry, that I have <note place="margin">My Letters to the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the disorders in the Schools the last Lent.</note> this Occasion to write to the University, which I love so well, that it cannot but trouble me to hear of any thing ill done in it. I have divers ways heard, what disorders and tumults have accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the publick Disputations toward the end of the last Lent, to the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54616:28"/>
great scandal of the University, and tending to the breach of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there. The noise of these great Disorders was like enough of it self to be heard far, and to add to this Unhappiness, these Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours were then committed, when they might be seen by some, which meant not to conceal them. Insomuch that the report of them is come to his Majesties Ears, who is highly displeased with this ill carriage, and the more, because he thought the care and the pains, which he lately took to settle some breaches of Government there, would not so soon have been forgotten, as it seems to him they are. Upon this his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty hath directed his Princely Letters to me, and by them required me to look both to the punishment of these Distempers and the preventing of the like hereafter. According to these his Majesties Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands I do pray and require you, Mr. Vice-Chancellour, and the rest of the Governours to look carefully to your several Charges, both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private, not only for the Honour of the University, (which it seems by some is too much neglected) but also because I find his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty so resolved, that he will have a severe Course held against any Governours, as well as others, that shall be proved faulty. And that this may appear, I have sent you here his Majestie's Letters to me, which are to be read in open Convocation, that the whole University may know, how distasteful these Courses are to his Majesty, and how prejudicial they may be to your selves. And I do heartily pray you all, that hereafter, not only in Disputations, but upon all other Occurrences whatsoever, you uphold the Honour and Government of that Place, and spare no man, that shall be proved an Offender against either. And for my part, if nothing else will serve, I shall take the best course I can to see Justice done, and Example made, where there is cause; Neither can I go off from this opinion, That the younger sort would easily be reduced into better order, if all the Governours did that, which in Conscience and Duty they are bound unto. And I will hope, that all, whom this may any ways concern, will hereafter be careful of the good of the University, the honour of themselves, and their Credit with his Majesty, which certainly can neither be gained nor held by such breaches upon Government. So praying you to take care of these things, I leave you to Gods gracious protection, and shall ever rest,</p>

                     <p>RIght trusty and well beloved Counsellour, and Right Reverend <note place="margin">His Majestie's Letters to me about the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults in <hi>Lent</hi> Disputations.</note> Father in God, We greet you well. We had reason to expect, that our own Princely care and former admonitions had sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated that our Vniversity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> whereof you, as Our Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, have the Charge. Nevertheless We understand, that the late <hi>Lent</hi> Exercises in their Schooles have been carried in such disorder, that if at the instance of the Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour had not excused the Bachellours of that House from answering in their turn, there had followed much mischeif, which Discretion of theirs we well approve. For tho' a Vertuous Emulation to whet the Industry of Scholars be not to be discouraged, yet it must always be governed, so as it may not proceed to Animosities and factious Contestat ions of young and hot heads, which will breed Combustion and publick distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in the end, if due prevention be not used. We therefore require you, not only to give present Order for suppression of these or the like Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults; but also to see, that the Authors be punished according to their deserts. And if upon due examination you find, that any Master of a College, or other Superiour, hath been Actor or Encourager herein, or hath not done his Duty in containing the Scholars from these Distempers. Let him know, that We shall hold him unworthy of that Trust, and will not spare to punish him as We shall see cause. Given at Our Palace at <hi>VVestminster</hi> this <hi>12.</hi> day of <hi>April 1632.</hi> in the eighth year of Our Reign.</p>

In the whole course of that his Government, he hath carried himself with a great deal of fidelity to the University, and a great deal of care and moderation in the managing of so many troublesome businesses, as have fallen in his time; yet notwithstanding these and his other abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for the discharge of that place, I am resolved to name another to you: both because among so many worthy and able men, as are with you, I would not pass by all the rest continually to overload any one. And because I am very desirous to divide the Experience, as well as the pains of that service among the Heads of Colleges, to the end there may still be some, that may be acquainted with the Burthen and weight of that Office, and able the better to assist such, as must newly enter upon it. At this time upon very due Consideration I have thought fit to name Dr. <hi>Duppa,</hi> Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> to be Vice-Chancellour for this year ensuing, whom I know to be a discreet, able, and worthy man for that place, and one, that will satisfie my Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and yours. These are therefore to pray and require you to allow of this my Nomination and Choice of Dr. <hi>Duppa,</hi> and to give him your best advice and assistance in all such Businesses, as may concern the good Government, and consequently the Honour of the University.

In the mean time it will be enough against the Plea of ignorance to declare upon all occasions the <hi>Five Articles</hi> controverted by the Remonstrants, are the Doctrines, for a time not to be meddled with, that the Factions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily spread amongst our Neighbours may not infect this our Church, or break the Peace of it. There is somewhat else considerable also, which I think not very fit to write. But to this, if you have any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, you may return me what Answer you please.</p>

                     <p>AFter my hearty Commendations, &amp;c. Upon occasion of difference <note place="margin">My Letters to the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Patent for Printing.</note> between <hi>Lichfeild</hi> and <hi>Turner</hi> about their Printing, there was cause given me to look into your Charters, what power the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity had for Printing, and how many Printers were allow'd unto you. Upon search I cannot find any Grant at all, so that Custom is the best Warrant you have for that Privilege. Your great Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. hath no mention at all of it: But <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which had the like <hi>Charter,</hi> found that defect in it, and repaired to the King again, and obtained another particular <hi>Charter</hi> for Printing only; which is very large, and of great honour and benefit to that University. Where by the way give me leave to tell you, that they of <hi>Cambridge</hi> have been far more vigilant both to get and keep their Privileges, than you at <hi>Oxford</hi> have been, for they have gotten this and other of their Privileges confirmed by succeeding Princes, and I think some of them by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> which for <hi>Oxford</hi> hath not been done. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consideration of this I thought it very just and equal, that the two Universities should enjoy the same Privileges, especially for <hi>Printing.</hi> And when I had weighed all Circumstances, I adventured to move his Majesty on your behalf, who, according to his great and princely favour to the University, did most graciously grant it: The <hi>motives,</hi> which Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed were principally two, the one that you might enjoy this privilege for Learning equally with <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and the other, that having many excellent <hi>Manuscripts</hi> in your <hi>Library,</hi> you might in time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be encouraged to publish some of them in <hi>Print,</hi> to the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Place, this Church and Kingdom. And now upon the Grant of the like <hi>Patent,</hi> I doubt not, but you will enter into some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Consideration among your selves, how you may set the <hi>Press</hi> going, and do something worthy of this his Majesty's Favour, and that the World may see it is not granted unto you for nothing. <hi>This Patent</hi> I delivered according to appointment to Mr. <hi>Philip King</hi> who paid the Fees, and took order for the safe carrying of it down.</p>
                     <p>But at that time there proved a happy Error in it, which occasioned the sending of it back to have it amended. That <hi>Slip</hi> was but in the miswriting of one word, which escaped them, whom (for want of <hi>Leisure</hi> my self) I set to compare it. The necessity to have this word mended, begat a desire to have a whole Clause added, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a privilege of sole Printing such <hi>M. S.</hi> as you should set forth for a certain number of years. The more I thought of this Clause, the more I found it necessary, and therefore moved his Majesty again for this But when it was granted, Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> (to whose care and love not only in this, but in divers other things the University is very much beholden) did not think it fit to have the former <hi>Patent</hi> recalled, that this might be added; for that would have been the same in charge
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54616:31"/>
with a new <hi>Patent,</hi> being again to pass the King's hand, and all the Seals, but not in profit to you. Therefore after a great deal of debate, I resolved by advice to move his Majesty for a second <hi>Patent,</hi> which may recite the former, and be in the nature of a Confirmation of it, and then add all those many Clauses, which concern the sole Printing not only of <hi>M. SS.</hi> but of any other Books made, and Printed there, and against the importation of all such, as shall be reprinted beyond the Seas, as you will see more perfectly by the ampleness of the <hi>Patent</hi> it self.</p>
                     <p>This being now finished, I here send you down both the <hi>Patents</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A second Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent procured,</note> together, but with this <hi>proviso,</hi> of which you must be very careful. The <hi>Priviledge</hi> is given to you to name your <hi>three Printers;</hi> but after they are named and settled by Convocation, they may perchance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get themselves and you, and do some things prejudicial to the Honour or Profit of the University, the Right being then as in themselves, tho from you. For prevention of which Inconveniences, and divers others yet unseen, and that both for the present and for the time to come, I think it will be very requisite,</p>
                     <p>First, that you confirm not either of the two Printers which you <note place="margin">The Printer; not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their places till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Secondly, that you name as yet no third <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but keep the place empty, that you may get an able man, if it be possible for the Printing of <hi>Greek,</hi> when you shall be ready for it. Thirdly, that you settle some Orders of <hi>Agreement</hi> beforehand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your <hi>Printers,</hi> and your other <hi>Stationers</hi> there, which print not. Fourthly, that though your <hi>Patents</hi> be large, yet coming over the Heads of the <hi>King's</hi> Printers and other Stationers here in <hi>London,</hi> I shall advise you not to suffer any of your Printers as yet to print <hi>Bibles, Service-Books, Grammars, Primers,</hi> &amp;c. (which caused the late and chargable Controversy betwixt <hi>Cambridge</hi> and them;) but let your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege settle a while, and gather strength quietly. Lastly, such Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as shall be thought fit to be made for the limiting of your <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and keeping them in due obedience to the University upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions (which may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> advised on by you, that are upon the place) I think, may now very fitly be inserted into a Chapter by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves among the Statutes, that so they may have the more binding Authority over them. And what else you may fittingly think of I leave to your selves. Mr. <hi>Mottershed,</hi> according to your direction, hath paid the Fees of this second <hi>Patent,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Philip King</hi> did of the first; but being a far larger <hi>Patent</hi> the <hi>Charge</hi> must needs rise higher. Yet I have gone the nearest way I could. As for the Bill of Charges, Mr. <hi>Mottershed</hi> will send it you down. I hope I shall not need to put you in mind of writing a very good Letter of Thanks to his Majesty, and I leave it to your Consideration, whether you will not think it fit to write to Mr. <hi>Attorney,</hi> who for the first <hi>Patent</hi> would take no Fees, and to Mr. Secretary <hi>Windebank,</hi> who put them to the King's hand, and ordered them to the Seals, and would take no Fee for either, which hath not a little lessened your Charges. So wishing, that these <hi>Patents</hi> may turn to the Honour and

Happiness of that place, I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest,</p>

For I am told by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that tho' the Masters come very duly in Caps, which I am right glad to hear of; yet the younger sort, which should be most in awe, are least in order, and came not (divers of them) to St. <hi>Mary's</hi> in that Form, which they ought to do.

And of this and all other Particulars of like nature, I shall look for an Account from you, if God bless me with a safe Return.

               </q>
               <p>Upon these Questions Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> then Professour had these passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges following, and were then offered to be avowed against him upon Oath, if need were; and it happened that the <hi>Queens-Almoner</hi> was present. The passages were these:</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54616:34"/>
                  <p>Ecclesia est mera Chimaera.</p>
                  <p>Ecclesia nihil docet nec determinat.</p>
                  <p>Controversiae omnes meliùs ad Academiam referri possunt, quam ad Ecclesiam.</p>
                  <p>Docti homines in Academiis possunt determinare omnes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversias, etiam sepositis Episcopis.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Upon an occasion of mentioning the absolute Decree, he brake into a great and long Discourse, that his Mouth was shut by Authority, else he would maintain that Truth <hi>contra omnes qui sunt in Vivis,</hi> which fetcht a great Hum from the Country Ministers, that were there, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>These particulars by the Command of his Majesty I sent to Dr. <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Prideaun's</hi> answer to these particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>August</hi> 22 <hi>Ex. Act.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Prideaux,</hi> and received from him this answer following, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation under his hand.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Ecclesia authoritatem habet in fidei Controversiis determinandis.</p>
                  <p>Ecclesia authoritatem habet interpretandi Sacras Scripturas.</p>
                  <p>Ecclesia potestatem habet decernendi Ritus &amp; Ceremonias.</p>
               </q>
               <p>These Questions I approved, when they were brought unto me, and wished the Beadle, that brought them, to convey them to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to be allowed according to Custom; conceiving them to be especially bent (according to the meaning of the Article cited) against <hi>Papal Vsurpations</hi> and <hi>Puritancial Innovations,</hi> which I detest, as much as any man, Whereby it appears, what I posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively hold concerning the authority of the Church in all the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Particulars, namely that which that 20th Article prescribeth, and not otherwise.</p>
               <p>Certain passages that came from Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> in the discussing of the Questions at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Ecclesia est mera Chimaera.</p>
                  <p>Ecclesia nihil docet nec determinat.</p>
                  <p>Controversiae omnes melius ad Academiam referri possunt, quàm ad Ecclesiam.</p>
                  <p>Docti homines in Academiis possunt determinare omnes Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias, etiam sepositis Episcopis.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The passages therefore imperfectly catched at by the Informer were no Positions of mine. For I detest them, as they are laid, for impious and ridiculous. But Oppositions according to my place, proposed for the further clearing of the truth, to which the <hi>Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:54616:34"/>
was to give satisfaction; And the General Protestation I hope, takes off all, that can be laid against me in the particulars.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding to touch on each of them, as they are laid.</p>
               <p>To the First, I never said the Church was <hi>Mera Chimaera,</hi> as it is, or hath a Being, and ought to be believed. But as the <hi>Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> by his Answer made it. In which I conceived him to swerve from the Article, whence his Questions were taken.</p>
               <p>To the Second, my Argument was to this purpose; <hi>Omnis actio ést Suppositorum vel Singularium; Ergo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in abstracto nil docet aut determinat, sed per hos aut illos Episcopos, Pastores, Doctores:</hi> As, <hi>Homo non disputat, sed</hi> Petrus &amp; Johannes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The third, and fourth may be well put together. My Prosecution was, That the Universities are eminent Parts and <hi>Seminaries</hi> of the Church, and had sitter opportunity to discuss Controversies, than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Assemblies. Not by any means to determine them, but to prepare them for the determination of Ecclesiastical Assemblies, of Synods, Councils, Bishops, that have Superiour Authority, wherein they might do Service to the Church and those Superiours; not prescribing any thing unto them. As the debating of a thing by a learned Counsellour makes the easier Passage for the Benches Sentence. And this was urged only as <hi>Commodum,</hi> not as <hi>Necessarium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>QUEEN's ALMONER</hi> present.</p>
               <p>I am told no. For he departed, as they say, that were in the Seat with him, being tyred as it should seem by the tedious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Respondent before the Disputations began: But be it so or otherwise, to what purpose this is interposed, I know not.</p>
               <p>Upon an occasion of mentioning the absolute Decree, he brake into a great and long Discourse, that his Mouth was shut by Authority; else he would maintain the truth <hi>contra omnes, qui sunt in vivis,</hi> which fetcht a great <hi>Hum</hi> from the Country Ministers that were there, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Argument was unexpectly cast in by Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of St. <hi>John's;</hi> but bent, as I took it, against somewhat I have written in that behalf; which the <hi>Respondent</hi> not endeavouring to clear, I was put upon it to shew, in what sense I took <hi>absolutum Decretum:</hi> Which indeed I said I was ready to maintain against any, as my Predecessors in that place had done. This was not in a long Discourse, as it is suggested, but in as short a Solution, as is usually brought in Schools to a Doubt on the bye. And from this I took off the Opponents farther proceeding in Obedience to Authority. Whereupon if a <hi>Hum</hi> succeeded, it was more than I used to take notice of. It
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54616:35"/>
might be as well of dislike as approbation, and of other Auditors, as soon as Country Ministers: A <hi>Hiss</hi> I am sure was given before, when the <hi>Respondent</hi> excluded the King and Parliament from being parts of the Church. But I remember whose practice it is to be <gap reason="foreign">

And also that divers Maltsters, Bakers, and Brewers do keep in their Private Houses two Bushels, a bigger wherewith to buy, and a lesser to sell, whereby the Country, that bring in their Corn and Grain to the said University, are deterred to furnish the said Market, in regard the measure of Grain will not hold out fully with the said great Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels.

And we do also by these presents straitly prohibit and discharge all the Inhabitants of the University or City of <hi>Oxon.</hi> from keeping and setting forth any publick Bushel or other measure, and to receive any Toll or profit for the same: And also all Malsters, Bakers, and Brewers for keeping in their Houses any more than a lawful and sealed Bushel, by which they shall sell, as well as buy, Provided always, that the said <hi>Christopher Dival</hi> demean himself honestly, uprightly, and indifferently in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the said Office or place as aforesaid, and that he take a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Oath yearly before us, or our Deputy the Vice-Chancellour, to that effect and purpose, according to the Law, and the Use, Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and Privilege of the said University: And provided also, that the said <hi>Christopher Dival</hi> in Consideration of the Premises, do

take diligent care to view the Pitching, Paving, and Cleansing of the Streets within the said University, and to make known unto us or our Deputy, by whose fault and negligence the same is left undone, and also that twice every Week after the end of the said Market he cleanse and keep sweet, or cause to be cleansed and kept sweet the said Corn-Market Place, the Inhabitants there paying to the Scavinger as now they do for the same. <hi>In witness</hi> whereof We have to these Presents put our Hand and Seal, Dated the 2d. day of <hi>May, Anno Dom.</hi> 1634.

And to this end I require you, that are the Principal of the said Hall, to dispose of those Scholars, that are now under his Tuition to such other Tutors, who by their discreet and peaceable Carriage shew themselves freest from Faction; and not to suffer the same or any other to live under his Charge, or him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Salary or Stipend from them. And this Censure you are presently to put in execution, by taking away his Scholars, and to take care, that no part of it hereafter be eluded.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54616:38"/>
God will so bless, as that it may much improve the Honour and good Government of that Place; a thing very necessary in this Age both for Church and Common Wealth, since so many young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and others of all Ranks and Conditions have their first breeding for the publick in that Seminary. To save the Purse of the University, and to gain time, it was thought fit rather to Print, than to transcribe so many Copies as might serve for the present necessary use of the University and the several Colleges and Halls respectively. And for my part I thought it expedient, that in every House they might have the Rule of the publick Government by them, and so see the way to their Duty: which being as much for their particular good, as the advance of the publick service, every man, I hope, will be most willing and ready to conform himself to that, which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">The Statutes to be publish'd for a years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</note> of him. There is to be a great Ledger Book written out fair, which is to be the Authentick Copie under Seal, and to rest <hi>in Archivis,</hi> to be the future Judge of all Statutes, which may hereafter be corruptly either printed or transcribed. But before this be written, I hold it very expedient to put these Statutes (as they are now corrected and set in order) into practice and execution for the space of one whole year, to the end it may better appear, if any necessary thing have slipt the Care of my self, and those, whom the University trusted with me. For then if any such thing be discovered, it may easily be amended in the Margent, or otherwise of these printed Books. And after this experience made, the Authentick Copy may be written fair, without any Interlining or other Blemish, and so be a Rule to Posterity of greater Credit. These are therefore according to the power given unto me by an Act, with full Consent in Convocation, bearing Date in <hi>August,</hi> 1633. to declare and publish to the University and every Member thereof, that the Statutes now printed are and shall be the Statutes, by which that University shall be governed for this year en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing, that is, until the Feast of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, which shall be in the year of our Lord God 1635. reserving to my self Power, according to the Decree before mentioned, to add or alter that, which shall be fit, and take away from these Statutes or any of them that, which shall be found by this intervening Practice to be either unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or incommodious for that Government. And then, (God willing) at or before that time I will discharge the Trust, which the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity hath commended to me, and absolutely make a settlement of the Statutes for future times, even as long as it shall please God to bless them with use and continuance. And I account it not the least of God's Blessings upon my self, that he hath given me strength and ability to do this Service for my ancient Mother, the University, whom I have ever so much Honoured, and am still ready to serve. And thus much Comfort I can already give you, that his Majesty being made acquainted by me, that the work was finisht, exprest extraordinary contentment in it, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to let you know so much, and withal that he doubts not of your ready Obedience to them: Than which nothing can from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>AFter my very hearty Commendations, &amp;c. I have a good while since <note place="margin">My Letters to the Convocati on concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Book of the Statutes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the King and Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby's</hi> Manuscrspts, &amp;c.</note> delivered the Book of your Statutes together with your Letters to his Sacred Majesty who was marvellously well pleased with both and commanded me at some convenient Leisure to let you know, how well he takes both the one and the other. And because the Letter you sent was very well written, after his Majesty had read it, I caused it to be fairly written in the spare Vellum at the beginning of the Book.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I had signified to your self, and the whole Body of the Convocation about a Month since, had I not been hindred by two things, the one as troublesome to my self as the other will appear beneficial to you. That which was troublesome to my self was the great Business of the Term, which lay very heavy upon me, especially towards the end of it, and at the same time the Care which I took to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive the benefit upon you. That which I know will be very benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <note place="margin">Manuscripts gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Sir <hi>

                              </gap> Digby</hi> to the University</note> to you is a parcel of Manuscripts which I have obtained for your Library from a very Learned and Noble Gentleman, Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby.</hi> These Manuscripts (many of them being very good) he hath been at the Charge to Bind up, and put his Arms fair upon them, and I think there are very few but so bound. With these he hath sent a Catalogue, but that (as himself tells me) is somewhat imperfect, his Man being indisposed for health, at the time when he made it. And whether the method of it will like you or fit the University I know not. But after the Books are compared with this, it will be very easy to make a perfect one by it. For my self I did not think it fit any way to meddle with them, but have left them in their several Trunks, as they were packed up by himself, and so sent them to you. Their number is 235. or thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Manuscripts I am to give two Advertisements of <note place="margin">Two Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sir <hi>Ken. Digby</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts to be observed.</note> the Donors Will and Pleasure, which I must and do pray you to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in this present Convocation: The one is, that he will not subject these Manuscripts to the strictness of Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley's</hi> Statute, but will have Liberty given for any man of worth, that will be at the Pains and Charge to Print any of these Books, to have them out of the Library upon good Caution given, and to that purpose and no other. The Second is, that he will reserve Liberty to himself, during his natural Life, to borrow any of these Books out of the Library for his own private use, whensoever he shall ask them. And both of us desire the Books may be put into the Library with these two Cautions expresly mentioned, as the Act of Convocation was for the Books which my Lord <hi>Steward</hi> gave.</p>
                     <p>This is all which I have for the present to trouble you with, for I presume I shall not need to put you in mind of writing a Letter of Thanks to Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> whose love thus and divers other ways express'd deserves it abundantly; so with my Prayers to Almighty

               <p>At this time there was a Proposition made for setting the Poor on <note place="margin">A Project to set the Poor of <hi>Oxford</hi> on work <hi>Decemb.</hi> 28. 1634.</note> work at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by making New Stuffs and Drapery Ware, much after the fashion that the Dutch and Walloons use at <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Norwich,</hi> and other places. Divers Letters passed between me and the Vicechancellor and some other interessed men about it: But in Conclusion such difficulties appeared in the Business, that the whole project suddainly vanished, and came to nothing. And yet Mr. <hi>Escott</hi> of <hi>Wadham</hi> College, who very carefully, and certainly with a very good intention laboured in the Business, gave me this Answer following to such Doubts as I had made. And set down some other things very considerable in the business; And yet for all this that good intention fell to nothing.</p>
               <p>THE Doubts that you have made to me, I think in part be thus <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Escots</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to certain of mine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Poor of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> Recep. <hi>March</hi> the 10. 1635.</note> answered.</p>
               <p>To the First. The Man <hi>John Roberts</hi> of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and born there, is a man as I suppose, conformable; for I have heard him speak with dislike of some sactious Brethren of the Town of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and of some of this Town of <hi>Oxford.</hi> And he commends Mr. <hi>Brook</hi> the Minister of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and particularly for a Suit that he lately commenced in the High Commission against a factious Lecturer for preaching scandalously of the Blessed Virgin, &amp;c. by reason of which Suit I suppose the said Minister and his Conformity is known to my Lord's Grace of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Second. If this Man die, another may be had upon the same Terms: But if he live any time, he will make his own Sons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perfect in the Trade, that may supply the place after him.</p>
               <p>To the Third. I hope we shall not need to fear the making us a number of Poor by them, that shall be trained up in this Trade, because this Course encreaseth not the number of Poor, but only teaches them, whom it finds idle, and enables them to maintain themselves and their Families, if they have any; for it employs both Men, Women and Children; and where there be no Idlers, 'tis like there will not be many Beggars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:54616:40"/>
To the Fourth. I find not indeed that we have power to impose a Tax upon Ale-houses.</p>
               <p>To the Fifth. The Taxes and Levies now made by the Town for the Poor, (are by the Statute) to be employed and disposed of by the Overseers of the Poor, with the consent of two Justices of Peace, for the providing of Materials to set them to Work, and for the placing out of poor Children to honest Trades. Now if the Overseers of this Work be made Justices of Peace, I see not but they may have a hand in disposing of those Taxes, and convert as much of them as shall be fit to this use. However the University may by its own power tax all privileged men.</p>
               <p>There is a man of good Place in the Town (who is like to be a Benefactor to this Work) that thinks the Town, if the University go through with it, will willingly Bind themselves to a yearly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution towards it, or else will undertake to maintain constantly a certain number of Children, which shall work there. But if none of these things be, I think there may be shewn a way, how the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity of its self, without the assistance of the Town, may be able to go on with this charitable Work, and provide for the maintaining and teaching Sixty poor Children the first year, and add to them 20 or 30 more every year perpetually; and yet so, that whatsoever any man shall contribute towards it, shall return to him within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the year with advantage. Which way may be this.</p>
               <p>There must be raised a Sum of Money, that shall issue out year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the maintaining of a certain number at work; suppose sixty or an hundred.</p>
               <p>This yearly Charge shall never increase, and yet the number to be maintained shall increase every year, thus;</p>
               <p>Suppose there be eighty to be maintained as Apprentices for seven years, at five pounds charge for every Child <hi>per annum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first year, their Earnings will but answer their Spoilings.</p>
               <p>The second year, this Eighty will earn 120 <hi>l.</hi> which will take in twenty four Children more.</p>
               <p>The third year, the first eighty will earn 200 <hi>l.</hi> and the 24 taken in the 2d year will earn 36 <hi>l.</hi> in all 236 <hi>l.</hi> Out of which deduct to maintain the 24 taken in the second year 120 <hi>l.</hi> and there will remain 116 <hi>l.</hi> which will take in 23 more.</p>
               <p>The fourth year the first Eighty will earn 280 <hi>l.</hi> and the rest will earn so as to take in 30 more. The fifth year will take in 40 more, the sixth year 50. The seventh 40.</p>
               <p>The Eighth year, The first Eighty shall be manumitted, and yet there will be left at work 204. and there may be taken in 30 more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:54616:41"/>
The ninth year will manumit the 24, that were taken in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year, and there will be left at work 210. And so always a certain number will go off yearly, as they come in, and others will be taken in their room.</p>
               <p>If there be taken in but 60 the first year, there will be added the second year 20. the third year 16. the fourth year 20. the fifth 30. the sixth 40. and so onward as it is shewed before.</p>
               <p>If the Town contribute towards it, there may be taken in the first year 100. If the University go on alone, they may (besides the allowance of the Master and Overseers) take in 60, by raising through the University by the Pole 1 <hi>d.</hi> a Week upon every man, except poor Scholars; or by setting a certain Sum upon every College, to be raised, as it shall seem meet to the Governours. Now if any man think this 1 <hi>d.</hi> a Week to be a Burthen, I answer him thus:</p>
               <p>First, that upon the matter he doth not give any thing, but only lays out by the Week what within the Year will come in to him again, in the Buying of his Gowns, Suits, Stockings, &amp;c. Neither is this a thing only in imagination, but it may easily be made to appear, that if things be well ordered, there shall be saved in some Stuffs 4 <hi>d.</hi> in some 6 <hi>d.</hi> in some 8 <hi>d.</hi> a Yard, in some more, in some less, as it is of higher or lower price, and in Stockings after the same proportion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I think I may say, there is well nigh as much as this given every Week at <hi>Buttery-Hatches,</hi> and to Beggars in the Town, which by this means might be saved; for if a right course be taken there should not be seen a Beggar or an idle Person within the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of the University.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I believe, that my Lord Keeper, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Petitioned by the University, will easily be induced (in regard of the undertaking of this work,) to keep this University out of all Breves, which now come very frequently upon us, and that we shall be burthened with no Collections, save only some extraordinary ones, that shall first pass the Consent and approbation of my Lord our Chancellour.</p>
               <p>If this may perswade, that the Enterprize is feasible, it were good, that all the Dispatch were made in it, that may be, that the Work may begin with the Year, now at our <hi>Lady-Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Overseers were made, they might travel in the perfecting of it, and enquire, what were the Causes of their first failings in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and how they do now go through with it, as likewise what Course they take at <hi>Norwich,</hi> where this Trade hath a good while flourished, and so, that it leaves not (as I am informed) a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in the whole Country thereabouts.</p>

                     <p>ANother Business there is, which I think may be very well worthy your Consideration; and if you do not give it remedy (as I think <note place="margin">A Branch of my Letters to my Lord of <hi>Winchester,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>New</hi> Coll. in <hi>Oxon. Feb.</hi> 2. 1635.</note> it abundantly deserves) I do not know who either can or will. I have often wondred, why so many good Scholars came from <hi>Winchester</hi> to <hi>New</hi> College, and yet so few of them afterwards prove eminent Men: And while I lived in <hi>Oxford</hi> I thought upon divers things, that might be causes of it, and I believe true ones; but I have lately heard of another, which I think hath done and doth the College a great deal of harm, in the Breeding of their Young men. When they come from <hi>Winchester</hi> they are to be Probationers two Years, and then Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. A man would think those two Years, and some Years after should be allowed to Logick, Philosophy, Mathematicks, and the like Grounds of Learning, the better to enable them to study Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with Judgment: But I am of late accidentally come to know, that when the Probationers stand for their Fellowships, and are to be examined how they have profited; One chief thing in which they are examined is, how diligently they have read <hi>Calvin's</hi> Institutions; <note place="margin">Concerning the Probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>New</hi> Coll. their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Calvin's</hi> Institutions too soon.</note> and are more strictly held to it, how they have profited in that, than almost in any kind of Learning besides. I do not deny but that <hi>Calvin's</hi> Institutions may profitably be read, and as one of their first Books for Divinity, when they are well grounded in other Learning; but to begin with it so soon, I am afraid doth not only hinder them from all grounds of Judicious Learning, but also too much possess their Judgments before they are able to judge, and makes many of them hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in, if not against the Church. For so many of them have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this latter Age, since my own memory in that University. Your Lordship is Visitor there, and I think you cannot do a better Deed, than to advise on a way, how to break this Business with the Warden who is a learned and discreet Man, and then think upon some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> for it. For I am verily perswaded, it doth that College a great deal of harm. I do not hold it fit that your Lordship should fall upon this Business too suddainly. When the Warden comes next to the Election may be a sit time; nor would I have You

You have also seen and heard the Confirmation and Establishment of these Statutes. First by his Majesties Royal Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature, and under the great Seal of his Kingdom: And respectively under the Hand and Seal of the Lord Arch-Bishop, both as Primate and Metropolitan of <hi>England,</hi> and as most worthy Chancellour of this University, whereby it is manifest, that these Laws and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are so established and ratified both by Sovereign and Subalternal Authority, Temporal and Spiritual, that nothing further can be required, but your ready acceptance and obedience, whereof I make no doubt. For (to do you right) you have already shewed so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Conformity; and at this present express such alacrity and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness, that I rather see cause to commend and encourage you, than to exhort and stir you up, or any way to importune you by any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Speech; yet because there is generally in Man's nature a secret, curiosity and prejudice against all things, that appear extraodinary and new, especially when they impose any Duty, and require obedience at their hands; I must crave leave in discharge of my own Duty to satisfie those, which hereafter may be inquisitive into these Proceedings, to insist a little upon those principal Respects which demonstrate the full Authorization and absolute necessity of submission to these Laws.</p>
                     <p>That which Commands in chief, and which no reason can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, is his Majesty's Sovereign Power, by which these Statutes (as you see) are both enacted and confirmed. Him we all acknowlege to be our supream Governour both of Church and Commonwealth, over all Causes and Persons; and to his Supremacy and Allegiance, we are all obliged by Oath. This then we must build upon, as an Axiom and fundamental Rule of Government, That all our Laws and Statutes are the King's Laws, and that none can be enacted, changed, or abrogated without him; so all Courts of Law or Equity are properly the King's Courts; all Justice therein administred, be it Civil or Martial, is the King's Justice; and no Pardon or Grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from any, but from the King: And as of Justice, so is he the Source of Honour; all Dignities, all Degrees, all Titles, Arms, and Orders come orignally from the King, as Branches from the Root. And not only particular Men and Families, but all Corporations, Societies, nay Counties, Provinces, and depending Kingdoms, have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54616:46"/>
all Corporations, Societies, nay Counties, Provinces, and depending Kingdoms have all their Jurisdictions and Governments established by him; and by him (for publick good) to be changed or dissolved. So his Power reacheth to Foreign Plantations, where he may erect Principalities, and make Laws for their good Government, which no man may disobey. And as in the temporal, so in the State Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, his Regal Power by ancient Right extendeth to the erection of Bishopricks, Deanries, and Cathedral Churches, and to settle Orders for Government in all Churches, by the advice of his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, without any Concurrence of Forreign Usurping Power.</p>
                     <p>But for Universities and Colleges, they are the Rights of Kings in a most peculiar manner. For all their Establishments, Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Priviledges and Orders by which they subsist and are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, are derived from Regal Power. And as it is your greatest Honour, so it is your greatest Safety, That now this Body of your Laws, as well as your Priviledges and Immunities, are established, ratified and confirmed by the King. And more I shall not need to say in this Point.</p>
                     <p>In the next place you may consider for your incouragement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this great Favour and Benefit from his Majesty with ready and thankful Minds, that your Chancellor's worthy Care had a chief operation in advancing this great work; whose nearness to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in a place of that Eminency and sincere Conformity to his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Commands, and most watchful Care over that part of the Government which is committed to his Trust, inableth him to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and may give you confidence to obey that which his Majesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth by so good a Hand, specially in Matters concerning the good Government of the Church or of the Schools.</p>
                     <p>In the Church (whereof he is Primate and Metropolitan) his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is very large, and his extraordinary endeavours in it deserve at least to be well understood. In former times, when Church-men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Rule, the greatest Prelates gave the first way to alienate Church Livings: Whereas this worthy Prelate maketh it his chief work to recover to the Church for the furtherance of God's Service what may be now restored. And what therein he hath effected under his Majesty's gracious and powerful Order, not <hi>England</hi> alone, but <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> can abundantly witness. Again, what help and relief he procureth dayly for Ministers oppressed by rich incroaching Neighbours or Patrons; what Collections and Contributions he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to re-edify, to repair and adorn Churches; and what great Structures are now in Hand, and much advanced by his Judgment, Care and Zeal in our most famous Monuments dedicated to God's service, we may behold with Joy, and future Ages will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to his Majesty's eternal Glory, by whose Power and Order all is performed, and to the Honour of our Country, and for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and example of those that shall succeed; who will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with us, that this Man is indeed, as he is by his just stile, a most Reverend and Beneficial Father of the Church: And for this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54616:47"/>
what better Evidence can be desired of his singular Love and Beneficence, than first that stately Building, whereby he hath made himself another Founder of that College, which bred him to this height of worth? And secondly, those many rare and exquisite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts and Authors, wherewith he hath replenished your renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publick Library? And if you add hereunto his constant Care to maintain you in all your Rights and Priviledges, and to assist you in your Preferments; And finally in collecting this great Volume of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances for the present and further Government of this famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity. You have Monuments sufficient to eternize among you and all men his memory and desert. And this work is that, which now remaineth in the third place to be further stood upon. For 'tis not (as some may think) either a Rhapsody of overworn and unuseful Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, nor yet an imposition of Novel Constitutions to serve the present Times; But our Royal <hi>Justinian</hi> by the Labour and Direction of this prudent person hath collected into a Pandect or <hi>Corpus juris Academici</hi> all the ancient approved Statutes, which in former times were scattered and so neglected. And tho many great Prelates have heretofore undertaken this Work, yet it ever miscarried, till the piercing Judgment and undefatigible Industry of this man took it in hand, and happily, as now you see, hath put you into possession of it, whereof the use can hardly be valued. For by these Rules, You, that are Governors, may know, what to command, and those, that are under you may know how to obey, and all may understand how to order their Behaviour, and their Studies, whereby they may become most profitable Members in the Church and Common-wealth, which is the main cause, why his Majesty requireth them so strictly to be obeyed. For let me speak freely out of that true affection which I bear to you all: Deceive not your selves with a vain opinion, that Kings and Princes give great Donations, Priviledges and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to their Schools and Universities for a popular Applause, or out of meer Bounty, or for honour, or for opinion of merit, by which the Art of Clergy-men transported them heretofore: But the very truth is, that all wise Princes respect the welfare of their Estates, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that Schools and Universities are (as in the Body) the noble and vital parts, which being vigorous and sound, send good Blood and active Spirits into the Veins and Arteries, which cause health and strength: Or if feeble or ill affected, corrupt all the Vital Powers; whereupon grow Diseases, and in the end death it self. What incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies have grown in all Ages by the ill Government and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Schools, your Books can inform you. And to come home to your selves, have not our late Parliaments complained? Nay hath not the Land exclaimed, that our great Schools of Virtue were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Schools of Vice? This I mention unwillingly, but withal do most willingly tell you to your eternal praise, That fince it pleased his Majesty to take to heart a Reformation, and by advice of your never too often named Chancellor, sent you down some temporary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whereby to reduce you to some reasonable moderation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by the Wisdom and Resolution of you the worthy Governours, and by the inclinable conformity of all the Students in general, it is now come to pass, that Scholars are no more found in Taverns or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54616:47"/>
Houses of Disorder, nor seen loytering in the Streets, or other places of Idleness or ill Example, but all contain themselves within the Walls of their Colleges, and in the Schools or publick Libraries: Wherein, I must confess, you have at length gotten the start, and by your Virtue and Merit have made this University, which before had no Paragon in any forreign Country, now to go beyond it self, and give a glorious Example to others not to stay behind.</p>
                     <p>And if those temporary and unperfect Orders produced so good effect, what may now be expected from this Body of Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, so compleat and so digested, that no former Age did ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the like?</p>
                     <p>Thus you have understood how the Goodness of our great King, how the Care and respect of your Chancellor, and how the worth and substance of the work it self may forcibly induce you to congratulate your own Happiness. And therefore I might here forbear to trouble you any longer with a harsh interrupted Speech: but that I cannot omit to put you in mind of one thing, which I know you will hear with willingness and attention, because it tendeth chiefly to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our God, and then by his power to the honour of our King; and thence to the comfort of every true hearted Subject who will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledg with Reverence and thankfulness the great blessings we now enjoy above all other Nations; I will tell you, but what I know: (for I speak within my Element) I have seen our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countries in great Prosperity and Renown, their Cities stately built and strongly fortified, with Walls raised up to Heaven, full of People, full of Trade, so full of peace and plenty, that they surfeited in all excess; but from hence they are since fallen, partly by the boundless Ambition of great Princes, partly by the Factions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions in Religion; and generally by their Disorders, into such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that men of great Honour sent in remote Employment, found whole Provinces so sack'd and depopulated, that in divers Journeys they incountred scarce a Man, and of those they found dead, some had Grass in their Mouths and Stomachs, and some were torn in pieces by Beasts and ravenous Fowls; and those that were alive had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Care or Study than how to save themselves from Fire and Sword. In general there is such Desolation, that without a kind of Horror, the Horror thereof cannot be express'd.</p>
                     <p>Now we by God's Blessing are in a better Case; we sit here in God's House thankful in true Devotion for this wonderful Favour towards us: We enjoy Peace and Plenty; we are like to those who resting in a Calm Haven behold the Shipwrack of others, wherein we have no part, save only in compassion to help them with our Prayers; which we all ought to do as interested in their sufferings, lest the like may fall on us. What then remaineth, but seriously to consider, how all these great Blessings are conferred upon us, not for our Merits, or for our more virtuous and Holy Lives, but only by God's favour to his true Religion: and under him by the happy Government of our Gracious King; which should confirm us all to a Constancy in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54616:48"/>
our Obedience, and to a ready subjection to all those Rules and Orders, which his Majesty shall prescribe for the Publick good. Wherein this general Admonition may fruitfully be applied to the Business now in hand, whereof I make no doubt. So I crave your pardon and your good acceptance of that, which I have rudely spoken, but with, a true affection to this whole Body, whereof (though I had my Education from another-Nurse) yet I had the Honour to be an Adopted Son, and (as I suppose) one of the ancientest that lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you at this day.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth, that Mr Vice-Chancellour perform his part; and proceed to the Subscriptions and Depositions of you the Heads.</p>

And as I give him hearty thanks for it, so is he much bound to God and my self with him, for the great Blessing with which he hath guided and supported all his Actions. And I cannot but profess unto you, that he hath deserved exceeding well, not of my self only, but of the whole University, and of every Man in particular, whose Sons have been bred there, during the time of this his Government. But for this Vigilancy and pains of his I must not overload him, but think upon some other worthy and able Man to succeed, that may, and will not take upon him the Office only, but go in the same way, into which he hath led him. And after some deliberation I have fixed my resolution upon Dr. <hi>Bailye,</hi> President of St. <hi>John's-Coll.</hi> and Dean of <hi>Sarum,</hi> upon whom I shall be for'cd to lay the greater burthen, if his Majesty hold his Gracious pur pose of Honouring the University with his Presence this present Year: And he will therefore need all the assistance, that either his Predecessours, and the rest of the Heads can give him. These are therefore to pray and require you to allow of this my Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Choice of Dr. <hi>Baylie</hi> to the Vice-Chancellourship; and I will not doubt but that you will all afford him your best Advice, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and help, to the performance of all such things, as may any way concern the Honour and good Government of the University. So I bid you all heartily Farewel, and rest,</p>

                     <p>SInce I writ last to you, the Dean of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> came to me, <note place="margin">My Letters to the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour about the settlement of the Plays in <hi>Oxford</hi> against his Majesties coming.</note> and acquainted me with two things, which are very necessary you should both know and remedy.</p>
                     <p>The one is, that the University seems to be unwilling to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Charge of the Plays, which are to be at <hi>Christ-Church.</hi> Now this charge, as by reason of their Building, they are not able to bear alone; So I must needs acknowledge, there is no reason, that they should, whatever their ability be: For the King is to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Oxford,</hi> not by <hi>Christ-Church.</hi> And that he lyes there, is but for the Conveniency of the place, where there are so many fairLodgings for the great Men to be about him. Indeed if <hi>Christ-Church</hi> men will say, they will have no Actors, but of their own House, let them bear the charge of their own Plays on God's name: But if they will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Actors from any other College or Hall, upon trial of their suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to be as good, or better than their own; then I see no reason in the World, but that the whole University should contribute to the Charge. And I pray see it ordered, and let your Successour follow you accordingly.</p>
                     <p>The other is, that since the University must contribute to this <note place="margin">The University to contribute to the Plays at <hi>Christ-Church.</hi>
                        </note> Charge, (for so it was done when King <hi>James</hi> came, and at the last coming of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> both within my own memory) I hold it very sit, that all the Materials of that Stage, which are now to be made new, and the <hi>Proscenium</hi> and such Apparel whatever it be, as is wholly made new, shall be laid up in some place fit for it; to which the Vice-Chancellour for the time being shall have one Key, and the <note place="margin">The materials of the Plays to be safely laid up and kept.</note> Dean of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> the other, that it may not be lost, as things of like nature and use have formerly been. And if any College or Hall shall at any time for any Play or Show that they are willing to set forth, need the use of any, or all of these things, it shall be as lawful, and free for them to have and to use them, as for <hi>Christ-Church;</hi> Provided that after the use, they do carefully restore them to the place whence they were taken. And to the end these things may be kept with the more safety and indifferency to the University, I think it very fit that an Inventory be made of them, and that one Copy thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with them, at <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and the other in such fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place, as the Vice Chancellour and the Heads shall agree on. For my part I think it fittest, that an Inventory should be kept in the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54616:52"/>
University Registry, that so you may not only have access to it, so <note place="margin">My Letters concerning the business of the Plays to be registred.</note> often as you shall have cause, but also leave it ready for direction in future times in like Cases of expence. And I think it not amiss, that these my Letters which concern the ordering of these Businesses, should be Registred also.</p>
                     <p>And further, that the University may see, how the Money, which <note place="margin">Four experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced men to be appointed to look to the rates of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria's for the Plays.</note> they allow towards these Charges is expended, I think it very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, that your self and the Heads should name three or four Men of good experience in those things, that may see at what Rates all things are bought and paid for: And an Accompt delivered in to the Vice-Chancellour and the Heads, at such time, as the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, shall call for them. And also that, their Hands be set to both Copies of the above named Inventories. I have thought upon Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanders,</hi> and the Warden of <hi>Wadham,</hi> as very fit Men for this purpose; And if you and the Heads shall think it requisite to joyn any more to them, you may name whom you please.</p>
                     <p>For the Play, which I intend shall be at St. <hi>John's,</hi> I will neither put the University nor the College to any Charge, but take it wholly upon my self. And in regard of the great trouble and Inconvenience, I shall thereby put upon that House, as also in regard it shall set out one of the Plays by it self, I think there is great reason in it, and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expect it, that no Contribution should be required from St. <hi>John's</hi> towards the Plays at <hi>Christ-Church.</hi> And I pray let me have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt from you of the settlement of these things. So I leave you to the Grace of God, and rest,</p>

               <p>THis year his Majesty and the Queen invited themselves to me <note place="margin">Concerning my Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King at <hi>Oxford.</hi>

The Vice-Chancellour made a very good Speech unto them, where my self and the University met them, which was a mile, before they entred the Town.

Within <hi>Christ-Church</hi> Gate, Mr. <hi>William Strode</hi> the University Orator entertained them with another Speech, which was well appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Thence the King accompanied his Queen to her Lodging, and instantly returned, and went with all the Lords to the Cathedral. There after his Private Devotions ended, at the West Door Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> one of the Prebendaries entertained him with another short Speech, which was well liked. And thence hisMajesty proceeded into the Quire, and heard Service.

The Sermon ended, The Prince Elector, and his Brother Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> attended by many of the Lords, came to the Convocation-House, where the Place was full of University-Men, all in their Forms and Habits very orderly.

               <p>AFter this the Vice-Chancellour proceeded, made another short <note place="margin">The 2 Princes and other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Art.</note> Speech, and after Creation and Admission of the Princes and and other Honourable Persons, ended the Convocation. That finisht, they all returned to <hi>Christ-Church</hi> to attend upon the King, (the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces having formerly in the Morning seen some of the fair Colleges.) Then the Queen being not ready, the King with the Princes and the Nobles, my self also waiting upon him, went to the Library, where the King viewed the New Buildings and the Books, and was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with a very neat Speech made by the Son of the Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> and <hi>Montgomery,</hi> then Lord Chamberlain.</p>
               <p>Then word was brought up, that the Queen was come. So the King went into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to her, and they went away to St. <hi>John's</hi> to dinner, the Princes and Nobles attending them.</p>
               <p>When they were come to St. <hi>John's,</hi> they first viewed the New-Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that done, I attended them up the Library Stairs; where so soon as they began to ascend, the Musick began, and they had a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54616:54"/>
fine short Song fitted for them, as they ascended the Stairs. In the Library they were Welcomed to the College with a short Speech made by — — one of the Fellows.</p>
               <p>And Dinner being ready, they passed from the old into the new <note place="margin">The King and Queen; Prince Elector, and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons feasted by me at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. <hi>John's.</hi>
                  </note> Library, built by my self, where the King, the Queen, and the Prince Elector dined at one Table, which stood cross at the upper end. And Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> with all the Lords and Ladies present, which were very many, dined at a long Table in the same Room. All other several Tables, to the number of 13 besides these two, were disposed in several Chambers of the College, and had several Men appointed to attend them; and I thank God I had that happiness, that all things were in very good order, and that no man went out at the Gates, Courtier or other, but content; which was a Happiness quite beyond Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>When Dinner was ended, I attended the King and the Queen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Nobles into several withdrawing Chambers, where they entertained themselves for the space of an hour. And in the mean time I caused the Windows of the Hall to be shut, the Candles lighted, and all things made ready for the Play to begin. When these things were fitted, I gave notice to the King, and the Queen, and attended them into the Hall, whither I had the happiness to bring them by a Way prepared from the President's Lodging to the Hall without any the least disturbance; And had the Hall kept as fresh and cool, that there was not any one person when the King and Queen came into it. The Princes, Nobles, and Ladies entred the same way with the King, and then presently another Door was opened below to fill the Hall with the better sort of Company, which being done, the Play was begun and Acted. The Plot was very good, and the Action. It was merry, and without offence, and so gave a great deal of content. In the middle of the Play, I ordered a short Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet for the King, the Queen, and the Lords. And the College was at that time so well furnisht, as that they did not borrow any one Actor from any College in Town. The Play ended, the King and the Queen went to <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> retired and supped privately, and about 8 a Clock, went into the Hall to see another Play, which was upon a piece of a Persian Story. It was very well penn'd and acted, and <note place="margin">The latter Play at <hi>Christ Church</hi> acted over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the <hi>Queen's</hi> Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi>
                  </note> the strangeness of the Persian Habits gave great Content; so that all Men came forth from it very well satisfied. And the Queen liked it so well, that she afterwards sent to me to have the Apparel sent to <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, that she might see her own Players act it over again, and see whether they could do it as well, as t'was done in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. I caused the University to send both the Clothes, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectives of the Stage; and the Play was acted at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court in <hi>November</hi> following. And by all Men's confession the Players came short of the University Actors. Then I humbly desired of the King and the Queen, that neither the Play nor Cloathes, nor Stage might come into the Hands and use of the Common Players abroad, which was graciously granted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:54616:54"/>
But to return to <hi>Oxford.</hi> This Play being ended, all Men betook themselves to their rest, and upon <hi>Wednesday</hi> Morning <hi>August</hi> 31. about Eight of the Clock, my self with the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> and the <hi>Doctors</hi> attended the coming forth of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen;</hi> and when they came, did our Duties to them. They were graciously pleased to give the University a great deal of thanks; and I for my self, and in the Name of the University, gave their Majesties all possible thanks for their great and gracious Patience and Acceptance of our Poor and mean Entertainment: So the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Queen</hi> went away very well pleased together.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Wednesday</hi> Night I entertained at St. <hi>John's,</hi> in the same Room where the <hi>King</hi> Dined the Day before, at the long Table, which was for the Lords, all the Heads of Colleges and Halls in the Town; and all the other <hi>Doctors,</hi> both the <hi>Proctors</hi> and some few Friends more, which I had employed in this time of Service; which gave the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity a great deal of Content, being that which had never been done by any <hi>Chancellor</hi> before. I sat with them at Table, we were merry, and very glad that all things had so passed to the great satisfaction of the <hi>King,</hi> and the honour of that place.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Thursday, September,</hi> 1. I Dined privately with some few of my Friends: And after Dinner went to <hi>Cuddesden</hi> to my ancient Friend, my Lord the Bishop of <hi>Oxford's</hi> House, there I left my Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and some few of my Servants with him at <hi>Oxford</hi> to look to my. <hi>Plate, Linnen</hi> and other things, and to pay all Reckonings, that no Man might ask a Penny after we had left the Town; which was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done accordingly. Upon <hi>Friday, September</hi> 2. I lay at a house of Mr. Justice <hi>Jones's</hi> of <hi>Henley</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> upon his earnest Invitation. And upon <hi>Saturday, September</hi> 3. (God be thanked) I returned sase home to my House at <hi>Croyden.</hi> The week after, my Steward and other Servants, which staid with him, came from <hi>Oxford</hi> to me; where the Care of my Servants, with God's Blessing upon it, was such, as that having borrowed all the <hi>King's Plate,</hi> which was in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, and all my Lord <hi>Chamberlain's,</hi> and made use of all mine own, and hired some of my <hi>Gold-smith,</hi> I lost none, but only two <hi>Spoons</hi> which were of mine own <hi>Plate,</hi> and but little of my <hi>Linnen.</hi>

My Letters to the <hi>Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> about the Service to be in <hi>Latin</hi> at the beginning of Terms, &amp;c.</note> made me forget to write to you before the beginning of <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Term last, concerning the Sermon and Prayers usually had at St. <hi>Maries</hi> at the beginning of Terms, which were wont to be not so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly as they should, nor with so good Example to other places at large in the Kingdom, as such a University should give.</p>
                     <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Communion</hi> was Celebrated in the Body of the <note place="margin">The <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> to be Celebrated in the <hi>Chancel.</hi>
                        </note> Church, and not in the Chancel, which, tho' it be permitted in the Church of <hi>England</hi> in some cases of necessity, where there is a <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of People;</hi> yet very undecent it is, and unfitting in that place, where so few, (the more the pity) use to communicate at these So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn times. But this abuse I caused to be rectified in Dr. <hi>Duppa's</hi> time, and I hope neither you nor your Successors will suffer it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again into the former Indecency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> tho' none do come to those Solemn Prayers and Sermons, but Scholars, and those too of the best Rank, yet to no small dishonour of that place, the Sermon is in <hi>Latin,</hi> and the Prayers in <hi>English:</hi> As if <hi>Latin</hi> Prayers were more unfit for a Learned Congregation, than a <hi>Latin</hi> Sermon. And the truth is, the thing is very absurd in it self, and contrary to the Directions given at the beginning of the Reformation of this Church; for in the <hi>Latin</hi> Service Books, which were first Printed in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there is an Express, both Direction and Charge, that notwithstanding the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ordinary Form of Prayers throughout the whole Body of the Kingdom from <hi>Latin</hi> into <hi>English:</hi> Yet in the Universities such Prayers, unto which none, but they which were Learned did resort, should be in <hi>Latin.</hi> And for my part, I do much wonder, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how Publick that Direction was, that the University at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Terms should fall from this Ordinance, and so divide the Service and Sermon between <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon Consideration of this I acquainted His Majesty both with that Printed Direction of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and with the Breach of it by the University at the beginning of Terms; whereupon His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was pleased to give me in Charge to see this ordered, and to take a Course for a Remedy in the future, and that hereafter <hi>Service, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> should be at all beginnings of Terms Uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Latin,</hi> since none resort to either, but such, as well understand it. These are therefore to pray and require You at some convenient Meeting of the Heads, to acquaint them with this Direction of His Majesty, and to take care, that both at the beginning of the next Term, and of all Terms following, the <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> be in <hi>Latin,</hi> as well as the <hi>Sermon.</hi> And that such, as are not furnished,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54616:55"/>
may the better provide themselves of <hi>Service</hi> Books in <hi>Latin,</hi> so soon as conveniently they can, you shall do well to make it so much the sooner known to the Heads. And this I must not forget to tell you, that when I took this first into Consideration, it was thought fitting to put it into the University Statutes. But afterwards I considered, that since the Statutes were to remain to Posterity, it would lay no small Scandal upon these times, when they should see by the very Statute it self, what a stranger the University was to the Prayers of the Church in a Learned Language. And hereupon having first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted His Majesty with this also, I thought it better to leave it out of the Statutes, and to reduce it to this privater way, which opinion of mine His Majesty was pleased graciously to Approve.</p>
                     <p>Two things there are, which You and the Heads must take present <note place="margin">The <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor</hi> and he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I Have received your Letters, by the <hi>Stationers,</hi> and with them <note place="margin">The Copy of a part of my Letters to the <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </hi> about the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the reserving of the 200 <hi>l. Per Ann.</hi> for the settling of the Learned <hi>Press Feb.</hi> 24.</note> a Copy of the <hi>Articles</hi> agreed upon between you. These <hi>Articles</hi> I can find no fault with; For certainly it will be more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesicial to the University for the advance of a Learned <hi>Press</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 200 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, than to print <hi>Grammars</hi> and <hi>Almanacks,</hi> &amp;c. And more Honour too, when it shall appear, to what extraordinary good use you turn this Money. I have therefore directed them to my <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> to draw the Agreement upon these <hi>Articles</hi> in Form, and so to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the business; and they give good Reason why the fourth <hi>Article</hi> should be secured apart: But I like the Conclusion best of all; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That this Agreement may determine at the end of Three Years, if the University find it so sitting for them.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Cambridge,</hi> as I know not, what they will do in this business, so neither will I be forward to meddle with them, but leave them to use their Privilege in such sort, as themselves shall think best. True it is, that when Bishop <hi>Harsenet,</hi> one of their own, was so far from assisting, that he oppressed their Privilege, and disswaded me; yet I stuck close to them, and carryed their Business alone: Nevertheless, they shall never be able to go tell my Lord their <hi>Chancellor,</hi> that I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to force their Privilege in the least. Yet if any difference between Them and the <hi>Stationers</hi> come in publick, I shall moderate things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reason, as far as I can.</p>
                     <p>Now in the mean time I shall require this of you, and your Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, that this Money, which you yearly receive, may be kept safe, as a stock apart, and put to no other use, than the settling of a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Press;</hi> and I think it were not amiss, that some handsome Register-Book were bought, in which might be kept alone your Acts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Settlement of the <hi>Press</hi> aforesaid, and in another part of the Book all your Receipts, and all your Disbursements: And if you and the Heads like this Proposal of mine, I would then have you order it so by an Act of Convocation: And I will presently acquaint the King, what great good use we are like to make of the gracious Privilege he hath granted, least any other Man should tell him, we have basely sold it.</p>
                     <p>Now to your other Letters. And first I pray, use any fit means <note place="margin">The <hi>Doctors</hi> made at his Majesties late being at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> either to pay 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Man, or to do their Exercise. And this to be Published in Convocation.</note> by Letters or otherwise to send to the <hi>Doctors,</hi> that took their Degree at his Majesty's late being in <hi>Oxford,</hi> that each of them repair to the University, and perform their Exercise before the Act next ensuing, or pay their 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Man, according as was ordered at the time of their Presentation. I would likewise, you would let them know, that this 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Man shall be turn'd to no other use, than to the setting up of the Learned <hi>Press,</hi> that as many of them as mean well may be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54616:57"/>
to pay it. And further, I think it were not amiss to Publish this in Convocation, both that it may be known to what use I mean to put the Money, and withal, that their Friends may take notice, and send them word, if they will, that I am resolved so soon as the Act is over, to sue every Man in the <hi>Vice-chancellor's</hi> Court, that pays not his Money, if he have not done his Exercise, which I will most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do, without respect of Persons: And therefore it is fit, it should be made known as soon as may be.</p>
                     <p>I pray the next <hi>Monday</hi> commend me to the Heads, and let them <note place="margin">About <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 line">

                     <p>But my main Business of all is to put you in mind, that I have not <note place="margin">Concerning the strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </note> receved any account from you all this Year, how the new <hi>Statutes</hi> are put in Execution, and that not only for matter of Disputations, but for all things else: And the reason of this my Care to have an Account, is two-fold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> If the <hi>Statutes</hi> fall into a neglect, and an half Performance now at their beginning, and in my own life-time, there will be no hope that ever they will recover it after; and so all that great and most useful Labour for the University will be lost: And I have all the reason in the world to prevent this inconvenience if I can. And these two Years of your <hi>Vice-chancellorship,</hi> the observation, or the not observation of them therein will be a great help or hindrance to the <hi>Statutes</hi> for ever. Therefore I pray, as ever I shall intreat any thing of you, take all the care you can in this great business, and give me an Account from time to time how it proceeds: And you shall do well to send for Doctor <hi>Turner,</hi> and desire him in my name to give you all the assistance he can, and you may shew if you will, how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously I have written to you about this Business.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because I remember I have heard, that the former <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> distasted something about the alteration of the <hi>Statute</hi> for <hi>Readers,</hi> and that since that time there hath been a transmission of that Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from <hi>Proctor</hi> to <hi>Proctor,</hi> which must needs do a great deal of harm, considering, how much they must be trusted with the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Statutes:</hi> Therefore I pray deal seriously with both the <hi>Proctors,</hi> but especially with Proctor <hi>Brown,</hi> and let him know, that he can give me no Content, if for the remainder of his time he be not careful of the <hi>Statutes,</hi> and their due performance. And at <hi>Easter,</hi> when the new <hi>Procters</hi> are chosen, I must desire you to look to them, if they do not look carefully to the Duty of their places, and in this particular especially. Besides, I hear a whispering from thence, that

during your short abode at <hi>Sarum</hi> in this Term-time, the <hi>Schools</hi> were scarce ever called so much as once. I pray God it may be found they have called the <hi>Schools</hi> at all since the Publication of the new <hi>Statutes.</hi> You shall do well to examin this, and by the answer which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> give you, you will be able to discover something both of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and intentions; besides, it cannot be, but that Mr. <hi>Belle's</hi> death and a new and unexperienced Successor must needs give some hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the <hi>Statutes</hi> which pertain to Service: But I hope this will be but a temporary inconvenience, and soon blown over by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Mr. <hi>Gayton,</hi> and tell him I expect it.</p>
                     <p>Besides, you shall do well to have a care of <hi>Noctivagation,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">A care to be had of <hi>Nocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagation,</hi> &amp;c.</note> disorders, else you will quickly have the Distempers of the Night break out in the Day; and now the Spring comes on, if your self do not take some pains that way, I doubt the <hi>Proctors</hi> will be negligent enough, though of their negligence I can give no reason, unless it be because by the new <hi>Statutes</hi> the University is made half sharer in the <hi>Mulcts,</hi> which how small they are, will appear by their accounts.</p>

You know, that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> is answering of a Book, that much concerns the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and I am very sorry, that the young Man hath given cause, why a more watchful eye should be held over him and his Writings. But since it is so, I would willingly desire this favour from you in the Church's Name, that you would be at the pains to read over this Tract, and see that it be put home in all Points against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Cause requires. And I am confident Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> will not be against your altering of any thing, that shall be found reasonable. And to the end, that all things may go on to the Honour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> (who is particularly concern'd in this business) so soon <note place="margin">Books Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed to the <hi>Press</hi> to have a form of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</note> as ever he is returned from <hi>London,</hi> to speak with you about it. And when all these Tryals are over, I would be content, that both this Book, and all others that shall be hereafter licensed in the University, have such an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> of the Licencer before it, as we use here above, which I shall leave to the Wisdom of the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> and the <hi>Heads.</hi>

And it may be, if you and the rest of the <hi>Curators</hi> would look well to it, you might find many things there, out of order, and sit to be amended. And while I am upon this Argument of placing the <hi>Statute-Book</hi> in the publick <hi>Library,</hi> I pray acquaint the <hi>Heads</hi> at the next meeting, that I am informed, that the <note place="margin">Concerning the keeping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> the <hi>Statutes</hi> too close.</note> 
                        <hi>Statute-Book</hi> in some private <hi>Colleges</hi> is kept up too close from them, whom it concerns; which is a great hindrance to the due Publication of the <hi>Statutes,</hi> and ministers occasion to many Men to pretend Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, instead of shewing Obedience. I pray therefore commend my love to the <hi>Heads,</hi> and let them know, that I expect every <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>College</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> where there is a <hi>Library,</hi> to take care that the Book of <hi>Statutes</hi> be placed and chain'd in it, that it may be of free access to the <hi>Students</hi> in each Society; And that in such <hi>Halls,</hi> as have no <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,</hi> the <hi>Statute-Book</hi> be placed as safely, and yet as publickly as it can be. And further, I must and do require of every of the <hi>Heads,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Additions to be inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the <hi>Statute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book</hi> of every Col. and Hall.</note> that all the Additions and Alterations made upon the Review of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi> be put into all and every <hi>Statute-Book</hi> which is kept within their several Governments. And I do require of you, Mr. <hi>Vice-chancellor,</hi> to see it done, and to give me an account of it. For it will be no great Labour to you at some convenient times to send for the <hi>Statute-Book</hi> of every <hi>College</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> and see whether it be done or no; and if the Additions should not be writ into every Book, it would cause one <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> to be otherwise informed concerning their particular <hi>Statutes</hi> than others are, and so cause more frequent recourse to the <hi>Leidger-Book,</hi> than would otherwise be necessary, and perhaps breed other disseren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces also.</p>
                     <p>I find that the <hi>Proctors</hi> of the last Year, and I doubt their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors <note place="margin">Concerning the <hi>Proctors</hi> collecting the <hi>Mulcts.</hi>
                        </note> also, have been too negligent in Collecting the <hi>Mulcts;</hi> and it may be those that are new come in, will be negligent also, if you call not upon them betimes; I pray therefore commend me to them and

tell them, that I will expect their Performance in this particular, as well as their diligence in all things else; and that I hold it a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thing that out of a plausible popular humour to decline the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of any private Man, they should so far neglect their Duty to the <hi>Statutes</hi> and the Publick. And certainly if the <hi>Proctors</hi> go on in this way, and either wholly neglect it, or thrust it upon the <hi>Vice-chancellor,</hi> I shall not only take it very ill from them; but at the end of their Year, either I shall cause the <hi>Delegates</hi> not to pass their Accompts, till they have paid it themselves, or else sue both them and the <hi>Delinquents</hi> in the <hi>Vice-chancellor's</hi> Court for such <hi>Mulcts</hi> as are left by them uncol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. And I pray let the <hi>Heads</hi> know, what I have Written in this Particular also.</p>

I am glad the <hi>Divinity</hi> Disputations in course go on. I hope now <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Divinity</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations.</note> that's master'd, other difficulties will be put the better over.

                     <p>When I read your Letters I was doubtful, in whom the Gift of <note place="margin">The Clerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's</hi> and the be stowing of it.</note> the Clerk-ship of St. <hi>Mary's</hi> was, till after considering how the Fees did rise, I conclude it must needs be in the University. And while I was reading your Letters, I did think to leave it wholly to your self, for which of your Men you pleased; but afterwards reading a Letter that came from Dr. <hi>Turner,</hi> he put some thoughts into my Head, that such a man might be chosen <hi>Clerk,</hi> as may be servicable to the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Press, either as a Founder of Letters, or as a Press-man in some inferiour Service. This is a very good consideration and timely put in; I pray therefore speak with Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> about it, and if such a man may be had in any Case, let him be chosen: But if otherwise it happen, that you must take a man at large, then I leave you free to take, which of your own men you please. Yet whosoever you make <hi>Clerk,</hi> I hold it very sit that the same man that is <hi>Clerk,</hi> may <note place="margin">The Clerk of St. <hi>Mary's</hi> not to be Clock-keeper.</note> not have the keeping of the Clock at St. <hi>Mary's</hi> to shorten Hours at his Pleasure, especially in <hi>Lent,</hi> to the great hindrance of those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, and the disordering of the University in all Exercises. But I think very fit, that some honest man were taken into that service, that would not be so easily found, nor perhaps so ordinarily corrupted, as the <hi>Clerks</hi> use to be. And for this service of his, he may be allowed some small thing Yearly out of the <hi>Clerk's</hi> wages. I leave all this to your Consideration, but believe it as very a Trisle as it seems, it reaches very far into the Discipline of the University.</p>

And I verily believe, if your <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners</hi> complain thither, (as fear of undoing may make them do any thing) I shall be commanded to Order you in this Case of Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> after the same manner. Besides this, there is something considerable in the thing it self. For tho' it be true, that Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> in this way may, and no doubt will undersel your other <hi>Stationers,</hi> and so undo them, and enrich himself; Yet when they are all undone, may not he then, or any other, that shall succeed him in that way, raise the price of <hi>Books,</hi> under some pretence or other, and sell them as dear as the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners</hi> now do? It is therefore certainly a business of great Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in it self, and in the Justice of the University, that so many Men and Families be not ruined, after they have served there for their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Liberty for some Saving to particular Men. And for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in a middle way, I do not yet see, where it may be had; and certainly one way or other, the business must be settled, and the soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the better.</p>

                        </note> to your directions, with the particular mischief, that ariseth out of the multitude of <hi>Victualling-Houses</hi> in this place, but that I was informed that by your <hi>Grace's</hi> care, an Order was made, that no <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices</hi> should License <hi>Ale-Houses,</hi> but in open <hi>Sessions,</hi> and that the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber should not exceed Three and Twenty.

The Cure (I conceive) is not by punishing the immediate <hi>Delinquents,</hi> either by Imprisonment, according to the <hi>Statute</hi> 5 to <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. or by whipping by the <hi>Statute</hi> Primo <hi>Reg.

                              </gap>, Letter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Number of <hi>Ale-Hoases</hi> unlicenced in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                        </note> of <hi>Ale-house-keepers</hi> and <hi>Victuallers</hi> unlicenced in the University to the great dishonour of that place, and as great mischief to many young Students there. I thank you heartily for this care and pains, and do hereby assure you, that I will give you all the assistance I possibly can to cure this Malady: And if you find that neither the Order which I caused to be made, nor the other Remedies, which your self mention, will cure this business (as it seems to do) I pray acquaint Mr. <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor</hi> with these my Letters, and let him know, I would have him, your self, and the other <hi>Justices,</hi> to proceed upon the <hi>Statute</hi> 4 <hi>to. Jacobi,</hi> and make every <hi>Brewer</hi> pay 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> for every <hi>Barrel</hi> he shall deliver into any <hi>Tap-house</hi> not Licenced.</p>
                     <p>It seems by your Letter, that this <hi>Statute</hi> well followed, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Remedy, and indeed I think it will go far, if it be well follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I perceive, you have but one doubt against it; and that is, least you should find opposition from the <hi>Town-Justices,</hi> who (you say) have of late both renewed and enlarged their Commission by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Five,</hi> one of them being a <hi>Brewer.</hi> Will the University still sleep, while the <hi>Town</hi> slips these things upon them? I am sure, I once took order, that the Number of <hi>Town-Justices</hi> should not exceed those of the Vniversity, that so things might be carried with indifferency. And if they shall now oppose in this business of the <hi>Ale-houses,</hi> it will be a good occasion for me to move My Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> again to dissolve their Commission, which I will not fail to do, if they give me cause: So I pray proceed, and God's Blessing be upon your Endeavours, while I rest</p>
                     <p>I trouble you with these Letters, because Mr. <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor</hi> was newly gone away from me with a whole Bundle of Instructions, just as your Letter came to me. <hi>W. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>I Have yet received no Letter from you this Week, if I do, you <note place="margin">My Letters to the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor (Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> 29. 1637.) sent presently away, for care to be had of this Business.</note> shall have an Answer on <hi>Friday,</hi> if I have so much leisure. In the mean time I send you this inclosed, which came to my Hands this present Afternoon; I pray examine the business with all the Care and Industry you possibly can, as well for the discharge of your own Duty and Credit, as mine, in the Government of that place. And if there be such a Man as <hi>Pully</hi> here mentioned, be sure to make him fast, and examine him throughly touching all Particulars, that you shall think material for the Discovery of these unworthy Practices for the seducing of Youths in that University, or elsewhere, especially concerning the Author of this Letter, and what Youths have been dealt withal after this sort, either in that House or any other of the Town. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any <hi>Jesuits,</hi> or others, have lain hankering up and down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, or be there at this present to that purpose, or any other as bad. In all which, I desire you to use the utmost diligence and discretion that you can, and let me have an Account with all convenient speed. So I leave you to God's Grace, and rest</p>
                     <p>This falls out very unhappily, not only for the thing it self, which ought by all means to be prevented; but also for the Clamors, which the late Libellers have made, that there are great endeavours for reintroducing of <hi>Popery.</hi>

                        </note> your return; and yet I cannot but see, that both Factions would be busie there. Concerning the <hi>Popish</hi> Faction, I writ hastily to you to prevent a Danger, which I thought was Imminent, and God grant you may secure it! but in any case name not <hi>Fish,</hi> if you can possibly avoid it; but carry it as if the Letter were Intercepted, and be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as possibly you can. And concerning the <hi>Puritan,</hi> I see plainly, that <hi>Brazen-Nose</hi> hath some as bad, or worse than <hi>Cook</hi> was about four Years since. And that <hi>Greenwood,</hi> who Preach'd on <hi>Sunday</hi> last, is like to prove a peevish Man, which I am the more sorry for; because you write he is a good Master of his <hi>Pen,</hi> and therefore like to do the more harm. But since he hath so cunningly carried it, (for the Fashion is now to turn the Libellous part into a Prayer) I think the best way is to take no notice of it at all; but the more carefully to observe, what the Man doth in the University: For I would have no Man publickly call'd in Question, where a fair Answer may be given and taken, that the Peace both of the Church, and of that place may be preserved, as much as may be. And yet to confess my thoughts to you, I think Mr. <hi>Greenwood</hi> had in this business, a very Factious, and a Rancorous mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>When you have made all the use you can of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I sent you on <hi>Wednesday,</hi> take a Copy of it, and send me back the <hi>Original</hi> safe.</p>

I pray be very careful in this also, for I know the <hi>Jesuits</hi> are very cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at these tricks; but if you have no more hold of your <hi>Printers,</hi> than that the <hi>Press</hi> must lye thus open to their Corruption, I shall take a Sowrer Course, than perhaps is expected. For tho' perhaps they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54616:65"/>
go so cunningly to Work, as that I shall not be able to make a legal Proof of this soul Misdemeanour: Yet I find that <hi>Knott</hi> makes a more speedy Answer, than is otherwise possible, without such seeing of the Sheets, I shall take that for Proof enough, and proceed to Discommission your Printer, and suppress his Press. And I pray fail not to let him know so much from me.</p>

                     <p>I Have received the Paper of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> Reasons, why he <note place="margin">A Passage of my Letters to the <hi>Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor Sept.</hi> 22. about Mr. <hi>Chillingworth's</hi> answering the second Part of <hi>Knott's</hi> Book.</note> is so loath to meddle with the second part of <hi>Knott's</hi> Book, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Answer to the first sufficient; and truely were all men that shall come to read his Book of his sufficiency, I would be of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, especially supposing, that to be true which he gives for one of his reasons, namely, that there is nothing in the Second of any worth or moment, that is not a repetition of somewhat in the First. Upon all things laid together, I am somewhat divided in my thoughts, what to resolve in this business; yet thus far I dare resolve.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> I would not have the Answer farther delay'd which Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> says he must needs do, and that for some Months, if he Answer the second Part. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If he Answer the first only, I would have him Print at the end of it those Reasons, which are fit to be publick why he does not Answer the second Part, and especially that Reason which he expresses, namely that the second Part contains almost nothing, but repetitions of the former. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of the first Part, I would quote to a Page where the same is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the second Part, that so the World may take notice, that both Parts are answered in one. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> I would have him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> with as much, as may any way be fit, that so no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content may arise between them.</p>

                     <p>When all is done, you must deal with Dr. <hi>Laurence</hi> to be very mindful of the waspishness of these times, and to be sure to read upon no argument, that may make any the least trouble in Church or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, which I shall in part lay upon your Care to look to; for so much as concerns Dr. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> so wishing you all health, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>SInce the Publishing of the new <hi>Statutes,</hi> there hath been some complaint made, that the younger sort cannot have access often enough to the <hi>Statute-Book,</hi> which is reserved in every particular <hi>College;</hi> thereby to know all Hours for <hi>Lectures,</hi> and all other Duties required of them.

This pains was undertaken, and the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by Mr. <hi>Thomas Crosfield</hi> of <hi>Queens College,</hi> and was Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Published in <hi>January</hi> 1638. but according to the old <hi>Stile</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> 1637.

I know there are other devices which <hi>Carpenters</hi> may mention: But they are to me as great <hi>Eye-sores,</hi> as a <hi>Post</hi> can be, and yet will not secure the Work, for neither clamping with Iron, nor Bracers from the Wall to the Beams, or two half <hi>Posts</hi> close to each Wall, can secure the middle of the Beam, where the greatest weakness is, and whence the Danger will come.</p>
                     <p>I am very glad to hear so well of the young <hi>Monk,</hi> that was; and <note place="margin">About <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Wescombe</hi> to be Master this next <hi>All.</hi>
                        </note> I pray let him have his Degree to be Master with all favour: For I do not see any inconveniency possible, by allowing any Man that time for his Degree, which he hath studiously spent in any other University. So let him be Master this Act, and God bless him.</p>

                           <hi>April</hi> 27. 1638. Concerning <hi>Gilpin's</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion from <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall.</note> 
                        <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall and <hi>Gilpin.</hi> And I plainly see, the business must be divided between them; and that Division I leave to you to make: Yet with this Caution that you suffer no man to escape unpunish't, for Incivility and Disrespect to his Governors; if the Complaint be justly made to You, and your assistance called for according to <hi>Statute.</hi> And on the other side, you shall do well to make the Precise part under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand (as you have occasion to deal with them) that they are not Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish't for their Conscience, But because they will never reform an erroneous Conscience, nor forbear Practising according to it, and that to the disturbance of Government. So the whole re-examination and future Settlement of that business I leave wholly to you.</p>
                     <p>I thank you heartily for your discreet Prosecution of that Base Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous <note place="margin">Concerning the Riotous Disorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Proctor Lawford.</hi>

What you will do, I know not: But if I should come to the knowledge of the Principal Offenders, if you did not Banish them the University, I should try how far my Power would stretch. The truth is, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Punishment be not laid upon some of them, it will be of more dangerous Consequence, than for ought I see, the Wisest of your Heads think on.</p>

Neither am I satisfied with You: For when you saw in what a disproportionable way to the Crime the Heads inclined to go, You should have told them plainly, and have performed it, That you would not yield to any such ending of the Business, till I were made acquainted with it, and had approved it, which I should never have done, but have brought the Offenders to some publick Shame or other. And indeed I am not a little troubled at this breach upon Government; which I ever perswaded my self, you would not have suffered. And I have much ado to hold my self from calling this Business to a more Publick reckoning, but that the disgrace both of the Heads and You must attend it. And I pray, let them know, how sensible I am of this great disservice to the University Government.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Frewen</hi> chosen my <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor.</hi>
                        </note> For the Dean of <hi>Sarum,</hi> Dr. <hi>Baylie,</hi> hath now undergone the pains and Care of that Place two Years together; and I shall not hold it fit without greater necessity, than I hope can befall me there, to over-burthen any man with more than two Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that carefull and troublesome Office. Dr. <hi>Baylie</hi> for his time hath been very carefull to give both my self and You, as much satisfaction and content, as well may be expected in the Execution of such an Office: And hath taken a great deal of Pains to uphold the discipline, and increase the Stock of the University. So that he hath left a good example to his Successor in both kinds. And now I have made choice of Dr. <hi>Frewen,</hi> Dean of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and President of <hi>Magdalen College</hi> to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him; who as he is every way very able and sufficient for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of that Place: So hath he this great advantage, that he hath been <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> heretofore, tho' under another <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the University, and by that means is well acquainted with all those things, which are incident to the Office: And thereby will be easily able to master those things which would be difficult to another man's begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. And this falls out so much the better, because at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> that great and beneficial <hi>Statute</hi> (give me leave to call it so) concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Examination of those, that stand for Degrees, must begin to be put in Execution. And tho' I do not hear, that the Younger sort have been so careful to provide themselves by speaking <hi>Latin</hi> in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Colleges, as I was to give them warning that they might; yet that shall put no stop upon me, but that I shall expect and require the Execution of the <hi>Statute.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:54616:70"/>
These are therefore to let You know, that I do hereby nominate and choose Dr. <hi>Frewen</hi> to be my <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> for the Year en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueing, and to pray and require You to allow of this my Choice, and to give him all the Respects due to his Place, and all other. Aid and Assistance by your Counsel or otherwise, which shall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, the better to inable him in the discharge of the Office, which he now undertakes. Thus not doubting of your readiness, and willing obedience herein; I leave both him and you all to the Blessing of God, and rest,</p>

               <p>WHereas there is an Omission in the Statutes concerning the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination <note place="margin">Passages out of the <hi>Vice-chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor's</hi> Letters, with Answers to them. 1. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in Term time. It needs not; the one being in Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being by Statute put into the Hands of the Proctors. 2. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Proctor <hi>Corbet</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-College,</hi> about his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting at the Communion at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Term.</note> of the younger sort before they take their Degrees, I advised the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> to consult the Heads for a supply of this defect in Statute, who did so, and sent me word that the Heads had Ordered, That all Regents should examine in their Course, those only excepted, who are dispensed with for their Absence by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; and that every Candidate repulsed as insufficient by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers, should not be admitted to a second Examination in six Months after. To this I gave Answer, That they should do well in a Business of such Difficulty, and so unpleasing to the young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and perhaps to the Regents also, to have this their Order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Convocation, unless they did find any thing in Statute to make such Order of their binding.</p>
               <p>To the Proctor of <hi>Merton-College,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> I delivered your Grace's Advice, That he should do well to substitute some other to officiate for him at the Communion at the beginning of Terms, if the tenderness of his Conscience would not give him leave to conform to such seemly Gestures, as are thought fit to be used at that Service: His Answer was, That he did conform therein at the last Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; the which, how true, my Predecessor now with your Grace, is best able to resolve you. I found him (I confess) more tractable than I expected; but since that time he is quite relapsed (the Fruit of his Friend's, Mr. <hi>Channell's</hi> Sermon, wherein among other the like passages he told us: That he that does more than Canon requires, is as great a <hi>Puritan,</hi> as he that does less.) By his last Discourse, I find him resolved neither to conform nor absent himself without Command, which I have assured him already is folly to expect. Yet to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he desired me to send you this inclosed Petition; a Copy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of here follows,</p>
               <p>To the Right Reverend Father in God, <hi>William,</hi> by the Divine Providence, Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;</hi> his Grace, the Honourable Chancellor of the Vniversity of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Humble Petition of <hi>Edward Corbet,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Proctor <hi>Corbet's</hi> Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> one of the Proctors of the same Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.</p>
               <p>WHereas your Petitioner was wish'd by Mr. <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> in your Grace's Name, either to bow towards the Altar at the University Common Prayers, or to forbear to officiate. He humbly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54616:72"/>
sheweth your Grace, that from his Heart he Loveth and Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and doth not only rigidly and carefully observe her Doctrine and Discipline, but would to the utmost of his weak power defend the same with his Pen or Blood. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he humbly beseecheth your Grace, that if above and besides what is established, any thing be thought fit to be practis'd, your Grace would vouchsafe either to order and command him to do it, or else be pleased to leave him to that Liberty which our Religious King and Orthodox Church have allowed him, so should he pray for your long Life and happy Government in the Church.</p>
               <p>And to all this I gave the Vice-chancellor this Answer following.</p>
               <p>I Thank you for your discreet handling of Proctor <hi>Corbet.</hi> And first for the thing it self; I have received his Petition, and will not give him any Command, either to do, or desist, or to appoint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Substitute, but leave him, and let him do as it shall please God and himself. And secondly, for the manner of this his Refusal, I must tell you, that it is all one in substance, with the Petition which Mr. <hi>Channell</hi> himself delivered me about a Twelve Month since; and that since your late being with me, I have received an Answer <note place="margin">Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this to your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>; you shall give the Proctor no Answer at all from me.</note> not much in effect differing from this Petition, from two or three Refractories in different Parts; and now your Predecessor tells me, that he being lately in his Visitation of his Peculiars belonging to his Deanery, had the same Answer given him, That they looked for a Command. By all which put together, I see the Faction have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed themselves, and are agreed to make this Answer, To call for a Command, which from me they shall never have, till I may be warranted my self by publick Authority: But we find, that besides Articles and Canons and Rubricks, &amp;c. the Church of Christ had ever certain Customs which prevailed in her Practice, and had no Canon for them; and if all such may be kickt out, you may bid farewel to all Decency and Order. In the mean time I will acquaint His Majesty with this Distemper growing, that the Blame may not be cast upon me.</p>

To prevent this, I pray communicate with the Heads, and make an Order, That a distinct Bell be tolled to every Lecture, that so the Auditors may know for what Lecture it is, and <note place="margin">This is since ordered by the Heads and settled.</note> apply themselves accordingly.

I have been the only Man that have kept up the Carryer to his four-wheeled Carriage for the University sake; but if this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition be true, it will force me to take off my Hand, and then I know he must take off two of his Wheels; and that done, let him carry what Weight he can. I pray You and the Heads to take this into serious Consideration, and to think upon some Remedy. That which I ever thought on was not to go by the weight of his Carriage, for then he will be continually laying on more, and you are not able to watch him, but by the number of his Horses, which should not exceed five or six at most; and then himself will not dare to lay on more load
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54616:74"/>
than his Horses can well draw through those bad ways; and if the Carriages be so great that he must use more Horses, let him use a second Cart, and divide his Team. If you can think upon a better way than this, I shall be glad of it, but You must prudently think upon some way for Remedy; for if it come to publick scanning at the Council-Table, or the Assizes, it will be ordered, whether you will or no, and perhaps in a sourer way, and not so agreeable to your Liberties, as this way it may be done.</p>

I cannot believe that the ablest Proceeders in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, if they had been examined upon the sudden, could have acquitted themselves better than these Candidates (such as I stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled on by chance) did upon expectation of a certain unavoidable Examination. The moderation which your Grace prescribed to Mr. <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> in the Execution of this Statute, hath set it very well on Foot, which if it had been pursued roughly at the beginning, would never have held, or else would have bred great Distempers in the University. For the <hi>Regents</hi> (who at the beginning of Term) kept out of the way, insomuch, that the Proctor of thirty of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Regents</hi> could scarce meet with three Examiners, if they had been held up stiffly at first to the rigour of the Statute, and so infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced some of them to lay open their own Infirmities or Disabilities, they would either have absented themselves quite, or else have made some desperate violent opposition against the Statute, and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that should back it. But by this Moderation which Mr. <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Care and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> herein.</note> useth towards them, (conniving at some defects now and then, where they come short of the Statute) he hath won the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents</hi> so, as that they conform themselves in a good measure to the intent of the Statute. For they examine through all the Arts and Sciences, in which the <hi>Candidates</hi> are bound to have been <hi>Auditors,</hi> asking fundamental Questions in every one, not propounding studied Subtilties to gravel and discourage young Students. And when the Statute hath gotten head, (which many Men had fore-doomed, and therefore did not fit themselves for it against it should take place,) I doubt not but the <hi>Regents</hi> will rise to a higher pitch, and the <hi>Candidates</hi> likewise will come prepared for it. But that which will set a special Edge upon both, is Mr. <hi>Vice-chancellor's</hi> assiduous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence at their Examinations, which I must confess looking to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Solitude and Retiredness, I could never have expected from him.</p>

                     <p>WE are informed that you have for some Years suffered a very ill Custom to continue in that our Collegiate Church; for whereas there are divers Scholars chosen to be Students of that House, and divers others, that live there as Commoners, but the greatest part of the Scholars are chosen from our School at <hi>Westminster;</hi> there is a Supper maintained Yearly, commonly called a <hi>Westminster</hi> Supper, at which all and only <hi>Westminster</hi> Scholars do meet. This Supper we hold to be a very ill Custom, and no way fit to be continued: For first, it is a thing not allowable in Government, that any party of Men should have a several Meeting, which is a direct way to Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Combination, and it teacheth the rest of the Students in such a Society to bandy themselves together against the other, that they may not be thought to be neglected. Secondly, such a Meeting must needs cause more Expences than many Students are able to bear, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in such chargeable times as these are. Thirdly, it gives an occasion of much Drinking and Riot, and consequently of all the bad effects which follow such excesses; besides no small disorder in leaving or keeping open the Gates of the College, for ingress and egress, for resort to that disorderly Meeting, at later Hours than are fit. And most usually to add to all this Disorder, this Supper must be kept upon a <hi>Friday-Night,</hi> against both the Canons of the Church and Laws of the Realm, and to the great Scandal of all sober Men that hear of it.</p>
                     <p>These are therefore to Will and Require You, the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to suppress that Supper or Meeting, by what Name soever it be called; and to call the Students together, and to command them in Our Name, that they presume not at any time hereafter to resort to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to any such Meeting, either in the College or out of it; and to Register these our Letters among the Orders and Decrees for the Government of that Church, as You and every of You will answer it at your utmost Perils; and these our Letters We Will shall be bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, not only upon your Selves, but upon your Successors, that this ill and dangerous Custom may never rise up into Practice again, Given &amp;c.</p>

HEaring that the new Statutes at <hi>Oxford</hi> permit none but those who totally reside and study there to take Degrees, and admit no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Terms, more than those wherein they were commorant there, so that many Discontinuers cannot in so short time proceed, as formerly there they might have done, and here with us they may yet, whereby many Batchelors of Arts of <hi>Oxford</hi> came this Year for their Degrees of Masters of Arts here, which this Year they could not obtain at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which I endeavoured to prevent, least <hi>Oxford</hi> should in a short time lose half their Proceeders, especially the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuers, for which I had no thanks here, because the <hi>Vice-chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> and <hi>Proctors</hi> lose Fees thereby, and the Colleges too; and there alledged to me that it was no prejudice to <hi>Oxford;</hi> for if it were, that University would have given publick Notice, or written to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> &amp;c. and that I had no particular Command from the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> so to do, whereby one <hi>Walter Crook,</hi> late of <hi>

The occasion this, as it follows in the Proctor's own Relation, <hi>in haec verba:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>ON the 31st. of <hi>May</hi> about 8 at Night, Mr. Proctor <hi>Fulham</hi> witho ther Senior Masters of that House standing near the College-gate, observed amongst others coming out of the Town into the College in their Hats one <hi>Edward Moore</hi> with his Hat on; the rest, as soon as they came within the view of the Proctor, modestly put off their Hats, and endeavoured to hide them; but <hi>Moore</hi> passed boldly by the Proctor without moving his Hat, whereupon the Proctor call'd him back, and question'd him for wearing his Hat in the Town, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that since he was in a fault, it would have better becom'd him to hide it, than to wear it on his Head. <hi>Moore</hi> clapping on his Hat, replied, that he was in the College. The Proctor twice or thrice admonish'd him to put off his Hat; but he refusing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing with his Hat on, the Proctor (having before complained on a Scholar of the House that had affronted him in like manner, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much slighted, as he conceived with this Answer, That in such Cases he was to be considered there but as an ordinary Master of Arts,) gave him a gentle Box on the Ear; and the said <hi>Moor</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in his Contumacy, was charged according to Statute by the Proctor to go to the <hi>Castle;</hi> but the said <hi>Moore</hi> went not, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to Mr. <hi>Hide,</hi> being his Deputy-Tutor in the absence of Mr. <hi>Glisson</hi> to be advised. Mr. <hi>Hide</hi> brought <hi>Moore</hi> to Mr. Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and complained of the Proctor as if he had done the Scholar wrong. Upon this Complaint, Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> sends for the Proctor to his Lodging, in the presence of <hi>Moore,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hide</hi> condemns the Proctor, and justifies <hi>Moore,</hi> and very much rated and check'd the Proctor; telling him, that he had done more than he could justifie, and that he should have nothing to do in the College; and that if he meddled thus in the House, he would meddle with him: That he was not Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> nor should be. And (by way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision) asked him, why he questioned not him and other Doctors that passed by that way, for their Hats; adding, That he got no good Will by being so busie; and so warned the Proctor to appear before the Chapter next Morning at 9 of the Clock, to answer for what he had done, in the mean time allowed <hi>Moore</hi> all Liberty of Speech to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and justifie his Fault. And Mr. Dean expresly told the Proctor, That <hi>Moore</hi> should not go to the Castle notwithstanding Command; and Mr. <hi>Hide</hi> (tho' sworn Pro-proctor) at the same time abbetting the said <hi>Moore</hi> told the Proctor he had done more than he could justisie in striking the said <hi>Moore,</hi> and that he ought not to go to the Castle upon his Command; using many other Words of Contestation and Reproach to the Proctor and his Authority. And Mr. <hi>Hide</hi> also said, That he had bid his Scholar not go to the Castle, but first go to Mr.

Dean to complain — Mr. Proctor hath observ'd and inform'd Mr. Dean as much, That the Gentlemen-Commoners sit in the Hall in Hats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, bring them to the Church constantly, walk and stand under his Window, some in Boots, and most in Hats; and as the Proctor pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by, they stand to it, upon what Encouragement he knows not.</p>

                     <p>I Have received two Letters from You the last Week and this, and <note place="margin">My Letters to Dr. <hi>Fell</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> both concerning the Accident fallen out between you and Proctor <hi>Fulham</hi> in the case of <hi>Moore.</hi> In your last Letter, you tell me there is a lameness fallen upon you, (which I am sorry for) and had not that happened, you would have come and given me an Account of the Business at <hi>Lambeth;</hi> but had you come, you would utterly have lost your Labour. For I would have spent no time, having so little to run to waste, to hear one side only, where two are concerned.</p>
                     <p>For the Business it self, I see you decline answering it to the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanchellor,</hi> under pretence, that it was done within your Gates. But first, I would pray you to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> that the Fault in question was done without your Gates, for it was for wearing a Hat in the Town. And howsoever, be the Cause what it will, I will not suffer any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Governour to wrong a publick Officer in any kind whatsoever, but that he shall answer it to my <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> if he do. For I well know, the Proctor will have little Credit abroad in the Streets, if he shall have Contempt put upon him at Home in his College. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, your declining the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> in this manner, and your refusing to answer upon Oath, when the Proctor offers to justifie all his Complaint by Oath in every particular, makes me think the Proctor's Relation is true in every Circumstance; and if it be true both in Circumstance and Substance, tho' for Government sake, (which you have so slighted in the Proctor) I shall be unwilling to put any Sowerness upon you in publick; yet must I tell you, you have carried this Business like a sudden, hasty, and weak Man, and most
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54616:78"/>
unlike a Man that understands Government. And should you go on with other things according to this, I shall have cause to repent some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what. And assure your self, if I hear any more like this I shall easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what I have to do. This to your self under Seal; so &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> in the mean time proceeded against <hi>Moore,</hi> but finding the Youth very Humble and Submissive, and but new come to the University, and the Proctor himself earnestly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding for him, took his private Submission, but enjoyned him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in <hi>Christ-Church</hi> Hall to deliver the Proctor an Epistle with an acknowledgment of his Fault, which was done accordingly. And for <hi>Hide,</hi> he was passed by, and was not Pro-Proctor this Year, but one Mr. <hi>William Cartwright</hi> of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> had that place.</p>

                           <hi>July</hi> 10. Two ignorant Batchelors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> from their Admission; They were of <hi>Glocester-Hall.</hi>
                        </note> from their Admission, which was a very wholsome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to uphold the Statute of Examination. But thereupon I writ to him, not to let it rest there, but to call in question those Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that examined them, who went directly against their Oath, in giving Testimony to such ignorant Men, and desired him to be as careful as he could in this Business. And this Repulse was made in the view of the New <hi>Regents,</hi> who were then all there present to be admitted.</p>
                     <p>For this his first Year the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> brought into the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity <note place="margin">831 <hi>l.</hi> brought into the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Chest for this Year.</note> Chest in ready Mony 831 <hi>l.</hi> 19 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> all Deductions made; and repaid likewise to Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley's</hi> Stock the 500 <hi>l.</hi> borrowed thence for the Purchase of Land for the Anatomy-Lecture.

But tho' I proceed to a new Nomination,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54616:79"/>
yet I can no way hold it fit to nominate a New <hi>Vice-chancellor,</hi> but shall continue that Trouble and Pains to Dr. <hi>Frewen</hi> for one Year more. And this I hold necessary to do, not only for the great Integrity and Sufficiency with which he hath managed thatOffice for this Year past; but also in particular for the great Success with which God hath blessed him in putting that useful Statute of the Examination of <hi>Candidates</hi> into Practice, which must needs tend to the great Benefit and Honour of that University in all succeeding times. And I am very desirous to continue it in the same Hand, and under the same Care for another Year, to the end it may the better settle.</p>
                     <p>These are therefore to let you know, that I do nominate and choose Dr. <hi>Frewen</hi> to be my <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> for this Year ensuing.

                     <p>THere is an Advertisement, which tho' I have given You Mr. <note place="margin">Warning, given, that the Masters keep their Seats, whilest either any publick Letters are read, or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnSpeeches made in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</note> 
                        <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> already in a private Letter, yet I thought now fit to mention it again in these publick Letters, that the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity might the better take notice of it. There is I confess, an old but a very ill Custom continued in the Convocation-House; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that whensoever the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> or either of the Proctors have an occasion to read any publick Letters, or make any Solemn Speech to that Body; the Masters do all or most of them rise from their Seats and come and stand confusedly before him that speaks, expresly contrary to Statute, and taking off all Decency and Dignity from that place. 'Tis probable, That this might arise at first upon a desire to hear some <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> or Proctor who had a lower Voice; but far better it is, that any such should be imperfectly heard, than the whole Order, Form and Dignity of a Convocation-House should be thereby lost. These are therefore to require every Member of that House to keep his Seat according to Statute, and not to stir or draw nearer the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> or Proctors upon any pretence of hearing, or any other whatsoever, and that they so continue in their Seats all the time of every several Convocation. And if any Man shall thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Statute presume to leave his Seat, and so either break the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or disturb the Peace of the House, I do hereby require, that the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> command him to Prison, and give me Notice of his Name; and that he that is to speak proceed not on with his Speech, until the House shall continue settled in every part. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">No Man to enter the Convocation-House upon pain of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, that is not a Member of that Body.</note> I require the <hi>Vice-chancellor</hi> and Proctors for the Time being, and their Successors, to commit any Man to the Castle, that shall presume to come within the Convocation-House Door, that is not a Member of that Body. And I do require that these my Letters be Registred, that this Direction may be the better kept in Memory.</p>

                     <p>THis next passage I shall desire you to communicate with the Heads, <note place="margin">A Branch of my Letters (of <hi>Octob.</hi> 4.) to the <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellor</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of Formalities.</note> and let both them and the Proctors know, That I have been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that some Masters come to St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and stand or sit there bare in Sermon time, not out of any Devotion, but only to hide their Hats. The end why I write this to you is, because I doubt if you look not well to it at the beginning of Term, you will find a Breach upon that Decency of the University before you be aware; and the reason why I desire you to impart it to the Heads and the Proctors is, because I know the Work will be too heavy for you alone, if they shall not concur to give you their best assistance in their several Stations. These are therefore to pray and require every of them to look strictly to their several Charges, and to assist you in all things according to the Statutes in the University, in which if any Man shall fail, I shall take it so much the worse from him, as there is greater necessity to hold up good Order in the brokeness of these times. And further, I think it not amiss that you employ the <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>omen-Beadles to look about the Church in Sermon time, and see who they are that in any cunning way offer to break the Statutes. I know this will be a work full of Envy to them; and therefore I think it may be very fit that you think of a Course how they may have profit by it, to sweeten their pains. And for my part, if you and the Heads shall find it so fit, I think it were not amiss, if out of the mulcts for those Offences some Proportion were given to them for their pains. But above all things, I desire you and the Proctors, and all else whom it may Concern, to continue your wonted Care of the Examinations, which will I hope prove a great Honour, and a greater advantage to the University.</p>

And this I take it is universal. And the reason of it (as I conceive) is, That the Prayers of the Church, howsoever different in place, might be jointly put up to God in all places at the same time. How sit it will be upon particular respects to vary such an universal <hi>Tradition,</hi> would be well thought on. As for the Hour which they say they shall gain to their Studies by this change, that works little upon me. For if Men be so studiously minded, that Hour may be taken, as well after Prayers as before. And Prayers coming between, will rather be a Relaxation to them than a hindrance. Besides, I cannot foresee what Example this may produce in other Cathedrals. And I would be very loath they should learn an ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from the University. Therefore I pray think well of these and other Circumstances, before you make any change.</p>

                     <p>THE University of <hi>Oxford</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edw.</hi> III. had the <note place="margin">The State of the Title of the <hi>Chancellor</hi> and <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for Licensing and Suppressing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, &amp;c. And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and Justices of the Town. This was drawn up by Council out of that which was shewed them by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</note> sole keeping of the Assize of Bread and Drink in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the Government and Correction of all manner of Victuallers, and Victualling and Tippling-Houses there.</p>
                     <p>This Power continued in the University for about 200 Years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interruption, until the Statute of 5 &amp; 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. which gave power to two Justices of Peace in every Shire or City to License Ale-Houses; and ordained, That none should keep any Ale-House but such as should be so Licensed.</p>
                     <p>By colour of this Statute (in regard there was therein no express saving of the Privileges of the University) the Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>Oxford,</hi> being Justices there, have Licensed Ale-Houses.</p>
                     <p>The Chancellor of the University and his Vice-Chancellor, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary and Deputy at the time of the making of the said Statutes were Justices of Peace within the City. And the Privileges of both Universities were afterwards in 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> confirmed by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in all Acts of Parliament since made touching Ale-Houses, the Correction and Punishment of all Ale-House-keepers and Tipplers in Ale-Houses in the University, is reserved solely to the Governor of the University.</p>
                     <p>The University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the Fifth Year of King <hi>Richard</hi> II. had their Privileges by Parliament granted to them, such as the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Oxford</hi> had, and no other. Yet when the Officers of the Town in the Sixth Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> attempted to License Ale-House, they were restrain'd by the Queen's Letter, and that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity hath ever since quietly enjoy'd the Privileges of the sole Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censing of Ale-Houses.</p>
                     <p>In the Book of Directions touching Ale-Houses, set forth 1608. His late Majesty declared, that the Officers of both Universities should have the Power of Licensing and ordering of Ale-Houses, and not the Officers or Justices of the Town.</p>
                     <p>And His Majesty in his Charter of Confirmation of the Liberties of the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> in the Eleventh Year of his Reign, hath been graciously pleased to grant that no License shall be made to any Victualler or Ale-House-keeper, without the special assent of the Chancellor.</p>
                     <p>There are now 300 Ale-Houses Licensed in <hi>Oxford,</hi> which occasion great Disorder in the University.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore most humbly desired on the behalf of the said Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, That his Majesty would be pleased by his gracious Letters to be directed to the Mayor and Commonalty of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to command them not to intermeddle in the Licensing of any Person to keep Ale-House or Tap-House within the Jurisdiction or Liberty of the said University or City of <hi>Oxford.</hi>

It seems strange to us (which we hear) that there should be now Three hundred Ale-Houses in <hi>Oxford:</hi> And we believe they would not have risen to that number, had the power of Licensing them rested only with the Vice-Chancellor and other Governors of our said University, as it doth in our University of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> We do therefore charge and require you, as you tender our Pleasure, and mean to enjoy the Liberties which you use under our Favour and Goodness, that you henceforth meddle not in the Licensing of any Person to keep Ale-Houses, Tap-Houses, or Victualling-Houses within the Jurisdiction or Liberty of the said University, and City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> but that you leave the same to the Vice-Chancellor and other Justices of Peace there, who are Members of the said University.</p>

There he sat a diligent Auditor for the space of an hour.

                     <p>ON <hi>Monday Nov.</hi> 18. the Vice-Chancellor sent his Majesty's, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">Concerning 300 Alehouses in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the ordering of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Majesty's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> Ale-Houses, to the Mayor and Aldermen. Upon the Receipt of them they consulted very privately, but yet it was easily known to be about the Contents of that Letter, because they enquired how many Ale-Houses were in every Parish. And this doubtless they did, to see if they could disprove the Information given to his Majesty, concerning the number of 300 Ale-Houses within the Town. But Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> who by my direction looked very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Business, made his Information good by the Testimony of the Ale-Brewer's Clerk, Servant to that College. And though this number be extremely too great; yet so long as Bakers and Brewers have the power of granting Licenses, no Man is like to be denied, that will take his Bread of the one, and his Ale of the other.</p>
                     <p>The Vice-Chancellor presently gave me notice of all this, least the Town should inform the Earl of <hi>Berkshire</hi> their Steward, and perhaps untruly, and so possess him against the University: And it seems they did so. For my Lord meeting me at Court, spake with me about the business, and acknowledged from them but 160 Ale-Houses, and that most of these were Privileged Persons, and Licensed by the University, contrary to their own Promise and Undertaking at the open Sessions; but spake nothing of the procuring of the Letter it self, which I was very glad of, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> his Lordship, that I verily believed he was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform'd in all particulars, as I doubted not but it would plainly appear.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Vice-Chancellor very discreetly went on to the <note place="margin">The Order by which the Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor proceeded in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> Reformation of this Scandal to the University; in which he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> That it might appear he aim'd at the good of the University, in the License which he drew up for the future, he makes it a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Recognizance for any Ale-House-keeper to receive any Scholar into his House to drink and tipple there.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> So soon as he had his full Proof that there were 300, he commanded the Constables of every Parish to bring in the Names of all such as sell Ale there. This Note he communicated with the Proctors, and turned out all such as in their several Night-Walks they had found to keep disorderly Houses.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> After this he sent the same Note to some of the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial and orderly Men in every Parish, and by their Advice struck out all those which had any Trade or other means to live by, that being a far fitter Course for them than Ale-House-keeping.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To the end no cunning of the Town might be able to elude this, he deliver'd to the Ale-Brewers the Names of all such as are now Licensed, with a charge not to serve Ale to any other upon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of paying the Mulct, which both the Statutes of the Realm and of the University inflict upon Offenders in that particular.</p>
                     <p>And as for the Allegation which they made to my Lord the Earl of <note place="margin">That almost all this vast number of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses were Licens'd by the Mayor and the Town-Justices.</note> 
                        <hi>Berkshire</hi> in their excuse, that proves utterly void. For <hi>1st,</hi> The number of 300 at the least is fully proved. <hi>2dly,</hi> Were it true that the most of these were Privileged Persons, that would not help them neither: For the greatest part, even of the Privileged Men, have been Licensed by themselves for their own Profit. <hi>3dly,</hi> On the University part no Justice hath given allowance to any but the Vice-Chancellor only: Neither can
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54616:84"/>
any License continue longer than for one Year. <hi>4thly,</hi> The Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor <note place="margin">Vid. Dalton. p. <hi>376, &amp; 377.</hi>
                        </note> that now is, hath been in that Office a Year and an half, and in all this time hath not Licensed any one till now, that His Majesty's Letters <note place="margin">Alderman <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> (as I have been since inform'd by very good hands) Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed 100 for his part, and tied them all to take their Beer of him.</note> came down to settle that Power in me and the University, according to our antient Privileges in that behalf. 'Tis true, that some produced an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Licenses subscribed by some of the Vice-Chancellor's Predecessors, as namely by Dr. <hi>Pinck</hi> and Dr. <hi>Baylie</hi> in their several Years respectively. But these, as they were out of Date, so were they very few, not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 20 in the whole number. By all which it appears manifestly, that almost all this Scandalous number of 300 were Licensed by the Mayor and the Town-Justices, and not by the University, as hath been suggested to my Lord their Steward.</p>
                     <p>The Vice-Chancellor took for his Assistant in this Business Dr. <hi>Pinck,</hi> Warden of <hi>New-College,</hi> who had been Vice-Chancellor, and best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the State of the Town (tho' Dr. <hi>Fell</hi> had means to be best ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <note place="margin">All these Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's Letters to me of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemb.</hi> 20. of <hi>Nov.</hi> 25. and of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 2.</note> with the number of the Ale-Houses:) And for a beginning supprest 200 of the 300, and then found it impossible for the present to sink them lower, there being so many poor and indigent People amongst them, who have no other possible means of Subsistance. Among these appear'd a lamentable Spectacle: For the only Son of Mr. <hi>Braddell</hi> (who had for many Years together in my Memory been Principal of St. <hi>Mary's Hall,</hi> and lived well, but in too free a fashion) was now found to be one of this number; yet for some reasons the Vice-Chancellor refused to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense him among the rest, unless the Principal of <hi>Brazen-Nose,</hi> and the Provost of <hi>Oriel</hi> (which were of his Father's antient Acquaintance, and now pleaded for him) would become his Sureties; and so the Business stands at present.</p>

The Mayor, Recorder and Town-Clerk there present assented, but next day fell off, upon pretence that the Commonalty would not yield: And here we stick. They press to have the Judge's first Order confirm'd, which gives all the Amercements to them. We plead an antient Composition (seen since, and allow'd by the same Judge) which gives us half. Their own Recorder is ashamed of them, and hath sundry times complain'd to me of their peevishness and breach of Promise in this particular. If they be now in earnest (whereof I much doubt) we will give them a Meeting when they please, and once more try whether by a friendly Parly these Differences may be composed.</p>

Understanding that some sold Ale without my leave, I sent out a Warrant to the Officers in every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. They finding by it that their Poor should reap the Fruit of their Pains, readily obey, make a strict search, inform and press to have the Penalty exacted, which hath bred a strange Distemper amongst them. and a strange one it must be, that can disjoin them (as this hath done) in their feud against the University.</p>
                     <p>Here follows the Copy of the Vice-Chancellor's Warrant.</p>
                     <p>THESE are to require you and every of you, immediately upon Receipt hereof <note place="margin">The Vice-Chancellor's Warrant.</note> to make diligent Inquiry in your Parish after all and every Person and Persons, that do take upon them to sell Ale or Beer within your said Parish, besides them whose Names are under-written.

Also I require you to make diligent search (taking with you a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable) what quantity of Ale or Beer the said Persons have in their several Houses, and to inform me what Brewer or Brewers have served the same: That I may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them according to the Law. Hereof fail you not, as you will answer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary at your Perils. <hi>Given,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Our University Coroner being last Week to sit upon the Body of a Privileged <note place="margin">A Privileged Person drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Person drowned near <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> sends his Warrant, (according as the Statute directs him) to the Constable of St. <hi>Olave's</hi> to warn a Jury: He presently consults the Mayor, and the Mayor the Town-Clerk, the City Oracle, and both instruct him to disobey, because by their Charter they are exempted from all Service without their Liberties, as this Place was, though yet within the Parish of St. <hi>Olave's;</hi> which forced us for the present to send into the Country for a Jury, <note place="margin">The Town not warning a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Coroner to warn one.</note> which lost time, and cost trouble.

And on <hi>Friday</hi> last I brought one of their Bailists almost upon his Knees, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing an unlicensed Tippling-House with Beer.

But, I confess, the Course did not make so deep Impression, while I barely apprehended the same, as did the solemn Executions thereof, while it was let in at mine Eyes and Ears, being the last Week present with Mr. Vice-Chancellor, and other Heads at that Exercise. The Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the Places for the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors at the upper end, and the like on each side for the Examiners and the Examined,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54616:87"/>
make the Exercise passing solemn, and cannot but beget an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Care in the Actors on both sides, to fit themselves unto this awful Tryal. For my own part, upon fuller Consideration, I take it to be the most absolute Course that ever was devised, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of the University: This single Course giving Life to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Pains of Tutors, and the publick Pains of Readers, making the Auditors diligent, if they come, which is for their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And if not so, but that the Private and Publick be slack, it putteth them upon a diligent search otherwise to enable themselves, as Men concern'd, either to give a good Account, or to be left to publick Shame and Obloquy. Your Grace in this one Course hath compleated all that the Founders of Colleges and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures intended. They intended the means to make Men Scholars; Your Grace applieth this Means, and effecteth it; I doubt not but Your Grace fully comprehended this, and have had the like Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions formerly presented unto you. Yet I trust the Repetition here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will not be ungrateful, in as much as this my late Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this singular Benefit may infer, that the sight and hearing of this Exercise, may in like manner work upon Men in succeeding times, and cause them deservedly to bless your Memory, who have so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely provided for this University, in this very particular, as that it may for ever carry the Face and Credit of an University.</p>

                     <p>IT was objected unto me at my late being in <hi>London,</hi> by Persons <note place="margin">Tavern haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of.</note> of good Quality, That our Universities of <hi>England</hi> were grown to that Corruption, especially of excessive Drinking, that many did Miscarry by the Liberty and ill Example which was given them there. Insomuch, that many to avoid the Danger, did send their Sons beyond Seas for their Education. Whereunto I made answer, That the Humours of Men are such in this Age, that Innocence and Perfection it self, being in Authority, could hardly avoid Calumny. That the Times are much better than heretofore they were; And that the Fault (if there were any) did much proceed from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents themselves, who think it a great Disparagement to their Sons, that they should be kept within the Limits of Discipline.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding all which, and what else may justly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, the serious Consideration of what was objected, hath caused me so much to forget mine own Unworthiness, as by my own Pen to intimate unto Your Grace, (what I have long time wished that some other would have done,) That the Liberty of resorting to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns,</hi> and other <hi>Drinking-Houses,</hi> and the <hi>Excess</hi> committed there is such, as may give some occasion of Scandal, being dangerous to Youth, and shameful in others, who ought to be Examples of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi> Having upon this occasion enquired into Times past, since the happy Reformation of this University, I understand by credible Information, that Dr. <hi>Pinck</hi> by his personal visiting of suspected Places, left the University, in this respect, in better state than it is at this present. For me to write how dangerous the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse into so loathsom and general a Disease may prove, were to forget my self, and my principal Intention, which was only to make known unto You this Defect, and thereby to do Service to this Place, and in part to express my Thankfulness to Your self for the much Favour vouchsafed unto me.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54616:88"/>
was Relapsing into a <hi>Drinking Humour,</hi> to its great Dishonour. But, I confess, I believed it not, because I had no Intimation of it from you. But this Letter comes from a Man that can have no Ends but Honesty, and the good of that Place. And because you shall see what he writes, I send you here a Copy of his Letter, and do earnestly beg of you, That you will forthwith set your self to punish all haunting of <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Ale-Houses</hi> with all the strictness that may be, that the University, now advancing in Learning, may not sink in Manners, which will shame and destroy all.</p>
                     <p>I am informed too from a very good, but another, <hi>Hand,</hi> That <note place="margin">Care to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the well Ordering and Educating Young Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> there is extream <hi>Liberty</hi> given and taken by Young <hi>Noblemen</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the better Sort in the University: That <hi>Tutors</hi> in most Colleges do only bestow a little Pains in Reading to them, if they will come at them, but use no Power of Government over them, or any restraint; as if they had nothing to do but only to Read to them.

And more, that it should be confessed by you, that they are not kept in so good awe, as they are at <hi>Cambridge;</hi> for, I am sure, your <hi>Statutes</hi> are perfecter than theirs, and, I dare say, you have as much careful Assistance from me in all things, as <hi>Cambridge</hi> hath from their <hi>Chancellor.</hi> And this being undeniably true, the fault must needs be among your selves: And I protest unto you, I knew nothing of any of their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> misgiven or misused, till about a Fortnight since, that I writ to you about the Young <hi>Earl of Downe,</hi> and that now you write to me about <hi>Caufield,</hi> the Son of an <hi>Irish</hi> Lord.

'Tis true, I would have a difference put between <hi>Noblemens</hi> Sons and others of meaner Condition; but that should be in an Honourable Usage of them, not in giving them any <hi>Liberty</hi> at their own hurt, and the Dishonour of the University. Now whether you will send for all these Young Men to the meeting of the Heads, that they may know what Charge I have given concerning them, I leave to your self, and that which you shall judge fittest upon the place. But I would have Young <hi>Caufield</hi> called, and his <hi>Tutour,</hi> and there

let it be told unto them, and the Head of the House in which he is, that if he mend not his Manners, he shall not stay there to corrupt others.

                     <p>YOUR Letters of the Seventh of this <hi>June</hi> with all Humility <note place="margin">The Mayor of <hi>Oxford's</hi> Letter to the Lords about <hi>Greene's</hi> Inn, with a Complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Town Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges.</note> we have received: And according to Your Lordships Commands therein, we have diligently enquired and informed our selves, and do find that some <hi>Guests,</hi> being <hi>Recusants,</hi> do resort to the Inn called the <hi>Miter,</hi> and that <hi>Greene</hi> named in Your Lordship's Letter, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented at the last Sessions for a <hi>Popish Recusant;</hi> but not many Years since he was one of our <hi>Serjeants,</hi> and did then frequent the <hi>Church:</hi> And we finding that he Marrying the late Inn-holder's Widow of the said Inn, became <hi>Owner</hi> thereof during the Minority of his Son-in-Law; and by that means, it being an ancient <hi>Inn</hi> of the Inheritance of <hi>Lincoln-College,</hi> he keepeth the same Inn. And touching the Authority and Licensing the said <hi>Greene</hi> so to do, His Majesty's Letters were lately procured and sent to us, that we should not meddle in the <hi>Licensing</hi> of any Person to keep Ale-Houses, or Victualling-Houses, but that we should leave the same to the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> and the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices</hi> that were Members of the University. And under pretence of that Letter, when we in Obedience to His Majesty's <hi>Proclamation,</hi> and his Highness's <hi>Writ</hi> directed to us for the observing of <hi>Lent,</hi> at the beginning of the last <hi>Lent</hi> did by Warrant Summon the <hi>Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers</hi> of our own Body only to become bound to His Majesty accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the said <hi>Proclamation,</hi> the Vice-Chancellor sent his <hi>Beadles</hi> to the Mayor, to tell him that the binding of <hi>Victuallers</hi> did belong to the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> and not to the <hi>Mayor:</hi> And thereupon the Vice-Chancellor presently made a <hi>Warrant</hi> to call all the Victuallers before him at another Place, one Hour before the time appointed in the Mayor's <hi>Warrant.</hi> And amongst others did take a <hi>Recognizance</hi> of the said <hi>Greene,</hi> but never certified the same <hi>Recognizance,</hi> not any other <hi>Recognizances</hi> to the Sessions according to the Law. And we make bold to certifie Your Lordships. That we have only the Name of Mayor and Magistrates, but the Vice-Chancellor, Doctors, and Proctors do interpose in the Town Affairs: That all our Liberties and Privileges are much lessened; that of late we had much ado to get Mayor and Bailiffs (there being so many that paid their Fines
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54616:94"/>
to refuse) that the City was at last forced to refuse their Fines, and to compel them to take upon them the same Offices. Whereas here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore when we enjoy'd our Liberties and Privileges, the same Places were much desired. And so hoping that, the Premisses considered, Your Lordships will not conceive us so careless therein, as in Your Lordships Letters is express'd, we humbly take leave, resting at Your Lordships Service.</p>

A Watch was set by Mr. Mayor and his Brethren, with the Consent of the Vice-Chancellor (these Rebellious times requiring the same) part of which <hi>Watch,</hi> by reason of divers Inrodes and Inlets (besides the <hi>Gates</hi> of the <hi>City</hi>) were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Mr. <hi>Mayor</hi> to walk about their several <hi>Wards</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> for the Safety thereof, and good Order; by which Watch straggling Soldiers and others have been taken, and we have been safe. But Mr. Proctors question the said Watch, and exact of them 40 <hi>s.</hi> a time for such their walking: And for Non-payment thereof threaten to sue them in the Vice-chancellor's <hi>Court,</hi> and send for these <hi>Watch-Men</hi> very often to their Chambers, and make them attend them there, and have imprison'd some of the Constables, and have laid hold of the Watch-Men, and taken some of them to the Prison Gates with an intent to Imprison them; and do say, that Mr. Mayor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give them Power to go from the Gates of the said City. And for these Causes Mr. Mayor is forced to discharge the Watch; but the Watch in St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Parish (being the Entrance from <hi>Farrington,</hi> where the late Rebellion was) he did not discharge, and the last Night Proctor <hi>Allibond</hi> Imprisoned the Constable for setting the same Watch. All this we will prove to be true upon Oath, if it be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And therefore our humble Suit to Your Lordship is, That by Your good furtherance we may receive the Opinion of the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council, what shall be done in the Premisses; And whether Mr. Mayor shall be freed of all Danger for not setting a Watch in these troublesom Times or not.

                     </opener>
                     <p>THE Mayor of <hi>Oxford</hi> hath lately sent these two Letters above <note place="margin">My Letters to the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these two Letters of the Mayor.</note> written, one to the Lords of the <hi>Council,</hi> and the other to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Berks,</hi> to shew to the Lords. And I here send you the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of them both. The Letter to the Lords is most concerning <hi>Greene</hi> and his Inn; in which I do desire you to make a clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Answer to these Particulars following. As First, Whether this Inn be the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of <hi>Lincoln-College;</hi> and whether <hi>Greene</hi> is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of it by the Marriage of the Widow in the Right of his Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law. And this the rather, because your first <hi>Information</hi> said, That the <hi>Town</hi> authorized him to keep this Inn. Secondly, You may see by this how angry they are about their <hi>Victuallers,</hi> where they directly charge you, That amongst others you took a <hi>Recognizance</hi> of the said <hi>Greene,</hi> but never certified the said <hi>Recognizance</hi> nor any other to the Sessions according to the Law: To which also it will be fit you give Answer. Thirdly, They say they have only the Name of <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Magistrates;</hi> and speak in all the rest of their Letter, as if all the <hi>Town Privileges</hi> were invaded by the University. And here I would have you answer two things. The one, That they offer to invade the University Privileges, which I conceive is true. And the other, Whether so many as they mention did refuse the Offices of <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Bailiffs</hi> this last Year.</p>
                     <p>Their second Letter is only concerning their <hi>Night-Watch;</hi> in which I think there is a manifest invading of the <hi>Vniversity Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege:</hi> And Proctor <hi>Allibond</hi> is challenged by Name. But they have taken a very cunning rise for their Business; for they put it all upon their Care for a Watch, by reason of the Seditious Tumult at <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington.</hi> There is great reason that Mr. <hi>Mayor</hi> should be freed from
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54616:95"/>
all Danger about <hi>setting of a Watch,</hi> save only such as is his Duty to set; but the <hi>Lords</hi> will not give me their Opinion, till they have an Answer from the University how the Mayor's Watch and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity Privileges stand together. I pray therefore send a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this Particular especially. But I pray send your whole An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in such fair Terms, as that I may shew it whole and entire to the Lords; but let the matter be as full home as you can.</p>

                     <p>IN the Name of the whole University, as well as in my own, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <note place="margin">The Vice-Chancellor's Answer to the two Letters of the Mayor of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                        </note> Your Grace humble Thanks for the Notice which by Your last Letter You have been pleased to give me of a late Information preferred by this Town unto the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council against us. To the several <hi>Branches</hi> whereof I will make bold to return a brief Answer, that it may the more fully appear unto Your <hi>Grace,</hi> how false in some, and groundless in all Particulars, the Complaint is.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, That <hi>Green's</hi> House belongs to <hi>Lincoln-College,</hi> and that he now enjoys it by the Right of his Wife: But this makes it not to be an Inn, that must be done by <hi>License,</hi> which he must either have from the <hi>Town</hi> (as all other <hi>Inns</hi> as yet have) or else he hath none. For, confident I am that he hath not any from the <hi>Vniversity.</hi> By Virtue of His Majesty's late gracious <hi>Grant</hi> unto us, we License <hi>Ale-House-Keepers</hi> and <hi>Victuallers.</hi> Above which Rank (until better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now by the Town) we conceived <hi>Inn-holders</hi> to be, and therefore meddled not with them. If <hi>Greene</hi> came in the throng at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Lent</hi> to be bound by me from dressing of Flesh (the which I remember not) he came not called. For by my <hi>Warrant</hi> I then Summoned none but <hi>Privileged</hi> Persons, and such only of the Town as by the Power given the University by His Majesty had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by us.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Recognizance</hi> of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Licensed, I confess, I returned not to the <hi>Quarter-Sessions,</hi> and that for this Reason: His Majesty by the fore-mention'd Letter was pleased to grant us the same Authority over <hi>Ale-Houses</hi> and <hi>Victuallers,</hi> which the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> hath. No <hi>Recognizances</hi> are returned there: (whereof I am certain, for I sent thither purposely in <hi>November</hi> last to enquire.) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none by us. The University there keeps them in its own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and so do we. The <hi>Town-Clerk</hi> (who Pen'd the Letter) does, I grant, by this means lose some petty Fees, which (the Poor Men now save in their Purses) he formerly had, whilest the power of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54616:95"/>
                        <hi>Licensing</hi> was in them. But this is a very weak Plea in a Business of such Consequence. Nor indeed are those Fees now considerable, we having already reduced those <hi>Ale-Houses</hi> to Five Score, which before were Three Hundred. A great number: And yet not to be marvelled at, when one Man, this <hi>Mayor's</hi> Father-in-Law, <hi>Bosworth</hi> a Brewer and Justice of the Town, was (as I have credibly been informed) in a very short time, the means of Licensing an <hi>Hundred</hi> for his part; upon Conditions (which tied them faster than their <hi>Recognizance</hi> to the King) that they should take all their <hi>Beer</hi> of him; nor did he stand single: Others they have who trod after him in the very same steps; which makes me wonder with what Face they can complain of the <hi>Loss</hi> of a Power which they so grosly abused.</p>
                     <p>And yet more, I marvel at their Complaint against us for invading their <hi>Liberties,</hi> when themselves are so notoriously guilty of daily <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts</hi> upon ours, without any colour at all of Right for their so doing. Witness their Intrusion into the Office of <hi>Clerk of the Market:</hi> Their Enquiries at their <hi>Leets</hi> touching the Cleansing and Paving of the Streets: Their refusing to be regulated by the Vice-Chancellor (as heretofore) touching the Price of their <hi>Candles:</hi> Arresting and Suing of <hi>Privileged</hi> Persons in their City Court: Taking of <hi>Felons</hi> Goods, and interrupting our <hi>Proctors</hi> in their Night Walk. Nor can I amongst these <hi>Grievances</hi> omit their present multiplying of <hi>Cottages,</hi> and <hi>Inmates</hi> in all Parts of the Town, in despight of the <hi>Inhibition</hi> to the contrary sent unto them by Letters from the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council; whereof they have in a friendly manner been put in mind by the University, both at their Publick <hi>Sessions,</hi> and at other times.</p>
                     <p>If the Mayors of <hi>Oxford</hi> have now (as is pretended) only the Title, not the Authority of the Place, they are the more to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for being so ambitious of it: I presume Your <hi>Grace</hi> hath heard of the violent and drunken Competition that was between a <hi>Brewer</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi> at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> was Twelve Month; how many Days, and how much Beer was spent in the <hi>Canvass,</hi> to the no small Scandal of this Place, and disparagement of the Office, which was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by such unworthy Means. In the issue the <hi>Brewer</hi> prevailed, and his Beer wrought so well with the Commoners the whole Year after, that by the strength thereof his Brother (the present <hi>Mayor</hi>) came to succeed him in the Place; That none either then or since have Fined for refusing the <hi>Office,</hi> either of <hi>Mayor</hi> or <hi>Bailiffs,</hi> though in their Letter they seem to pretend the contrary.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mayor</hi> pretending the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the First for his <hi>Night-Watch,</hi> I did not oppose it; though I saw little use of it here, and knew this Place to be exempt by an Act <hi>Eliz.</hi> 13. which confirms all our <hi>Charters</hi> unto us, notwithstanding any Acts of Parliament what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. That <hi>Statute</hi> appoints the <hi>Watch</hi> to stand at the <hi>Gates;</hi> where had they kept themselves, the <hi>Proctors</hi> had not questioned them. But when they took the boldness to walk the Streets to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>Scholars</hi> of all Conditions, to enter Houses, and search what
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54616:96"/>
Company there, then they thought it high time to appear, and stand up in defence of their own <hi>Authority,</hi> and the <hi>Privilege</hi> of the University. Your Grace, having been <hi>Proctor</hi> long since, cannot but know that the <hi>Night Watch</hi> hath of old belonged to the University, and was so confirmed unto us, as our Right by the Lords, at an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them 'twixt the University and Town, 1612. <hi>Jacobi De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimo.</hi> Nor since then have the <hi>Townsmen</hi> disturb'd it at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, when our unwillingness to trouble either Your <hi>Grace</hi> or the <hi>Lords</hi> of the Council with petty Complaints in these busie Times, hath so heartned them, that nothing will now satisfie them, unless they may trample our <hi>Charters</hi> under their Feet, and give Laws to them by whom they live. For the particular Passage 'twixt one of the <hi>Proctors</hi> and the <hi>Constable</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Parish I am a Stranger, and therefore have sent Your Grace the sum of it under the <hi>Proctor's</hi> own Hand.</p>
                     <p>A second Reason (omitted before through hast) for my not bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Quarter Sessions the <hi>Recognizances</hi> which I have taken of Victuallers and Ale-Houses, is this; because His Majesty hath by our Charter given to the University all the <hi>Fines, Amercements</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> that accrue from them. Since I began to write, <hi>Greene</hi> hath been asked, and he makes Answer, That he keeps his Inn by virtue of a <hi>Licence</hi> from the <hi>Town;</hi> but an ancient one it is.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> For an Outrage committed by his Watch upon one <hi>Wallis</hi> in his own <hi>Lodging;</hi> he himself being at the same time at the Door.</p>
                     <p>

                              <pb n="207" facs="tcp:54616:97"/>
After mature Debate it was ordered, That the University of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> according to his Majesty's Gracious Letter, shall have the sole Licensing of <hi>Victualling-Houses</hi> in that <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Suburbs,</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> hath in the Town of <hi>Cambridge:</hi> And for that purpose it is ordered by His Majesty, with advice of the Board, That the Commission for the Peace in <hi>Oxford</hi> shall be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Vice-Chancellor only made of the <hi>Quorum.</hi> Secondly, for the Complaint of the Building of Cottages, it is ordered, That the Vice-Chancellor and the Mayor shall make several Certificates of all the new Cottages built within Twenty Years, and shall distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish which of them have been built by <hi>Privileged</hi> Persons upon Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege Lands, and which by Townsmen, and which by <hi>Privileged</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon the <hi>Town Wast</hi> by their leave: Upon return of which Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates their Lordships will give such farther Order therein as shall be fit.

Upon Certificate whereof their Lordships will take such Order as shall be fit for the due Observance of the same. Fourthly, it was ordered, That according to the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Winchester,</hi> those to whom it belongeth ought to set <hi>Watches</hi> at the <hi>Gates</hi> of the City, according to the said Statute; and that the said <hi>Watch</hi> continue there, without walking of the Streets, or moving from their Station, except it be for the suppressing of any sudden <hi>Tumult,</hi> or other <hi>Malefactors,</hi> whereof there is not time to give notice to the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> and the <hi>Proctors</hi> of the said Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.

                     <p>DR. <hi>Frewen</hi> hath now born the troublesom Office of the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellorship <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> chosen my Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.</note> of that University for the space of two whole Years, which is the time now usually given to execute that Office: And is certainly weight enough for any Man to bear so long. In the discharge of this Office he hath through the whole course of his time carried himself with great Care, Moderation and Prudence; and that as well in all Businesses which relate to the Town, as in those which look more immediately upon the University. And among other great Services perform'd by him, I cannot forbear to single out one, and here publickly to give him Thanks for it, even above the rest: And that is the great Pains he hath taken, and the singular Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which he hath used in bringing the <hi>Statutes</hi> concerning the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations into Use and Settlement. Which <hi>Statute,</hi> I dare be bold to say, being continued and kept up in the same Vigour to which it is now raised by his Care and Providence, will be of such singular use
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54616:98"/>
as that, for my part, I cannot easily tell whether it will be greater Honour or Benefit to that University; but sure I am, it will be the one by the other, if it be kept up to the Life, as I hope it shall be.</p>
                     <p>Dr. <hi>Frewen's</hi> time being thus happily spent both for his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the University's Good, the Care now lies upon me to name another, to take up that Burthen which he lays down, and to go in those steps which he hath trod out before him. And I thank God for it, there is such Choice of able Men in that Place for this Service, that I cannot be to seek whom to name unto it. But I have for the present thought upon Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> Dean of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and Provost of <hi>Queen's-College,</hi> as a Man whom I know to be of great Integrity and Sufficiency for that Place, and of whose Care and Industry there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am very confident. To him, together with the Office, I do more especially recommend the Care of the Examinations in point of Learning, and a most strict Watchfulness and Observance against all haunting of <hi>Taverns</hi> or any other Meetings, private or publick, which may any way help to suppress the base Sin of Drunkenness, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or the Nurse of almost all other Distempers, which may bring Obloquy upon that Place. These are therefore to let you know, that I do hereby nominate and chuse Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> to be my Vice-Chancellor for this Year ensuing: And do hereby pray and require you to allow of this my Choice, and to give him all due Respect and Assistance in all things necessary for that Government, and more especially in the two Particulars above-named; that so Sobriety and good Manners as well as Learning may flourish in that Place. And thus not doubting of your readiness and willing Obedience herein, I leave both him and you to the Grace of God, and rest</p>

The <hi>Collusion,</hi> which he feared might be, was by plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before-hand between the <hi>Examinants</hi> and the <hi>Candidates,</hi> which by which should be examined, and consequently each <hi>Candidate</hi> might easily know upon what <hi>Questions</hi> he should be examined, and provide accordingly.

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE SPEECH OF The Right HONOURABLE WILLIAM Lord Viscount <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Seal,</hi> &amp;c. SPOKEN IN PARLIAMENT, Upon the BILL about BISHOPS POWER in CIVIL AFFAIRS, AND COURTS of JUDICATURE, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641.

            <head>Arch-Bishop <hi>LAVD's</hi> ANSWER TO THE Lord <hi>SAY's</hi> SPEECH Against the BISHOPS.</head>
            <p>THIS Speech is said to have done the <hi>Bishops,</hi> their <hi>Calling,</hi> and their present Cause a great deal of harm, among the <hi>Gentry,</hi> and divers sober-minded Men: and therefore I did much wonder that so many learned Bishops, present in the House to hear it, should not, (some of them) being free and among their Books, so soon as it was printed, give it Answer, and stop the venom which it spits from poysoning, so many at least, as it's said to have done; especially <hi>that Bishop</hi> who stands named in the Margin, and against whom in particular the Speech was in part directed, should (as I conceive) to vindicate himself, as well as the Cause, have taken this task upon him. But since I see all Men si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and the Speech go away in triumph, as if it were unanswerable truth, though the <hi>Bill</hi> be now past, and the <hi>Bishops</hi> with their Votes cast out of the House, and from all <hi>Civil</hi> Employment, yet I thought it fit, if not necessary, to call this Speech to an account in every pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and with all due respect approve what is just, and give the rest such an Answer as it deserves. And though you may think this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer comes too late, as indeed it doth to remedy the present Evil, yet I have thought fit to go on with these my Endeavours, that if these miserable distracted times have an end (which I have no hope to live to see) the Errours of this Speech may appear, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops perhaps recover their ancient Rights. If not (as I confess 'tis very hard in <hi>England</hi>) that yet the World may see how unjustly they suffer'd, and with what misguided Zeal this <hi>Lord</hi> hath fallen upon the Church, as indeed he hath done in all kinds. And I pray God something fall not therefore upon Him and His. The Speech then begins thus:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54616:105"/>
My Lords,</p>
            <q>
               <p>I shall not need to begin as high as <hi>Adam</hi> in answer to what hath been drawn down from thence by a <note n="*" place="margin">The Bishop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Bishop</hi> concerning this Question, for that which is pertinent to it, will only be what concerns Bishops, as they are <hi>Ministers of the Gospel:</hi> What was before, being of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, can give no Rule to this.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Whether this Reverend Bishop, now <hi>Lord Arch-Bishop of York,</hi> did begin his Speech as high as <hi>Adam,</hi> I cannot tell, nor what proof he made after such beginning; for I was committed long before this Speech was made: but if he did bring it down from <hi>Adam,</hi> I think there may be good Reason for it. For it will appear, for the two thousand years before the Law, and for two thousand years more under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that the Priests, especially the High and Chief Priests, did meddle in all the great Temporal Affairs, which fell out in their times.</p>
            <p>And first for the time before the Law, 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, and receiv'd by all Men, that the <note n="†" place="margin">Sacerdotium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </note> 
               <hi>Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> the First-born was Priest, and the First-born in the Prime and Leading Families, were as the <hi>Chief-Priests</hi> in their several Generations: and 'tis more than absurd to think that all these Prime Men in their several Families first, and Tribes after, being Priests, should be estranged from all their <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Temporal</hi> Affairs, and leave them in the hands of Younger and Weaker Men. And as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law there is no express Text for this their forbearance to help to manage Civil Affairs, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there any sufficient Reason be given why they should abstain. Neither did they. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Priest, and a great one, for he was a <hi>Patriarch, Heb.</hi> 7. 4. And his Priesthood appears in that he was the first Minister of the Sacrament of <hi>Circumcision. Gen.</hi> 17. 23. and yet he managed his Family, and trained up his Servants in that which is most opposite to the Priestly Function, even for War. Nay took them, and went in Person against five Kings, and redeemed his Kinsman <hi>Lot</hi> by the Sword, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 14, 16. And <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> who is expresly called the Priest of the high God, was <hi>King of Salem</hi> also: a <note place="margin">Gen. 14. 18. Heb. 7. 1.</note> King and a Priest too, so both capable by one Person. And as he received Tythes as a Priest, so no doubt can be made but he ordered and governed Civil Affairs as a King. Before these <hi>Noah</hi> was a Priest, and offered Sacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 20. and yet all the great care and trouble of building the <hi>Ark,</hi> and managing the preservation of the whole World, was committed to him by God himself, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took by him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Under the Law the Case comes under fuller and clearer Proof. And in the first entrance <hi>Moses</hi> himself was <hi>Saccrdos Sacerdotum,</hi> the Man that consecrated <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 40. 13. and after reckon'd with <hi>

               <note place="margin">Levit. 8. 1.</note> among the Priests of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 99.6. and yet the whole Princely Jurisdiction resided in him all his days. But God commanded him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54616:105"/>
to settle the Priesthood upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> to teach the World that few Men's Abilities were fit for the Heighth of both those Places, since <hi>Moses</hi> himself was order'd to ordain <hi>Aaron,</hi> and divide the Burthen. After this division the High Priest did meddle in <hi>Civil Affairs,</hi> even the greatest, as well as <hi>Moses</hi> continued his Care of the Synagogue. In the numbering of the People for War, a thing of sole <hi>Imperial</hi> Cognisance, if any, <hi>Aaron</hi> was joined in Commission with <hi>Moses</hi> by God himself, to number them by their Armies; and they did it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. 3. 17. 44. In the ordering of the Standards and Ensigns of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in their removes from place to place, God's own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand came alike to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 2. 1, 2. the Silver Trumpets to call the Assemblies of the People together did belong to <hi>Moses,</hi> the People had nothing to do with them; nor might they tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously assemble, but orderly, as the Sound of the Trumpets directed them; but the Priests, <hi>the Sons of Aaron</hi> were to sound them, <hi>Num.</hi> 10. 8, 9,11. And this Duty lay upon them as well when they went to War, as when they sacrificed. In the Survey of the Land of Promise <hi>Aaron</hi> was interessed as well as <hi>Moses:</hi> And this appears plainly, First, in that when the <hi>Spies</hi> (all save <hi>Joshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi>) had brought up an evil Report upon the Land, the People fall into a Murmuring, and were as mad against <hi>Aaron</hi> as against <hi>Moses, Numb.</hi> 14. 2, 5. Secondly, because when the Land of Promise came to be divided among the Tribes, no Spiritual business was it, and yet in the Commission which <hi>Moses</hi> gave for the solemn Division of the Land, both to <hi>Reuben, Gad,</hi> and the half Tribe of <hi>Manasses</hi> on the one side of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and on the other side to the other Tribes, and to all the Princes of the several Tribes of <hi>Israel, Eleazar</hi> the Priest was first and principal, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32. 2, 28. &amp; 34.17. even before <hi>Joshua</hi> himself: and that not only here during <hi>Moses</hi> his life, but even after, at the actual Division of the Land to every Tribe, though <hi>Joshua</hi> was then the Leader of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Josh.</hi> 19. 51. In the great Murmuring of the People at <hi>Kadesh,</hi> for want of Water, which was like enough to break out into an Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the Commission which God himself gave out to gather the Assembly together, and to satisfie the People with Water out of the Rock (a harder thing for <hi>Moses</hi> to do when he looks upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than for God when he looks upon the Rock) went jointly to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 20. and they performed it accordingly.</p>
            <p>Thus far it went, and in all these great Particulars in <hi>Aaron's</hi> Life time; as if God would give a pattern in the first High Priest under the Law, what his Successours in some Cases might, and in some must do in great and Civil Affairs. And not so only, but to instruct the Successours of <hi>Moses</hi> also what value they should put upon <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Successours, if they will follow the way which God himself prescribed, and which hath been taken up and followed in all well govern'd Kingdoms, as well <hi>Christian</hi> as <hi>Heathen,</hi> till this very time that this ignorant boisterous <hi>Faction</hi> hath laboured to bear sway, as a <note n="*" place="margin">They would have Clergy-Men not admitted, or very sparingly to Matters of State, contrary to the practice of all well govern'd Common-wealths and of our own till these late Years. <hi>Geo. Cranmer,</hi> Epist. to Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi> p. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note> learned <hi>Country-Man</hi> of ours hath observed. And therefore though God set the pattern in <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet he continued it farther, to shew (as I conceive) that his Will was it should continue. For no sooner was <hi>Aaron</hi> dead, but his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54616:106"/>
Son <hi>Eleazar</hi> succeeded in all those great Civil employments, as well as in the Priesthood. For when the People of <hi>Israel</hi> were come into the plain of <hi>Moab</hi> near <hi>Jerico,</hi> and were ready to enter into the Land of Promise, God himself joyned <hi>Eleazar</hi> with <hi>Moses</hi> for the numbring of all the People that were found fit for War, which they were to expect at their entrance into <hi>Canaan, Numb.</hi> 26. 1, 3. In the difficult point of Inheritance for the Daughters of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> when they came and demanded right of <hi>Moses,</hi> their demand was made to him and <hi>Eleazar,</hi> and the Princes of the Congregation, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 2. which they would not have done had not <hi>Eleazar</hi> had a Vote in that Judicature with <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Princes.</hi> And no less than God himself commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to declare <hi>Joshua</hi> to be his Successour in the presence of the Congregation, <hi>Josh.</hi> 17. 4. And orders farther that <hi>Joshua</hi> shall stand before <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Priest, and that <hi>Eleazar</hi> shall ask <hi>Counsel for him after the Judgment of Vrim before the Lord.</hi> Numb. 27. 18, 19, 23. Now I would fain know of <hi>this Lord,</hi> whether <hi>Eleazar</hi> might give <hi>Joshua</hi> the Counsel which he asked of God for him. If he might not, why did God appoint him to ask it for <hi>Joshua?</hi> If he might, then he might give Counsel in <hi>Temporal</hi> Affairs, for so runs the Text about the War to be had with the <hi>Canaanites. At Eleazar's word they should go out, and at his word they should come in, both Joshua and all the Children of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phineas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eleazar,</hi> but Priest too, though not High Priest till after his Father's Death, was employed by <hi>Moses</hi> in the War against the <hi>Midianites, Numb.</hi> 31. 6. and the Trumpets put into his Hands. After the Victory over them, the Captains and the Spoil were brought to <hi>Moses, Eleazar,</hi> and the chief Fathers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to divide them, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 26. and an express Law ordained, that if there be a <hi>matter too hard for them in Judgment,</hi> (I pray mark it, 'tis <hi>between blood and blood, between plea and plea, between stroke and stroke;</hi> these are no <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Matters, I trow,) that they should go unto <hi>the Priests, the Levites, and to the Judges that shall be in those days, Deut.</hi> 17. 8, 9. and he that will not <hi>hearken unto the Priest and Judge shall die,</hi> v. 12. Was the Priest here excluded from all <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> affairs? Nay, was he excluded from any, when his Judgment was required <hi>between Blood and Blood?</hi> Nay, the <hi>Geneva</hi> Note adds here, <note n="*" place="margin">Annot. in Deut. 17. 9.</note>

               </note> Dr. <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> tells us very learnedly, that this Law was made to establish the highest Court of Judgment among that People, in which all harder Causes both <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> should be determined without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Appeal. When the People made War and came nigh unto the Battle, the Priest was to approach and speak unto them; and when he had done, the Officers were to speak to them likewise; which must needs imply that the Priests which were present were not strangers to some at least of the Counsels of the War, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 2, 5. and the whole Law, the <hi>Judicial</hi> as well as the rest, was delivered by <hi>Moses,</hi> after he had written it, unto the Priests the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> and unto all the <hi>Elders of Israel,</hi> Deut. 31. 9. so was the Priest trusted with the Custody and in the discussing of the Law, and (as is before
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54616:106"/>
mentioned.) <hi>Eleazar</hi> had his Hand in distributing the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the several Tribes, as well as <hi>Joshua,</hi> and the other Elders of <hi>Israel, Josh.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
            <p>Nay though this were not ordinary and usual; yet <hi>Eli</hi> was so far trusted with and employed in <hi>Temporal</hi> Affairs, as that being High Priest, he was also <hi>Judge over Israel</hi> fourty Years, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 18. and after him <hi>Samuel</hi> a Levite Judged <hi>Israel,</hi> and no Man better. Yea, and after the Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> also, for well near five Hundred Years, the Priesthood had the greatest Stroke in the Government; as under the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and they did all that belonged unto them very worthily, and it pleased God to make that Family very victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. After <hi>Samuel,</hi> when that People had Kings to Govern them, in that great and most unnatural Conspiracy of <hi>Absalom</hi> against his Father <hi>David,</hi> in that great distress, <hi>Hushai</hi> was ordered by <hi>David</hi> to return and mix himself with the Counsels of <hi>Absalom,</hi> and to impart all things to <hi>Zadoc</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priests, that by them and their Sons, <hi>David</hi> might come to know what was useful or necessary for him to do, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 27. 32. 35. and <hi>Hushai's</hi> making no scruple nor reply to this, makes it clear that <hi>Zadoc</hi> and <hi>Abiathar</hi> were formerly trusted with <hi>David's</hi> Counsels, and that <hi>Hushai</hi> had observ'd them to be prudent and secret. And when <hi>David</hi> was old, he called a kind of <hi>Parliament</hi> for the settling his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Kingdom. To that great Assembly he gathered together all the Princes of <hi>Israel,</hi> with the Priests and the Levites, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 1, 2. so far was he from turning their <hi>Votes out of the House</hi> of that great Consultation, that Six Thousand of them were by the Wisdom of that Senate made Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Judges throughout the Kingdom, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and this was done on both sides of <hi>Jordan</hi> in all businesses of the Lord, and in the Service of the King, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 30, 32. In the beginning of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Reign, <hi>Abiathar</hi> the High Priest was in all the great Counsels of that State, but falling into the Treason of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> he was deprived by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Zadock</hi> made High Priest in his Room, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 27, 35. And when <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> repaired the decays of that State, he set the Priests and the Levites in their right places again, according to that Law in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 8, 9. and restored to them that Power in Judicature which was by God's appointment settled in them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 8. And that he had relation to that Law is manifest, because he pitches almost upon the same words, <hi>v.</hi> 10. as <note n="*" place="margin">Conf. with <hi>Hart,</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>203.</hi>
               </note> Dr. <hi>Raynolds</hi> hath observed before me. And <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the High Priest was the preserver of <hi>Joash,</hi> the right Heir of the Crown, against the Usurpations of <hi>Athaliah;</hi> and when he had settled him in his Kingdom, though not without Force of Arms, and they also ordered by <hi>Jehoiada,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 8. he was inward in his Counsels, and was ruled by him in his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 2. and he died with this Testimony, that this young King <hi>did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, all the days wherein Jehoiada</hi> instructed him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12. But after his Death you may read what befel <hi>Joash,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. In all the Conduct of this People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which many Temporal Businesses did occur, <hi>Aaron</hi> was joyned with <hi>Moses</hi> in and through all. <hi>Thou leadest thy People like sheep</hi> (saith the Prophet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.) <hi>by</hi> or <hi>in the Hand of Moses and Aaron.</hi> The Prophet <hi>David</hi> was a great Shepherd himself,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54616:107"/>
and knew very well what belonged to <hi>leading the People;</hi> and you see he is so far from separating <hi>Aaron</hi> from <hi>Moses</hi> in the great work of leading the People, that though they be two Persons, and have two distinct Powers, yet in regard the one is subordinate and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the other, they are reputed to have but <hi>one Hand</hi> in this great Work. And therefore in the <hi>Original,</hi> and in all the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which render it, 'tis said <hi>in Manu,</hi> not <hi>in Manibus,</hi> in the Hand, not in the Hands, of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> So necessary did God in his Wisdom think it, that <hi>Aaron</hi> should be near about <hi>Moses</hi> in the Government of his People. And as the Priests and Levites were great Men in the great <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so were two of them ever in all the lesser <hi>Sanhedrims</hi> in the several Cities of every Tribe, for so <note n="†" place="margin">Oppidatim praesint septem viri probatae virtutis &amp; justitiae cultores: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Josephus</hi> witnesses expresly, that two of them were ever allotted to each Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy. <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> Sin it was, and a great one, to make the lowest of the People Priests, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 13. and I pray God it be not the Sin of this Age to make the Priests the lowest of the People.</p>
            <p>So by this I think it appears, that nothing of like Antiquity can well be more clear, than that four thousand years before and under the Law, the <hi>Priests,</hi> especially the chief Priests did meddle in, and help manage the greatest <hi>Temporal</hi> Affairs. And this, as this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Person cannot but know, so I presume he was willing warily to avoid. For he tells you he shall not need to begin so high. Not need? And why so? Why, it is because (saith he) the Question is only what concerns Bishops as they are <hi>Ministers of the Gospel,</hi> and that which was before being of another Nature can give no Rule to this. No Man doubts but this Question in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> belongs only to Bishops as they are Ministers of the Gospel, nay more particularly than so, as they are Ministers of the Gospel in the Church of <hi>England</hi> only. For either this must be said, or else granted it must be by this Honourable <hi>Lord,</hi> that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> takes upon them to limit Episcopacy through all the <hi>Christian</hi> World, and to teach all States therein, what they are to do with their Bishops. And this were as bold a part for the <hi>English Parliament</hi> to do, as it is for a private <hi>English-man</hi> to censure the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And truly, for my own part, I cannot tell how to excuse the Parliament in this. For though in the <hi>Act</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. 1641/2.</note> now past there be nothing enacted but that which concerns Bishops, and such as are in Holy Orders here, because their Power stretches no farther than this Kingdom, yet their Aim and their Judgment is general. And this appears by the Preface of that Act, which runs thus. <hi>Whereas Bishops, and other Persons in Holy Orders, ought not to be intangled with Secular Jurisdiction,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ought not:</hi> Therefore in their Judgment 'tis <hi>Malum per se,</hi> a thing in it felf unlawful for any Man in Holy Orders to meddle in, or help manage Temporal Affairs. For though their words be, <hi>Ought not to be intangled</hi> (which as that word <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled</hi> bears sense in English, and stands for an absolute hindring of them from the works of their own Calling, I grant as well as they) yet the Act proceeds generally to divest them of all Power and Jurisdiction in <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs, whether they be <hi>intangled</hi> with them or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:54616:107"/>
But be it so, that this Question belongs to Bishops only as they are Ministers of the Gospel, yet why may not the Ancient Usage before the Law, and the Law of God Himself give a Rule to this? For sure, if they can give no Rule in this, then can they give no Rule to any thing else under the Gospel, that is not simply <hi>Moral</hi> in it self, as well as none to Prelates, and their assisting in Temporal Affairs. Which Opinion how many things it will disjoynt both in Church and State is not hard to see. First then, I shall endeavour to make it appear, that the practice of pious Men before the Law, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Law, can give a Rule to many things under the Gospel; and then I will examine how, and how far those things may be said to be of another Nature, which is the Reason given why they can give no Rule in this.</p>
            <p>For the First, <hi>that they can give a Rule,</hi> I hope it will appear very plainly. For in things that are <hi>Typical,</hi> the Type must praefigure the Antitype, and give a kind of Rule to make the <hi>Antitype</hi> known: Therefore in <hi>Typical</hi> things no Question is or can be made, but that the things which were under the Law can give a Rule to us <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Though this bold Proposition runs universally, without except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things <hi>Typical</hi> or any other. Besides, the Priests had a hand in all Temporal Affairs, and in matters which were no way <hi>Typical,</hi> but meerly belonging to Order and Government, as appears by the Proofs before made. And therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> may be Precedents for <hi>Christians,</hi> which could not possibly be if they could give us no Rule. Nor is this any new Doctrine. For that ancient Commentary under the Name of St <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Ambrose</hi> tells us expresly, that that which is mentioned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 30. is a Custom of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> which he would have us to follow. And as this Doctrine is not new, so neither is it refused by later Writers, and some of them as Learned almost as this <hi>Lord.</hi> For that which was ordered, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 30. that they should <hi>stand every Morning and Evening to thank and praise the Lord,</hi> is precedent enough to presume that the like is not against the Law of God. And <note n="†" place="margin">Calv. <hi>in</hi> Act. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Calvin</hi> speaks it out expresly. In regard (saith he) that God himself instituted that they should offer Sacrifice Morning and Evening, <hi>inde colligitur,</hi> it is thence collected plainly, that the <hi>Church</hi> cannot want a certain Discipline. So here the <hi>Jews</hi> Discipline gives an express Rule to us. And it is very learnedly and truly observed by a late <hi>Writer</hi>

That there is no such Light to the true meaning of Scripture, as the Practice of matters contained in it under the Synagogue, and in the Church afterwards.

Besides, for ought I know of this <hi>Lord's</hi> Religion, he may brand all the <hi>Old Testament</hi> as deeply as the <hi>Manichees</hi> did of old, or go very near it, if it can give no Rule, and so be of no use to Christians. <note n="†" place="margin">

And this they might justly challenge to themselves, and make it a Rule.</p>
            <p>But 'tis time to proceed to other Particulars. In the Case of <hi>Tythes</hi> we find that they were due <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> by Divine Right, to the Priests under the Law, and some were paid before the Law, no Man doubts; but many will not grant that there is any <hi>Divine Right,</hi> commanding or ordering them to be paid to the Priests under the Gospel. Yet this is undeniable that Tythes have been paid to the Ministers under the Gospel, in all or most parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> for many Hundreds of Years together; and God be thanked the Payment continues yet in some Places. What was it then, if not <hi>Divine Right,</hi> that gave the Rule to Christians for this kind of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Practice before the Law and the Precept under it? Shall we say here, as this <hi>Lord</hi> doth, That what was before can give no Rule to this. Now God forbid. The whole Christian World thought otherwise.</p>
            <p>And whatsoever becomes of the Controversie about Tythes, yet this is certain, that the Ministers of the Gospel ought to have a liberal and free Maintenance. Men, whom they serve in and for Christ, must not open their Mouths too often to preach, and muzzle them whom they should feed. And the Rule for this is given by the Law, for it is written in the Law of Moses. <hi>Thou shall not muzzle the Mouth of the Ox that treads out the Corn. Doth God take care for Oxen, or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes no doubt this is written,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 9. And yet how many of these <hi>Oxen</hi> are poorly shuted, and in a manner muzzel'd, is evident enough. How comes this to pass? How? Why surely, the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> was utterly deceived here, ask my <hi>Lord</hi> else; for he proves this point of their Maintenance, because 'tis so written in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> whereas that Law which was before can give no Rule to this.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>The Lord himself hath ordained</hi> (so saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> v. 14.) <hi>that they which preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel.</hi> Not starve by the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but live upon it; live plentifully and decently. But by what Rule did the Lord himself proceed in this? If his Will had been his Rule, no Rule so strait, it could not but have been just. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us there, <hi>v.</hi> 13. that God himself proceeded by another Rule, <hi>Do ye not know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that they which minister about Holy things, live of the things of the Temple, and they which wait on the Altar are partakers with the Altar? <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, — even so hath the Lord ordained.</hi> Just so: That as the Priests and Levites under the Law, did wait on the Altar and live by it, so must they who preach the Gospel, by the Gospel. Just so: Why then, how did the Priest under the Law live? 'Tis set down at large, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 1. <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 9. and a very full Portion they had, so full as that they might have no Inheritance amongst their Brethren, the <hi>Lord's Portion</hi> which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54616:108"/>
was made theirs was so great, yet <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>so</hi> the Lord ordained for the Ministers of the Gospel. Press this a little farther and 'twill come to the quick. The Priests and Levites under the Law, besides their partaking with the Altar, had the Tythes of all duly paid them. Will not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> reach to this too? If so, then 'tis clear in the Text, that the <hi>Lord himself</hi> ordained payment of Tythes to the Ministers of the Gospel. For the ordained that the Ministers of the Gospel, should live of the Gospel, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>just as</hi> the Priests under the Law did of the Altar. I will not be peremtory in this sense of the Text, yet I would have it well considered. And howsoever, that a free and plentiful Certain Maintenance is the Ordinance of the Lord himself, is by this Text as clear as the Sun. Now this <hi>Lord</hi> should do well to tell St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that either he mistook the <hi>Lord's Ordinance,</hi> or if he did not, that then the <hi>Lord himself</hi> was mistaken in so ordaining for the Ministers of the Gospel, because what was before can give no Rule to this.</p>
            <p>Farther yet, you may see the Vanity, the Nothing of this bold As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion in other particulars beside the Case of Tything. For if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the State of Man before the Law, nor the Law it self can give any Rule in things of this kind, to us that live under the Gospel, then there is nothing in God's Law that can give a Rule to us, but that a Man may remove his <hi>Neighbour's Land-mark,</hi> he may lead the <hi>Blind out of the way,</hi> he may <hi>smite his Neighbour</hi> so it be secretly, he may <hi>marry</hi> in many Degrees of Consanguinity, and what may he not? For all these and many things more are prohibited only in the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. But that going before can give no Rule to these. Now the Apostle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6, 11. <hi>That those things were our Examples, and written for our admonition.</hi> And he speaks of things before and under the Law. And more generally, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning.</hi> Now, learn well and certainly we cannot, but by Rule; and therefore most manifest it is, that those things which were before, can give us Rules, whatsoever is here said to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Two things there are which work much with me, why this <hi>Lord</hi> should say that the things which were before and under the Law can give no Rule in this: And if not in this, then not in things like to this. The one is the <hi>Power</hi> which Kings have in their several Dominions over the external Government and Polity of the Church. The <hi>Apostle's</hi> Rule goes in the general only, <hi>Let every Soul be subject.</hi> Rom. 13. 1. But the Rule drawn down to particulars is from the the commended Practice of the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> under the Law. Now if these can give us no Rule, then we have none at all brought down to particulars, wherein that Power consists. And here this <hi>Lord</hi> being a known <hi>Separatist</hi> from the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as appears most manifestly by another Speech of his <hi>Lordship's</hi> in Parliament, and printed with this) separates, I doubt, from her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine too, and will not, (could he speak out with safety) allow Kings any Power at all in Church Affairs, more than to be the Executioners to see the Orders of their Assemblyes executed, in such things as they need the Civil Sword. And therefore he doth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54616:109"/>
wisely in his generation, to say, That the things which were before can give no Rule in this.</p>
            <p>The other is, that there is of late a Name of Scorn fastned upon the Brethren of the Separation, and they are commonly called <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,</hi> from their Fashion of cutting close and rounding of their Hair: A Fashion used in <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Paganism</hi> in the times of their Mournings, and sad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, as these seem to do, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in outward shew at least a sowr Look and a more severe Carriage than other Men. This Fashion of <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Head, God himself forbids his People to practise, the more to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the Superstitions of the Gentiles. <hi>Ye shall not round the Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of your Heads,</hi> Lev. 19. 27. This express Text of Scripture troubled the <hi>Brownists</hi> and the rest extreamly; and therefore this <hi>Lord</hi> being a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of theirs, if not one himself, hath thought upon this way to ease their minds, and his own. For 'tis no matter for this Text, nor for their resembling <hi>Heathen</hi> Idolaters; they may <hi>round</hi> their Heads safely, since those things which were before can give no Rule in this. And I do not doubt but that if this World go on, the <hi>dear Sisters</hi> of these <hi>Rattle-heads</hi> will no longer keep silence in their Churches, or <hi>Conventicles,</hi> since the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle surely is deceived, where he saith that <hi>Women are not permitted to speak in the Churches, because they are to be under Obedience, as also saith the Law,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. For the Law and those things which were before can give no Rule in this; and therefore they shall not need to go as high as <hi>Adam</hi> to answer this. They shall not need in this, nor we in that of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> go so high as <hi>Adam.</hi> But yet we may if we will, for so high the <hi>Apostle</hi> goes in this place.</p>
            <p>And I thank this <hi>Lord</hi> for that Liberty (if he means so well) that though we need not go so high, yet we may if we list. And this is most certain, that any State <hi>Christian</hi> may receive all or as much of the <hi>Judicial</hi> Law of <hi>Moses</hi> as they please, and find fit for them; and as much of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> as detracts not from Christ come in the Flesh. And since all Law is a Rule, this could not be done if those Laws being before could be no Rule to us.</p>
            <p>This is proof enough (as I conceive) that these things which were before, can give a Rule to us now under the Gospel. My <hi>Lord</hi> thinks not so, for this Reason, Because they are of another Nature.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54616:109"/>
Secondly, therefore the Reason comes to be examined. Wherein I shall weigh two things. First, Whether the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Gospel of <hi>Christ</hi> are things of another Nature, and how far? And Secondly, Whether this be universally true, that among things of another Nature one cannot give a Rule to another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the first, I shall easily acknowledge a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Law and the Gospel. They differ in the Strictness of the <hi>Covenant</hi> made under either: They differ in the <hi>Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Sacramentals</hi> used in either: They differ in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi> of either: They differ in the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of justifying a Sinner; and perhaps in more things than these. And in these things in which they thus differ, and <hi>qua,</hi> as they so differ, the Law can give no Rule to Christians; but whether these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences do make the Law and the Gospel things of quite <hi>another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> (which are the words here used) I cannot but doubt a little. First, because more or less strictness doth not vary the Covenant in <hi>Nature</hi> though it doth in <hi>Grace;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>And so</hi> Arist. <hi>persues it.</hi> Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare &amp; parere, non differunt secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Magis &amp; Minus, quia differunt specie. Arist. <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>Polit. c.</hi> 8.</note> for <hi>Magis &amp; Minus non variant speciem,</hi> More or Less in any thing does not make a specifical Difference, and therefore not in <hi>Nature.</hi> And use of different <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> do not make things to be of another Nature, where <hi>Res Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> the Substance of the Sacrament is one and the same. And so 'tis here. For one and the same <hi>Christ</hi> is the Substance of <hi>Circumcision</hi> and the <hi>Pascal Lamb,</hi> as well as of <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> For our Fathers under the Law, <hi>did all cat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink of the same spiritual drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: And that Rock was Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 3, 4. And much less, can <hi>Extent</hi> or <hi>Continuance</hi> vary Nature: Not <hi>Extent;</hi> for Fire contained in a Chimny and spread miserably over a City, is one and the same in Nature. Not <hi>Continuance;</hi> for then a Father and his Son should not be of the same Nature, if the one live longer than the other. And as for the way and Power of <hi>Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they difference the Law and the Gospel, not so much in their Nature as in their Relation to <hi>Christ,</hi> who alone is our Justification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. and was theirs also who lived under the Law, for both they and we, were and are justified by the same Faith in the same Christ.</p>
            <p>And this seems to me very plain in Scripture. <hi>For to this day</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>the Vail remains upon the Jews in the reading of the Old Testament, which Vail is done away in Christ, but we all with open Face behold as in a glass the Glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 14, 18. So one and the same <hi>Christ</hi> is in the Old Testament as well as in the New. Not so plainly; but there, though under a Vail. Now <hi>a Vail on and a Vail off,</hi> a dimmer and a clearer sight in and by the one than by the other, do in no case make the things of another Nature.</p>
            <p>Again; We find it expresly written <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24. That the <hi>Law was our School-master to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by Faith. Our School-master;</hi> therefore it must needs be able to give Rules unto us, or else it can never teach us. And the Rules it gives, are very good too, or else they can never bring us unto <hi>Christ,</hi> that we may be justified by Faith; which to do, St. <hi>Paul</hi> here tells us is the End
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54616:110"/>
of the Law's Instruction. And this Instruction it could not so fully give, if this School-master were so of another Nature as that it could not give us a Rule in this.</p>
            <p>Besides, the <hi>Type</hi> and the <hi>Antitype,</hi> the <hi>Shadow</hi> and the <hi>Substance,</hi> howsoever they may be of another Nature if you look upon their Entity, yet in their Relative Nature, as Type and Antitype, Shadow and Substance, they are of the same Nature, and have mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence either upon other, and give Rules mutually either to other, and a Proof one of another. For a Man may take the measure of the Body by the Shadow, and of the Shadow by the Body. And so it is between the Law and the Gospel; the Sacrifices in the One, and <hi>Christ</hi> in the other. For <hi>the Law had but the Shadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things themselves, and therefore with those Sacrifices could make nothing perfect,</hi> Heb. 10. 1. But <hi>Christ is the Body</hi> it self, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. And when <hi>he came into the World, he saith, Sacrifice and burnt Offering thou wouldest not have, but a Body hast thou given me,</hi> Heb. 10. 4. How shall this appear? How? Why, by the very Rules given in the Law. For so the Prophet tells us in the Person of Christ. <hi>In the volume of the Book it is written of me,</hi> Psal. 40. 7. Nay, so says <hi>Christ</hi> himself, St. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 46. <hi>Had ye believed Moses ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me.</hi> And to bring all home close to the present business; <hi>Christ,</hi> as God, of another Nature quite from <hi>Melchisedek,</hi> yet in Relation to the Priesthood, as Type and Antitype, not so; for Christ was Man also, and the one gave a kind of Rule to the other. <hi>For Christ was made a Priest after the order of Milchisedek,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: Or as <hi>Mont.</hi> reads in the Margin <hi>Secundum Morem,</hi> according to the Form, Manner or Rule of <hi>Melchisedek's</hi> Priesthood. And as <hi>Melchisedek</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> are Type and Antitype in their Priesthood, <note n="†" place="margin">For those Priests served but to the Example, and to the Shadow, &amp;c. But how hath he obtained a more excellent Ministery. <hi>Heb. 8. 5, 6.</hi>
               </note> so the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Aaron</hi> under the Law, was but a shadow of the Priesthood of Christ under the Gospel. And therefore the Priestood which is now, ought in all Privileges to exceed that under the Law, in as much as the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type and the Body is of more worth than the Type and the Shadow. I say, in all Privileges which are not appropiated by God himself to the Priesthood of the Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, It may be considered too, whether this be universally true; that among things which are of another Nature, one cannot give a Rule to another. For my own part, I doubt there is not Truth in the Rule, but instead of Truth a great deal of danger. And surely, if this be generally true, that that which was before (being of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature) can give no Rule to this; that is, if that which was both before and under the Law concerning Priesthood can give no Rule, none at all, to the Ministery under the Gospel, then can it give no Rule in any thing else: Because the Law is as much of another Nature, in regard of other things, as of this. Nay, this very thing, the Priesthood, makes the Law to be of another Nature more than any thing else. And so the Apostle plainly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>For the Priesthood being changed, made of Necessity a change also of the Law.</hi> But be this change, this other Nature what it will, if the Law can give no Rule at all in this (which again is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54616:110"/>
to the <hi>Apostle</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9, 13.) then can it no give Rule in any thing else pertaining to the Gospel. For the Reason if it be good, holds alike, 'tis of another Nature.</p>
            <p>Nay, yet farther, if this Reason be true, universally true, (as 'tis here given) then it reaches to, and thorough the whole Law. No part of it can give any Rule to Men, or things under the Gopsel. For if no Rule to things, then none to Men, who must do or leave undone; and if so, then the <hi>Moral</hi> Law can give no Rule to Men under the Gospel, more than the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> or the <hi>Judicial</hi> Law. For the whole Law was before the Gospel, and here said, without any distinction, to be of another Nature, and so unable to give a Rule. And for ought I know this zealous <hi>Lord</hi> may be of this Opinion. For this lewd Doctrine hath been somewhat common of late among his Favourites, that <hi>Moral Honesty is an Enemy to the Grace of Christ;</hi> that <hi>Harlots and debauched Persons are nearer to the Kingdom of God, than they which labor to shew themselves Moral Men,</hi> and the like. As if they went to teach the People to live lewdly, and to do evil that good may come thereof, <hi>whose Damnation</hi> the Apostle tells us <hi>is just, Rom.</hi> 3. 8. Whereas <hi>Christ came not to take away the Law, but to fulfill</hi> it for us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17. and in some measure to enable us to keep it also. And in the Gospel, when the Scribe told our Saviour, that to <hi>love God with all the Heart, and his Neighbour as himself,</hi> (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Commandments hang the whole Law, S. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 40.) <hi>was more than all burnt Sacrifices, our Saviour</hi> did not tell him that <hi>Harlots were nearer the Kingdom of God than he,</hi> or that this Law being of another Nature, could give him no Rule for his Life. But quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he told him for his Comfort, and the Comfort of Obedience, that he was not <hi>far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> S. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12. 34. And though this be bad enough, and will prove a fruitful Mother of all <hi>Libertinism</hi> and Prophaness, yet there is a greater danger behind. For if the Grace of <hi>Christ</hi> under the Gospel, be a discharge of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, and disenable it to give a Rule, as being of another Nature, what shall become of <hi>God</hi> the Law-giver himself in all kinds? For he is quite of another Nature, eminently and infinitely exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and whatsoever is, or can be naturally in us; yea or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally either. And what now? Shall not God himself being of another Nature give us any Rule in this or any thing else. I know this <hi>Lord</hi> will say, this is not his meaning. No truly, I hope it is not. But then this <hi>Lord</hi> if he will needs be writing and printing, should so express himself, as that he may not expose his words to such unsavory Consequences as (for ought I know) may justly be gathered from them. And let me tell him in the mean time, 'tis a dangerous thing to be so busie with the Law of God; and so without distinction, as he is, lest he intrench upon the <hi>Law-giver</hi> before he be aware.</p>
            <p>Howsoever, in this Proposition of his, that that which is before being of another Nature, can give no Rule to this, leaves him at a loss which way soever to turn himself. For since 'tis manifest by the Apostle in the places <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 9. 13, 14. Rom. 15.4. 1 Cor. 10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 11.</note> before cited, that the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> which was before, doth give a Rule to divers things under the Gospel; this <hi>Lord of the Separation</hi> is at a loss every way. For if the Law and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54616:111"/>
that which was before be not of another Nature from this, then his Reason is false, which says it can give no Rule because 'tis of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, and so he is at a loss in that. And if it be of another Nature, yet it appears by the <hi>Apostle's</hi> practice, that for all that it can give a Rule in this. For that which can give the <hi>Apostle</hi> a Rule, can give a Rule to us: And so he is at a loss in the whole Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For whether that which was before, be or be not of another Nature, yet it can give a Rule.</p>
            <p>I have been long upon this Passage, because I conceive the main Controversie hangs and turns upon this hinge. And if any Reader think it long or tedious, or be of this <hi>Lord's</hi> Mind, that he need not go so high for Proof, yet let him pardon me, who in this am quite of another Judgment. And for the pardon, I shall gratifie him, by being as brief as possibly I can in all that follows. Thus then this <hi>Lord</hi> proceeds:
<q>
                  <p>The Question which will lye before your <hi>Honours</hi> in passing this Bill, is not, Whether <hi>Episcopacy</hi> (I mean this <hi>Hierarchical</hi> Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy which the World now holds forth to us) shall be taken away <hi>Root and Branch;</hi> but, Whether those exuberant and superfluous Branches, which draw away the Sapp from the Tree, and divert it from the right and proper use, whereby it becomes unfruitful, shall be cut off, as they use to pluck up Suckers from the Root.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After this <hi>Lord</hi> had told us we need not go so high for the business, he comes now to state the present Question. Where he tells us what himself means by Episcopacy. Namely, <hi>Hierarchical Episcopacy,</hi> such as is properly and now commonly so called in the World. And this his <hi>Lordship</hi> adds because of that distinction made by <hi>Beza</hi> in his Tract <hi>de Triplici Episcopatu, Divino scilicet, Humano &amp; Satanico.</hi> In which, what part <hi>Beza</hi> plays I will forbear to speak, but leave him and his <hi>Gall of bitterness</hi> to the Censure of the Learned.

               <hi>Calvin</hi> have taught us, that the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church had in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Province among their Bishops one <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> and that in the Council of

               <hi>Nice</hi> Patriarchs were appointed which should be in order and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty above Bishops, had he thought either such Bishops or Arch-Bishops to have been <hi>Satanical:</hi> And had <hi>Beza</hi> lived in those times, he would have been taught another Lesson. And the Truth is, <hi>Beza,</hi> when he wrote that Tract, had in that Argument either little Learning or no Honesty. But for this <hi>Lord,</hi> whether he means by <hi>Hierarchical Episcopacy,</hi> the same which <hi>Beza,</hi> I will not determine. He uses a Proper word and a Civil, and I will not purpose to force him into a worse meaning than he hath, or make him a worse Enemy to the Church (if worse he may be) than he is already. Though I cannot but doubt he is bathed in the same Tub.</p>
            <p>Having told us what he means by Episcopacy, he states the business thus: That the Question is not whether this <hi>Hierarchical Episcopacy</hi> shall be taken away <hi>Root and Branch.</hi> So then I hope this Lord will leave a <hi>Hierarchy</hi> (such as it shall be) in the Church. We shall not have it all laid level. We shall not have that Curse of <hi>Root and Branch</hi> (<note n="*" place="margin">Job. 18, 16.</note> for less it is not) laid upon us: Or at least not yet. But what shall follow in time, when this Bill hath us'd its edge, I know not. Well, if not <hi>Root and Branch</hi> taken away, what then? What? why, 'tis but whether <hi>those exuberant and superfluous Branches, which draw away the Sapp from the Tree, and divert it from the right and proper use, whereby it becomes unfruitful, shall be cut off, as they use to pluck up Suckers from the Root.</hi> This <hi>Lord</hi> seems to be a good <hi>Husbandman,</hi> but what he will prove in the Orchard or <hi>Garden of the Lord,</hi> I know not: For most true it is, that <hi>Suckers</hi> are to be plucked from the Root; and as true, that in the prime and great <hi>Vine,</hi> there are some Branches which bear no fruit, and our Saviour himself tells us, that they which are such, <hi>are to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> St. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2. And therefore I can easily believe it that in Episcopacy, which is a far lower <hi>Vine,</hi> under and in the Service of <hi>Christ,</hi> and especially in the husbanding of it, there may be some such Branches as this <hi>Lord</hi> speaks of, which draw away Sapp and divert it, and make the Vine less fruitful; and no doubt but such Branches are to be cut off. So far I agree, and God forbid but I should. But then there are divers other Questions to be made and answered before this sharp <hi>Lord</hi> fall to cutting. As first, What Branches they be which are <hi>Exuberant and Superfluous</hi> (as this <hi>Lord</hi> is pleased to call them) What time is fittest to <hi>cut them off?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be not such as with <hi>Pruning</hi> may be made fruitful? If not, then <hi>how near</hi> to the Body they are to be cut off? Whether this <hi>Lord</hi> may not be mistaken in the Branches which he thinks divert the Sapp? Whether a Company of Lay-Men without any Order or Ordinance from <hi>Christ,</hi> without any Example from the days of <hi>Christ,</hi> may, without the Church, take upon them to prune and order this <hi>Vine?</hi> For, whatever this <hi>Lord</hi> thinks in the over abundance of his own Sense, the Lord hath appointed <hi>Husbandmen</hi> to order and prune this Vine, and all the Branches of it, in his Church, without his Usurpation of their Office: And while he uses a <hi>Bill</hi> (which is too boisterous a Weapon for a Vine) instead of a <hi>Pruning-hook,</hi> the Church it self which is the <hi>Vine,</hi> which bears Episcopacy, may bleed to death in this Kingdom, before Men be aware of it. And
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54616:112"/>
I am in great fear, if things go on as they are projected, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is upon taking its leave of this Kingdom. But this <hi>Lord</hi> hath not quite done stating the Question, for he tells us next, That,
<q>
                  <p>The Question will be no more but this, Whether Bishops shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to what they were in their first advancement over the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters (which although it were but a Humane device for the Remedy of Schism, yet were they in those times least offensive) or continue still with the addition of such things as their own Ambition, and the Ignorance and Superstition of succeeding times did add thereunto, and which are now continued for several Political Ends; things Heterogeneal and Inconsistent with their Calling and Function as they are Ministers of the Gospel, and thereupon such as ever have been, and ever will be hurtful to themselves, and make them hurtful to others in the times and places where they are continued.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here my <hi>Lord</hi> states the Question again. He did it before under the Metaphor of a <hi>Tree</hi> and the <hi>Branches.</hi> Here, that Men of narrow Comprehensions may not mistake him, he lays it down in plain Terms, and tells us, the Question is no more but this, <hi>Whether Bishops shall be reduced to what they were in their first advancement over the Presbyters?</hi> And you may be sure they shall be reduc'd if they once fall into the Hands of this Zealous <hi>Lord.</hi> Reduc'd out of doubt every way, if he may have his will, saving to that which they were in the <hi>Original,</hi> which his <hi>Lordship</hi> calls their first advancement over the <hi>Presbyters.</hi> For my own part, if it be thought fit to reduce the <hi>Christian</hi> Church to her first Beginnings, give us the same power, and use us with the same Reverence for our Works sake, as then our Predecessours were used, and reduce us in God's name when you will. But this <hi>Lord's</hi> Zeal burns quite another way. He tells us indeed, that the Question is no more, but whether <hi>Bishops</hi> shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to what they were in their first Advancement over the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; but he means nothing less than their reducement thither: and this is manifest out of his own next Words. For there he says, their first advancement was but a <hi>Humane Device for avoiding of Schism.</hi> But a <hi>Humane Device?</hi> Why first, our Saviour himself chose <hi>twelve Apostles</hi> out of the whole number of his Disciples, and made them Bishops, and advanced over the Presbyters, and all other believing Christians, and gave them the Name of Bishops as well as of Apostles; as appears, since that Name was given even to <hi>Judas</hi> also, as well as to the other Apostles, and to the other Apostles as well as to <hi>Judas,</hi> since <hi>Matthias</hi> was chosen by God himself, both into the Bishoprick and Apostleship of <hi>Judas, Acts</hi> 1. 20, 24, 25. Now that Christ himself did ordain the Apostles over the ordinary Disciples, Presbyters or others, is evident also in the very Text; for he chose them out of his <note place="margin">S. Luke, 6. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Disciples, S. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. And to what end was this chusing out, if after this choise they remained no more than they were before? Nay, he chose them out with a special Ordination to a higher Function; as appears S. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. where 'tis said, <hi>He ordained twelve that they should be with him;</hi> that is, in a higher and nearer Relation than the rest were. Nay more than so, the Word there used by S. <hi>Mark</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:54616:112"/>
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he made them; he made them somewhat which before that making they were not; that is, <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Bishops.</hi> Had they been such before, it could not have been said that he <hi>made them then.</hi> And our last Translation renders it very well, <hi>He Ordained them:</hi> so belike this Making was a new Ordination of them. And this appears farther by the choice of <hi>Matthias</hi> into the Apostleship of <hi>Judas:</hi> For <note n="*" place="margin">Euseb. <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>Hist. c.</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Matthias</hi> was one of the <hi>Seventy</hi> when he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen; and then this choice needed not, if the LXX had been before of equal Place and Calling with the Apostles. For as S. <hi>Jerome</hi> speaks, <note place="margin">

                  </hi> Jer. Taylor, <hi>in his Book entituled</hi> Episcopacy Asserted; §. 10.</note> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are Successors of the Apostles, and Presbyters made in resemblance of the LXX Disciples. And so the Institution of <hi>Christ</hi> himself (for so by this <hi>Lord's</hi> leave I shall ever take Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopacy to be) is made but a <hi>Humane Device to avoid Schism.</hi> But there hath been so much written of late to prove Episcopacy no Humane Device, that I will not trouble the Reader with any more of it here: only we are thus far beholding to this <hi>Lord,</hi> that he thinks Bishops were in those times least offensive; so belike in the Apostles times they were offensive, though less. And this makes me doubt, he thinks as much of the Apostles themselves, since they were so ambitious as to take on them Superiority over their Brethren, which this great <hi>Lord of the Separation,</hi> (for so he is) cannot endure, as being <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and therefore certainly (if he may have his Will) will reduce the Bishops farther yet, till they be of his Marring and not of <hi>Christ's</hi> Making.</p>
            <p>The other part of the Question stated by this <hi>Lord,</hi> is, <hi>Or whether the Bishops shall continue still with the additon of such things as their own Ambition, and the Ignorance and Superstition of succeeding times, did add unto them.</hi> I would <hi>my Lord</hi> had been pleased to tell us what <hi>those things</hi> are, which he says are thus added unto them. I should much the better have seen what his <hi>Lordship</hi> aims at, and been able to come up the closer to him. Now I must be forced to answer him in general. That there are many things of Honour and Profit, which <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>great Kings</hi> have conferred upon Bishops to the better Settlement of their Calling, and the great advancement of <hi>Christianity;</hi> and for which Bishops in all times and places, in which they have lived, have been both thankful and very serviceable. And I could give many instances in this Kingdom of such Services done by them, as <hi>this Lord and all his Posterity</hi> will never equal. But what things their own Ambition or the Ignorance and Superstition of succeeding times have added to them, I may know when this busie <hi>Lord</hi> is at leisure to tell me. In the mean time I doubt the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54616:113"/>
Piety and Devotion of these times is here miscalled <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> while the Knowledge of these times, in too many, is a running headlong into Sacrilege, as the best way to cure Superstition.</p>
            <p>But these things, what ever they be, his <hi>Lordship</hi> tells us, are now continued for <hi>several politick Ends.</hi> Yea, and with his <hi>Lordship's</hi> favour, for several and great Religious Ends too. But if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for Politick Ends only, so the Policyes be good and befitting <hi>Christians,</hi> I know no Reason why they may not be continued. For, as for that which is here given by this <hi>Lord,</hi> 'tis either weak or false. He says these things are <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> to their Function, that's weak. For, 'tis not possible for any Priest, that is not Cloistered, to live so in the World, as to meddle with nothing that is <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> to their Function. And he says farther, that these things are <hi>inconsistent</hi> with their Function; and that's false. For if these things were simply <hi>inconsistent</hi> with Priesthood, God himself would never have made <hi>Ely</hi> both Priest and Judge in <hi>Israel:</hi> Nor should <note n="†" place="margin">Bertram de Polit. Jud. c. 6.</note> Six of each Tribe have been of the Sanhedrim, and so by Consequence Six of the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> and so the High Priest might be always one, and a chief in that great Court, which had Cognizance of all things in that Government: And their Functions, as they are Ministers of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is no more inconsistent with these things than the <hi>Levitical</hi> Preisthood was. For beside their Sacrificing, they were to read and expound the Law, as well as we the Gospel. For so it is expresly set down, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 10. <hi>They</hi> (that is, the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi>) <hi>shall teach Jacob thy Judgments, and Israel thy Laws.</hi> So that medling with Temporal Affairs was as great a Distraction to them from their Calling, as from ours; and as <hi>inconsistent</hi> with it, and so as hurtful to their Consciences and their Credits. And would God put all this upon them, which this <hi>Lord</hi> thinks so unlawful for us, if it were so indeed? But this <hi>Lord</hi> goes yet farther, and tells us, that these things are such as have ever been, and will ever be hurtful to themselves, and make them hurtful to others in the times and places where they are continued. Good God! what <hi>fools</hi> we poor Bishops are, as were also our Predecessours for many hundred years together, that neither they nor we could see and discern, what was and is hurtful to our selves, nor what then did, or yet doth make us hurtful to others, in times and places where they are continued to us? And surely, if my <hi>Lord</hi> means by this our medling in Civil Affairs, when our Prince calls us to it (as I believe he doth) I doubt his <hi>Lordship</hi> is much deceived. For certainly, if herein the Bishops do their Duties, as very many of them in several Kingdoms have plentifully done, they cannot hurt themselves by it; and to others, and the very Publick it self, it hath occasioned much good both in Church and State. But now my <hi>Lord</hi> will not only tell us what these things are, but he will prove it also that they are hurtful to us.</p>
            <q>
               <p>And these things alone (<hi>says my</hi> Lord) this Bill takes away; that is, their Offices and Places in Courts of Judicature, and their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Obligation of Office in Civil Affairs. I shall insist upon this to shew, First, how these things hurt themselves, and Secondly, how they have made and ever will make them hurtful to others.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54616:113"/>
These things then you see which are so hurtful and dangerous to Bishops themselves, and make them as hurtful to others, are their <hi>Offices,</hi> and <hi>Places in Courts of Judicature,</hi> and their <hi>Employment by Obligation of Office in Civil Affairs.</hi> Where, First, for <hi>Offices;</hi> I know no Bishop since the Reformation that hath been troubled with any, but only Dr. <hi>Juxon,</hi> when Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> was <hi>Lord High Treasurer of</hi> England, for about Five Years. And he was made when the King's Affairs were in a great strait; and, to my knowledge, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried so, that if he might have been left to himself, the King might have been preserved from most of those Difficulties, into which he after fell for want of Money. As all Kings shall be hazarded, more or less, in some time or other of their Reign, and much the more if their Purses be empty, and they forced to seek Aid from their Subjects. And this, as 'tis every where true, yet 'tis most true in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Places in Courts of Judicature,</hi> the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> have ever sat all of them in <hi>Parliament,</hi> the highest Court, ever since Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments were in <hi>England.</hi> And whatsoever is now thought of them, they have in their several Generations done great Services there: And, as I conceive, it is not only fit but necessary they should have <hi>Votes</hi> in that great Court; howsoever the late <hi>Act</hi> hath shut them out; and that <hi>Act</hi> must in time be repealed, or it shall undoubtedly be worse for this Kingdom than yet it is. The Bishops sat in no other Courts, but the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> and the <hi>High Commission.</hi> And of these the <hi>High Commission</hi> was most proper for them to sit, and see Sin pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd: For no Causes were handled there but <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and those such as were very heinous, either for the Crime it self, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which committed it, being too great or too wilful to be ruled by the inferiour Jurisdictions. As for the <hi>Star Chamber,</hi> there were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily but <hi>two Bishops</hi> present, and it was fit some should be there: For that Court was a mix'd Court of Law, Equity, Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and was compos'd of Persons accordingly from the very Original of that Court. For there were to be there two Judges to take care of the Laws, and two Bishops to look to the Conscience, and the rest Men of great Offices or Birth, or both, to preserve the Honour, and all of them together to maintain the Equity of the Court. So here were but two Bishops employ'd, and those only twice a Week in Term time. As for the <hi>Council Table</hi> that was never accounted a <hi>Court,</hi> yet as Matters <hi>Civil</hi> were heard and often ended there, so were some <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> too. But the Bishops were little honoured with this Trouble since the <hi>Reformation:</hi> For many times no Bishop was of the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> and usually not above two. Once in King <hi>James's</hi> time I knew Three, and once Four, and that was was the highest, and but for a short time. And certainly the fewer the better, if this Lord can prove (that which he says he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon) that those things are hurtful to themselves, and make them hurtful to others. And to do this he proceeds;
<q>
                  <p>They themselves art hurt thereby in their Conscience and in their Credits. In their Conscience, by seeking and admitting things which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54616:114"/>
are inconsistent with that Function and Office which God hath set them apart unto.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Lordship</hi> begins with this, That the Bishops are hereby hurt both in their <hi>Consciences</hi> and their <hi>Credits.</hi> Two great hurts indeed, if by these things they be wounded in their Consciences towards God, and in their Credits before Men. But I am willing to hope these are not <hi>real</hi> but <hi>imaginary</hi> hurts, and that this <hi>Lord</hi> shall not be able to prove it otherwise: Yet I see he is resolved to labour it as much as he can. And first, he would prove that these things, and not the ambitious seeking of them only, but the very admitting of them, though offer'd, or in a manner laid upon some of them by the Supream Power, are hurtful to their <hi>Consciences,</hi> because they are <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Function to which God hath set them apart. But I have proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that they are not inconsistent with that Function, and so there's an end of this Argument. For Bishops, without neglect of their Calling, may spend those few Hours required of them, in giving their assistance in and to the forenamed Civil Affairs. And 'tis well known that S. <hi>Augustin</hi> did both in great Perfection, so high up in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church, and in that Great and Learned Age: For he <note n="*" place="margin">S. Aug. Ep. 110.</note> complains that he had nor Fore-noon, nor After-noon free, he was so held to it, <hi>Occupationibus Hominum,</hi> by the Businesses which Men brought to him; and he desires that he may ease himself in part upon him that was at his desire designed his Successor; to which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expressed their great liking, by their Acclamation.

And this, besides many Bishops and Clergy-Men of great Note, who have been employ'd in great Embassics, and great Offices under <hi>Emperors</hi> and Kings, and discharged them with great Fidelity and Advantage to the Publick, and without detriment to the Church. And surely they would never have taken this Burthen upon them, had their Conscience been hurt by it, or had it been inconsistent with their Function, or absolutely against the ancient <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church, of which they were so conscientious and strict Observers. My <hi>Lord</hi> goes on to another Argument and tells us;
<q>
                  <p>They are separated unto a special Work, and Men must take heed how they mis-employ things dedicated, and set apart to the Service of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54616:114"/>
God. They are called to Preach the Gospel, and set apart to the Work of the Ministery; and the Apostle saith, <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> Shewing that this requireth the Whole Man: and all is too little. Therefore for them to seek or take other Offices, which shall require and tie them to employ their Time and Studies in the Affairs of this World, will draw a Guilt upon them, as being inconsistent with that which God doth call them, and set them apart unto.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is my <hi>Lord's</hi> next Argument: And truly I like the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it very well, and I pray God this <hi>Lord</hi> may be mindful of it when time may serve. For surely Men ought to take heed how they mis-employ Things dedicated and set apart to the Service of God. And therefore, as Ministers must not mis-employ their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or their Times, which are dedicated to God and his Service; no more must Lay-Men take away and mis-employ the Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues devoutly given, dedicated and set apart to maintain and hold up the Service of God, and to refresh <hi>Christ</hi> in his poor Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers upon Earth. And if ever a Scambling time come for the <hi>Church-Lands</hi> (as these Times hereafter must) I hope his <hi>Lordship</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this Argument of his, and help to hold back the Violence from committing more Sacrilege, whereas too much lies heavy on the Kingdom already.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Argument will abide some Examination. First then, most true it is, that Bishops are called to <hi>Preach the Gospel, and set apart to that Work;</hi> but whether they be so set apart, as that what Necessity soever requires it, they may do nothing else but Study and Preach, is no great Question. For certainly, they may in Times of Persecution labour many ways for their <hi>Perservation,</hi> and in Times of Want for their <hi>Sustenance,</hi> and at all Times (if they be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it) give their best <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> for the publick Safety of the State as well as their own.</p>
            <p>Nor doth that of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> hinder this at all. For though this great Calling and Charge requires the whole Man, though all that the ablest Man can do in it, be too little (all things simply and exactly consider'd) yet he that saith here, <hi>None are sufficient for these things,</hi> (for so much the Question implieth) saith also in the very next Chapter, that God hath made him and others <hi>able Ministers of the New Testament,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. and if able, then doubtless sufficient. And the <hi>Greek</hi> word is the same, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>sufficient</hi> in the one place, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>made us sufficient</hi> in the other: Besides, it may be the sense of the Places will bear it; that no Man is sufficient for the Dignity of the Office, which brings with it the <hi>savour of Life or Death</hi> to all Men, and yet that many Men are made sufficient by God's Grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this Office; that is, to bring both the one and the other. But howsoever, be the Office as high as it is, and be the Men never so sufficient, yet the Function is such as cannot be daily performed by the Priest for the Preaching part, nor attended by the People for their other necessary Employments of Life, which made the Wisdom of God himself command a Sabbath under the Law, and the Church
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54616:115"/>
to settle the <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> and other Holy-days under the Gospel, for the Publick Service and Worship of God, and the Instruction of the People. I say, in regard of this, a Bishop or a Priest who shall be judged fit for that Publick Service, may give Counsel in any Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and take upon him (if not seek) any Office temporal, that may help and assist him in his Calling, and give him Credit and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to do the more good among his People, but not to the deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Spiritual Work. And this <hi>Lord</hi> is much deceived if he thinks all Offices do require and tie them to employ their Time and Studies in the Affairs of this World. If they be such Offices as do, I grant with him, that to take them (unless it be upon some urgent Necessity) may draw a Guilt upon them: But if they be such as <hi>Clergy-Men</hi> may easily execute in their empty Hours, without any great hindrance to their Calling, and perhaps with great Advantage to it, then, out of doubt, it can draw no Guilt upon them which take them. And this <hi>Lord</hi> in this Passage is very cunning: For, instead of speaking of Bishops having any thing to do in Civil Affairs, he speaks of nothing but taking of Offices. Now a <hi>Clergy-Man</hi> may many ways have to do in Temporal Affairs, without taking any set Office upon him, which shall not tie up his Time or his Studies to the Affairs of this World, as it seems this <hi>Lord</hi> would persuade the the World all do.</p>
            <p>Now that a Bishop or other Clergy-Man may lawfully meddle with some Temporal Affairs (always provided that he <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>entangle</hi> not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with them; for that indeed no Man doth that Wars for <hi>Christ</hi> as he ought, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4.) is, I think, very evident, not only by that which the Priests did, and might do under the Law; but also by that which was done after <hi>Christ,</hi> in the <hi>Apostle's</hi> time, and by some of them. To Study and Practise <hi>Physick</hi> is as much inconsistent with the Function of a Minister of the Gospel, as to Sit, Consult, and give Counsel in Civil Affairs: But St. <hi>Luke,</hi> though an Evangelist, continued his Profession, as appears <hi>Colos.</hi> 4. 14. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> says thus, <hi>Luke the beloved Physician greets you;</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have called him a <hi>Physician</hi> had he left off that Calling to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Gospel only. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, when he might have lived on the Gospel by the Lord's own Ordinance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. would never have betaken himself to live by <hi>making of Tents, Acts</hi> 18. only for a Convenience (as I conceive) that he might work the more upon the People while he charged them not, if in so doing he had found it a hindrance to his Preaching the Gospel: And this <hi>Lord</hi> and others, who would not have Ministers meddle with Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, are content, not only to the Disgrace of the Ministery, but even of Religion it self, to hear <hi>Felt-makers,</hi> and <hi>Iron-mongers,</hi> and <hi>Gardiners,</hi> and <hi>Brewers, Clerks,</hi> and <hi>Coachmen</hi> preach God knows what Stuff, and countenance them in this Sacrilegious Presumption. Nay, and are never troubled that these Men have all their time taken up in the Affairs of the World, but rather say their Gifts are the greater, that they are able to do both. Out of doubt they hope that their <hi>Coachmen-Preachers</hi> shall hurry them to Heaven in some <hi>Fiery Chariot;</hi> and I my self in time might be brought to believe it too, did I not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54616:115"/>
see <hi>Phaeton</hi> setting the Christian World on fire, but no <hi>Elias</hi> there. Nor yet will S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Example any whit advantage them: For he was no ignorant Tradesman, but a learned <hi>Pharisee</hi> brought up under <hi>Gamaliel, Acts</hi> 22. And it was the Custom of their Doctors (as it is at this Day in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and many other places in the <hi>East.</hi>) to breed up their Scholars to a Trade as well as to the Knowledge of their Law; both that they might know the better how to spend their empty Hours honestly, and be able to get their Living should Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity overtake them. Now let these bold Men shew under what <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel</hi> they were bred, and how they profited under him; or that they have S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Revelation as well as his Trade, and then I'll say more to them. But this <hi>Lord</hi> is very full in this Theam, and falls upon another Argument.</p>
            <q>
               <p>In this respect (<hi>saith he</hi>) our Saviour hath expresly prohibited it, telling his Apostles that they should not <hi>Lord it over their Brethren,</hi> nor Exercise Jurisdiction over them, as was used in Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among the Heathen. They were called Gracious Lords, and exercised Jurisdiction, as Lords, over others; and sure they might lawfully do so. But to the Ministers of the Gospel our Saviour gives this Rule, It shall not be so done to you; if you strive for Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he shall be Greatest that is the greatest Servant to the rest. Therefore in another place he saith, <hi>He that putteth his hand to the Plough, and looketh back to the things of this World, is not fit for the Kingdom of God;</hi> that is, the Preaching of the Gospel, as it is usually called.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Argument will be somewhat indeed, if it proves such as this <hi>Lord</hi> says it is. For he says that our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath expresly prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited it: and if it be so, there's an end of the Controversie. No Question but it is utterly unlawful if our Saviour prohibited it. But where is it that he hath done so? Where? Why 'tis where he tells his Apostles, that they should not <hi>Lord it over their Brethren.</hi> Not Lord it over their Brethren? that's true: Nor exercise Jurisdiction over them? that's false, if the Proposition be general; for then there can be no Order, no Government among <hi>Church-Men.</hi> And if it be particular, no such Jurisdiction as was used in <hi>Civil</hi> Government among the <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> then 'tis fit to weigh this place through and throughout. Well then! the Mother of <hi>Zebedee's</hi> Children desired of <hi>Christ</hi> for her two Sons, that <hi>the one might sit at his right hand, and the other at his left hand in his Kingdom,</hi> S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 21. Where first it appears plainly, that this was not only a piece of <hi>Feminine</hi> Ambition, for her Sons made the suit as well as she; so S. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 35. tells us; and they came with her when she made it. So St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 20. And little doubt need be made but that they set their Mother on to move it, as may appear partly by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who says nothing to the Mother, but first puts a Question to the Sons, which they answer, and then gives his Answer to them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 22, 23. which (I conceive) he would not have done, had not they been in the Business: And partly, because the other Ten <note n="*" place="margin">Or were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

them, <hi>to sit at his right hand and at his left in his Kingdom in Heaven,</hi> as may be thought not altogether improbable by the Question Christ puts to them about his Baptism and his Cup, both preparatory to that Kingdom. And if it be so (and so some think it is) then this Text is applied by this <hi>Lord</hi> to no purpose, if it meddles nothing with Temporal Offices and Employments, but relates to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. But if they meant by this sitting at his right Hand and at his left, the honourable Places about him in his <hi>Earthly Kingdom,</hi> which the Apostles sometimes fancied he should here have, as some think, because of the other part of <hi>Christ's</hi> Answer, that <hi>the Princes of the Gentiles exercise Dominion over them, but it shall not be so amongst you,</hi> ver. 25, 26. Then the Answer is clear, that <hi>Christ</hi> did not here forbid them the taking of such Places upon them simply, but he forbids either an absolute independent Power; for so <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies, which takes not away Superiority over others, so they be subject to the Prince and State. Or else the using of such Places after the Lordly and Tyrannous Manner of some <hi>Heathens.</hi> And the <hi>Geneva</hi> Divines in their Notes upon the Bible tell us, That the meaning of <hi>Christ's</hi> Answer to them in these words, <hi>to sit at my right hand at my left is not mine to give,</hi> ver. 23. is, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Annot. in St.</hi> Matth. 20. 23.</note> had not given him Charge to bestow Offices of Honour here, but to be an Example of Humility to all. So <hi>Christ</hi> came not then to give such Places; but here's no Prohibition for the <hi>Apostles</hi> to take them at their Hands who would give them for the good of the Church. And howsoever, if this place must be understood of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Honours and Employments, then it follows, that though these two Apostles had not those Seats, some other of them should. For <hi>Christ</hi> says plainly, That the sitting at his right Hand and at his left <hi>shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by his Father.</hi> So then it shall be given to some, and doubtless to some of the <hi>Apostles:</hi> Strangers should not be preferred before them. And 'tis all one to our present Business, which of the Apostles sat there, so some did, or were to do; and rather than yield this, his <hi>Lordship</hi> perhaps were better grant, that this is to be understood of another Kingdom, and that this Text meddles with no Temporal either Offices or Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but that by occasion of this our <hi>Saviour</hi> preaches Humility to them, yet so as still to keep up Authority and Government in the Church, to which he applies it.</p>
            <p>And for that other parallel Place, <hi>be ye not called Rabbi,</hi> S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 8. that cannot prejudice all Juridiction in Men in Holy Orders; as if to meddle with it were forbidden by <hi>Christ,</hi> or, as if it were <hi>Antichristian,</hi> as now 'tis made; since it is plain that <hi>Christ</hi> there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids neither the Title, nor the Preheminence, nor the Authority, but the Vain-glorious Affectation of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. and that's a Sin indeed, no Man doubts. And it may be observed too, if this <hi>Lord</hi> pleases, that this Precept was given to the People too, as well as to the Disciples, <hi>ver,</hi> 1. and then, for ought I know, this Truth will come in as strongly to pull down <hi>Temporal Lords,</hi> as Bishops; and what will his <hi>Lordship</hi> say to that?</p>
            <p>As for that which is added by this <hi>Lord, If ye strive for Greatness, he shall be greatest who is the greatest Servant to the rest:</hi> Though the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54616:116"/>
words differ somewhat from the Text, yet my <hi>Lord</hi> must be content to hear, that there is a twofold Greatness; the one in God's account, and that's Greatness indeed: And so our <hi>Saviour</hi> means it here, that <hi>he is Greatest who is the greatest Servant to the rest,</hi> (if this <hi>Lord</hi> will needs read it so:) The other is in Man's account, when one Man hath Power and Superiority over another; and which was that which the <hi>Apostles</hi> affected. In which case, though our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Precept be, <hi>Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your Servant;</hi> that is, the more serviceable to you and the Church, the greater he is; yet these words (<hi>it shall not be so with you</hi>) do not deny this Authority or Greatness which one may have over another in the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> for the necessary Government thereof, though they neither do nor may Domineer over their Brethren.

No <hi>Parity,</hi> and yet no barbarous <hi>Lording;</hi> but orderly and Christian Governing in the Church. And this must needs be so, or else <hi>Christ</hi> lest his Church in a worse Condition, than this <hi>Lord</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the Civil Governments were among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> which he says might lawfully govern so. For I hope he will not say that even the <hi>Heathen</hi> might tyrannize.</p>
            <p>If this be not sufficient, this <hi>Lord</hi> puts us in mind that our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> says in another place, That <hi>he which lays his hand to the Plough, and looks back to the things of this World, is not sit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> that is, the Preaching of the Gospel, as 'tis usually called, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> Where, first, it may be doubted whether this laying of the <hi>hand to the Plough</hi> belong to the Ministers of the Gospel only, or to others also. For if it belongs to others as well as to them (though perhaps not so much) then no <hi>Christian,</hi> though he be not a Minister, may have to do with Worldly Affairs; and then we shall have a devout wise World quickly. Secondly, it may be doubted too whether this looking back be any kind of meddling at all with worldly Affairs, or such a meddling as shall so entangle the Husbandman that his <hi>Plough</hi> stands still, or so bewitches him, that he forsakes his <hi>Plough,</hi> that is, his Calling altogether. If it be no meddling at all, no Man can live; if it be no meddling, but that which entangles, then any Minister may meddle with Worldly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, so far and so long as he <hi>entangles</hi> not himself with them: And so far as to entangle himself, no <hi>Christian</hi> may meddle, that will <hi>live Godly in Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be not sufficient, this <hi>Lord</hi> will prove it e'er he hath done, for he goes on.</p>
            <q>
               <p>To be thus withdrawn, by entangling themselves with the Affairs of this Life, by the Necessity and Duty of an Office receiv'd from Men, from the Discharge of that Office which God hath called them to, brings a Woe upon them. <hi>Woe unto me</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>if I</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54616:117"/>
Preach not the Gospel. <hi>What doth he mean? If I Preach not once a Quarter, or once a Year in the King's Chapel? No. He himself interprets it,</hi> preach the Word, be instant in season and out of season; rebuke, exhort or instruct with all long-Suffering and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <hi>He that hath an Office must attend on his Office, especially this of the Ministery.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>I see my <hi>Lord</hi> will not mend his Terms, though they marr the Sense, and mislay the Question. For no Man says that which this <hi>Lord</hi> so often repeats; namely, that a Bishop or any other Clergy-Man may entangle himself with the Affairs of this Life (which yet may be with Covetousness and Voluptuous Living, as much or more than with being called to Council in Civil Affairs) by any Office re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Man, from the discharge of that Office, which God hath called them unto. No! God forbid! this would bring a <hi>Woe</hi> upon them indeed. But since no Man says it, this <hi>Lord</hi> fights here with his own Shadow. For all that is said is this, that a Bishop being grown old and full of Experience, if the King, or the State in which he lives, thinks him for his Wisdom, Experience and Fidelity fit to be employed in Civil Councils or Affairs, be it with an Office or without, the Bishop may lawfully undertake this, so he be able to discharge it without deserting the Office which God and his Church have laid upon him. But if he takes it, and be not able to discharge both; or being able, doth loiter and not discharge them; either of these is <hi>Vitium Hominis,</hi> the fault of the Person, but the thing is lawful.</p>
            <p>As for the place of Scripture which his <hi>Lordship</hi> adds, I doubt his <hi>Lordship</hi> understands it not as the <hi>Apostle</hi> means it; for 'tis a Text very much abused by ignorant Zeal. For when he saith, <hi>Woe unto me if I preach not the Gospel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 16. what doth he mean? if he Preach not once <hi>a Quarter?</hi> No sure, that's too seldom. What then? if he Preach not once <hi>a Year</hi> in the <hi>King's Chapel?</hi> No sure, much less. For in those days there was no <hi>King in Corinth,</hi> nor any where else, that was <hi>Christian,</hi> to have a Chapel to Preach in. So this <hi>Lord</hi> might have let this Scorn alone, had it so pleased him. No; nor is it if a Man Prate not three or four times a Week in one of his <hi>Lordship's</hi> Independent Congregations, and then call it Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The <hi>Apostle</hi> knew no such <hi>Schismatical Conventicles.</hi> No sure, None of this. Why but what is this Preaching then, the neglect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of draws this <hi>Woe</hi> after it? This he tells you St. <hi>Paul</hi> interprets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. 'tis <hi>to Preach the Word.</hi> 'Tis indeed, and neither Schism nor Sedition, which are the common Themes of these Times. 'Tis to be <hi>instant in Preaching the Word,</hi> as God gives Ability and Opportunity; 'tis to be instant <hi>in season and out of season;</hi> that is, to take God's Opportunity rather than our own, and not Preach out of season only, as some of this <hi>Lord's</hi> great Favourites use to do; 'tis to <hi>rebuke, exhort and instruct</hi> with Knowledge and Gravity, and not spend Hours in idle and empty Discourses. And all this is to be done <hi>with all long-Suffering and Doctrine;</hi> and let the Clergy but study hard, and provide that their Doctrine be sound and good, and I will pass my word this <hi>Lord</hi> and his Friends shall take order
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54616:117"/>
they shall do it with all the <hi>long Suffering</hi> that may be; and if they do not suffer enough, or not long enough, it shall not be his Fault, so dearly doth he love that they should Preach the Word.</p>
            <p>Nay, I must go farther yet. To <hi>preach the Word</hi> in this manner, is not only to go up into the Pulpit, and thence deliver wholsom and pious Instructions, and necessary and Christian Reproof, though this be, as the commendable, so the ordinary way of publick Preaching, that most at once may hear. For he may be said to Preach the Gospel, that any ways declares <hi>Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and informs the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings and Consciences of Men, for right Belief and true Obedience, be it privately or publickly; be it by word of Mouth or by Writing: and a Man may be seasonably instant this way sometimes, when in the publick way of Preaching he cannot. And if this be not so, how is it said of the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 42. that <hi>in the Temple and in every House, they ceased not to teach and to preach Jesus Christ,</hi> Acts. 20. 20. <hi>I have taught you publickly, and from House to House.</hi> And I believe some Bishops, whom this Lord in this passage is pleased to jeer at, have preached more and to more purpose, than any of his Lordship's <hi>Divinity-darlings.</hi> That which follows is true, that he which hath an Office, <hi>must wait upon his Office, Rom.</hi> 12. 7. and especially this of the Ministery; of which Office there the <hi>Apostle</hi> principally treats. But this again no Man denies. And yet by his <hi>Lordship's</hi> good leave, no Man is bound to starve by waiting upon his Office. He must wait upon it, that's true; but he must provide necessarys too, that he may be able to wait. Next this Lord tells us,
<q>
                  <p>The Practice of the Apostles is answerable to the Direction and Doctrine of our Saviour. There never was, nor will be, Men of so great Abilities and Gifts as they were endued withal, yet they thought it so inconsistent with their Calling, to take Places of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature in Civil Matters, and Secular Affairs and Employments upon them, that they would not admit of the Care and Distraction that a business far more agreable to their Callings than these would cast upon them, and they give the Reason of it in the Sixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> v. <hi>2. It is not Reason that we should leave the Word of God, and serve Tables.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There is no doubt but that the Practice of the <hi>Apostles</hi> was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Direction and Doctrine of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> And as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true it is, that there never were, nor ever will be, Men of so great Abilities and Gifts, in Supernatural and Heavenly things especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they were endued withal. But how will this <hi>Lord</hi> prove, that they thought it a thing absolutely inconsistent with their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to meddle with Temporal or Civil Affairs. No one of them hath in any place of Scripture expressed so much. Against <hi>entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling themselves with the World and the Affairs of it,</hi> I confess they have, but no more. Yet this <hi>Lord</hi> proves it thus: They would not admit of the Care and Distraction, that a business far more agreeable to their Calling than these would cast upon them. His <hi>Lordship</hi> means the <hi>Deacon's</hi> Office: And therefore surely they would not take these. But this Argument by his <hi>Lordship's</hi> leave is inconsequent:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54616:118"/>
For if any Offices or Employments, how agreeable soever to their Calling, bring with them such Care and Distraction as shall in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner quite take them off from Preaching the Gospel, the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not, and their <hi>Successours</hi> may not trouble themselves with them: When as yet the Apostles might, and their Successours may take on them other Employments, though in their Nature less agreeable to their Calling, if they be less distractive from it. Now the <hi>Deacon's</hi> Office (as it was then) brought more trouble upon them for the Poor and the Widows, than any Places of Judicature or Council do upon Clergy-men now. Which may appear by the very Reason they have given, and here remembred, that it was no Reason <hi>they should leave the Word of God and serve Tables.</hi> For there it is not said, that they might not at all meddle with the ordering of those Tables, but that it was not fit they should so meddle with them as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> — leaving the word of God to attend them. And this to do no Man says is lawful now. But his Lordship presses this Argument yet farther.</p>
            <q>
               <p>And again, when they had appointed them to choose Men fit for that business, they institute an Office rather for taking Care of the Poor, than they by it would be distracted from the principal Work of their Calling, and then shew how they ought to apply themselves: But we (say they) will give ourselves continually unto Prayer, and to the Ministery of the Word. Did the Apostles, Men of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifis, think it unreasonable for them to be hinder'd from giving themselves continually to preaching the Word and Prayer, by taking care for the Tables of Poor Widows; and can Bishops now think it reasonable or lawful for them to contend for sitting at Council Tables, to govern States, to turn States-men instead of Churchmen, to sit in the highest Courts of Judicature, and to be employed in making Laws for Civil Polities and Government?</p>
            </q>
            <p>It is true indeed that the <hi>Apostles</hi> appointed the <hi>Disciples</hi> to choose Men fit for that business, and that they did institute the Office of <hi>Deacons</hi> to take care of the Poor, rather than they would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from the principal Work of their Calling. But when was this done? When? Why not till the Disciples were multiplied; not till there arose Contentions between <hi>the Greeks and the Hebrews, that that their Widows were neglected in the daily Ministration,</hi> Acts 6. 1. Therefore till the Work grew so heavy, and the Contentions so warm, the Apostles themselves did order those Tables, and attend them too. Therefore the Work was not unlawful in its self for them, for then it had been Sin in them to do it at all at any time. For that which is simply evil in, and of it self, is ever so; therefore the most that can be made of this Example is, that it was lawful, very lawful and and charitable too, for the <hi>Apostles</hi> to take care of those Tables them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and they did it. For all the Provision for the Poor was brought and <hi>laid at the Apostles feet,</hi> Acts 4. 35. which doubtless would never have been done, had it been unlawful for the <hi>Apostles</hi> to order and to distribute it. But when they found the encreasing Burthen too heavy for both the one Work and the other, then,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54616:118"/>
though both were lawful, yet it was more expedient to leave the <hi>Tables</hi> than the <hi>Word of God,</hi> with which the World was then as little acquainted, as now 'tis full of; (and I pray God it be not full to a dangerous Surfeit.) Now this, as I conceive in Humility, states the Bishops Business: For to me it seems out of Question, that it is most lawful for Bishops to be conversant in all the Courts, Councils, and Places of Judicature, to which they have been called since the Reformation in the Church and State of <hi>England,</hi> till they find themselves, or be found unable to discharge the one Duty and the other. And then indeed I grant no serving of Tables, no nor Council Tables is to be preferred. But then you must not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure Preaching only by a formal going up into the Pulpit: For a Bishop (and such Occasions are often offer'd) may Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel more publickly, and to far greater Edisication in a Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, or at a Council Table, where great Men are met together to draw things to an Issue, than many Preachers in their several Charges can; and therefore to far more Advancement of the Gospel, than any one of his <hi>Lordship's</hi> Sect at a <hi>Tables end</hi> in his <hi>Lordship's</hi> Parlour, or in a Pulpit in his <hi>Independent</hi> Congregation, wheresoever it be. And when he hath said all that he can, or any Man else, this shall be found true, that there is not the like Necessity of Preaching the Gospel lying upon every Man in Holy Orders, now <hi>Christianity</hi> is spread and hath taken Root, as lay upon the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> Men, when <hi>Christ</hi> and his Religion were Strangers to the whole World. And yet I speak not this to cast a Damp or Chilness upon any Man's Zeal or Diligence in that Work: No, <hi>God forbid!</hi> For, though I conceive there is not the same Necessity, yet a great Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity there is still, and ever will be, to hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Besides, <hi>Deacons</hi> were not Lay Men, but Men in <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> though inferiour to the <hi>Apostles;</hi> as appears by <hi>Stephen's</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking <note place="margin">Acts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Therefore, if to meddle with these things were simply unlawful in themselves, or for Men in <hi>Holy Orders:</hi> Or, if all meddling with them were such a Distraction, as must needs make them leave the Preaching of the Gospel, then these <hi>Seventy</hi> might not discharge the Office to which they were chosen; and if this be so, then this <hi>Lord</hi> must needs infer that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> and all which chose them, did sin in Instituting such Men to take care of the Tables, and to distract them from Preaching of the Word; which they thought unfit for themselves to do. And yet, I hope, my <hi>Lord</hi> will not say this in his privatest <hi>Conventicle.</hi> Nay, yet more; though this Care was delivered over to the <hi>Deacons</hi> in ordinary, yet <hi>Calvin</hi> tells us plainly, that in things of moment they <note place="margin">Calvin <hi>in</hi> Acts 21.</note> could do nothing — <hi>Nec quicquam</hi> — without the Authority of the Presbyters. So they meddled still.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54616:119"/>
Next this <hi>Lord</hi> shews, since the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not think fit to distract themselves with Business about these Tables, how they ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themselves. And this he sets down in the Apostle's Words, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 4. <hi>But we will give our selves continually to Prayer, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Word.</hi> And yet I hope this <hi>Lord</hi> doth not think the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> by this word <hi>continually,</hi> meant to do nothing else but Pray and Preach: For if they did one of these two <hi>continually</hi> without any intermission, then they could do nothing else, which is most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently false. And indeed (which it seems this learned <hi>Lord</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered not) this word <hi>continually</hi> is not in the Text. For in the <hi>Greek</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we will be constant and instant in Prayer and Ministration of the Word; which may and ought to be done, though neither of them <hi>continually;</hi> and which many of God's Servants have done, and yet meddled some way or other with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or worldly Affairs.</p>
            <p>The Argument is over: The rest of this Passage is this <hi>Lord's</hi> Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, which I shall answer as I repeat it. <hi>Did the Apostles</hi> (saith his <hi>Lordship</hi>) <hi>Men of extraordinary Gifts, think it unreasonable for them to be hindred from giving themselves continually to Preaching the Word and Prayer, by taking care of the Tables of the poor Widows?</hi> No; sure they they did not think it <hi>unreasonable;</hi> that is this <hi>Lord's</hi> word to make the present business of the Bishops more Odious, as if it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst common Reason. But there's no such word in the Text. The word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>it is not meet.</hi> Now many things may not be <hi>meet</hi> or <hi>comely,</hi> which yet are not altogether <hi>unreasonable:</hi> Nay, which at some times, and upon some occasions, may be <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>comely</hi> enough; nay, perhaps necessary for the very Gospel it self, and therefore no way unreasonable; howsoever at this time unfit for the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and worthily refused by them.</p>
            <p>Well; the Rhetorick goes on. Did the <hi>Apostles</hi> thus, <hi>and can the Bishops now think it reasonable or lawful for them?</hi> Yes, the Times and Circumstances being varied, and many things become fit which in some former Times were not, they can think it both reasonable and lawful, nay, necessary for some of them. What? To contend for sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at Council Tables? No; <hi>God forbid,</hi> perhaps not to sue for sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there, but certainly not to contend for it; but to sit there being called unto it, and to give their best Advice there, never unlawful, and oft-times necessary: And here let me tell this <hi>Lord</hi> by the way, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> which he hath sufficiently hated, was so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for this, that though he had that Honour given him by His Majesty to sit there many Years, yet I do here take it upon my <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> that he did never move His Majesty directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that Honour, and was surprized with it as altogether unlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, when His Majesty's Resolution therein was made known unto him. Nor ever did that <hi>Bishop</hi> take so much upon him, as a <hi>Justice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> or meddle with any Lay-Employment, save what the Laws and Customs of this Realm laid upon him in the <hi>High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> and the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> while those Courts were in being; and continued Preaching till he was Threescore and four, and then was taken off by Writing of his Book against <hi>Fisher</hi> the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> being then not able at those Years to continue both. And soon after the World
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54616:119"/>
knows <hi>what trouble</hi> befel him, and in time they will know <hi>why</hi> too, I hope. Besides, the Care of Government, which is another part of a Bishop's Office, and a necessary one too, lay heavy upon him, in these Factious and broken Times especially. And whatsoever this <hi>Lord</hi> thinks of it, certainly, though Preaching may be more necessary for the first planting of a Church, yet Government is more noble and necessary too, where a Church is planted; as being that which must keep Preaching and all things else in order. And Preaching (as 'tis now used) hath as much need to be kept in order as any, even the greatest Extravagance that I know. Nor is this out of Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <hi>Pasce Oves, John</hi> 21. 15. for the feeding of his Sheep. For a Shepherd must guide, govern, and defend his Sheep in the Pasture, as well as drive them to it. And he must see that their <hi>Pasture</hi> be not tainted too, or else they will not thrive upon it. And then he may be answerable for the <hi>Rot</hi> that falls among them.</p>
            <p>The Rhetorick goes farther yet. <hi>To contend for sitting at Council Tables to govern States.</hi> No, but yet to assist them being called by them. <hi>To have States-Men instead of Church-Men.</hi> No, but doing the Duty of Church-Men, to mingle pious Counsels with States-Mens Wisdom. <hi>To sit in the highest Courts of Judicature:</hi> And why not, in a Kingdom where the Laws and Customs require it? <hi>Not to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making Laws for Civil Polities and Government.</hi> And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is great Reason for this in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and greater since the <hi>Reformation</hi> than before. Great Reason, because the Bishops of <hi>England</hi> have been accounted, and truly been, grave and experienced Men, and far fitter to have <hi>Votes</hi> in Parliaments for the making of Laws, than many young Youths which are in either House: And because it is most fit in the making of Laws for a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that some <hi>Divines</hi> should have Vote and Interest to see (as much as in them lies) that no Law pass, which may perhaps, though unseen to others, intrench upon Religion it self, or the Church. And I make no doubt but that these and the like Considerations settled it so in <hi>England,</hi> where Bishops have had their Votes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in making Laws, ever since there were Parliaments; yea, or any thing that resembled them in this Kingdom. And for my part, were I able to give no Reason at all why Bishops should have Votes in Parliament, yet I should in all Humility think that there was and is still some great Reason for it, since the Wisdom of the <hi>State</hi> hath successively in so many Ages thought it fit. And as there is great Reason they should have Votes in making Laws, so is there greater Reason for it since the <hi>Reformation</hi> than before. For before that time Clergy-Men were governed by the Church <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> and the <hi>Common Laws</hi> of <hi>England</hi> had but little Power over them. Then in the Year 1532. the Clergy submitted; and an Act of Parliament was made upon it: So that ever since the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> from the Highest to the Lowest, are as much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Temporal Laws as any other Men, and therefore ought to have as free a Vote and Consent to the Laws which bind them, as other Subjects have. Yet so it is, that all Clergy-Men are and have long since been excluded from being <hi>Members of the House of Commons,</hi> and now the Bishops and their Votes, by this <hi>last Act,</hi> are cast out of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54616:120"/>
the <hi>Lord's House.</hi> By which it is at this Day come to pass, that by the Justice of <hi>England,</hi> as now it stands, no Clergy-Man hath a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, by himself or his Proxy, to those Laws to which all of them are bound.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, before I pass from this Point, this <hi>Lord</hi> must give me leave to put him in mind of that which was openly spoken in both Houses; that the Reason why there was such a Clamour against the Bishops Votes was, <hi>because all or most of them Voted for the King,</hi> so that the potent Faction could not carry what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, especially in the <hi>Vpper House.</hi> And when some saw they could not have their Will to cast out their Votes fairly, the <hi>Rabble</hi> must come down again, and Clamour against their Votes; not without danger to some of their Persons. And come they did in Multitudes. But who procured their coming I know not, unless it were this <hi>Lord</hi> and his Followers. And notwithstanding this is as clear as the Sun, and was openly spoken in the House, that this was the true Cause only why they were so angry with the Bishops Votes; yet this most Godly and Religious <hi>Lord</hi> pretends here a far better Cause than this; namely, that they may, as they ought, carefully attend to the Preaching of the Word, and not be distracted from that great Work, by being troubled with these Worldly Affairs. And I make no doubt, but that the same Zeal will carry the same Men to the devout taking away the Bishops and the Church Lands, and perhaps the Parsons Tythes too, and put them to such Stipends as they shall think fit, that so they may Preach the Gospel freely, and not be drawn away with these Worldly Affairs from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Work of that Function, Well! my <hi>Lord</hi> must give me leave here to Prophesie a little: and 'tis but this in short, Either the Bishops shall in few Years recover of this Hoarseness, and have their Honour and their Votes in Parliament again; or, before many Years be past, all Baseness, Barbarity and Confusion will go near to possess both this Church and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Lord</hi> hath yet somewhat more to say; namely, that
<q>
                  <p>If they shall be thought fit to sit in such Places, and will undertake such Employments, they must not be there as ignorant Men, but must be knowing in Business of State; and understand the Rules and Laws of Government, and thereby both their Time and Studies must be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily diverted from that which God hath called them unto. And this surely is much more Vnlawful for them to admit of, than that which the Apostles rejected as a distraction unreasonable for them to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Why but yet if they shall be thought fit to sit in such Places, and will undertake such Employments, what then? Why then they must not sit there as <hi>ignorant Men,</hi> but they must be knowing Men, and <hi>understand the Rules and Laws of Government.</hi> This is most true; and if any Man sit in those places as an Ignorant, 'tis an ill Choice that is made of him, and he doth not well that accepts them. But sure, if Bishops sit there as Ignorants, they are much to be blamed. For if they spend their younger Studies before they meddle with Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54616:120"/>
as they may and ought, sure there is some great Defect in them, if they be not as knowing Men in the Rules of Government as most Noblemen or others are, who spend all their younger time in Hawking and Hunting, and <hi>somewhat else:</hi> And this younger time of theirs, if Bishops have spent as they ought, they may with a little Care and Observation, and without any great Diversion of their Time and Studies from that which God hath called them unto, perform those Places with great Knowledge and much Happiness to the States in which they serve, as hath formerly in this, and doth at present in other Neighbouring States appear. And for ought this <hi>Lord</hi> knows, if some Counsels had been followed, which some Bishops gave, neither the King, nor the State, nor the Church, had been in that ill Condition in which they now are. Nor are these Places more Unlawful for Bishops to admit of in these Times and Conditions of the Church, than that which the Apostles rejected as a Distraction, but not as an unreasonable one, in those Times and Beginnings of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as is proved before. But the Zeal of this <hi>Lord</hi> burns still, and as it hath fired him already out of the Church, and made him a <hi>Separatist;</hi> so it would now sire the Bishops out of the State, and make them Members of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> His <hi>Lordship</hi> goes on therefore, and as before he told us the Practice of the <hi>Apostles</hi> was answerable to the Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> so here he tells us again;
<q>
                  <p>The Doctrine of the Apostles is agreeable to their Practice herein. For St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he instructs <hi>Timothy</hi> for the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, presseth this Argument from the Example of a good Soldier: <hi>No Man that warreth entangleth himself with the Affairs of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine of the <hi>Apostles</hi> is agreeable indeed to their Practice herein, and in all things else; and I would to God with all my Heart this <hi>Lord's</hi> Opinions were agreeable to either their Practice or their Doctrine; and then, I am sure, he would be a better Soldier for <hi>Christ,</hi> than this poor Church hath cause to believe he is. But his <hi>Lordship</hi> says that <hi>Paul</hi> when he instructs <hi>Timothy</hi> for the Work of the Ministery, presseth this Argument from the Example of a good <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 4.</note> Soldier; That <hi>no Man that warreth, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, entangles himself with the Affairs of the World.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies <hi>involvere &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscere se,</hi> to involve and, as it were, throughly to mingle himself with that which he undertakes; to be so busied, <hi>ut extricare se non possit,</hi> that he cannot untwist himself out of the Employment: And I easily grant that no good Christian, much less any good Bishop, may so entangle himself with the World, as either to Desert his Calling, or to be so distracted from it, as not to do his Duty in it, <note place="margin">Annot. ibid.</note> But this bars not all meddling with it. For the <hi>Geneva</hi> Note upon that place says plainly, he may not extangle himself; no, not so much as with his Houshold and other ordinary Affairs. But then if he shall not meddle with, or take care of these at all, he may beg or starve, unless he have better Means than the Competency which this Devout Age thinks sufficient for the Ministery. Nay, which is more, he may by so doing fall under that heavy Sentence of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54616:121"/>
               <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 8. <hi>That if he provide not for his own, he hath denied the Faith, and is worse than are Insidels.</hi> Nay, which is yet more, if all meddling with Temporal Affairs, all Care of the World be an <hi>Entanglement,</hi> the Clergy must needs be in a Perplexity whatsoever they do. For if they meddle with any Worldly Business, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themselves, they do that they ought not, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. And if they do not meddle with Worldly Affairs, and so do not provide for their own; and provide they cannot without some meddling. Then, for sear of this <hi>Lord's</hi> sowr Divinity, that all meddling with is <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling</hi> in them, they are <hi>worse than Infidels.</hi> Now a Perplexity which shall wrap a Man up in Sin which way soever he sets himself to Action, is so contrary to <hi>Divine Justice,</hi> as that no Law or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God can command it, nor any right Reason of Man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>
            <p>But examining this Text farther I find two things more observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The one, that the <hi>Soldier</hi> here, whose Example is the ground of this Argument, is not bound under Pain of any Sin, not to busie himself with the Affairs of this Life; but he doth it not (saith the Text) to the end <hi>he may please him whose Soldier he is.</hi> So then, if any Man, the better to please God, forbears this Employment, and his Conscience and Love to his Calling be his Motives so to do, he does well. But if another Man, who hath no scruple in himself, and finds he can do both without an <hi>Entanglement</hi> by the one to the prejudice of the other, and thereupon be so employ'd (for ought I know) he doth not sin. The other is, perhaps this <hi>Lord</hi> may find that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here in this place instructs <hi>Timothy,</hi> not so much for the Work of the Ministery (as here he affirms) as for the general Work of Christianity. For, <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. he exhorts to Constancy and Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that he <hi>be strong in the Grace which is in Jesus Christ.</hi> And then this Argument falls upon other Christians as well as upon Ministers, though not so much. And then I hope this <hi>Lord,</hi> who is so careful for <hi>our</hi> Spiritual Warfare, will take some care of his own also; if the great care which he takes at this present for the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Kingdom entangles him not. But his <hi>Lordship</hi> is now come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Point.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I conclude; That which by the Commandment of our Saviour, by the Practice and Doctrine of the Apostles, and I may add by the Canons of ancient Councils grounded thereupon, is prohibited to Ministers of the Gospel, and shewed to be such a distraction unto them from their Calling and Function, as will bring a Woe upon them, and is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for them to admit of; if they shall notwithstanding entangle themselves withal, and enter into, it will bring a Guilt upon their Souls, and hurt them in respect of their Consciences.</p>
            </q>
            <p>His <hi>Lordship</hi> is now come (so he tells us) to conclude this Point; and in this Conclusion he artificially sums up, and briefly, all his Arguments. I shall as briefly touch at my Answers before given, and stay upon nothing, unless I find somewhat new. This done, I shall wait upon him (for that's his desire Clergy-Men should) to the next Point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:54616:121"/>
And truly, I find nothing new in the folding up this Conclusion, but that he says, he may add that Ministers are prohibited from meddling with Wordly Affairs, by the <hi>Canons</hi> of Antient <hi>Councils</hi> grounded upon the Apostles Doctrine. The Church is much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this <hi>Lord</hi> that he will vouchsafe to name her Antient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils: He doth not use to commit this Fault often, and yet lest he should sin too much in this kind, he doth but tell you that he may add these, but he adds them not. It may be he doubts, that if he should name those Canons, some sufficient Answer might be given them, and yet the Truth remain firm, that it is not only lawful, but fit and expedient in some times and cases, for Bishops to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with, and give Counsel in Temporal Affairs; and though this <hi>Lord</hi> names none, yet I will produce and examine such <hi>Canons</hi> and Antient <hi>Councils</hi> as I find, and see what they say in this business.</p>

            <p>In the mean time when all these, or any other Councils are duly weighed, and their meaning right taken, this will be the result of all; that neither Bishop nor other Clergy-Man might or may, by the Canons of Holy Church, ambitiously seek, or voluntarily of himself assume any Secular Engagement. And as they might not ambitiously seek great Temporal Employments, so might they not undertake any low or base ones for sordid and covetous ends.

And so might the Bishop (who had no Superiour in his Province) if the Prince required his Service; or that he thought it necessary for the present State of the Church in which he liv'd: <note n="†" place="margin">Balsamon. in Concil. Chalcedon. c. 3. p. 327.</note> For if he might transmit his Power to those of the inferiour Clergy, no doubt but he might deal himself in such Civil Affairs, as are agreeable to the dignity of his Place and Calling: and generally the Bishop, or any other Clergy-Man, may and might by the ancient Canons of the Church be employed in any Action of Piety, though that Action be attended with Secular care and trouble. And this is without any strain at all collected out of that great and famous Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> one of the four first <hi>General Councils,</hi> approved of highly throughout all Christendom, and with great reverence acknowledged in the Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And therefore after the <hi>Canon</hi> of that Council had laid it down in general terms, that neither <hi>Bishop, Clerk,</hi> nor <hi>Monk,</hi> should farm Grounds, or <hi>immescere se,</hi> mix himself as it were with such Temporal Affairs, it adds some exceptions of like Nature to those by me expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, especially the last of them. And some of these will expound
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54616:122"/>
the Canon of any Council which I have yet seen, that speaks most against Clergy-Mens embarking themselves in Secular Business. And therefore though this <hi>Lord</hi> would not, yet I have laid before you whatsoever is come to my Knowledge out of the <hi>Antient Councils;</hi> where by this last cited and great Council, his <hi>Lordship</hi> may see, that Bishops should meddle with and order some Temporal Affairs, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in that kind fitter to be trusted than other Men of what Rank or Condition soever; and therefore excepts from its own general Canon the Cases of <hi>Orphans</hi> and <hi>Widows,</hi> and the Estates of such Persons as most need Ecclesiastical help, or where any Cause in the fear of God requires it. In which Cases the <hi>Widows</hi> and the <hi>Fatherless</hi> have had much cause to bless God, when they have been referred to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, Trust and Care of Bishops. But this were in a manner to make them <hi>Masters of the Wards</hi> or <hi>Guardians</hi> to them, which I know this <hi>Lord</hi> will not like by any means. It would come too near his Office; and then he would cry out indeed, that this was a greater Distraction of them from their Function to which God had called them, than that of the attending poor <hi>Widows Tables</hi> was to the <hi>Apostles:</hi> And yet he sees what some <hi>Canons</hi> of Antient Councils have decreed in this Case. Besides, we cannot have a better or a clearer Evidence of the true meaning of the Antient Canons than from the Practice of the Antient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church, who were strict and consciencious Observers of the Canons, and yet (as is before proved) meddled in many, and some the greatest Givil Affairs, being employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Ambassadors</hi> from great Emperors and Kings: And <note n="*" place="margin">Balsam. in Conc. Carthag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prima, Can. 16. p. 328, 329.</note> 
               <hi>Balsamon</hi> observes, that whensoever it shall please the Prince to call any Bishops to such Employments, they neither are to be restrained by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Canons, nor censured by them.</p>
            <p>I conclude this Point then, that Bishops are not prohibited to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with Civil publick Affairs, either by <hi>Christ's</hi> command, or by the <hi>Apostle's</hi> either Doctrine or Practice (though all their Practice doth not give an absolute Rule for all future Obedience as their Doctrine doth) and I may add not by <hi>Canons</hi> of Antient Councils (rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood) nor are all of them such Distractions as will bring a <hi>Woe</hi> upon Bishops or other Clergy-Men, though they meddle with them: I rather believe some things will be in a woful Case if they meddle not. And in some Cases there's all the Reason in the World they should be not only permitted, but some of them commanded to meddle; to the end that in all Consultations, especially the greatest, in Parliament, and at <hi>Council Table,</hi> it might be their care to see that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were kept upright in all; and that nothing by Practice or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise pass, <hi>cum detrimento Religionis &amp; Ecclesiae,</hi> with detriment to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or the Church, always provided that they do not so entangle themselves in any of these Affairs, as shall much prejudice their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and this done, I know no Guilt that this meddling can bring upon their Souls, or hurt their Consciences. But this <hi>Lord</hi> having (as he thinks) concluded the contrary, proceeds now to the next Point, and says, that
<q>
                  <p>In the next place this meddling in Temporal Affairs doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54616:123"/>
which they desire to possess the World withal, that unless they may have those outward Trappings, or worldly Pomp added to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, that Calling will grow into Contempt and be despised.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good God!</hi> How Pious this <hi>Lord</hi> is, and what a careful Friend over the Church! First, he takes care the Bishops Consciences may not be hurt, and now he is as jealous over their Credits. But I doubt he is jealous over them amiss: For he is of Opinion, that meddling in Civil Affairs strikes them in their Credit; and he thinks farther, that the Position with which they would possess the World in this case is far from Truth. Let's examine this Position then, what it is, and what it works. The Position is, (as this <hi>Lord</hi> reports it) That <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they may have these outward Trappings, or worldly Pomp added to the Ministery, their Calling will grow into Contempt.</hi> First, there was never any Age in any Kingdom <hi>Christian,</hi> in which the Bishops were ridden with so much Scorn and Contempt as they are at this day in <hi>England;</hi> and this makes this <hi>Lord,</hi> though he be a very ordinary Horseman for any good Service, please himself with <hi>Trappings.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for the <hi>worldly Pomp</hi> which he means and expresses, the Train of that hath been long since cut short enough in <hi>England;</hi> and he that will not look upon the Bishops with an evil Eye must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it. Well, but what then doth this Position work? Why they may not have these <hi>Trappings,</hi> there will follow <hi>Contempt upon their Calling;</hi> so he makes the Bishops say. Is this <hi>Lord</hi> of that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion too? No sure; for he says,
<q>
                  <p>The Truth is, these things cast Contempt upon them in the Eyes of Men. They gain them Cap and Courtesie, but they have cast them out of the Consciences of Men; and the Reason is this, every thing is esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it is eminent in its own proper Excellency; the Eye in seeing, not in hearing; the Ear in hearing, not in speaking. The one would be rather monstrous than comely, the other is ever acceptable, being proper. So is it with them: their proper Excellency is Spiritual, the denial of the World, with the Pomps, and Preferments, and Employments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This they should teach and practice.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, the question is, Whether the Honour of Bishops and their Employments in Temporal Affairs, as they are at this day mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, in the Church and State of <hi>England,</hi> bring Contempt upon them and their Calling, as this <hi>Lord</hi> says; or help to keep off Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as he says the Bishops would possess the World. First, I am clear of Opinion that <hi>Solomon</hi> was almost as wife as this <hi>Lord</hi> thinks himself, and yet he says plainly, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 16. That though Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in its self be far better than Folly, yet <hi>the poor Man's Wisdom is despised, and his Words not heard.</hi> And we see in daily Experience, that a poor Minister's Words are as much slighted in the Pulpit, as a poor Man's in the Gate. And therefore these things which this <hi>Lord</hi> calls <hi>Trappings,</hi> are many times very necessary to keep off that <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Despight</hi> which the boisterous Multitude, when their Sins are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, are apt to cast upon them. And whatsoever this <hi>Lord</hi> thinks, tis a great Credit and Support to the rest of the Clergy, and being
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54616:123"/>
well used, a great advantage to their Calling, that the Bishops and other Eminent Men of the Clergy should have moderate Plenty for Means, and enjoy Honour and external Reputation; and though it be well known that the Church consider'd in <hi>Abstract,</hi> in and by its self only, is not promoted nor advanced by such Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet, as she is considered in her <hi>Peregrination</hi> and <hi>Warfare,</hi> she gains by them great both Strength and Encouragement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That which this <hi>Lord</hi> adds, that those things gain the Bishops <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Courtesie,</hi> but have cast them out of the Consciences of Men. 'Tis well that these things gain them that. For the Age is grown so churlish to that Calling, that I believe they would have very little of either, were it not for these things; as will too soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear now this last <hi>Act</hi> of Parliament hath taken away their <hi>Trappings.</hi> As for that which follows next, that these things have cast them out of the <hi>Consciences of Men,</hi> that's not so: For in other Kingdoms that are <hi>Christian,</hi> and some <hi>Reformed</hi> as well as other, they have more Employment in Civil Affairs than with us, and yet are in high esteem in the <hi>Consciences of Men.</hi> But the Truth is, Schisin and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration have so torn Men from Clergy and Church, from God and Christ and all, that they have not only cast Bishops, but Religion too out of their Consciences, and their Consciences are thrown after, God knows whither.</p>
            <p>Now for the Reason which this <hi>Lord</hi> gives, he is quite wide in that also. For every thing is not esteemed as it is eminent in its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Excellency (as he says it is): Indeed it ought to be so, but so it is not. For in the place before cited, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>Wisdom is better than Folly,</hi> and is most eminent in its own proper Excellency, but is it always esteemed so? No sure; <hi>for the poor Man's Wisdom is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.</hi> There, however it ought to be esteemed for its proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, yet if it be found in a poor Subject, 'tis despised and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as mean and vile as he is that hath it. And as for the Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration which his <hi>Lordship</hi> makes of this his Proposition, 'tis meerly fallacious. For Arguments drawn from <hi>Natural</hi> Things, which ever work constantly the same way, to <hi>Moral</hi> Things, which depend upon voluntary and mutable Agents, will seldom or never universally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: And therefore though it be true, that the <hi>Eye</hi> is esteemed for seeing, not hearing; and the <hi>Ear</hi> for hearing, not speaking; and should it be otherwise it would be rather monstrous than comely. That's true, because they are Agents determined <hi>ad unum,</hi> to that one Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and cannot possibly do the other; but then, by his <hi>Lordship's</hi> leave, so it is not with Bishops; for though their proper Excellency be indeed Spiritual, yet they may meddle with other things so long as they can observe the <hi>Apostle's</hi> Rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. and <hi>use this World as if they used it not;</hi> that is, use it so long and so far as may help their Service of God, and cast it off when it shall hinder them. But this <hi>Lord</hi> thinks all use of these things, and Employments in them, to be unlawful for our Calling. And therefore he adds,
<q>
                  <p>That when they, contrary hereunto, seek after a worldly Excellency, like the great Men of the World; and to Rule and Domineer as they do, contrary to our Saviour's Precept, <hi>Vos autem non sic, But it shall not</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54616:124"/>
                     <hi>be so amongst you:</hi> Instead of Honour and Esteem, they have brought upon themselves, in the Hearts of the People, that Contempt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> which they now lie under; and that justly and necessarily, because the World sees that they prefer a worldly Excellency, and run after it, and contend for it, before their own; which being Spiritual is far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and which being proper to the Ministery, is that alone which will put a Value and Esteem upon them that are of that Calling.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All this which follows is but matter of Ampliation, to help ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the business, and to make Bishops so hateful to other Men, as they are to himself. For I hope no Bishops of this Church do seek after <hi>worldly Excellency</hi> contrary to their Function; at least I know none that do: And they are far from being like the Great Men of the World. As to <hi>Ruling,</hi> 'tis proper enough to them, so far as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is given, but <hi>Domineer</hi> they do not. This comes from this <hi>Lord's</hi> Spleen, not from their Practice: And by that time his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> hath sat a while longer in the State, Men will find other manner of Domineering from him, than they found from the Bishops. Nor do they in their meddling with Civil Affairs in such sort as is now practised in <hi>England,</hi> go contrary to our Saviour's Precept, <hi>Vos autem non sic, It shall not be so amongst you,</hi> as I have proved before.</p>
            <p>Most true indeed it is, that the poor Bishops of this Church do now instead of Honour and Esteem lie under Contempt and Odium in the Hearts of the People. Of some, not of all; no nor either of the greater or the better part, for all the noise that hath been raised against them; and this <hi>Lord</hi> is much deceived to say they have brought it upon themselves. For it is but part of the Dirt which this <hi>Lord</hi> and his fellow <hi>Sectaries</hi> have most unchristian-like cast upon them: And this only to wrest their Votes out of Parliament, that now they are gone, they may the better compass their ends against Church and State, which God preserve against their Malice and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie. But this <hi>Lord</hi> says farther, That the Bishops have brought this Contempt upon themselves <hi>justly and necessarily.</hi> Now God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that it should be either; and his <hi>Lordship</hi> proves it but by saying the same thing over again, namely, because the World sees that they prefer a worldly Excellency, and run after it, and contend for it before their own. And surely if they do this, they are much to blame; but I believe the World sees it not, unless it be such of the World as look upon them with this <hi>Lord's</hi> Eyes, and that when they are at the worst too. And I verily persuade my self and I think upon very good grounds, that the present Bishops of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, all or the most of them, are as far from any just tax in this or any other kind, as they have been in any former Times since the <hi>Reformation.</hi> 'Tis true, that their own Calling being Spiritual, is far more excellent; and I shall the better believe it, when I see this <hi>Lord</hi> and the rest value it so. For I have told his <hi>Lordship</hi> already, that every thing which is more excellent in its self, is not always so estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by others: And though this Excellency be never so proper, yet by his good leave, it is not that alone which will put a value and esteem upon them and their Calling. There must be some outward helps to encourage, and countenance, and reward them too, or else
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54616:124"/>
Flesh and Blood are so dull, that little will be done. And suppose this Religious <hi>Lord,</hi> and some few like himself, would value and esteem them for their Spiritual Calling only, yet what are these to so many as would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them? And yet to speak the Truth freely, I do not see this <hi>Lord,</hi> nor any of that <hi>Feather,</hi> put a value upon that Calling for the Spiritual Excellency only; for then all Ministers that do their Duty should be valued and esteemed by them, the Calling being alike Spiritual and alike Excellent in all: whereas the World sees they neither care for nor countenance any Ministers, but such as separate with them from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> or are so near to it, as that they are ready to step into an <hi>Independent Congregation,</hi> so soon as by the Artifice of this <hi>Lord</hi> and others, it may be made ready to receive them. Now this <hi>Lord</hi> having thus belaboured these two Points, that Bishops by meddling in Civil Affairs do hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Consciences and in their Credits; he proceeds to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct us farther. And thus,
<q>
                  <p>As these things hurt themselves in their Consciences and Credits, so have they, and if they be continued, still will make them hurtful to others. The Reason is, because they break out of their own Orb and move irregularly. There is a Carse upon their leaving their own Place.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord</hi> is now come to his second general part of his Speech, and means to prove it if he can, that Bishops by any kind of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling in Civil Affairs do not only hurt themselves in Conscience and in Credit, but also, if they continue in them, they will make them hurtful to others also. And that he may seem to say nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Reason, his <hi>Lordship</hi> tells us the Reason of this is, because <hi>they break out of their own Orb and move irregularly.</hi> But I conceive this Reason weak enough. For first (as is before proved) these <hi>Stars</hi> (to follow my <hi>Lord</hi> in his Metaphor) are not so fixed to their <hi>Orb</hi> of Preaching the Gospel, but that they may do other things also at other times, so this be not neglected. And therefore it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that all their Motions out of this Orb are <hi>irregular.</hi> Secondly, when they do thus move, they are not violently to break out of their Orb, but to sit still till Authority find cause to call any of them a little aside, to attend Civil Affairs, that they may proceed never the worse, and the Gospel the better. As for that <hi>Curse</hi> which this <hi>Lord</hi> speaks of, which follows upon their leaving of their own Place; I know of none, nor any leaving of their own Place. This I am sure of, whatever this <hi>Lord</hi> says, that many extraordinary Blestings and Successes have come both upon this Kingdom and other Nations, by Counsels given by Clergy-Men; and I pray God his Counsels, such as they have been, do not bring Dishonour, and a <hi>Curse</hi> to boot, upon this Church and Kingdom. But his <hi>Lordship</hi> goes on with his Metaphor, and argues very strongly by Similitudes; which hath but a Similitude of Argumentation.</p>

So have these done. While they kept themselves to the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery alone, and gave themselves to Prayer and the Ministery of the Word, according to the Example of the Apostles, the World received the greatest Benefits from them; they were the Light and Life thereof. But when their Ambition cast them down like Stars from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to Earth, and they did grow once to be advanced above their Brethren; I do appeal to all who have been versed in the antient Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, or modern Histories, whether they have not been the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condiaries of the Christian World, never ceasing from Contention one with another about the Precedency of their Sees and Churches, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating one another, drawing Princes to be Parties with them, and thereby casting them into bloody Wars.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Argument is grounded upon <hi>si <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ruat, if Heaven falls we shall get store of Larks.</hi> But Heaven cannot sall, and so 'tis here. The Heavenly Bodies while they keep within their own Spheres, give Light and Comfort to the World; but if they should break out, which is impossible, and fall from their Regular Motions, which cannot possibly be, they would set the World on fire; or perhaps drown it again (had not God promised the contrary) according as the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Motion bended. So have these done. Nay, not so with this <hi>Lord's</hi> leave. For First, Clergy-Men are not so fixed to their <hi>Orbs</hi> as those Heavenly Bodies are, but in themselves are free and voluntary Agents, which those Bodies are not. And Secondly, they may and ought as occasion is offered them, do many things in publick Civil Affairs, which may much advantage the Gospel of <hi>Christ,</hi> and they will never <hi>Fire</hi> the World by such attendance upon them; and they may and ought give themselves to Prayer and to the Ministery of the Word notwithstanding this: and they may be the same Benefits to the World of Light and Life as before. Yea, and I make no doubt, but that when this <hi>Lord</hi> and his Followers will be as liberal and devout as the Primitive Christians were, who <hi>sold their Land and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the Money, and laid it at the Apostles Feet,</hi> Acts 4. 37. to make a Stock for their and the Church's Wants, the Bishops will be well content to follow the <hi>Apostles</hi> Example, as far and as well as they can. But if the Bishops may meddle with no Temporal Affairs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Example of the Apostles; how came the Apostles to meddle with the Receiving first, and after with the Layings out of all this Money? For, say it was to be employed on charitable Actions, yet some Diversion more or less it must needs be to the Preaching of the Gospel. But since the Example and Practice of the Apostles is so often pressed by this <hi>Lord,</hi> I would willingly his <hi>Lordship</hi> should tell me (if he will make their Practice a Rule general and binding) why now among Christians <hi>all should not be common,</hi> as the Apostles and other Believers had it; and that no Man might say that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32. and then where is the <hi>Property of the Subject?</hi> And then why do we not go up and down and Preach at large, according to the Examples of the Apostles, and endure neither Division of Parishes nor Parish Churches? And why do we not receive the <hi>Communion after Supper,</hi> at 'tis well known <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> did? Indeed, if any Bishops or other Clergy-Men
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54616:125"/>
should become <hi>falling Stars</hi> from Heaven to Earth; especially if their Sin should be so like the Devil's as to cast themselves down by their own Ambition: That, as it makes the Fall heavy to them, so yet I must say to this <hi>Lord,</hi> that both Fall and Fault is the Person's; the Episcopal Office is not the cause of it, as is here charged by him. Nor did they become <hi>falling Stars</hi> so soon as they did once grow to be advanced above their Brethren, as this <hi>Lord</hi> insinuates it. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves there was a Chief in order, S. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 26. and some were advanced to Dignity and Power above their Brethren, even in the <hi>Apostles</hi> Days; whom yet, I presume, this <hi>Lord</hi> will not be so ill advised as to call <hi>fallen Stars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Appeal which he makes to all them who have been ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Antient or Modern <hi>Ecclesiastical Histories;</hi> that's no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For in all Histories you shall find great Men of all sorts doing what in Honour and Duty should not be done; and <hi>Ambition</hi> hath been the cause of very much of this, and <hi>Ambition</hi> sticks so close to Humane Nature, as that it follows it into all Professions and Estates of Men: And I would to God Clergy-Men had been freer from this Fault than Histories testifie they have. But this hath been but the fault of some; many Reverend Bishops in all Ages have been clear of it, and 'tis a personal Corruption in whomsoever it is, and cannot justly be charged upon the Calling, as this <hi>Lord</hi> lays it. Neither have the worst of them (some <hi>Popes of Rome</hi> excepted) been the <hi>common Incendiaries of the Christian World.</hi> But <hi>Incendiaries</hi> is grown a great word of late with this <hi>Lord;</hi> and some of the poor Bishops of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been made <hi>Incendiaries</hi> too by him and his Party. But might it please God to <hi>shew some token upon us for good, that they which hate us may see it, and be ashamed,</hi> Psalm 86. 17. there would be a full discovery who have been the <hi>Incendiaries</hi> indeed in these Troubles of <hi>England;</hi> and then I make no question but it will appear that this <hi>Lord</hi> flames as high and as dangerously as any Man living. But <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (saith God) <hi>all ye that kindle a Fire, that compass your selves about with Sparks; walk in the light of your own Fire, and in the Sparks which your selves have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand, ye shall lie down in Sorrow,</hi> Isai. 50. 11.</p>
            <p>Next I pray be pleased to consider, how unworthily, and fallaciously withal, this <hi>Lord</hi> manages this Proof. For all this Discourse tends to prove it unlawful for Bishops to intermeddle in Secular Affairs; that so to do is hurtful to themselves in Conscience and in Credit, and to others also by this their irregular Motion. And this he proves by their never ceasing from Contention one with another, either about the Precedency of their <hi>Sees</hi> or <hi>Churches.</hi> They have indeed some, and sometimes, contended too eagerly for their Sees and Churches; but neither all, nor any that I know with a never-ceasing, but the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for his Supremacy. And say this were so, yet these Contentions were about their own proper Places, not about Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which now should lie before his <hi>Lordship</hi> in Proof; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was no <hi>irregular Motion</hi> of theirs in regard of the Object, but only in regard of the manner. Nor were they out of their <hi>Orb</hi> for this, though faulty enough. The like is to be said for that which follows, their <hi>Excommunicating one another</hi> upon these Quarrels. As
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54616:126"/>
for their drawing of Princes to be Parties with them, thereby casting them into bloody Wars; this hath seldom happened, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it hath happened, some Church business or other hath unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily set it on, not their meddling in Temporal Affairs. But whatever caused it, the Crime of such misleading of Princes is very odious, and as hateful to me as it can be to his <hi>Lordship.</hi> But the Persons must bear their own Faults, and not the Calling; and, sure I am, this <hi>Lord</hi> would think me very wild, if I should charge the antient <hi>Barons Wars</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> upon his <hi>Lordship</hi> and the Honourable <hi>Barons</hi> now living. But howsoever by this 'tis plain, that this <hi>Lord</hi> would not only have the Bishops turned out of all <hi>Civil Employments,</hi> but out of their <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions</hi> also: They must have no Power nor Superiority there neither; their <hi>Sees</hi> must be laid as level as Parity can make them. For all these Mischiefs came on (saith he) as soon as they were once advanced above their Brethren.</p>
            <p>And one thing more I shall take occasion to say. Here's great Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour made against the Bishops, and their meddling in Civil Affairs; but what if the <hi>Presbytery</hi> do as much or more? Do they Sin too by breaking out of their <hi>Orb,</hi> and neglecting the Work of the Ministery? No, by no means: Only the Bishops are faulty. For do you think that <hi>Calvin</hi> would have taken on him the Umpirage, and composing of so many Civil Causes as he did order between Neighbours, if so great Sin had accompanied it? For he dealt in <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Causes,</hi> and had Power to <note n="a" place="margin">Omnes in Carcerem conjecti sunt, &amp;c. Calvin. Epist. ad Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellum.</note> inflict <hi>Civil Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in his Consistory. For he committed divers to Prison for Dancing, and those not mean ones nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and he <note n="b" place="margin">Calvin. Epist. ad Viretum, fol. 373. Edit. 1575.</note> arbitrated divers Causes; and in a great Controversie between the Senate of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> he tells one <hi>Frumentius</hi> who laboured for a Reconciliation, that the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> was not so destitute, but that <note n="c" place="margin">Calvin.

               <hi>Fratres mei</hi> (saith he) <hi>huic Provinciae subeundae pares futuri essent,</hi> some of his Brethren might have been fit for that Work. Belike he took it ill, that in such a Business, though meerly <hi>Civil,</hi> he and his Fellow-Ministers should be left out. And for matters in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth he had so great Power in the Senate, and with the People, that all things were carried as he pleased. And him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self brags of it, that the <note n="d" place="margin">Senatum esse nostrum. Calvin. ad Farellum, fol. 72. Populum esse nostrum. Calvin. ad Viretum, fol. 73.</note> 
               <hi>Senate</hi> was his and the <hi>People</hi> his. And to encrease his Strength, and make it more formidable, he brought in Fifty or more of the <hi>French</hi> his Country-men and Friends, and by his solicitation made them <hi>Free Denizons</hi> of the City; <note n="e" place="margin">Calvin.

            <p>Or can you think that <hi>Beza</hi> would have taken upon him so much Secular Employment, had he thought it unlawful so to do? For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Form of the Civil Government of that City, out of the Two hundred prime Men there was a perpetual Senate chosen of Sixty, as <note n="f" place="margin">Bodin, l. 2. de Repub. c. 6.</note>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54616:126"/>
               <hi>Council-Table?</hi> Besides this; when <hi>Geneva</hi> sent a solemn Embassie to <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France,</hi> about the razing of a Fort which was built near their City by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Thuan. Hist. Anno 1600. c. 125.</note> 
               <hi>Beza</hi> would needs go along to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that Spiritual Cause unto the King; and how far he dealt, and laid Grounds for others to deal in all such Civil Causes, as were but <hi>in Ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> is manifest by <note n="†" place="margin">Beza de Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commun. p. 47.</note> himself. And I am sure <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus proximus</hi> may reach into the Cognizance of almost all Civil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Or can any Man imagine that so Religious a Man as Mr. <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> the late Parson of St. <hi>Stephen's</hi> in <hi>Coleman-street,</hi> would have done the like to no small hindrance to <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> had he thought that by this meddling he had hurt both his Conscience and his Credit, whereas (good Man) he fled into <hi>New-England</hi> to preserve both. Or, if Mr. <hi>Alexander Henderson</hi> would have come along with the <hi>Scottish Army</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and been a <hi>Commissioner</hi> (as he was) in that whole Treaty, wherein many of their Acts of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Civil Government of that Kingdom were deliberated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confirm'd; if he had thought his so doing inconsistent with his Calling? Or that the <hi>Scots</hi> (being so Religious as they then were, even to the taking up of Arms against their King for Religion) would have suffered him to take that place upon him, so contrary to the command of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Practice of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> if it had been so indeed? Or, would they have suffer'd their Preachers, which then attended their <hi>Commissioners</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> not only to meddle with, but to preach so much temporal Stuff as little belonged to the Purity of the Gospel, had they been of this <hi>Lord's</hi> Opinion? Surely, I cannot think it. But let the Bishops do but half so much, yea, though they be commanded to do that which these Men assume to themselves; and 'tis a venture but it shall prove Treason against the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of the Kingdom, and an endeavouring to bring in an <hi>Arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> Well! I'll tell you a Tale. There's a Minister at this day in <hi>London,</hi> of great Note among the Faction, well esteem'd by this <hi>Lord</hi> and others of this Outcry against the Bishops Votes in Parliament, and their meddling in Civil Affairs; this Man (I'll spare his Name) being pressed by a Friend of his, how he came to be so eager against the Church, of which and her Government he had ever heretofore been an Upholder, and had Subscribed unto it, made this Answer; <hi>Thou art a Fool; thou knowest not what it is to be the Head of a Party.</hi> This Man is one of the <hi>great Masters</hi> of the present Reformation; and do you not think it far more inconsistent with his Ministerial Function to be in the Head of a turbulent Faction (to say the least of them) than for a Bishop to meddle in Civil Affairs? Yet such is the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of our Times. But 'tis no matter for all this; his <hi>Lordship</hi> hath yet more to say against the Ambition of the Prelates. For,
<q>
                  <p>Their Ambition and intermeddling with Secular Affairs and State Business, hath been the cause of shedding more Christian Blood than any thing else in the Christian World; and this no Man can deny that is versed in History.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the same over and over again; saving that the Expression contains in it a vast Untruth. For they that are versed in <hi>History</hi> must
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54616:127"/>
needs say 'tis a loud one, that Bishops meddling in Temporal Affairs hath been the cause of shedding <hi>more Christian Blood, than any thing else in the Christian World.</hi> What a happiness hath this <hi>Lord</hi> that his pale Meagerness cannot blush at such thing as this. Yea, but he will prove it here at home in this Kingdom. For, says he,
<q>
                  <p>We need not go out of our own Kingdom for Examples of their Insolency and Cruelty. When they had a dependency upon the Pope, and any footing thereby out of the Land, there were never any that carryed themselves with so much Scorn and Insolency towards the Princes of this Kingdom, as they have done. Two of them the Bishop that last spake hath named, but instances of many more may be given, whereof there would be no end.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed we need not go out of our own Kingdom for Examples of their Insolency and Cruelty. For in so many Ages 'tis no wonder in any Kingdom to find some bad Examples, be it of Insolency, Cruelty or what you will: Especially in the midst of so much Prosperity as accompanied Clergy-Men in those times. But 'tis true too, that there are far more Examples of their Piety and Charity, would this <hi>Lord</hi> be pleased to remember the one with the other. As for their bad Examples his <hi>Lordship</hi> gives a Reason why not all, but some of them, carryed themselves with so much Scorn and Insolency towards their Princes, even with almost as much as <hi>this Lord and his Faction</hi> carry themselves at this day towards their mild and gracious King. And the Reason is a true one; it was their dependency upon the <hi>Pope,</hi> and their footing which thereby they had to subsist out of the Land: which may, and I hope will be a sufficient warning to his Majesty and his Successours, never to let in again a foreign Supream Power into any of his Dominions. For 'tis to have one State within, yet not dependent upon the other, which can never be with Safety or Quiet in any Kingdom: And I would have the World consider a little with what Insolency, and perhaps Disallegiance this <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Round-head</hi> Crew would use their Kings, if they had but half so strong a foreign dependance as the Bishops then had, that dare use the most gracious of Kings as they do this present day. <hi>Two of these Insolent ones</hi> (this <hi>Lord</hi> says) <hi>the Bishop that last spake named. Lincoln</hi> stands in the Margin, by which it appears that Dr. <hi>John Williams</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and since Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> was the Man that named two; but because this <hi>Lord names them not,</hi> I know not who they are, and therefore can say nothing for or against them, but leave them to that <hi>Lord which censured</hi> them. As for that which follows, that the instances of many more may be given, whereof there would be no end. This is a piece of this <hi>Lord's</hi> loud Rhetorick, which can have no Truth in it, especially relating, as it doth, to this Kingdom only.</p>
            <p>But whereas this <hi>Lord</hi> said immediately before, that their med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling in State business hath been the cause of <hi>shedding more Christian Blood, than any thing else in the Christian World,</hi> and in the very next words falls upon the proof of it in this Kingdom; I must put him in mind that one Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> namely, that which most
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54616:127"/>
irreligiously and trayterously deposed <hi>Richard</hi> II. was the cause of the effusion of more <hi>Christian Blood</hi> amongst us, than all the Bishops that ever were in this Kingdom. For that base and unjust Parliament was the cause of all the Civil Wars, those Bloody Wars which began in the Heir's time after the Usurpation of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not till there were slain of the Royal Blood and of Nobles and the common People a Numberless Number: And I heartily beg it of God, that no disloyal Parliament may ever bring this Kingdom into the like distress. For our Neighbours are far stronger now than they were then, and what desolation it might bring upon us, God in Heaven knows. So this <hi>Lord</hi> may see, if he will, what a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> it self being misgoverned may do. But will his <hi>Lordship</hi> think it Reason to condemn all Parliaments because this, and some few more, have done what they should not do, as he here deals by Bishops? Sure he would not. But having done with the Bishops dependency on the <hi>Pope,</hi> he goes on and tells us farther, that
<q>
                  <p>Although the Pope be cast off, yet now there is another Inconvenience, no less prejudicial to the Kingdom, by their sitting in this House; and that is, they have such an absolute dependency upon the King, that they sit not there as free Men.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I am heartily sorry to see this <hi>Lord</hi> thus far transported: The <hi>Pope</hi> is indeed cast off from domineering over <hi>King, Church,</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> But I am sorry to hear it from this <hi>Lord,</hi> that this other Inconvenience by Bishops sitting in the House of Parliament, is no less prejudicial to the Kingdom. Where, first I observe that this <hi>Lord</hi> accounts the <hi>Pope's</hi> ruling in this Kingdom, but a <hi>matter of inconvenience;</hi> for so his words imply. For that must be one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, if the Bishops voting be the other; and I am sure the Laws both of this Church and State, make it far worse than an Incovenience. Had I said thus much, I had been a <hi>Papist</hi> out of Question. Secondly; I'll appeal to any prudent and moderate <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> in the Christian World, whether he can possibly think that the Bishops having Votes in the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> can possibly be as great, or no less an Inconvenience, than the <hi>Pope's</hi> Supremacy here. And I believe this <hi>Lord</hi> when he thinks better of it, will wish these words unsaid.</p>
            <p>Well! but what then is this <hi>inconvenience</hi> that is so great? Why, my <hi>Lord</hi> tells us, 'tis because they have such an <hi>absolute dependency upon the King that they sit not there as free-Men.</hi> Where first, 'tis strange to me and my Reason, that any dependency on the King, be it never so absolute, can be possibly so great an Inconvenience to the King, as (that upon) an Independent foreign Power is; the King being <hi>sworn to the Laws,</hi> but the <hi>Pope</hi> being free, and (as he challenges) not only independent from, but superiour to, both King and Laws. Secondly, I conceive the Bishops dependency is no more absolute upon the King than is the dependence of other Honourable Members of that House, and that the Bishops sit there as absolute free-men as any others, not excepting his <hi>Lordship.</hi> And of this Belief I must be till the contrary shall be proved; which his <hi>Lordship</hi> goes thus about to do.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54616:128"/>
               <p>That which is requisite to Freedom is, to be void of Hopes and Fears; he that can lay down these is a Free-man, and will be so in this House: But for the Bishops, as the case stands with them, it is not likely they will lay aside their Hopes; greater Bishopricks being still in expectancy; and for their Fears they cannot lay them down, since their Places and Seats in Parliament are not invested in them by Blood, and so hereditary; but by annexation of a Barony to their Office, and depending upon that Office; so that they may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of their Office, and thereby of their Places at the King's pleasure.</p>
            </q>
            <p>My <hi>Lord's Philosophy</hi> is good enough; for to be void of Hopes and Fears is very requisite to Freedom, and he that can lay these down, is a Free-man, or may be if he will: But whether he will be so in <hi>that great House,</hi> I cannot so well tell. For though no Man can be free that is full charg'd with Hopes or Fears; yet there are some other things which collaterally work upon Men, and consequently take off their Freedom, almost as much as Hopes and Fears can do. Such are <hi>Consanguinity, Affinity,</hi> especially if the Wife bears any sway; <hi>private Friendship,</hi> and above all <hi>Faction.</hi> And therefore though I cannot think that every Man will be a Free-man in that House, that is void of Hopes and Fears, yet I believe he may if he will. Now I conceive that in all these collateral Stiflings of a Man's Freedom, the <hi>Lay Lords</hi> are by far less free than the Bishops are.</p>
            <p>Again, for the main bars of Freedom, <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> into which all the rest do some way or other fall, I do not yet see but that Bishops, even as the case stands with them, may be as free, and I hope are, in their Voting as Temporal <hi>Lords.</hi> For their Hopes, this <hi>Lord</hi> tells us 'tis not likely they will lay them aside, <hi>greater Bishopricks</hi> being still in expectancy. Truly, I do not know why a deserving Bishop may not in due time hope for a better Bishoprick; and yet retain that Freedom which becomes him in Parliament, as well as any <hi>Noble-man</hi> may be Noble and Free in that great Court, and yet have moderated Hopes of being called to some great Office, or to the <hi>Council-table,</hi> or some honourable and profitable <hi>Embassage,</hi> or some Knighthood of the <hi>Garter;</hi> of all, or some of which, there is still expectancy. Lay your Hand on your Heart, my <hi>Lord,</hi> and examine your self.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Fears,</hi> his <hi>Lordship</hi> tells us roundly the Bishops cannot lay them down. Cannot? Are all the Bishops such poor Spirits; But why can they not? Why, because their Places in Parliament are not <hi>hereditary,</hi> but by annexation of a <hi>Barony</hi> to their Office, and depending upon it; so that they may be deprived of their Office, and thereby of their Place at the King's pleasure. First; I believe the Bishops gave their Votes in Parliament as freely to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and Judgment as this <hi>Lord</hi> or any other. Secondly; If any of them for Fear or any other motive have given their Votes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily; I doubt not but many Honourable <hi>Lords</hi> have at some time or other forgot themselves and born the Bishops company: though in this I commend neither. Thirdly; I know some Bishops who had rather lose not their <hi>Baronies</hi> only, but their <hi>Bishopricks</hi> also, than Vote so unworthily as this <hi>Lord would make</hi> the World
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54616:128"/>
believe they have done. Lastly, it is true their Seat in Parliament depends on their <hi>Barony,</hi> their <hi>Barony</hi> on their Office; and if they be deprived of their Office, both <hi>Barony</hi> and Seat in Parliament are gone. But I hope my <hi>Lord</hi> will not say we live under a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> and then I will say Bishops are not deprivable of their Office, and consequently not of the rest, at the Kings Pleasure. But this <hi>Lord</hi> proceeds into a farther Amplification: And to whet his inveterate Malice against the King, says as follows. Nay,
<q>
                  <p>They do not so much as sit here, <hi>dum bene se gesserint,</hi> as the Judges now by your Lordships Petition to the King have their Places granted them, but at Will and Pleasure; and therefore as they were all excluded by <hi>Edward</hi> the First, as long as he pleased, and Laws made <hi>excluso Clero,</hi> so may they be by any King at his Pleasure in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. They must needs therefore be in an absolute dependency upon the Crown, and thereby at Devotion for their Votes, which how prejudicial it hath been, and will be to this House, I need not say.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If I could wonder at any thing which this <hi>Lord</hi> doth or says in such Arguments as these, when his Heart is up against the Clergy, I should wonder at this. For if he will not suppose the King's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be <hi>Tyrannical,</hi> the Bishops have their Places during Life, and cannot justly be put out of them, unless their Miscarriage be such as shall merit a Deprivation. And therefore, by this <hi>Lord's</hi> good leave, they have as good a <hi>Tenure</hi> as the Judges is of a <hi>Quamdiu bene se gesserint.</hi> And this they have without their Lordships Petition to the King, as his <hi>Lordship</hi> tells us was fain to be made for the <hi>Judges,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by galling the King for giving some <hi>Patents</hi> to the Judges during Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; which, as the Case stood with them, whether he had Reason to do or not, I will not dispute. So that manifest it is, that the Bishops do not hold their Bishopricks at the King's Will and Pleasure, and consequently neither their Baronies nor their Places in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And I would have my <hi>Lord</hi> consider, whether all the Noblemen that sit in that House, by <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Inheritance,</hi> be not in the same Condition upon the matter with the Bishops. For as Bishops may commit Crimes worthy Deprivation, and so consequently lose their Votes in Parliament; so are there some Crimes also which Noblemen may commit (God preserve them from them) which may consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void all their <hi>Rights</hi> in Parliament, yea, and taint their <hi>Blood</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And as for the Bishops <hi>Baronies,</hi> they are not at the King's Will and Pleasure neither: For they hold their <hi>Baronies</hi> from the <hi>Crown</hi> indeed, but by so long Prescription as will preserve them from any Disseisure at Will and Pleasure of the King. So if they merit not Deprivation by Law and Justice, their <hi>Baronies</hi> are safe, and that by as <hi>good Right,</hi> and far <hi>antienter Descent,</hi> than any the antientest No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman of <hi>England</hi> can plead for himself.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Edward the First,</hi> he was a brave Prince, and is of glorious Memory, and respected the Dutifulness of his Clergy very Royally. As for the Acts of Parliament made in his Time, and the Time of his Royal Successor <hi>Edward the Third,</hi> I conceive nothing can be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54616:129"/>
out of the <hi>Titles</hi> or <hi>Prefaces</hi> of those Acts, against either the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops presence at, or their Voting to those Laws, by any Prohibition of Exclusion of them, by those famous Kings. For though the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Carlisle,</hi> 35 <hi>Edw.</hi> I. not Printed, be recited in the Statute <note place="margin">Et Similiter <hi>in the Statute of</hi> 27 Ed. 3. <hi>and</hi> 38 Ed. 3. <hi>both of</hi> Provisces.</note> 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. of <hi>Provisoes,</hi> and says, that by the Assent of the Earls, Barons, and other Nobles, and all the Commonalty, at their Instances and Requests in the said full Parliament, it was ordained. &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mention at all of the Prelates; yet it is more than probable, that the Prelates were Summoned to, and present at these Parliaments. For first, it appears expresly that the <hi>Statute of the Staple,</hi> 27 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. made in the same Parliament with the <hi>Statute of Provisoes,</hi> that the Prelates were Assembled and Present there: And I rather think that in all these <hi>Statutes of Provisoes</hi> (being professedly made against the Liberty and Jurisdiction of the <hi>Pope,</hi> in those Times challenged in this Kingdom, to whose Power the Bishops were then Subject) they voluntarily chose to be absent, rather than endanger themselves to the <hi>Pope,</hi> if they Voted for such Laws; or offend the King and the State, if they Voted against them. But these Laws were not made <hi>excluso Clero,</hi> and that <hi>as long as the King pleased</hi> (as this <hi>Lord</hi> affirms) and this is very plain in the Statute it self of 38 <hi>Edw.</hi> III. For in the last Chapter of that Statute, though the <hi>Prelates</hi> be omitted in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, yet there 'tis expresly said, That the King, the Prelates, the Dukes, Earls and Barons, &amp;c. So here was not exclusion of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops by the King, but their own voluntary Absence, which made those kind of Laws pass without them.</p>
            <p>As for the Parliament at <hi>Carlisle,</hi> I conceive the Books are misprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a common Errour risen by it. For that Parliament was held <hi>Anno</hi> 35 <hi>Edw.</hi> I. and was the first of <hi>Provisoes;</hi> and as appears in the <hi>Records,</hi> the Prelates were present. <note n="*" place="margin">Rotulo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>.</note> But in 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> I. the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Summoned to <hi>London,</hi> and the Bishops called to it. And there was <note n="†" place="margin">M. 25 Dorso.</note> another Summons to <hi>Salisbury</hi> in the same Roll, to which the Prelates were not called. But this, I conceive, was a Summons of the King's <hi>Great Council</hi> only, and not of a Parliament, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons not being called any more than the Prelates: Nor were there any other Summons, 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> I. but these two. That which his <hi>Lordship</hi> infers upon this, is, that therefore the Bishops are <hi>in abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dependency upon the Crown;</hi> which is manifestly untrue, since they cannot be outed at Will and Pleasure, but for Demerit only; and that may fall upon Temporal Lords as well as Bishops. And therefore neither are they at Devotion for their Votes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in true Construction, no Prejudice can come by them to that Honourable House. And I pray God their casting out be not more prejudicial both to State and Church than I am willing to forespeak. After this his <hi>Lordship</hi> tells us what he hath done in this great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, saying,
<q>
                  <p>I have now shewed your Lordships how hurtful to themselves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers these things, which the Bill would take away, have been. I will only Answer some Objections which I have met withal, and then crave your Pardon for troubling you so long.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:54616:129"/>
His <hi>Lordship</hi> tells us he hath shewed how hurtful these things are both to the Bishops and others, which this Bill would hew down; and out of his Zeal and Love to the Church he hath gone farther than any Man in this Argument; yet I conceive he hath not shewed what he thinks he hath. 'Tis true, he hath strongly laboured it, but I hope it will appear he hath not master'd it. I shall now see how he Answers such Objections, as his <hi>Lordship</hi> says he hath met with. And the First Objection is, his <hi>Lordship</hi> says,</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>1.</hi> That they have been very Antient.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>2.</hi> That they are Established by Law.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>3.</hi> That it may be an Infringement to the House of Peers, for the House of Commons to send up a Bill to take away some of their Members. To these three the Answer will be easie.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I know not how easie the Answer will be, but these must needs be hard Times for Bishops, if neither <hi>Antiquity</hi> can fence them against Novelty, nor <hi>Law</hi> defend them against Violence, nor fear of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>House of Peers</hi> preserve them against the Eagerness of the <hi>House of Commons;</hi> and that in the very House of Peers it self. Let us see then and consider how easie the Answer will be to these, and how sufficient also.</p>
            <q>
               <p>To the First. Antiquity is no good Plea; for that which is by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience found hurtful, the longer it hath done hurt, the more cause there is now to remove it, that it may do no more. Besides, other Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities are as antient which have been thought fit to be redressed; and this is not so antient, but that it may truly be said, <hi>Non fuit sic ab initio.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>This Answer may be easie enough; but sure 'tis not sufficient: Nor do I wonder that <hi>Antiquity</hi> is no good Plea in this <hi>Lord's</hi> account; for he is such an Enemy to it, that he will have his very Religion new. If any thing be <hi>antient</hi> it smells of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Yea, but if it be found hurtful, <hi>the longer it hath done hurt, the more cause to remove it.</hi> That's true; if it be hurtful in and of it self; so is not this. If it does hurt constantly or frequently; else you must cast out the Lay Lords Votes too, and his <hi>Lordship's</hi> with the rest. For out of all doubt their Votes do hurt sometimes, and it may be more often and more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously than the Bishops Votes: And when this <hi>Lord</hi> shall be pleased to tell us what those other <hi>Irregularities</hi> are, which are as antient and yet redressed, I will consider of them, and then either grant or deny. In the mean time, I think it hath been proved that it is no <hi>Irregularity</hi> for a Bishop that is called to it by Supreme Authority, to give Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, or otherwise to meddle in Civil Affairs, so as it take him not quite off from his Calling. And for his <hi>Lordship's</hi> Close, That this is not so antient, but that it may be truly said, <hi>Non fuit sic ab initio;</hi> his <hi>Lordship</hi> is much deceived. For that Speech of our Saviour's, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> 19. 8. is spoken of <hi>Marriage</hi> which was instituted in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,</hi> and therefore <hi>ab initio,</hi> from the beginning, must there be taken from the <hi>Creation,</hi> or from the <hi>Institution</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> soon after

it. But I hope his <hi>Lordship</hi> means it not so here, to put it off that Bishops had not Votes in the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For then no question but it may be truly said, <hi>Non fuit sic ab initio.</hi> But if his <hi>Lordship,</hi> or any other, will apply this Speech to any thing else, which hath not its beginning so high, he must then refer his Words and meaning to that time, in which that thing he speaks of took its beginning; as is this particular to the beginning of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in this Kingdom. And then, under Favour of this <hi>Lord,</hi> the voting of Bishops in Parliament is so antient that it cannot be truly said, <hi>Non fuit sic ab initio:</hi> For so far as this Kingdom hath any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> to shew, Clergy-Men both Bishops and Abbots, had free and full Votes in Parliament; so full, as that in the first Parliament of which we have any certain Records, which was in the Forty and ninth Year of <hi>Henry the Third,</hi> there was Summoned by the King to Vote in Parliament, One hundred and twenty <hi>Bishops, Abbots</hi> and <hi>Priors,</hi> and but Twenty three <hi>Lay-Lords.</hi> Now there were but Twenty six Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in all, and the Lords being multiplied (to the unspeakable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Crown) into above One hundred, besides many of their young Sons called by Writ in their Father's Life-time, have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther found or made a troubled time, to cast the Bishops and their Votes out of the House.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> To the Objection for being Established by Law, <hi>his Lordship says,</hi> The Law-makers have the same Power and the same Charge to alter old Laws inconvenient, as to make new that are necessary.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Law-makers have indeed the same Power in them, and the same Charge upon them, that their Predecessors in former Times had; and there's no question but old Laws may be Abrogated and new ones made: But this <hi>Lord,</hi> who seems to be well versed in the Rules and Laws of Government (which the poor Bishops understand not) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know that it's a dangerous thing to be often changing of the Laws; especially such as have been antient, and where the <hi>old</hi> is not inconvenient, nor the <hi>new</hi> necessary; which is the true State of this Business, whatever this <hi>Lord</hi> thinks.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> And for the Third Objection, the Privileges of the House, <hi>this</hi> Lord <hi>says,</hi> it can be no Breach of them. For either Estate may propose to the other by way of Bill, what they conceive to be for publick Good, and they have Power respectively of accepting or refusing.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This is an <hi>easie</hi> Answer indeed, and very true. For either <hi>Estate</hi> in Parliament may propose to the other by way of <hi>Bill,</hi> and they have Power respectively of accepting or refusing; and there is no <hi>Breach of Privilege</hi> in all this. But this <hi>easie</hi> Answer comes not home. For how my <hi>Lord</hi> understands this Objection, I know not; it seems as if it did reach only to the external Breach of some Privilege, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they which made the Objection meant much more. As name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that by this Bill there was an aim in the <hi>Commons</hi> to weaken the <hi>Lords House,</hi> and by making their Votes fewer, to be the better able to work them to their own Ends in future Businesses. So the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54616:131"/>
is of equal, if not greater strength against the <hi>Lord's</hi> yielding to the Bill to the Iufringement of their own strength, than to the <hi>Commons</hi> proposing it, and there is no doubt but that the <hi>Commons</hi> might propose their Bill without <hi>Breach of Privilege;</hi> but whether the Lords might grant it without impairing their own strength, I leave the future Times, which shall see the Success of this Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to judge of the Wisdom of it, which I shall not presume to do. I thought his <hi>Lordship</hi> had now done, but he tells us,
<q>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> There are two other Objections which may seem to have more force; but they will receive satisfactory Answers. The one is, that if they may remove Bishops, they may as well next time remove Barons and Earls.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Lord</hi> confesses the two Arguments following are of more force, but he says they will receive <hi>satisfactory Answers.</hi> And it may be so. But what Answers soever they may receive, yet I doubt whether those which that <hi>Lord</hi> gives be such: For to this of taking away of <hi>Barons</hi> and <hi>Earls</hi> next, his <hi>Lordship</hi> Answers two things. First he says,
<q>
                  <p>The Reason is not the same; the one sitting by an Honour invested in their Blood and Hereditary, which though it be in the King alone to grant, yet being once granted he cannot take away. The other sitting by a Barony depending upon an Office, which may be taken away; for if they be deprived of their Office, they sit not.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To this there have been enough said before, yet that it may fully appear this Reason is not <hi>Satisfactory,</hi> this <hi>Lord</hi> should do well to know, or rather to remember, for I think he knows it already, that though these great Lords have and hold their Places in Parliament by <hi>Blood and Inheritance,</hi> and the Bishops by <hi>Baronies</hi> depending upon their Office; yet the King, which gives alone, can no more justly or lawfully alone away their Office without their Demerit, and that in a legal way, than he can take away Noblemens Honours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for ought is yet said, their Cases are not so much alike as his <hi>Lordship</hi> would have them seem. In this indeed they differ somewhat, that Bishops may be deprived upon more Crimes, than those are for which <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> may lose their Honours; but neither of them can be justly done by the King's Will and Pleasure only. But Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for farther Answer this <hi>Lord</hi> tells us,
<q>
                  <p>The Bishops sitting there is not so essential. For Laws have been, and may be made, they being all excluded; but it can never be shewed that ever there were Laws made by the King and them, the Lords and Earls excluded.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Reason is as little <hi>satisfactory</hi> to me as the former. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, according to Law and Prescription of Hundreds of Years, the Bishops sitting in that House is as <hi>essential</hi> as the Lords. And this about the Laws made without them, is built only upon some difficult emergent Cases, from which they desired to be exempt and free themselves: Not from any constraint of the State; nor from any
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54616:132"/>
Opinion of the King, Peers or People, that it was fit to make Laws without them. But to this we have given an Answer before.</p>
            <p>But this Objection of taking away the <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> next, strikes (as I conceive) another way at the Lord's House, than either of those Answers or Reasons seem to meet with. And perhaps this <hi>Lord</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is willing to pass it by, if he does see it; and 'tis thus. The <hi>House of Commons</hi> sees and knows well enough, that should they bring up a Bill open, and with a bare edge to take away the Votes from the Lords, it could not possibly be endured by either King or Peers. Therefore the <hi>Bill</hi> which may come to take them away next, and which may be meant in this Objection, may be a Bill to make one House of both, and set them altogether, under the pretence of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Unity, and more free and quick dispatch of all Business, all Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages and Conferences, and breach of Correspondencies, and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences happening between the Two Houses, while they are Two, being by this means taken away. And this I am sure hath been much spoken of since this Parliament began, and may with far more ease be next compassed now the Bishops are thrust out; both because there are fewer in the <hi>Lord's House</hi> to help to cast out such a Bill, and because the <hi>Commons House,</hi> which would willingly receive the <hi>Lords</hi> in among them, would never admit the Bishops into their House. So that both ways this is made far more easie to Pass. And, should this happen, I would fain know of this <hi>Lord,</hi> wherein this Objection would fail, that they might the next time remove the <hi>Barons</hi> and the <hi>Earls.</hi> Not remove them from making Laws (as his <hi>Lordship</hi> speaks of it) but remove them into the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> where their Votes shall be swallow'd up among the many, and might be quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master'd, though they should not all Agree and Vote one way. For then the meanest <hi>Commoner</hi> in that House would have his Vote as great as the greatest <hi>Earls.</hi> Whereas now in their own House being distinct, though all the <hi>House of Commons</hi> agree upon a Bill, or any thing else; the <hi>Lords</hi> may, if they see Reason, alter or reject it. So that if hereafter they be reduced to one House, I make no question but their Votes are gone next after the Bishops. And if his <hi>Lordship</hi> shall think this an impossible Supposition; let him know, it is not half so impossible, as that which he made before, of the <hi>Heavenly Bodies</hi> breaking out of their own Spheres. But we are now come to the last Objection, the other of the two, which his <hi>Lordship</hi> says are stronger. And,
<q>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> The other Objection is this, That this Bill alters the Foundation of this House; and Innovations, which shake Foundations, are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And truly this Objection seems to me very strong; but perhaps that is by reason of my Weakness; for my <hi>Lord</hi> tells us before, that it is capable of a <hi>satisfactory Answer;</hi> and here his <hi>Lordship</hi> gives two for failing.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I Answer, First, That if there should be an Errour in the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it shall be found, and the Master-Builders be met together,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54616:132"/>
they may, nay, they ought rather to amend it, than to suffer it to run on still to the prejudice and danger of the whole Structure.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Answer, whatever this <hi>Lord</hi> thinks of it, is not <hi>satisfactory;</hi> and the thing will be full of danger, whensoever it shall be put to trial. For <hi>Foundations</hi> are seldom meddled withal but with great hazard, and a Fundamental Errour in a Kingdom is born with more Safety to the whole than it can be taken away. And this happens partly because among the many Subjects of a Kingdom there are different Judgments, and as different Affections; whence it follows, that all Men are not of Opinion, that that which is called an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the Foundation, is so indeed: Nor do the Affections of all Men dislike it, nay perhaps the greater, perhaps <hi>the better</hi> part will approve it. In this Case, if the <hi>Master-Builders</hi> fall to mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this somewhat boisterously, may they not rend all in pieces, to fall about their own Ears, and other Mens? And partly, because the <hi>Master-Builders</hi> which are to meet to repair the decays of the State, though in all Ages they have the same Authority to make Laws, yet they have not in all Ages the same Skill and Wisdom, for the making or the mending of them. Whence it follows, that even the <hi>Master-Builders</hi> themselves may mistake, and call that the Errour, which is indeed a great part of the Strength of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: And so by tampering to mend that which is better already, endanger the shaking, if not the fall, of the whole Structure, which they would labour to preserve. And I pray God Posterity do not find it, that even the <hi>Master-Builders</hi> which are now met, be not so deceived, and with as ill Success, in casting the Bishops Votes out of the House, under the Name of an <hi>Errour in the Foundation.</hi> But if this Answer satisfie not, his <hi>Lordship</hi> may hope his next will.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It seems this <hi>Lord</hi> distrusts his former Answer about mending <hi>Fun damental Errours</hi> in a State, and therefore here he denies that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and their Votes are <hi>Fundamental</hi> to the <hi>Lords</hi> House. But I doubt his <hi>Lordship</hi> is mistaken in this. For that is <hi>Fundamental</hi> in any Court, which in that Court is first laid and settled, upon which all the future Structure is raised. Now in the <hi>Lords</hi> House of Parliament, the Bishops Votes were laid at the very first, as well as the Votes of the <hi>Lords</hi> Temporal. Nay, with a Precedency both in Place and Number, and all the Ordinances and Powers of that great Court have equally proceeded from the Votes of the Bishops and the <hi>Lords:</hi> and therefore for ought which yet appears to me, either the <hi>Lords</hi> Vote are not <hi>Fundamental</hi> to that House, or the Bishops are.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:54616:133"/>
But his <hi>Lordship</hi> proves they are not <hi>Fundamental</hi> to that House, because that House hath stood without them. But weakly enough, God knows, like a House whose Foundations are shaken upon one side, and because <hi>that House hath done all that appertains to the Power of it without them.</hi> It may be so. But I doubt whether it did all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of it without them. For this relation again to that Parliament under <hi>Edward</hi> the First, from which, his <hi>Lordship</hi> says Bishops were excluded; and we know that Parliament is called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctum Parliamentum,</hi> the unlearned Parliament: For all the <hi>Lawyers</hi> were excluded from that Parliament as well as the <hi>Clergy-Men.</hi> And therefore were this <hi>Lord</hi> indifferent, he might argue that <hi>Lawyers Votes</hi> are not Fundamental in the <hi>Commons House;</hi> which is true, tho' no way convenient, rather than that <hi>Bishops Votes</hi> are not Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the <hi>Lords House;</hi> which is utterly against all Truth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. But his <hi>Lordship's</hi> Tooth is so sharp, and so black against that Order, that he snaps at them upon all, and upon no Occasion, and would invenom them had he Power.</p>
            <p>To make this seem the better, his <hi>Lordship</hi> ends this Speech with a piece of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which I cannot approve neither. For he says, That which hath been done for a time at the King's Pleasure, may be done with as little danger for a longer time. For First, this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is unsound in it self: For many Cases may happen, in which divers things may be done for a Prince's Pleasure once, or for a time, and with no great danger; which continued or often repeated, will be full of danger, and perhaps not endured by the Subject. Secondly, I am confident, let the Tables be but turned from a Bishop to a Lay-Man, and this <hi>Lord</hi> shall eat his own Proposition. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; in another <hi>Parliament,</hi> and in a time generally received to be as good as that of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time, and within my own Memory, Mr. <hi>Peter Wentworth</hi> moved in the <hi>House of Commons</hi> to have an Heir apparent declared for the better and securer Peace of the Kingdom in After-times. The Queen, for her meer Will and Pleasure (for that which he did was no Offence against Law) took him either out of the <hi>House,</hi> or so soon as he came out of the <hi>House,</hi> clap'd him up in the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he lay till his Death. What will this <hi>Lord</hi> say to this? Will he say this was done once at the Prince's Pleasure? Why then I return his Proposition upon him, and tell him, that that which was done once at one Prince's Pleasure, may be done oftner at other Prince's Pleasure with as little danger. Or will this <hi>Lord</hi> say this was not done at the <hi>Queen's</hi> Pleasure, but but she might justly and legally do so? Then other Princes of this Realm having the same Power residing in them, may do by other <hi>Parliament Men,</hi> as she did with this <hi>Gentleman.</hi> And which soever of the two he shall say, King <hi>Charles</hi> had as good Right, and with as little Breach of Parliament-Privilege, to demand the <hi>Six Men</hi> which by his <hi>Attorney</hi> he had accused of Treason, as that <hi>great Queen</hi> had to lay hold on Mr. <hi>Wentworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since I had written this, the <hi>Observer</hi> steps in and tells us, That a <note place="margin">Observations upon some of His Majesty's late Answers, <hi>p. 7.</hi>
               </note> meer Example (though of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>) is no Law; for some of her Actions were retracted: and that yet without question Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> might do that which a Prince less beloved could never have
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54616:133"/>
done. 'Tis true, that <hi>a meer Example is not a Law,</hi> and yet the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of <hi>England,</hi> even in that happy <hi>Queen's</hi> Time, were not apt to bear Examples against Law; and if that she did were not against Law, that's as much as I ask. For then neither is that against Law which King <hi>Charles</hi> did upon a far higher Accusation, than could be charged against Mr. <hi>Wentworth.</hi> 'Tis true again, that Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> might do that which a <hi>Prince less beloved</hi> could not have done; that is, she might do that with safety, which a <hi>Prince less beloved</hi> could not do, that is, not do with safety. But whatsoever is lawful for one Prince to do, is as lawful for another; though perhaps not so expedient, in regard of what will be well or ill taken by the People. But otherwise the Peoples Affection to the Prince can be no Rule nor Measure of the Princes <hi>Justice</hi> to the People.</p>
            <p>I will be bold to give him another Instance. King <hi>Charles</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ship-Money</hi> all over the Kingdom: Either he did this <hi>justly</hi> and <hi>legally</hi> for the Defence of himself and the Publick; or he did it at his <hi>Will and Pleasure,</hi> thinking that an honourable and fit way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. I am sure this <hi>Lord</hi> will not say he did it <hi>legally,</hi> for his <hi>Vote</hi> concurred to the condemning of it in Parliament: And if he say he did it at his own <hi>Will and Pleasure,</hi> then I would fain know of his <hi>Lordship,</hi> whether this which was done for a time at the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, may be done with as little danger to the <hi>Liberty of the Subject,</hi> and the Property of his Goods, for a longer time, and so be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued on the Subject? And if he says it may, why did he Vote against it as a thing dangerous? And if he says it may not, then he must Condemn his own Proposition. For he cannot but see, that that which is once done, or done for a short time at a Prince's <hi>Will and Pleasure,</hi> cannot be often repeated or continued, but with far greater danger than it was once done. Though for the thing it self, if it were not legal, <hi>I am sorry it is not made so.</hi> For it would be, under God, the greatest Honour and Security that this Nation ever had: Whereas now the <hi>Tugging</hi> which falls out between the King's Power, and the Peoples Liberty, will in time (unless God's infinite Mercy prevents it) do that in this Kingdom, which I abhor to think on.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Lord</hi> goes on yet and tells us, That that which hath been so done for a time, when it appears to be <hi>fit</hi> and for <hi>publick Good,</hi> not only may, but ought to be done altogether by the Supream Power. So then here this is his <hi>Lordship's</hi> Doctrine, that that which was once done at a Prince's Will and Pleasure, when it shall appear to be <hi>fit,</hi> and for the <hi>publick Good</hi> (as he supposeth here the taking away of Bishops Votes to be) it not only <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>ought</hi> to be done altogether by the Supream Power, as now that is done by Act of Parliament. Not only <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>ought!</hi> Soft a little; His <hi>Lordship</hi> had the same Phrase immediately before. Why but, First, every thing that is fit, <hi>ought</hi> not by and by to be made up into a Law: For <hi>fitness</hi> may vary very often, which <hi>Laws</hi> should not. Secondly, Every thing that is for the <hi>publick Good,</hi> is not by and by to be made up into a Law. For many things in Times of Difficulty and Exigency may be for <hi>publick Good,</hi> which in some other Times may be hurtful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be generally bound within a Law. And if his <hi>Lordship</hi> shall say, as here he doth, that they ought to be done altogether, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54616:134"/>
be made up into a Law by the <hi>Supream Power,</hi> but fitted only to such Times; under his <hi>Lordship's</hi> Favour, that ought not to be neither. For let such a Law be made, and he that is once <hi>Master</hi> of the Times, will have the Law ready to serve his turn and theirs, whether the Times bear the like Necessity or not.</p>
            <p>And since every thing that is fit, and is for publick Good, ought not by and by, without more Experience of it, to be made up into a Law; then much less that which appears so; yea, though it appear never so evidently; yea, and to the wisest <hi>Parliament</hi> that ever sat. 'Tis true, they may make such a thing into a Law, and 'tis fit for the most part so to do; but to say they ought to do it, is more than I can believe. For no Parliament is or can be so wise as to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, and no Evidence can be so apparent unto them in those things of infinite variety for the publick Good, and in which is so much uncertainty; but that they may both piously and prudently forbear the making of some of them into a Law if they please. But no Man may forbear that which he <hi>ought</hi> to do, <hi>when</hi> he <hi>ought</hi> to do it: And till that time comes, he <hi>ought</hi> not. This <hi>Lord</hi> hath now done, and so have I: And I shall end with my Prayers to God, that this <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> now made to cast the Bishops and their Votes out of the Parliament, how fit soever it seems, and how much soever it appears to this <hi>Lord</hi> to be for the publick Good, do not turn to the decay of Religion, and the great Damage and Detriment of King and Peers, of Church and State.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> be thanked 'tis in all Points otherwise with You: For <hi>God</hi> hath blessed You with a <hi>Religious</hi> Heart, and not subject to <hi>Change.</hi> And he hath filled You with <hi>Honour</hi> in the Eyes of Your <hi>People:</hi> And by their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Dutifulness</hi> He hath made You safe.

               <p>We have received, and daily do receive from <hi>God,</hi> many and great <hi>Blessings</hi> by <hi>You:</hi> And I hope they are not many that are <hi>unthankful</hi> to <hi>You,</hi> or to <hi>God</hi> for You.

                     <hi>In Jul.</hi> c. 75.</note>) <hi>laceratam existi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationem,</hi> The tearing and rending of their Credit and Reputation, with a gentle, nay, a generous Mind.</p>
               <p>But of all <hi>Libels,</hi> they are most <hi>odius</hi> which pretend <hi>Religion:</hi> As if that of all things did desire to be defended by a <hi>Mouth that is like an open Sepulchre,</hi> or by a Pen that is made of a sick and a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Quill.</p>
               <p>There were Times when <hi>Persecutions</hi> were great in the <hi>Church,</hi> even to exceed <hi>Barbarity</hi> it self: Did any <hi>Martyr</hi> or <hi>Confessor,</hi> in those Times, <hi>Libel</hi> the <hi>Governours?</hi> Surely no; not one of them to my best <hi>Remembrance:</hi> yet these complain of <hi>Persecution</hi> without all shew of cause; and in the mean time <hi>Libel</hi> and Rail without all measure. So little of kin are they to those which <hi>suffer for Christ,</hi> or the least part of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi> It is not every Man's <hi>Spirit</hi> to hold up against the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome</hi> which <hi>Libellers</hi> spit. For S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who was a stout and a worthy <hi>Prelate,</hi> tells us, not that himself, but that a far greater Man than he, that's King <hi>David,</hi> had found out (so it seems in his <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 'twas no matter of ordinary Ability) <hi>Grande inventum,</hi> a great and mighty Invention, how to swallow and put off those bitter <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumilies</hi> of the <hi>Tongue</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">In Apol. <hi>1.</hi> David. <hi>c. 6.</hi>
                  </note>: And those of the <hi>Pen</hi> are no whit less, and spread farther. And it was a great one indeed, and well beseemed the greatness of <hi>David.</hi> But I think it will be far better for me to look upward, and <hi>practise</hi> it, than to look downward, and <hi>discourse</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:54616:138"/>
In the mean time I shall remember what an <hi>Antient,</hi> under the name of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> tells me *, <hi>Indignum est &amp; praeposterum,</hi> 'Tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy <note place="margin">Ad Ocean. de Ferend. Opprob.</note> in it self, and preposterous in demeanour for a Man to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for <hi>doing good,</hi> because other Men glory in <hi>speaking ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I can say it clearly and truly, as in the <hi>presence of God,</hi> I have done nothing, as a <hi>Prelate,</hi> to the uttermost of what I am conscious, but with a <hi>single Heart,</hi> and with a <hi>sincere Intention</hi> for the good <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the maintenance of the <hi>Orthodox Truth</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> professed, established, and maintained in this <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my <hi>Care of this Church,</hi> the reducing of it into <hi>Order,</hi> the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of the <hi>external Worship of God</hi> in it, and the setling of it to the <hi>Rules</hi> of its <hi>first Reformation,</hi> are the <hi>Causes</hi> (and the sole Causes, whatever are pretended) of all this malicious <hi>Storm,</hi> which hath lowred so black <hi>upon me,</hi> and some of <hi>my Brethren.</hi> And in the mean time, they which are the only, or the chief <hi>Innovators</hi> of the <hi>Christian World,</hi> having nothing say, accuse us of <hi>Innovation; They themselves</hi> and their <hi>Complices</hi> in the mean time being the greatest <hi>Innovators</hi> that the <hi>Christian World</hi> hath almost ever known. I deny not but others have spread more dangerous <hi>Errors</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> but no Men, in any Age of it, have been more guilty of <hi>Innovation</hi> then they, while themselves cry out against it: <hi>Quis tulerit Gracchos?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I said well, <hi>Quis tulerit Gracchos?</hi> For 'tis most <hi>apparent</hi> to any Man that will not wink, that the <hi>Intention</hi> of <hi>these Men,</hi> and their <hi>Abettors,</hi> was and is to raise a <hi>Sedition,</hi> being as great <hi>Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries</hi> in the <hi>State</hi> (where they get Power) as they have ever been in the <hi>Church; Novatian</hi> himself hardly greater.</p>
               <p>Our main <hi>Crime</hi> is (would they all speak out, as some of them do) <note place="margin">Burton's <hi>Apol. p.</hi> 110.</note> that we are <hi>Bishops;</hi> were we not so, some of us might be as <hi>passable</hi> as other Men.</p>
               <p>And a great trouble 'tis to them, that we maintain that our <hi>Calling of Bishops</hi> is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> by Divine Right: Of this I have said enough, and in this place, in <hi>Leighton's</hi> Case, nor will I repeat. Only this I will say, and abide by it, that the <hi>Calling of Bishops</hi> is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> by Divine Right, tho' not all <hi>Adjuncts</hi> to their <hi>Calling.</hi> And this I say in as direct <hi>opposition</hi> to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as to the <hi>Puritan Humour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I say farther, that from the <hi>Apostles times,</hi> in all Ages, in all Places, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was governed by <hi>Bishops:</hi> And <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> never heard of, till <hi>Calvin's</hi> new-fangled Device at <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this is made by these Men, as if it were <hi>Contra Regem,</hi> against the King, in Right or in Power.</p>
               <p>But that's a meer <hi>ignorant shift;</hi> for our being <hi>Bishops, Jure Divino,</hi> by Divine Right, takes nothing from the <hi>King's Right or Power over us.</hi> For though our <hi>Office</hi> be from God and Christ <hi>immediately,</hi> yet may we not <hi>exercise</hi> that <hi>Power,</hi> either of <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> but as God hath <hi>appointed</hi> us, that is, not in His <hi>Majesty's,</hi> or any <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King's Kingdoms,</hi> but by and under the Power of the <hi>King</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us so to do.</p>
               <p>And were this a good <hi>Argument</hi> against us, as <hi>Bishops,</hi> it must needs be good against <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> too; for themselves grant that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54616:138"/>
their <hi>Calling</hi> is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> by Divine Right; and yet I hope they will not say, that to be <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> is against the <hi>King,</hi> or any his <hi>Royal Prerogatives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, Suppose our <hi>Callings,</hi> as <hi>Bishops,</hi> could not be made good <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> by Divine Right, yet <hi>Jure Ecclesiastico,</hi> by Ecclesiastical Right, it cannot be denied. And here in <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, both in their Power and Means, by <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi> So that here we stand in as good Case as the present <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi> can make us. And so we must stand till the <hi>Laws</hi> shall be repealed by the same <hi>Power</hi> that made them.</p>
               <p>Now then, <hi>suppose</hi> we had no other string to hold by (I say sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this, but I grant it not) yet no Man can <hi>Libel</hi> against our <hi>Calling</hi> (as these Men do) be it in <hi>Pulpit, Print</hi> or otherwise, but he <hi>Libels</hi> against the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>State,</hi> by whose <hi>Laws</hi> we are establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Therefore, all these <hi>Libels,</hi> so far forth as they are against our <hi>Calling,</hi> are against the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> and can have no other purpose, than to stir up <hi>Sedition</hi> among the People.</p>
               <p>If these Men had any other <hi>Intention,</hi> or if they had any Christian or charitable desire to <hi>reform</hi> any thing amiss; why did they not modestly <hi>Petition his Majesty</hi> about it, that in his <hi>Princely Wisdom</hi> he might set all things right, in a <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Orderly</hi> manner? But this was neither their <hi>Intention</hi> nor <hi>Way.</hi> For one clamours out of his <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and all of them from the <hi>Press,</hi> and in a most virulent and <hi>unchristian</hi> manner set themselves to make a <hi>Heat</hi> among the People; and so by <hi>Mutiny,</hi> to effect that which by Law they cannot; and by most false and unjust <hi>Calumnies</hi> to defame both our <hi>Callings</hi> and <hi>Persons.</hi> But for <hi>my Part,</hi> as I pity their Rage, so I heartily pray <hi>God</hi> to <hi>forgive</hi> their Malice.</p>
               <p>No <hi>Nation</hi> hath ever appeared more jealous of <hi>Religion,</hi> than the People of <hi>England</hi> have ever been. And their <hi>Zeal to God's Glory</hi> hath been, and at this day is a great <hi>honour</hi> to them. But this <hi>Zeal</hi> of theirs, hath not been at all times and in all Persons, alike guided by <hi>knowledge.</hi> Now <hi>Zeal,</hi> as it is of <hi>excellent</hi> use, where it sees its way; so it is very <hi>dangerous</hi> company, where it goes on in the <note n="*" place="margin">You may see it in the Examplé of <hi>S. Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zeal in the darkness of his Vnderstanding, which he then had, made him persecute Christ and his Church, <hi>Act. 22. 3, 4.</hi> And he was very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous company then; for he breath'd out threatnings against the Disciples, <hi>Act. 9. 1.</hi> So true is that of Saint <hi>Greg. Naz. Orat. 21. Zelus Iracundiam acuit:</hi> All Zeal puts an edge to Anger it self: And that must needs be dangerous in the dark.</note> 
                  <hi>dark:</hi> And these Men knowing the <hi>Disposition</hi> of the People, have laboured nothing more, than to misinform their <hi>knowledge,</hi> and misguide their <hi>Zeal,</hi> and so to fire that into a <hi>Sedition,</hi> in hope that they whom they causlesly hate, might miscarry in it.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>main scope of these Libels</hi> is to kindle a <hi>Jealousie</hi> in Mens Minds, that there are some great Plots in Hand, <hi>dangerous Plots</hi> (so <note place="margin">Page <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> says Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> expresly) to change the <hi>Orthodox Religion</hi> established in <hi>England;</hi> and to bring in, <hi>I</hi> know not what, <hi>Romish Superstition</hi> in the room of it. As if the <hi>external decent worship of God</hi> could not be upheld in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> without bringing in of <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now by this <hi>Art</hi> of theirs, give me leave to tell you that the <hi>King</hi> is most desperately abused and wounded in the Minds of his <hi>People,</hi> and the <hi>Prelates</hi> shamefully.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:54616:139"/>
                  <hi>The King most desparately:</hi> For there is not a more cunning trick in the World, to <hi>withdraw</hi> the Peoples Hearts from their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> than to persuade them that he is changing <hi>true Religion,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to bring in gross <hi>Superstition</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aud the Prelates shamefully:</hi> For they are charged to <hi>seduce,</hi> and lay the Plot, and be the <hi>Instruments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For his Majesty first.</hi> This I know, and upon this <hi>occasion</hi> take it my <hi>Duty</hi> to speak: There is no <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Christendom</hi> more sincere in his <hi>Religion,</hi> nor more constant to it, than the <hi>King.</hi> And he gave such a Testimony of this at his being in <hi>Spain,</hi> as I much doubt whether the best of that <hi>Faction</hi> durst have done half so much as his <hi>Majesty</hi> did, in the Face of that <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And this you, my <hi>Lord, the Earl of Holland,</hi> and other Persons of <hi>Honour,</hi> were Eye and Ear Witnesses of, having the happiness to <hi>attend</hi> Him there. And at this day, as his <hi>Majesty</hi> (by <hi>God's</hi> great Blessing both on him and us) <hi>knows</hi> more, so is he more <hi>settled</hi> and more confirmed, both in the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Religion</hi> here established, and in <hi>Resolution</hi> to maintain it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for the Prelates;</hi> I assure my self, they cannot be so base, as to live <hi>Prelates</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and labour to bring in the <hi>Superstitions</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> upon themselves and it. And if any should be so <hi>foul,</hi> I do not only leave him to <hi>God's Judgment,</hi> but (if these <hi>Libellers,</hi> or any other, can <hi>disdover</hi> that his base and <hi>irreligious</hi> falshood) to <hi>shame</hi> also, and severe <hi>Punishment</hi> from the <hi>State:</hi> And in any <hi>just</hi> way, no Man's <hi>Hand</hi> shall be more, or sooner against him, than <hi>mine</hi> shall be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And for my self,</hi> to pass by all the <hi>scandalous reproacbes,</hi> which they have most <hi>injuriously</hi> cast upon me, I shall say this only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I know of no Plot, nor <hi>purpose</hi> of <hi>altering</hi> the <hi>Religion</hi> established.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have ever been far from attempting any thing that may <hi>truly</hi> be said to <hi>tend</hi> that way in the least degree: And to these two, I here offer my <hi>Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the <hi>King</hi> had a mind to change <hi>Religion,</hi> (which I know he hath not, and <hi>God</hi> forbid he should ever have) he must seek for other <hi>Instruments.</hi> For as basely as these Men conceive of me, yet I thank <hi>God,</hi> I know my Duty well, both to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King:</hi> And I know that all the <hi>Duty</hi> I owe to the <hi>King,</hi> is under <hi>God.</hi> And my great happiness it is (though not <hi>mine</hi> alone, but your <hi>Lordships</hi> and all his Subjects with me) that we live under a <hi>Gracious</hi> and a <hi>Religious King,</hi> that will ever give us leave to serve <hi>God</hi> first, and <hi>Him next.</hi> But were the days otherwise, I thank <hi>Christ</hi> for it, I yet <hi>know</hi> not how to serve any Man against the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and I hope I shall never learn it.</p>
               <p>But to return to the business; what is their <hi>Art</hi> to make the World believe a <hi>change of Religion</hi> is endeavoured? What? Why <hi>forsooth,</hi> they say, there are great <hi>Innovations</hi> brought in by the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and such as tend to the advancing of <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> of this may appear, I shall humbly defire your <hi>Lordships</hi> to give me leave to recite briefly all the <hi>Innovations</hi> charged upon us, be they of less or greater <hi>Moment,</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:54616:139"/>
and as briestly to answer them. And then you shall clearly see, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any <hi>cause</hi> hath been given of these unsavory <hi>Libels;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whether there be any shew of <hi>cause</hi> to fear a <hi>change of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And I will take these great pretended <hi>Innovations</hi> in order, as I meet with them.</p>

                     <hi>First,</hi> I begin with the <hi>News from Ipswich.</hi>

                     </note> Innovation is, that the last Years Fast was enjoyned to be without Sermons in <hi>London,</hi> the Suburbs, and other infected Places, contrary to the Orders for other Fasts in former times: Whereas Sermons are the only means to humble Men, &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this I say <hi>First.</hi> That an after-Age may without <hi>Offence,</hi> learn to avoid any visible <hi>Inconvenience</hi> observed in the former. And there was visible <hi>Inconvenience</hi> observed in Mens former flocking to <hi>Sermons</hi> in <hi>Infected Places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This was no particular <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Prelates;</hi> but the business was debated at the <hi>Council-Table,</hi> being a matter of <hi>State,</hi> as well as of <hi>Religion.</hi> And it was concluded for no <hi>Sermons in those Infected Places,</hi> upon this <hi>Reason,</hi> that <hi>Infected Persons</hi> or <hi>Families,</hi> known in their own <hi>Parishes,</hi> might not take occasion upon those <hi>by-days</hi> to run to other <hi>Churches</hi> where they were not known, as many use to do, to hear some <hi>humorons</hi> Men Preach; For on the <hi>Sundays,</hi> when they better kept their own <hi>Churches:</hi> The <hi>Danger</hi> is not so great altogether.</p>
               <p>Nor <hi>Thirdly,</hi> is that true, that <hi>Sermons</hi> are the <hi>Only means</hi> to <hi>humble</hi> Men. For though the <hi>Preaching</hi> of <hi>God's Word,</hi> where it is performed according to his <hi>Ordinance,</hi> be a great means of many good <hi>Effects</hi> in the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men; Yet no <hi>Sermons</hi> are the only <hi>means</hi> to <hi>humble</hi> Men. And some of their <hi>Sermons</hi> are fitter a great deal for other <hi>Operations:</hi> Namely, to stir up <hi>Sedition,</hi> as you may see by Mr. <hi>

               <p>To this I answer <hi>First,</hi> That the appointing of <hi>Wednesday</hi> for the <hi>Fast-day</hi> was no <hi>Innovation.</hi> For it was the <hi>day</hi> in the <hi>last Fast</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this: And I <hi>my self</hi> remember it so, above forty years since more than once.</p>

                     <hi>3.</hi> The Third Innovation <note n="†" place="margin">Page. <hi>3</hi>
                     </note> is, that the Prayer for seasonable weather was purged out of this last Fast-Book, which was <hi>(say they)</hi> one cause of Ship-wrecks and tempestuous weather.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this I say, <hi>First</hi> in the <hi>General;</hi> this <hi>Fast-Book,</hi> and all that have formerly been made, have been both made and published by the command of the <hi>King,</hi> in whose sole Power it is <hi>to call a Fast.</hi> And the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> to whom the ordering of the <hi>Book</hi> is committed, have <hi>power</hi> under the <hi>King,</hi> to <hi>put in,</hi> or <hi>leave out,</hi> whatsoever they think fit for the present <hi>Occasion;</hi> as their <hi>Predecessors</hi> have ever done before them. <hi>Provided</hi> that nothing be In contrary to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this may serve in the <hi>General</hi> for all <hi>Alterations,</hi> in that or any other <hi>Fast-Book,</hi> or Books of Devotion upon any particular Occasions, which may and ought to <hi>vary</hi> with several <hi>times,</hi> and we may, and do, and will <hi>justifie,</hi> under <hi>his Majestys Power,</hi> all such <hi>Alterations</hi> made therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>particular. When</hi> this <hi>last-Book</hi> was set out, the weather was very <hi>seasonable.</hi> And it is not the <hi>custom</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> nor <hi>fit</hi> in it <hi>self</hi> to pray for <hi>seasonable</hi> weather when we <hi>have</hi> it, but when we want it. When the <hi>former Book</hi> was set out, the weather was <hi>extreme ill,</hi> and the Harvest in <hi>Danger;</hi> Now the Harvest was in, and the weather good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> most <hi>inconsequent</hi> to say, that the leaving that Prayer out of the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Devotions,</hi> caused the <hi>Shipwrecks</hi> and the <hi>Tempests</hi> which followed. And as bold they are with <hi>God Almighty,</hi> in saying it was the <hi>cause:</hi> For sure I am, God never told them that was the cause. And if <hi>God</hi> never <hi>revealed</hi> it, they cannot come to know it; yet had the <hi>Bishops</hi> been <hi>Prophets,</hi> and foreseen these <hi>Accidents,</hi> they would certainly have <hi>prayed</hi> against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Had any <hi>Minister</hi> found it <hi>necessary</hi> to use this <hi>Prayer</hi> at any one time during the <hi>Fast,</hi> he might with ease and without Danger, have supplied that want, by using that <hi>Prayer</hi> to the same purpose, which is in the Ordinary <hi>Liturgy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I humbly desire your <hi>Lordships</hi> to weigh well the <hi>Consequence</hi> of this great and dangerous <hi>Innovation.</hi> The Prayer for fair <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was left out of the <hi>Book</hi> for the <hi>Fast;</hi> Therefore the <hi>Prelates</hi> intend to bring in <hi>Popery.</hi> An excellent <hi>Consequence,</hi> were there any shew of Reason in it.</p>

               </q>
               <p>To this I answer <hi>First,</hi> As before; It was <hi>lawful</hi> for us to <hi>alter</hi> what we thought fit.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since that <hi>Collect</hi> made mention of <hi>Preaching,</hi> and the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>State</hi> forbad <hi>Sermons</hi> on the <hi>Fast-days in infected Places,</hi> we thought it fit, in pursuance of that <hi>Order,</hi> to leave out that <hi>Collect.</hi>

                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> The Fifth Innovation <note n="*" place="margin">Page. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> is, That in the sixth Order for the Fast, there is a passage left out concerning the abuse of Fasting in relation to Merit.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this I <hi>answer.</hi> That he to whom the <hi>ordering</hi> of that <hi>Book</hi> to the <hi>Press</hi> was <hi>committed,</hi> did therefore leave it out; because in this <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> there is little Opinion of <hi>Meriting by Fasting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, on the contray, the Contempt and Scorn of all <hi>Fasting</hi> (save what <hi>humorous</hi> Men call for of themselves) is so rank, that it would grieve any <hi>Christian</hi> Man to see the necessary <hi>Orders of the Church concerning Fasting,</hi> both in <hi>Lent</hi> and at other <hi>set times,</hi> so <hi>vilified</hi> as they are.</p>

                     </note> is, That the Lady Elizabeth and her Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely Children are dashed <hi>(that's their phrase)</hi> out of the new Collect, whereas they were in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Collect of the former Book.</p>
               </q>
               <p>For this <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>News</hi> knows full well that they are left out of the <hi>Collect</hi> in the latter <hi>Editions</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer-Book,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Book</hi> for the <hi>Fast.</hi> And this was done according to the <hi>Course</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which <hi>ordinarily names</hi> none in the Prayer <hi>but the Right Line descending.</hi> Yet this was not done till the <hi>King</hi> himself <hi>commanded</hi> it; as I have to shew under <hi>his Majesty's Hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I beseech your <hi>Lordships</hi> to consider, what must be the <hi>Consequence</hi> here: The <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and her <hi>Children</hi> are left out of the <hi>Collect,</hi> therefore the <hi>Prelates</hi> intend to bring in <hi>Popery;</hi> For <hi>that</hi> (you know) they say, <hi>is the end of all these Innovations.</hi> Now if this be the end and the <hi>Consequence,</hi> truly the <hi>Libellers</hi> have done very dutifully to the <hi>King,</hi> to <hi>poyson</hi> his <hi>People</hi> with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; that the <hi>Lady Elizabeth</hi> and her <hi>Children</hi> would keep <hi>Popery</hi> out of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Children</hi> will not. And many as good <hi>Offices</hi> as these have they done the <hi>King</hi> quite thorow these <hi>Libels,</hi> and quite thorow his <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> For <hi>My part, I honour</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and her <hi>Line,</hi> as much as any Man whatsoever, and shall be as ready to <hi>serve them,</hi> but I know not how to depart from my <hi>Allegiance,</hi> as I doubt these Men have done.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> The Seventh Innovation <note n="‖" place="margin">Page. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> is, That these words (who art the Father of thine Elect and of their Seed) are changed in the Preface of that Collect, which is for the Prince and the King's Children. <hi>And with a most spiteful inference,</hi> that this was done by the Prelates to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the King's Children out of the number of God's Elect. <hi>And they call it</hi> an intolerable Impiety and horrid Treason.</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this I answer, <hi>First,</hi> That this <hi>Alteration</hi> was made in my <hi>Predecessor's</hi> time, before I had any <hi>Authority</hi> to meddle with these things farther than I was <hi>called</hi> upon by him</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:54616:141"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is not therefore to lay any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon my <hi>Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor;</hi> for he did in that but his Duty: For his <hi>Majesty</hi> acknowledges it was done by his <hi>special Direction,</hi> as having then no <hi>Children</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> for.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This <hi>Collect</hi> could not be very <hi>old,</hi> for it had no being in the <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> all <hi>Queen Elizabeth's</hi> time, she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no <hi>Issue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Truth is, it was made at the coming in of <hi>King James;</hi> and must of necessity be <hi>changed</hi> over and over again <hi>pro ratione Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum,</hi> as Times and Persons vary. And this is the <hi>Intolerable Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and horrid Treason they charge</hi> upon <hi>Vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this <hi>Method</hi> the <hi>Innovations</hi> are set down in the <hi>News from Ipswich.</hi> But then in Mr. <hi>Burion's News from Friday-street</hi> (called his <hi>Apology</hi>) they are in another Order, and more are added. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with your <hi>Lordship's</hi> leave I will not <hi>repeal</hi> any of these, but go on to the <hi>rest,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> adds.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="8">8. The eighth Innovation <note n="†" place="margin">Burton's Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, pag. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> is, That in the Epistle the Sunday before Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, we have put out <hi>In,</hi> and made it <hi>At</hi> the Name of <hi>Jesus</hi> every knee shall bow; which Alteration, <hi>he saith,</hi> is directly against the Act of Parliament.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here give me leave to tell you, 'tis <hi>At the Name of Jesus,</hi> in the late Learned <hi>Translation</hi> made in <hi>King James</hi> his time. About which many Learned Men of best note in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> were imployed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides some <hi>Prelates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this I Answer: <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> was <hi>confirmed</hi> by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and so all things contained in it, at the passing of that <hi>Act.</hi> But I hope if any thing were false <hi>Printed</hi> then, the <hi>Parliament</hi> did not intend to pass those slips for current.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am not of Opinion, that if one <hi>word</hi> be put in for another, so they bear both the same <hi>Sense,</hi> that there is any great matter done against the <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This can make no <hi>Innovation.</hi> For <hi>In the Name,</hi> and <hi>At the Name of</hi> Jesus, can make no <hi>Essential Difference</hi> here. And Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> (whose <hi>Darling</hi> business it hath long been to <hi>cry</hi> down the <hi>Honour</hi> due to the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> at the <hi>mentioning</hi> of his <hi>saving Name Jesus</hi>) knows the <hi>Grammar Rule</hi> well, <hi>In a Place or at a Place,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If there were any Errour in the change of <hi>In</hi> into <hi>At;</hi> I do here <hi>solemnly protest</hi> to you, I know not how it came: For <hi>authority</hi> from the <hi>Prelates,</hi> the <hi>Printers</hi> had none; and such a word is easily changed in such a <hi>negligent Press</hi> as we have in <hi>England.</hi> Or if any <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi> it purposely, for ought I know, they did it to <hi>gratifie</hi> the <hi>Preciser</hi> sort. For therein they followed the <hi>Geneva Translation,</hi> and Printed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> 1557 <note n="*" place="margin">In Octavo.</note>. where the words are, <hi>At the Name of Jesus.</hi> And that is 94 years ago; and therefore no <hi>Innovation made by us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This I find in the <hi>Queen's Injunctions</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Injunction <hi>52.</hi>
                  </note>, without either word <hi>In</hi> or <hi>At. Whensoever the Name of Jesus shall be in any Lesson, Sermon, or otherwise pronounced in the Church</hi> ('tis injoyned) <hi>that due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be made of all Persons, Young and Old, with lowliness of Coursy and uncovering of the Heads of the Men-kind, as thereunto doth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily belong, and heretofore hath been accustomed.</hi> So here's <hi>necessity</hi> laid upon it, and <hi>custom</hi> for it, and both expressed by <hi>Authority</hi> in the very <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and is therefore no <hi>Innovation now.</hi>

               </q>
               <p>To this I say, <hi>First,</hi> 'Tis a <hi>notorious Vntruth,</hi> that this <hi>Book was ordered to be Read by Act of Parliament.</hi> The <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> indeed is <hi>Printed</hi> before it; and therein is a <hi>Command</hi> for <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings</hi> every <hi>Fifth of November;</hi> but not one Word or Syllable for the <hi>Form of Prayer:</hi> That's left to the <hi>Church;</hi> therefore here's no <hi>Innovation</hi> against that <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Alteration</hi> first mentioned, that is, <hi>That Sect,</hi> or <hi>That Sect of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> if of so small Consequence, as 'tis not worth the speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of: Besides, if there be any thing of moment in it, 'tis answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Both for <hi>that</hi> and the <hi>second place,</hi> which seems of more <hi>moment;</hi> and so for the rest not only in that <hi>Book,</hi> but that other also for His <hi>Majesty's Coronation; His Majesty</hi> expresly commanded <hi>Me</hi> to make the <hi>Alterations,</hi> and see them <hi>Printed.</hi> And here are both the <hi>Books</hi> with His <hi>Majesty's Warrant</hi> to each of them. So that herein I conceive I did not <hi>offend,</hi> unless it were that I gave not these Men <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> of it, or asked them leave to obey the King.</p>
               <p>Against this there can be but two <hi>Objections,</hi> should <hi>Malice</hi> it self go to work. The one is, <hi>That I moved His</hi> Majesty <hi>to command the Change.</hi> And the other, <hi>That now, when I saw my self challeng'd for it, I procured His</hi> Majesty's <hi>Hand for my security.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these I Answer clearly, <hi>First,</hi> That I did not move the <hi>King, directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly,</hi> to make this <hi>Change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That I had His <hi>Majesty's</hi> Hand to the <hi>Book,</hi> not <hi>now,</hi> but <hi>then,</hi> and before ever I caused them to be <hi>Printed;</hi> as now they are. And that both these are <hi>true,</hi> I here again <hi>freely</hi> offer my self to my <hi>Oath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That you may see <hi>His Gracious Majesty</hi> used not his <hi>Power</hi> only in <hi>commanding</hi> this <hi>Change;</hi> but his <hi>Wisdom</hi> also; I shall adventure to give you my <hi>Reasons,</hi> such as they are, why this <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> was most <hi>fit,</hi> if not <hi>necessary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My <hi>first Reason</hi> is, In the <hi>Litany</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. his time <note n="*" place="margin">It was put into the Litany of <hi>Hen. VIII.'s</hi> time, as appears in his Primer, with his Injunction before it.</note>: and also under <hi>Edward</hi> VI. <note n="†" place="margin">And 'tis in both the Service Books of <hi>Edw. VI.</hi> both that which was Printed <hi>1549,</hi> and in that which was after, <hi>Anno 1552.</hi>
                  </note> there was this <hi>Clause: From the Tyranny of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and all his detestable Enormities, from all false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Good Lord deliver us.</hi> But in the <hi>Litany</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time this <hi>Clause</hi> about the <hi>Pope</hi> was left out, and it seems of <hi>purpose,</hi> for avoiding of <hi>Scandal:</hi> And yet the <hi>Prelates</hi> for that not accounted <hi>Innovators,</hi> or <hi>Introducers</hi> of <hi>Popery.</hi> Now 'tis a far greater <hi>Scandal</hi> to call their <hi>Religion Rebellion,</hi> than 'tis to call thir chief <hi>Bishop Tyrant.</hi>

               <p>My <hi>second Reason</hi> is, That the <hi>Learned</hi> make but <hi>Three Religions</hi> to have been of old in the World, <hi>Paganisns, Judaism,</hi> and <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> And now they have added a <hi>Fourth,</hi> which is <hi>Turcism,</hi> and is an absurd <hi>mixture</hi> of the other Three.

               <p>My <hi>third Reason</hi> is, Because if you make their <hi>Religion</hi> to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> then you make their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> to be all <hi>one.</hi> And that is against the <hi>ground</hi> both of <hi>State</hi> and the <hi>Law.</hi> For when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Romish Priests</hi> and <hi>Jesaits</hi> have deservedly suffered <hi>Death</hi> for <hi>Treason,</hi> is it not the constant and just Profession of the <hi>State,</hi> that they never put any Man to <hi>Death</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> but for <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Treason</hi> only? Doth not the <hi>State</hi> truly <hi>affirm,</hi> That there was never any <hi>Law</hi> made against the <hi>Life</hi> of a <hi>Papist, quatenus</hi> a <hi>Papist</hi> only? And is not all this stark <hi>false,</hi> if their very <hi>Religion</hi> be <hi>Rebellion?</hi> For if their <hi>Religion</hi> be <hi>Rebellion,</hi> it is not only <hi>false,</hi> but <hi>impossible,</hi> that the <hi>same Man</hi> in the <hi>same Act</hi> should suffer for his <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and not for his <hi>Religion.</hi>

               <p>Therefore even according to the <hi>Service-Book</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> both are call'd upon, for <hi>external</hi> and <hi>bodily Reverence</hi> and <hi>Worship</hi> of GOD in his <hi>Church.</hi> Therefore they which do it, do not <hi>Innovate.</hi> And yet the <hi>Government</hi> is so <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> (<hi>God</hi> grant it be not too <hi>loose</hi> therewhile) that no Man is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained,</hi> no Man <hi>questioned,</hi> only <hi>religiously</hi> called upon, <hi>Venite, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remus, Come, let us Worship.</hi>

               <p>And you my <hi>Honourable Lords</hi> of the <hi>Garter,</hi> in your great <hi>Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> you do your <hi>Reverence,</hi> and to <hi>Almighty God,</hi> I doubt not, but yet it is <hi>versus Altare,</hi> towards his <hi>Altar,</hi> as the greatest <hi>place</hi> of God's <hi>Residence</hi> upon Earth.

               </q>
               <p>To this I Answer, That 'tis no <hi>Popery</hi> to set a <hi>Rail</hi> to keep <hi>Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from that <hi>Holy Table;</hi> nor is it any <hi>Innovation</hi> to place it at the <hi>upper end</hi> of the <hi>Chancel</hi> as the <hi>Altar</hi> stood. And this appears both by the <hi>Practice,</hi> and by the <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <hi>First,</hi> By the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For in the <hi>King's Royal Chapels,</hi> and <hi>divers Cathedrals,</hi> the <hi>Holy Table</hi> hath ever since the <hi>Reformation</hi> stood at the <hi>upper end</hi> of the <hi>Quire,</hi> with the <hi>large</hi> or <hi>full side</hi> towards the People.</p>
               <p>And though it stood in most <hi>Parish Churches</hi> the <hi>other way,</hi> yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not more reason, the <hi>Parish Churches</hi> should be made <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable</hi> to the <hi>Cathedral</hi> and <hi>Mother Churches,</hi> than the <hi>Cathedrals</hi> to them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

off the <hi>Indifferency</hi> of the standing of the <hi>Holy Table</hi> either way, but only by laying it fairly before Men, how fit it is there should be <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Vniformity;</hi> I say still reserving the <hi>Indifferency</hi> of the standing.</p>
               <p>But howsoever I would fain know, how any <hi>discreet moderate</hi> Man dares say, that the placing of the <hi>Holy Table Altar-wise</hi> (since they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And there to set it otherwise, is to set it <hi>cross</hi> the place, <hi>not In</hi> the place where the <hi>Altar</hi> stood: and so, <hi>Stulti dum vit ant vitia</hi> — weak Men, as these <hi>Libellers</hi> are, run into one <hi>Superstition</hi> while they would avoid another; For they run upon the <hi>Superstition</hi> of the <hi>Cross.</hi> while they seek to avoid the <hi>Superstition</hi> of the <hi>Altar.</hi> So you see here's neither <hi>Popery</hi> nor <hi>Innovation</hi> in all the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> or since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These</hi> words of the <hi>Injunction</hi> are so plain, as that they can admit of no <hi>shift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And give me leave to tell you, That a very learned <hi>Prelate</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> whom <hi>I think</hi> these Men will not <hi>accuse,</hi> as a Man like to <hi>advance or usher in Popery,</hi> is of the same <hi>Opinion:</hi> 'Tis my <hi>Lord</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some difference was lately rising about placing the <hi>Communion-Table in a Parish Church</hi> of his <hi>Diocese.</hi> The <hi>Bishop,</hi> careful to prevent all <hi>Disorder,</hi> sends his <hi>Injunction</hi> under his <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> to the <hi>Curate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">May 17. 1637.</note> and <hi>Church-Wardens,</hi> to <hi>settle that</hi> business: In which he hath these <hi>two</hi> Passages <hi>remarkable.</hi> I have <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>read</hi> the <hi>Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first Passage</hi> is this; <hi>By the Injunction of Queen</hi> Elizabeth (saith he) <hi>and by</hi> Can. 82. <hi>under King</hi> James, <hi>the Communion Tables should ordinarily be set and stand with the side to the East Wall of the Chancel.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Prelates, to justifie their Proceedings, have forged a new Article of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, brought from</hi> Rome (<hi>which gives them full power to alter the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline of our Church at a Blow</hi> (as they interpret it) <hi>and have foisted it</hi> (such is their Language) <hi>into the beginning of the 20th Article of our Church. And this is in the last Edition of the Articles,</hi> Anno 1628. <hi>in affront of His Majesty's Declaration before them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The <hi>Clause</hi> (which they they say is <hi>forged</hi> by us) is this, <hi>The Church</hi> (that is, <hi>the Bishops,</hi> as they expound it) <hi>hath Power to Decree Rites and Ceremonies, and Authority in matter of Faith.</hi> (The word is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> by their leave.) <hi>This Clause</hi> (say they) <hi>is a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery fit to be Examined, and deeply Censured in the</hi> Star-Chamber. <hi>For 'tis not to be found in the</hi> Latin <hi>or</hi> English <hi>Articles of</hi> Edward VI. <hi>or</hi> Queen Elizabeth, <hi>ratified by Parliament.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is a <hi>heavy Charge, my Lords;</hi> but I thank <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Answer's</hi> easie.</p>
               <p>And <hi>truly</hi> I grant, that to <hi>Forge</hi> an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>whole</hi> or in <hi>part,</hi> and then to <hi>thrust</hi> it upon the <hi>Church,</hi> is a most <hi>hainous Crime,</hi> far worse than the <hi>Forging of a Deed.</hi> And is certainly <hi>very deeply Censurable</hi> in this <hi>Court.</hi> And I would have humbly besought you, that a <hi>deep Censure</hi> might have been laid upon <hi>it,</hi> but that this <hi>Sheet</hi> was found after, and so is not annext to the <hi>Information,</hi> nor in <hi>Judgment</hi> at this <hi>present</hi> before you.</p>
               <p>But then, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I must tell you, I hope to make it as <hi>clear</hi> as the <hi>Day,</hi> that this <hi>Forgery</hi> was not, <hi>that</hi> this <hi>Clause</hi> mentioned was added by the <hi>Prelates</hi> to the <hi>Article,</hi> to gain <hi>Power</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and so to serve <hi>our turns.</hi> But that that <hi>Clause</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Article</hi> was by these Men, or at least by some of their <hi>Faction, rased out,</hi> and this to weaken the just Power of the <hi>Church</hi> to serve <hi>their turns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They say (to justifie their <hi>Charge</hi>) that this <hi>Clause</hi> is not to be found in the <hi>Articles, English</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> of either <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. or Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer: The <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. and those made under Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> differ very much. And those of <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. are not now binding. So whether the <hi>Clause</hi> be <hi>In</hi> or <hi>Out</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> 'tis not much <hi>material.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> made in the <hi>Queen's</hi> time, and now in <hi>force,</hi> that this <hi>Clause</hi> for the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Ceremonies, and to have Authority in Controversies of Faith,</hi> should not be found in <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Latin Copies</hi> till the <hi>Year</hi> 1628. that it was set forth with the <hi>King's Declaration</hi> before it, is to me a <hi>Miracle;</hi> but <hi>your Lordships</hi> shall see the <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Boldness</hi> of these Men.</p>

What? <hi>Is this</hi> Affirmative Clause <hi>in no</hi> Copy, English <hi>or</hi> Latin <hi>till the</hi> Year <hi>1628?</hi> Strange: <hi>Why, my</hi> Lords, <hi>I have a</hi> Copy <hi>of the</hi> Articles <hi>in</hi> English <hi>of the</hi> Year <hi>1612, and of the</hi> Year <hi>1605, and of the</hi> Year <hi>1593, and in</hi> Latin <hi>of the</hi> Year <hi>1563, which was one of the</hi> first Printed Copies, <hi>if not the</hi> first of all. <hi>For the Articles were</hi> agreed <hi>on but the</hi> Nine and twentieth day of January <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>And in all these, this <hi>Affirmative Clause</hi> for the Churches Power is in. And is not this strange <hi>boldness</hi> then to <hi>abuse</hi> the World, and falsely to say 'tis in no <hi>Copy</hi> when <hi>I my self,</hi> out of my own <hi>store</hi> am able to shew it into so <hi>many,</hi> and so <hi>antiently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>My Lord's,</hi> I shall make it plainer yet: For 'tis not fit concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and an <hi>Article</hi> of such <hi>Consequence</hi> for the <hi>Order, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> you should <hi>rely</hi> upon my <hi>Copys,</hi> be they never so <hi>many</hi> or never so <hi>ancient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I sent to the <hi>Publick Records</hi> in my <hi>Office,</hi> and here under my <hi>Officers</hi> Hand, who is a <hi>Publick Notary,</hi> is returned me the <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Article</hi> with this <hi>Affirmative Clause</hi> in it. And there is also the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Articles</hi> to be seen.</p>
               <p>By this your <hi>Lordships</hi> see how free the <hi>Prelates</hi> are from <hi>Forging</hi> this part of the <hi>Article.</hi> Now let these Men quit themselves and their <hi>Faction,</hi> as they can, for their <hi>Index Expurgatorins</hi> and their foul <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> in leaving out this <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Article.</hi> For to <hi>leave out</hi> of an <hi>Article</hi> is as great a <hi>Crime</hi> as to <hi>put in;</hi> And a <hi>Main Rasure</hi> is as <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable</hi> in this <hi>Court</hi> as a <hi>Forgery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, <hi>But then my</hi> Lords; <hi>what is this</hi> Mystery of Iniquity?</p>
               <p>Truly, I cannot certainly tell, but as far as I can I'll tell you.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Articles</hi> you see were <hi>fully,</hi> and <hi>fairly</hi> agreed to and <hi>subscribed</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1563. But after this, in the <hi>Year</hi> 1571, there were some that <hi>refused to subscribe,</hi> but why they did so, is not <hi>recorded.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were about this <hi>Article</hi> or any other I know not. But in Fact this is Manifest, that in that <hi>Year</hi> 1571, the <hi>Articles</hi> were <hi>Printed</hi> both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> and this <hi>Clause</hi> for the <hi>Church</hi> left out of both. And certainly, this could not be done, but by the <hi>malicious cunning</hi> of that <hi>Opposite Faction.</hi> And though I shall spare <hi>dead</hi> Men's <hi>Names</hi> where I have not <hi>certainty;</hi> Yet if you be <hi>pleased to look back</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> who they were that <hi>Governed</hi> businesses in 1571, and <hi>rid</hi> the Church almost at their <hi>pleasure;</hi> And how <hi>potent</hi> the <hi>Ancestors,</hi> these <hi>Libellers</hi> began <hi>then</hi> to <hi>grow,</hi> you will think it no <hi>hard</hi> matter to have the <hi>Articles Printed,</hi> and <hi>this Clause left out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet 'tis plain, That, after the stir about <hi>Subscription</hi> in the <hi>Year</hi> 1571, the <hi>Articles</hi> were <hi>setled</hi> and <hi>subscribed</hi> unto at last, as in the <hi>Year</hi> 1562, with this <hi>Clause</hi> in them for the Church: For looking far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the <hi>Records</hi> which are in <hi>mine own</hi> Hands, I have found the <hi>Book</hi> of 1563 subscribed by <hi>all the Lower House of Convocation,</hi> in this very <hi>Year</hi> of <hi>Contradiction,</hi> 1571, Dr. <hi>John Elmar</hi> (who was after <hi>Lord Bishop of London</hi>) being there <hi>Prolocutor: Alexander Nowel Dean of</hi> St. <hi>Paul's,</hi> having been <hi>Prolocutor</hi> in 1563, and yet living and present and subscribing in 1571. Therefore, I do here openly in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> charge upon that <hi>pure Sect</hi> this <hi>foul Corruption</hi> of <hi>falsifying the Articles</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> let them take it off as they can.</p>
               <p>I have now done, and 'tis time I should, with the <hi>Innovations</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Prelates,</hi> and fit to be answered here.</p>

Some few more there are, but they belong to matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which shall presently be answered, <hi>Justo Volumine,</hi> at large, to <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> all <hi>Well-Minded</hi> People. But when Mr. <hi>Burton's Book</hi> which is the <hi>Main one, is answered</hi> (I mean his <hi>Book</hi> no this <hi>Railing</hi>) neither <hi>Prynn,</hi> nor <hi>Bastwick;</hi> nor any <hi>Attendants</hi> upon <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> shall <hi>by me</hi> or <hi>my care</hi> be <hi>answered.</hi> If this <hi>Court</hi> find not a way to <hi>stop</hi> these <hi>Libellers Mouths</hi> and <hi>Pens,</hi> for <hi>me</hi> they shall <hi>rail</hi> on till they be <hi>weary.</hi>

               <p>Yet <hi>one</hi> thing more, I beseech <hi>you,</hi> give <hi>me</hi> leave to <hi>add.</hi> 'Tis Mr. <hi>Burton's Charge</hi>

                  </note> upon the <hi>Prelates. That the Censures formerly laid upon Malefactors, are now put upon God's Ministers for their Vertue and Piety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>heavy charge</hi> this too. But if he or <hi>any Man</hi> else can <hi>shew</hi> that any Man hath been <hi>punished</hi> in the <hi>High Commission,</hi> or elsewhere, by the <hi>Prelates,</hi> for <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> there is all the Reason in the World <hi>we</hi> should be <hi>severely punished</hi> our selves. But the Truth is, the <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> for which these <hi>Ministers</hi> are <hi>punished,</hi> is for Preaching <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> many of their <hi>Sermons</hi> being as bad as their <hi>Libels,</hi> As <hi>Burton's Libell</hi> was one of his <hi>Sermons</hi> first. But whether this stuff have any <hi>Affinity</hi> with <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> I submit to any <hi>Christian Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> is so <hi>confident</hi> of his <hi>Innocency,</hi> even in <hi>this Cause</hi> wherein he hath so <hi>fouly</hi> carryed himself, that he breaks forth into these words, <note n="*" place="margin">Page <hi>7.</hi>
