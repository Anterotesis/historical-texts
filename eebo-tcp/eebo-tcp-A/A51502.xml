            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot more effectually enforce the Moral of this Piece which exposes the Frailty of a VVarrior, than by prefixing to it the Name of one who with the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Gallantry of <hi>Mars</hi> has no allay of his Vices: And as among the few living Exemplars of such unsul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied Vertue I know none more universally, nor more justly allow'd than your self, I must appeal from your Sentence to all the world, should your Favorite Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty byass you to condemn the Necessity of this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress. While so many of our Youth are neglectful of their Ancestors Glory and their own, and indeed of every Thing but Effeminacy or Libertinism, 'tis fit we shou'd set before their Eyes not only the Deformities with which they are familiar, but the Beauties to which they are Strangers, that they may at once be sham'd into a Loathing of the one, and charm'd into an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the other. This wou'd require a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick rather than an Epistle, if studied Ornaments, often injurious to prevailing Charms, were not as prejudicial
<pb facs="tcp:62097:3"/>
to convincing Truth, which is most engaging in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Nakedness, at which it needs not blush, since it never fell like man To those that know you, your Name alone will imply more than the best Oratory could display, and even an imperfect account of your Excellencies will seem almost incredible to others. You set out so soon and so vigorously for the Race of Glory, that in your early Morn we see you gain the Prize. Thus even at those years when others of your Birth and Fortune made no other use of the opportunities they had to improve their minds but to impair 'em, the general ill Example could not affect you, unless it were with Compassion; you despis'd their false Pleasures for the chast Love of that <hi>Celestial</hi> that <hi>Alma Venus</hi> of <hi>your own</hi> Lucretius, and that sublime Truth of your admir'd <hi>Malebranche.</hi> You even then reapt the Muses Laurels, as now you do those of <hi>Mars,</hi> while your brave Father in the New-world was gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Name that spreads over the old, as yours now flys from the one to the other. The World with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment saw you arise in full Glory, and reconcile Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thought almost incompatible; at once a nice and impartial Critic, yet a polite and excellent Master of Fancy; a Man of Wit and Conversation, yet a Respecter of sacred things; a Courtier, yet the best of Friends; a forward Soldier, yet a good Officer; and in short a profound Scholar, yet a fine Gentleman. Such partly <hi>Caesar</hi> was; thus he exerted the Writer and the Hero; but with this difference, he fought to enslave his Country, you to free Yours: and 't was but just that as your Studies have advanc'd you to an honourable Post among the Learned, so your Courage shou'd give you one among the Brave, that you might be at once a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Honor to either Station; the more, as you seek
<pb facs="tcp:62097:3"/>
no other Benefit from both, but that of doing the more good to men of both Professions. For, far from being like those whose Pleasures engross their Youth and Wealth, you cannot be happy with yours, unless it makes others so; and I could instance some whose needy Modesty has found it self unexpectedly reliev'd by you, without being expos'd to any other Blushes than what so surprizing a Generosity could raise. I know Sir, you would have your Bounty conceal'd; but pardon me if I sav, 'tis too often imploy'd, not to be discover'd; besides it acts in so obliging a manner, that 'tis a pain to a grateful Spirit to conceal it; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he foregoes the Pride which waited on his Want, to own favours that humble him, if it can hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man to be reliev'd by you: For my part, I am so far from thinking that possible, that I have long been ambitious of having this opportunity of owning my self,</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis Musical Play or Masque was written to be inserted into a very short Farce written by Mr. <hi>Ravenscroft,</hi> called <hi>The Anatomist, or the Sham Doctor;</hi> without any other Expectation than that of being serviceable to my Friend. For I am too well acquainted with that way of Writing, and my own Incapacity, to aim at Reputation by it. The Rhimer here must sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that to the Musician, or rather to the Audience's Ear, if there be any Reputation to be challeng'd from Trifles of this Nature. I chose a subject never manag'd in a Dramatic way before; tho gallantly handled by <hi>Ovid,</hi> from whom I borrow'd it, as I have a couple of Songs from my self, formerly inserted elsewhere. I was prevailed witk to bring in a Song and Dance of <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> tho I knew there is one in <hi>Psyche,</hi> borrowed almost verbatim from <hi>Moliere</hi>'s, as he borrow'd his from an old <hi>Italian</hi> Opera called <hi>Le Nozze de gli Dei;</hi> but mine is wholly different, which was more difficult than to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented another. Whatever the Critics may think of the Lines, if any will honor them so far as to find fault with 'em, I dare assure, from the little judgment I have, and much more from the general approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the best Iudges, there has not been more agreeable, nor more masterly Music perform'd upon our Stage. The two great Composers having, as it were, nobly strove to outdo one another, and thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd even themselves.</p>
            <p>By reason of the Symphonies and Repetitions some Lines are left out in the Singing, which may easily be known by the Marks prefix'd, and past over, when the Music is performing.</p>

               <l>And your worst Mimick calls himself an Actor.</l>
               <l>So your dull Scribbler (to our Cost we know it)</l>
               <l>Writes a damn'd Play, and is misnam'd a Poet.</l>
               <l>Once Song and Dance cou'd buoy up want of Thinking,</l>

               <l>Plays grow so heavy, that those helps are vain;</l>
               <l>Three times they rise, and never rise again.</l>

               <l>Why, 'tis an Op'ra but to dress a Beau.</l>
               <l>But one unlucky diff'rence stands between;</l>
               <l>Op'ra's are paid, but Beaux pay to be seen,</l>

               <l>For your own sakes, we beg Applause of you;</l>

               <l>From those who to dissect it Yonder stay;</l>
               <l>Like Surgeons on an Execution day.</l>

               <l>The fear of this our trembling Scribbler kills;</l>
               <l>I dare say they've no need to take my Pills.</l>

               <l>Or else, egad, few Plays or Wives will live.</l>
               <l>Ev'n he, methinks, too late his wrath did smother,</l>
               <l>Here, Wives and Husbands keep not such a pother,</l>
               <l>But fairly strive t' out-Cuckold one another.</l>
