            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOME Weekes ago, the Houſe of Dr. <hi>Sloan</hi> near <hi>Bloomsbury-Square,</hi> was attempted to be Broke open by ſeveral Notorious Perſons; which to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, they got over into a back Yeard adjoyning to the Fields, but having ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times Endeavoured without ſucceſs to force the Doors open (they being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bolted and Secured within) the ſaid Villains, by the Inſtigation of the Devil, Immediatly fix'd upon this Deſperate, Terible, and Diſmal Reſolution, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſet the Houſe on Fire in ſeveral places, and by this violent method, to amaze the Family to that degree, as to open the Doors; and then under pretence of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſtance, they were to ruſh in and Robb the Houſe; but Bleſſed be God they are prevented tho having cut ſeveral Splinters off the Door of the Houſe of Office, and ſet Fire to them under the Window, and Back Door of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which being of thin and dry Deal-Boards, burnt with great Violence, and had anſwered their wicked Deſigns, if Providence had ſo Ordered the matter, that the Lady was awake, who ſmelling the Scent of the Fire, could not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till the Servants were call'd up, upon which one of them going Down Stairs, and Opening the Pantry-Door was almoſt Chok'd, with the Violence of the Smoke and Flame, which by this time, had got great Advantage, whereupon being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, he Cry'd out Fire, and their upon Alarm'd the whole Family, who by the help of ſeveral Tubbs of Water, which were happily brought in over Night in order to waſh their Linnen (the Fire tho very Violent) was in a ſhort time Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; during this amazing Diſorder 3 or 4 Men were obſerved by ſome of the Neighbours, to ſtand liſtening in the back Yard to make their Enterance, as ſoon as the Door was opened; but ſeeing their Deſign were Fruſtrated, they Sheer'd off with all the haiſt Imaginable, and ſo made their Eſcapes: And tho in order to their being Diſcovered, Dr. <hi>Sloans</hi> offered a Reward of 100 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> to any Perſon that would Apprehend either of them, yet they remain'd Undiſcovered till laſt Week, at which time as if the Almighty was more than ordinary offended with ſuch an abominable undertaking, they were Diſcovered, and taken after a ſtrange manner, <hi>viz.</hi> one of them being Surprized in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for a Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Crime and ſent to the <hi>Gate-Houſe,</hi> he there in Order to get his Diſcharge, Diſcovered the aforeſaid Villany, by whoſe Directions <hi>John Davis,</hi> and <hi>Phillip Wake,</hi> were taken into Cuſtody, and Carried before the <hi>Recorder,</hi> who Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them both to <hi>Newgate,</hi> on <hi>Saturday</hi> laſt.</p>
