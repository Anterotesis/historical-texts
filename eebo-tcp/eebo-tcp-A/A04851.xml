            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> artificial fireworkes, he confounded many of
them by their owne skil, and brought their intended
mischeefes vpon their owne heads.</p>
            <p>Now (according to my text) <hi>come and behold the
works of the Lord, what desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he hath wrought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth:</hi> shal J saie he causeth warrs to cease? Or
breaketh the bow? It was far worse. For at that very
time when they said of our soules, <hi>There is noe help for
them in their God, there there thus would wee haue it,</hi>
their stratageme being as ripe as the mellowest som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
fruit, there wanting nothing in the world but the
last hand to act it, at that very time (that God maie be
al in al, and that the honour may be wholy his without
anie thought of copartnership) were al these machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of theirs desolated, discomfited, and defeated:
And notwithstanding their vowed and dejerated se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie,
their <hi>threefold bond</hi> of keeping counsaile, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
oath, sacrament, <hi>[You shal sweare by the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and the holie sacrament, that neither directly nor
indirectlie, by word nor circumstance &amp;c]</hi> Yet was their
worke of darknes discouered, their Troian horse of the
most barbarous villanie that euer eare hard opened,
their Labyrint, their dungeon, their hel of secresy, yea
the deep and vnsearchable hell of their harts <hi>(who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
find them out</hi> saith the Prophet?) eviscerated, ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sacked,
and manifested to the light of the world.</p>
            <p>Then were we as men that drempt, when the Lord
waked ouer vs, wee sat vnder our vines and suspected
nothing, peace, peace, and al is wel, the noise of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones

            <p>I knowe you haue long looked for an end. Much
speaking is wearines to the flesh, and long hearing is
offense to patience. Wil you heare the end of al? Thus
began, thus endeth my text. <hi>The Lord of hostes is with
vs</hi> that <hi>Dominus virtutum,</hi> with and for whome the
starres in their courses fight.
<q>—Et coniurati veniunt in praelia venti,</q>
the winds and waues fight, and <hi>pugnat orbis terrarum,</hi>
al the creatures in the world fight to take vengance of
his enimies; himselfe fighteth for vs: &amp; <hi>Deus IACOBI</hi>
(of whom I trust he hath sworne by his holinesse, that
hee wil neuer faile him, and hath made an euerlasting
couenant with him and his seed, his image our hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Prince, and his whole happie race <hi>(si custodierint,</hi>

<hi>this God of Iacob is our defense.</hi>
