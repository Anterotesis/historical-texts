            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

to the word of God; prophane ſcandalous and ignorant Miniſters may be outed, men approved for godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and gifts may be incouraged in preaching the Goſpel, and ſuch convenient maintenance provided for
them as the Parliament ſhall thinke fit, and that the unequall troubleſome and contentious way of maintaining
Miniſters by Tythes, may with all convenient ſpeed be taken away, reſpect being therein had to other mens
rights.</p>
            <p n="3">II. That ſpeedy and effectuall courſe may be taken for the regulation of the Law, both in the matter, forme, and adminiſtration of
it, in all particulars wherein it is unjuſt, unreaſonable needleſly vexatious, grievous or burthenſome to the people. To which
purpoſe, that the ſeverall Reſults agreed on by the Committee appointed thereunto, may be ſpeedily, taken into debate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
in Parliament; and what ſhall be found to make for ſuch regulation may be ſpeedily enacted; And that the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee

diſaffected perſons in all places of Authoritie and publique Truſt, may from time to time be removed; And the beſt proviſion

good men that the Magiſtracy and ſuch as have publique Truſt, ſhould be men of truth, fearing God, and hating covetouſneſſe.</p>
            <p n="5">IV. That foraſmuch as there are divers oppreſſion and abuſes in the mannaging and collecting the Excize, you will authorize and
impower a Committee in each County to heare and redreſſe the ſame, or to take ſuch other effectuall courſe therein, as to you
ſhall ſeeme fit.</p>
            <p n="6">V. That ſuch as have freely lent upon the publique faith, or deeply ſuffered for their conſtant good affections to the publique, may
be conſidered, and a way found out to give them juſt and competent ſatisfaction, and firſt the poorer ſort, who cannot ſubſiſt
without it; And this to be chiefly regarded before any more of the publique revenue be given to particular perſons.</p>
            <p n="7">VI. That ſome effectuall Proviſion may be made for ſtating the Accompts of the Arrears of ſuch Officers and Souldiers, as have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſerved the Parliament, who were not compriſed within the ſecurity of the late Kings Lands, and have not by any Action of
theirs juſtly forfeited the ſame. And that they or their Aſſigns may be ſatisfied out of the Lands that are or may be confiſcated
either in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> except ſuch of them as are maimed, and the Widdowes and Orphans of ſuch of them as have
been ſlain in the Service, or are dead, whoſe Arrears we deſire may be ſatisfied in <hi>England,</hi> except they ſhall deſire it in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or
<hi>Scotland.</hi> And further, That conſideration may be had of making effectuall (to the competent and comfortable reliefe of Maimed
Souldiers, and the Widdowes and Children of ſuch who have been ſlain or dyed in the Service) all ſuch Acts of Parliament as
have been made to that purpoſe, by a further Act and Acts, as the Parliament ſhall think fit; through the want whereof, many
have been, and are ready to periſh, eſpecially in the Countreyes.</p>
            <p n="8">VII. That all Articles of War given to the Enemy, may be made good, according to the intent of them.</p>
            <p n="9">VIII. That the whole Revenue and Treaſure of the Common-wealth may with all convenient ſpeed be brought into one Publick
Treaſury, and be received, iſſued, and mannaged (for the Publique Service) by a competent number of honeſt and able perſons,
to be appointed and Authorized thereunto (ſuch as may attend the ſame) together with ſuch Clerks as the Parliament ſhall
think fit; and that theſe may have alſo power to call to Account all that are Accountable for any Publick moneyes received by
them. And that for the future all Receipts and Diſburſments out of the Publick Revennue or Treaſury, may be Publiſhed year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or halfe yearly, for the ſatisfaction of the Nation.</p>
            <p n="10">IX. That in regard of the preſent great Affairs of Parliament, a Committee of honeſt and well-affected perſons without the Houſe,

of places of profit, unneceſſary places, and large Sallaries, and to offer the ſame to the Parliament for redreſſe to be made
therein.</p>
            <p n="11">X. That conſideration may be had of a through and effectuall ſuppreſſing of all Vagabonds and common Beggers, by ſetting on work

denyed the ſame within ſeverall Corporations.</p>
            <p n="13">XII. That for Publique ſatisfaction of the good People of this Nation, ſpeedy conſideration may be had of ſuch Quallifications
for future and ſucceſſive Parliaments, as tend to the Election only of ſuch as are pious and faithfull to the intereſt of the Common-wealth,
