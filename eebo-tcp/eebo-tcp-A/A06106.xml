            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For the which I deſire no more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage and protection, then the truth of the ſeuerall points contayned therein doe deſerue.

to ſift euery ſentence, and to find a knot in a bull-ruſh: but my ſhelter is the buckler of truth, and the brazen wal of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; with which being armed, I hope, through Gods aide, that I ſhall be as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and able to entertayne the re-encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if any aſſault be made, as I was willing to giue this on-ſet: I confeſſe that theſe are not the tithe of the arguments, that might be produced againſt the Romiſh religion, yet I doubt not, but that euen theſe few may ſerue, both to diſcouer the falſhood thereof, and to confirme and ſtrengthen thoſe that ſtagger, and are weake in the truth: the Lord accompanying theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours of his ſeruant with his bleſſing, as I hope, and pray that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do.

Hence it is (as by lamentable experience it is found true) among thoſe that are deuoted to this Religion, they ſinne freely, that they may confeſſe and be abſolued; and when they haue confeſſed they ſinne againe, that they may confeſſe againe, making no conſcience how they liue all the yeare, and what horrible ſinnes they commit, being perſwaded that at Eaſter, by the ſhriuing of a Prieſt, they are cleane abſolued.

The courſe of nature in man-kind is like the ſource of a running ſtreame, which by no dammes, nor artificiall barres can bee ſtopped, but it will runne either the naturall courſe in the channell, or ſome other by-paſſage, and that the more it is ſtopped, the more violently it rageth, except the fountaine and ſpring be dryed vp.

The <hi>Iewes</hi> Religion is oppoſite to Chriſt in two reſpects principally: firſt, in retaining the old Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, which<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.

               <p n="3">3. Now compare the Romiſh Religion with theſe Rabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſticall conceits in both reſpects, and it will appeare that one egge is not liker to another, nor milke to milke, then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and Iewiſh ſuperſtition are to each other. And touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">I.</note> the firſt, to begin with the multitude of their ceremonies: It is not vnknowne to any that know any thing in the booke of God, that the Church of the Iewes was loaden with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie burden of ceremonies. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that it was <hi>ſo heauie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 15. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that neither they nor their fathers were able to beare it,</hi> and therefore calleth the Ceremoniall law, a <hi>yoke of bondage,</hi> and<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1. and 4. 31.</note> thoſe that were vnder that yoke, <hi>children of the bondwoman, and not of the free.</hi> And the reaſons why God did impoſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them ſuch a number of Ceremonies, were iuſt and holy, to wit: firſt, becauſe the Church was then in the infancy, and therefore needed to be vnder a Schoolemaſter to inſtruct,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24.</note> and as it were catechize it vnto Chriſt, and therefore they were to be dealt withall, as children vſe to be with the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded leaues and faire pictures of externall rites, and to be fed with milke, being not able to digeſt ſtrong meates. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe by them they were, as it were by viſible repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations informed, both touching ſome great beneſit paſt and receiued, and touching the Meſſias to come and his Kingdome, as alſo concerning godly conuerſation required in their owne life: for in the barke of euery legall ceremonie, theſe three vitall ſpirits were contained. And thirdly (as it is
<pb n="06" facs="tcp:1727:39"/>
well obſerued by S. <hi>Chryſostome</hi>) in regard of their infirmity<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> and weakeneſſe, who being lately come out of Egypt, and there defiled themſelues with idolatrie and ſuperſtition, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required ſacrifices and ceremonies to be allowed vnto them, leſt they ſhould fall backe againe to their Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian corruption: wherefore Almighty God (ſaith he) ſo dealt with them, as a Phyſician dealeth with his ſicke patient, who through the burning heat of his diſeaſe, requireth a cup of cold water, or elſe is ready to hang or kill himſelfe; there the Phyſician being conſtrained by neceſſity, commands a viole of cold water prepared by himſelfe, to be brought vnto him, but withall warnes him, that he drinke not but out of that Viole. So God granted ſacrifices and ceremonies to the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iſraelites, but ſo, that they ſhould not vſe any, but thoſe which hee appointed for them, and that after the manner by him preſcribed. And this to be ſo, hee proueth, becauſe the law of ceremonies was not giuen, vntill the children of Iſrael had defiled themſelues with the golden Calfe, for the making whereof they were ſo madde bent, as that they pulled off their Iewels, eare-rings, and rings from their bodies, and gaue them for the framing of that Idoll: and hee illuſtrateth the ſame in another place by another excellent ſimilitude. If a man (ſaith hee) haue a wife prone to incontinencie, hee ſhutteth her vp in certaine places &amp; chambers, ſetting about her a guard of ſeruants and attendants, to keepe her from ſtraying abroad, and entertaining her louers. So God dealt with the Church of the Iewes, which he had married to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in compaſſion and loue, ſeeing it prone to Idolatry and ſuperſtition, hee ſeparated it from other Nations, and ſhut it vp within the bounds of the land of Canaan, and ſet about it a guard of Ceremonies and externall Rites, which ſhould be as it were Tutors vnto it, vntill it were fully confirmed in faith and obedience. Thus farre <hi>Chryſostome.</hi> By all which wee ſee not onely, that the Church of the Iewes was loaded with a bundle of ceremonies, which were to endure till the comming of the Meſſias: but alſo the reaſons why the Lord impoſed that burden vpon them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1727:39"/>4. Now is the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> any whit behinde them in this? No verily, but farre before them: for if we ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Moſes Leuiticus,</hi> with the Romiſh Miſſals, wee ſhall finde, that in number of ceremonies they farre exceede the Synagogue of the Iewes. The Iewes had but two great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> haue ſeuen. The Iewes but one ordinary Altar: the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> tenne thouſand, euen as many as Churches, and not onely ſo, but often diuers Altars in one Church. The Iewes offered many ſacrifices, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> exceede them in the number of their Maſſes tenne to one. The Iewiſh Holy-dayes were few in compariſon of the Romiſh, for they had but their Paſſeouer, Pentecoſt, feaſt of Tabernacles, of Trumpets, reconciliation, new Moones, Purim and dedication: but theſe haue their Holy-dayes for euery Saint, for the Croſſe, <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> All Saints, All Soules, and what not: inſomuch that their friend <hi>Eraſmus</hi> complaineth, that in <hi>Ieromes</hi> age there were<note place="margin">Eraſ. in Mat. 11.</note> few Holy-dayes beſides the Lords day: but now, that there is neither end nor meaſure in the multitude of them. The Iewes obſerued a few faſting dayes by Gods appointment, and others taken vp by their owne tradition, as the ſecond and fift day of the weeke: but the Romiſh faſts exceede both in number and ſuperſtition: for beſides two dayes in euery weeke, euery Saints Eue almoſt is a faſting day with them, beſides their Lent faſt continued whole ſixe weekes without intermiſſion, if to abſtaine from fleſh, and glut themſelues with other viands, as nutritiue to the body, be to be termed a faſt. The Iewes Prieſt-hood was diſtinguiſhed but into two maine orders, Prieſts and Leuites, and theſe later aſſigned to ſome few diſtinct offices about the Temple: but the Romiſh Prieſt-hood is peſtered with a ſwarme of the ſeuerall orders of Friars, Monkes, Anchorites, ſecular and regular Prieſts, that almoſt ſerue for nothing but to conſume the fruits of the earth. The holy garments for the Leuiticall Prieſt-hood, were but few in number in compariſon of the Romiſh veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: for the high Prieſt of the Iewes had but ſixe garments appointed to him; the Ephod, the breſt-plate, the Robe, the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1727:40"/>
linnen coate, the girdle, and the crowne; and for the inferiour Prieſts, but foure, linnen coats, bonnets, linnen breeches, and girdles: but the Romiſh haue ſixe garments in token of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and the Biſhops nine, becauſe there are (as they ſay)<note place="margin">Bonau. ratio.

And thus they are not onely equall to them, but farre exceed them in the number of their Ceremonies.

And what is the night, but the darke ſhadow of the earth, and the day, but the remouing of that ſhadow by the comming of the Sunne? The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then being thus enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and compaſſed about with the ſuperſtitious ſhadowes of Iewiſh ceremonies, plainly declareth, that either the Sunne is not riſen amongſt them, or that it is very farre off, euen in the skirts of their Horizon. Secondly, that their Church is not as they bragge of it, the onely Catholick Church, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whore of Babilon, for her attire bewrayeth her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: a chaſt Matrone is attired decently, but not gariſhly, but a ſtrumpet like <hi>Iezabel,</hi> ſets forth her ſelfe with gariſh deckings, and a painted face to allure louers vnto her: the Romiſh congregation then being thus adorned, not like a chaſt Matrone, but like a light Harlot, with the gariſh attire of Iewiſh ceremonies, all in pompe and oſtentation, diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her ſelfe not to be the Spouſe of Chriſt, but the ſtrumpet of Antichriſt. And ſo I conclude the firſt part of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſeeing one piece of the Iewes enmitie to Chriſt, conſiſteth in retayning the Leuiticall ceremonies, which had their accompliſhment in Chriſt: therefore to imitate them in this reſpect, is a plaine demonſtration, that their Religion is not from Chriſt, but from Antichriſt, his profeſt enemie.</p>

Thirdly and laſtly, that this firſt grace which they ſay, doth work with free-will, in the firſt act of our new birth, and help &amp; aſſiſt it, is not intrinſicall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, but barely outward &amp; prouocant. In reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Coster</hi> compareth grace <hi>to a ſtaffe in a mans hand, which at his owne will he either vſeth for his helpe, or throweth away; and to a friend, who finding a man in a deepe pit, perſwadeth him by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reaſons to be willing to be pulled out.</hi> And in expreſſe words the ſame Ieſuite ſaith, that <hi>this grace is onely the impulſion and motion of the holy Ghoſt, being yet without, and ſtanding knocking at the doore of our heart, not being as yet let in.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> auoucheth the ſame, when hee ſaith, that it is but onely <hi>a perſwading, which doth not determine the will, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth it in manner of a propounding obiect.</hi> And thus vnder colour of the name of grace, they inſinuate into mens ſoules the poyſon of their doctrine, attributing in word all to grace, when indeede they meane nothing leſſe.</p>

Theſe things being thus diſcouered, let vs now come to ſee, how by this doctrine the glory of God is defaced: which that it may more clearely appeare, two grounds are to be laid:<note place="margin">Eſay 48. 11. &amp; 42. 8.</note> the firſt whereof is, that God is ſo iealous of his glory, that he
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1727:56"/>
cannot endure any copartner or ſharer with him therein. The ſecond is, that in caſes where grace &amp; nature ſeeme to worke together, the godlieſt courſe is to magnifie the grace of God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 7.</note> and to debaſe the nature of man, yea, to aſcribe all to grace, and nothing to nature, becauſe this ſauours of humility, whereas the contrary hath a manifeſt taſte of pride. Theſe grounds being ſetled in our mindes, let vs come to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their doctrine. And I pray you, touching the firſt ground, doth not this doctrine of theirs make man to part ſtakes with God? In his glory, whereas our doctrine doth aſcribe all the glory in ſolid, and whole to God onely: let any man iudge whether aſcribe more glory vnto God, wee, that affirme that God is all in all to the effecting of our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or they that ſay, that our will doth cooperate with his grace, or elſe it can doe nothing: we that ſay, that we are ſtarke dead to Godward, till God put life into vs by his ſpirit; or they that ſay, wee are but ſicke and halfe dead, and are but onely helped and aſſiſted by his ſpirit: wee that teach, that a man can no more prepare himſelfe to his owne iuſtification, then a dead man to life, or they that teach; wee may by our naturall powers either merit of congruity, or prepare our ſelues to our iuſtification. Laſtly, wee that aſcribe the whole worke of our ſaluation to God onely, or they that attribute ſome part thereof to their owne free-will. If this bee not to derogate from Gods glory, what can be? for apparently they ſhare the great and glorious worke of our regeneration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, grace and nature.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Would it not (thinke you) be a great impeachment to Gods glory, if in the worke of our creation any ſhould teach that God alone did not create vs, but that we our ſelues were coadiutors with him: ſo in the worke of regeneration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a ſecond creation to attribute part to Gods ſpirit, and part to free-will, is it not a great blemiſh to the glory of God? for, either it muſt be ſaid, that God could not doe it of himſelfe alone, or that he would not: If the firſt, then they blaſpheme in derogating from his power: if the ſecond, then they dote in ſaying, God is not willing to maintaine his owne glory,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1727:56"/>
or that he is willing to impart it vnto others, contrary to his owne word and will reuealed in the Scripture, which way ſo euer they turne themſelues, they fall into the pit of impiety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make themſelues guilty of high treaſon againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſtie.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Againe, when our Sauiour raiſed vp <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the graue, where he lay ſtinking foure dayes, if it bee true which ſome write, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> life was ſtil remaining in him, and that his ſoule and body was not parted, and ſo our bleſſed Sauiour did but excite and ſtirre vp that life, which was as it were aſleepe, and did not inſpire into him a new life, and couple together his ſoule and body againe being deuided, is not the glory of this miracle mightily darkened and extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? This is our very caſe, wee ſay that a man is ſtarke dead and buried in the graue of ſinne, and till a new life of grace be inſpired into his ſoule, he cannot moue the leaſt haires bredth to heauen-ward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our aduerſaries ſay, that he is not dead, but maymed and wounded like the man, that betwixt <hi>Iericho</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> fell among theeues; and therefore needes not to be reuiued, but onely to be healed and helped with the oyle and wine of grace powred into his wounds, he himſelfe coopera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with his owne free will: who ſeeth not that by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ours, God is more glorified, and by theirs more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed? for the leſſe and eaſier the worke is, the leſſe is alſo the glory of the worke-man, and the greater and harder the worke, the greater his glory: but it is a leſſe worke to heale a man wounded, then to raiſe a man dead, and therefore leſſe glory aſcendeth vnto God by their doctrine, then by ours. But what doe I ſay leſſe? when indeed to giue any part of the Creators glory to the creature, is vtterly to take all from the Creator: for hee will haue all or none, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> notably<note place="margin">Tertul. aduerſ. haereſ.</note> obſerueth, when he ſaith, <hi>That true faith requireth this in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the true God, that whatſoeuer is his, we make it onely his, for ſo ſhall it bee accounted his, if it bee accounted onely his,</hi> by which rule, the faith of the Romane Church cannot bee the true faith.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And againe, according to the ſecond ground, if to

giue all the glory to God, and none to our ſelues, ſauour of humility, but to deuide ſtakes betwixt God and our ſelues, hath a taſte of pride: then it muſt needs follow, that God is more honoured by the one then by the other, becauſe by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility God is honoured, and by pride diſhonoured: and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that hee reſisteth the proud, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth</hi>

All which kinde of ſpeeches, as they are full of pride and fleſhly vanity, ſo they are ſtuffed with impiety and blaſphemie, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly tend to the diſpoyling of the diuine Maieſtie of that glory, which is onely due vnto him. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with two notable ſayings, one of S. <hi>Augustines,</hi> and another of <hi>Caſſander,</hi> a learned Reconciliater of late time; <hi>Tutiores viuimus</hi> (ſaith the Father) <hi>ſi totum Deo damus, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt. de bono Perſeuer. c. 6.</note> that is, <hi>We liue more ſafely if we attribute all wholy to God, and not commit our ſelues partly to God, and partly to our ſelues.</hi> And <hi>this is the part of a godly minded man</hi> (ſaith the Reconciliater) <hi>to attribute nothing to themſelues, but all to Gods grace: whence</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caſſand. conſult. de lib. arbitr.</note> 
                  <hi>it followeth, that how much ſo euer a man giueth to grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet in ſo doing, hee departeth not from pietie, though hee detract ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from nature and freewill: but when any thing is taken from Gods grace, and giuen to nature, which belongeth to grace, that</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1727:57"/>
                  <hi>cannot be without eminent danger.</hi> So that by the confeſſion both of this learned Romaniſt, and alſo of that reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, our doctrine in the poynt of free-will, is both more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to piety, and reſpectiue to Gods glory, then theirs is; and therefore in reaſon to be preferred before it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The next doctrine whereby the glorie of God is dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,<note place="margin">2.</note> and the dignitie of Chriſts merites blemiſhed, is their doctrine of Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which I ioyne next vnto Free-wil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ſophiſtry &amp; cunning in this great &amp; maine pillar of Religion cannot well be diſcerned (they ſo palliate the matter with faire gloſſes &amp; goodly words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) except their opinion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the power of Free-will be firſt apprehended. And here, before I enter into the bowels of this poynt, it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that moſt of them vaunt and bragge that they doe much more magnifie Chriſts merites by their doctrine of Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then we doe: which, how true it is, the diſcourſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (I hope) ſhall ſo manifeſt, that euery indifferent man ſhall be able to ſay truely of them, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid of the Donatiſts, <hi>Theſe are the words of men, extolling the glory</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. cont. lit. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. li. 2. ca. 84.</note> 
                  <hi>of man, vnder the name of Chriſt, to the abaſing of the glory of Chriſt himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. The doctrine therfore of our Church touching the iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a ſinner, is in effect thus much. That a ſinner is iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that is accepted into the fauour and loue of God, not by any thing in himſelfe, or from himſelfe, but by the perfect and vnſpotted righteouſnes of Chriſt Ieſus, imputed vnto him by the meere mercy of God, through the couenant of grace, and apprehended on his behalfe by the hand of faith. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe that which muſt ſatisfie Gods iuſtice, and reconcile a ſinner vnto him, muſt haue theſe two properties; firſt, it muſt be of infinite weight and value, to counterpoyſe with the rigour of Gods iuſtice: and ſecondly, it muſt be of ſufficient ability to performefull and perfect obedience to the law of God; ſo that a perfect ſatisfaction bee made both in reſpect of the obedience which the law requireth, and alſo of the puniſhment that it inflicteth. Now, no righteouſneſſe of man is thus qualified, but is both imperfect and vnſufficient;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1727:58"/>
no, not the righteouſnes of Angels themſelues, being, though excellent, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="15">15. From this it appeareth, that when we ſay that a man is iuſtified by faith, our meaning is not, that faith is the cauſe of our iuſtification, but onely the inſtrument and hand to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that righteouſnes of Chriſt whereby we are iuſtified: &amp; when we ſay, <hi>faith alone iust fieth;</hi> we meane that it alone is the inſtrument of our iuſtification, becauſe it alone layeth hold vpon the righteouſnes of Chriſt, and applyeth it to our ſelues: not that it is euer alone, but alwaies accompanyed with charity and patience, and zeale, and temperance, and other fruites of the ſpirit: for we hold, that the true iuſtifying faith is euer m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In a word, In the act of iuſtification, wee ſay that workes haue no roome, becauſe both they are imperfect, and alſo are not done by our own ſtrength; but being once iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we muſt needs repent, and become new creatures, walking not according to the fleſh, but according to the Spirit. And this is the doctrine of our Church concerning Iuſtification.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Now let vs heare what they ſay, and then weigh both doctrines in the ballance of the ſanctuary, that wee

Concerning the firſt iuſtification, ſome of them affirme, that it is the free gift of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by no precedent workes; others that it is merited by congruity, but not by condignity: but of the ſecond, they<note place="margin">

               <p n="17">17. Wherein let vs obſerue three maine and fundamentall differences, betwixt their doctrine and ours; in all which they raze the foundation, and dedignifie the merits of Chriſt, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1727:59"/>
the mercy of God, to extoll the dignitie of man. The firſt in their preparations, wee hold that a man cannot any wayes diſpoſe himſelfe vnto grace, but is wholly fitted and prepared by God; and that thoſe acts of preparation (as they call them) are not fore-runners of iuſtification, but rather fruites and effects thereof, they teach the contrary, as I haue ſhewed. The ſecond difference is, that the workes of a man iuſtified do not merit increaſe of grace, which they terme the ſecond iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but as the beginning of grace is from gods mercy alone, ſo the increaſe and augmentation thereof and perſeuerance therein, is onely to be aſcribed to the worke of Gods ſpirit, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>He that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>this good worke in you, will performe it vntill the day of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> this we hold, they the contrary. The third diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in the formall cauſe of our iuſtification, which they maintaine to be an inherent righteouſnes within vs, euen the righteouſnes of Sanctification. We on the other ſide affirme, that the formall cauſe of our iuſtification, is the righteouſnes of Chriſt Ieſus, not dwelling in vs, nor proceeding from vs, but imputed vnto vs by the mercy of God.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Hauing thus layd open both our doctrines, let vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and trye which of them giueth moſt glory vnto God, and moſt exalts the merites of Chriſt, for that muſt needs be the truth; and which lifteth vp higheſt the proud nature of man, for that muſt needs be falſhood and errour: eſpecially, ſeeing that Gods dignity, and the dignity of man; Chriſts merits and mans, are as it were, two skales of a ballance, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reof the one riſing, the other falls, the one lifted vp, the other is preſſed downe. Firſt therefore, touching the workes of preparation, whether doe they more magnifie Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that ſay a man cannot prepare and diſpoſe himſelfe at all to grace, but is wholly diſpoſed and prepared by God; or they that affirme that a man can prepare himſelfe by his owne endeuour, aſſiſted outwardly with the grace of God? the one makes Gods mercy the ſole cauſe of iuſtification, the other but the adi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vant and helping cauſe. And whether doe they aduance moſt the dignity of man, that ſay, that a man can do
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1727:59"/>
nothing of himſelfe for his owne iuſtification, or they that ſay that a man can doe ſomething to the preparation of himſelfe to that great worke; the one attributeth ſome dignity to man, the other, none at all; we affirme the one part, the Romaniſts the contrary: and therefore our doctrine tends more to the debaſing of mans worth, and conſequently to the exalting of Gods glory, then theirs doth.</p>
               <p n="19">19. True it is, like Ferrimen, that looke Eaſt and go Weſt, they with their great Grand-father <hi>Pelagius,</hi> talke of grace, when they meane nothing but nature, and ſo deny indeede that which they affirme in word, if the matter bee examined according to truth. For <hi>Pelagius</hi> confeſſed a neceſſity of grace<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. cont. Pelag. &amp; Celeſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 31. 33.</note> in all ſpirituall actions, and yet was condemned for an enemy to grace, by the Church of God, becauſe hee vnderſtood not by grace the ſanctifying worke of Gods ſpirit, but an outward moouing and perſwading power, aſſiſting mans free-will to the effecting of his owne ſaluation. The very ſame is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Romaniſts, as hath beene declared, and therefore wee may iuſtly condemne them as enemies to the grace of God, whatſoeuer they bragge and vaunt to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Secondly, touching the ſecond iuſtification, which ſtandeth, as they ſay, in the augmentation and encreaſe of our iuſtice: let the moſt partiall Reader iudge, whether tends moſt to the magnifying of Gods glory, their doctrine which teacheth that wee merite the encreaſe of our iuſtice by our owne workes: or ours, which teacheth, that both the ſeed and the growth, both the roote and the fruite, both the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and encreaſe of all righteouſneſſe, is the worke of Gods ſpirit alone, preuenting, aſſiſting, and vpholding vs to the end; and that theſe ſeuerall workes of grace are beſtowed vpon vs, not for any merites of our owne, but ſimply and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely for the merits of Chriſt Ieſus. I, but they will ſay, works doe not merit iuſtification, becauſe they are ours, but becauſe they are works of grace, which grace floweth from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Chriſts merits, and ſo they attribute aſmuch, or more, to grace and Chriſts merites, then wee doe. To which I anſwere, two things: firſt, if they held that theſe workes

Now if it were of infinite valew, then it made the full and perfect purchaſe it ſelfe: and if it made the full purchaſe, then he need not giue ſtrength to our righteouſnes to doe the ſame. Thus either the one or the other muſt needes be falſe, except we will haue a double purchaſe of one and the ſame thing, and a double ſatisfaction of the ſame debt, which is in no caſe agreeable to the iuſtice of God. Laſtly, they ſhew their arrogancie, in that they ſcorne to receiue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, as an almes and free gift from God of his mere mercy towards them: but they will haue it like ſturdy and proud companions, as a due vnto their deſerts, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to their ſeruice: nay, they will not haue it from<note place="margin">Bel. de purgat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lib. 1. cap. 14.</note> Chriſts purchaſe alone, but they will bee ioyned purchaſers with him, or elſe they will haue none of it: then which, what can be greater arrogancie? And thus by this vaine vaunt they fall into diuers palpable abſurdities, and plainely diſcouer, that it cannot any way be auoyded, but that by their doctrine of iuſtification, they doe exalt the dignity of man, and pull downe the glory of Chriſt our Sauiour.</p>

The third doctrine whereby they derogate from Gods<note place="margin">3.</note> glory, is their monſter of merit, which I put in the next place, becauſe it iſſueth from the two former, as the Progenitours thereof, the doctrine of iuſtification by inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being as it were the mother of it, and that of free-will the Grand-mother: and ſo it cannot be, the fountaine being poyſoned, but that the waters ſtreaming there-from, muſt needes be infected: and becauſe <hi>malum creſcit eundo,</hi> an euill groweth worſe by propagation, and the daughter commonly exceedeth the mother in naughtineſſe, therefore this doctrine is firre more blaſphemous, then either of the former, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth them, both in derogating from Gods glory, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp mans dignity againſt God.

               <p n="25">25. Their doctrine touching the merite of workes, is in briefe this, that there is ſuch a dignity, excellency, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the workes of the Regenerate, that by the rule of iuſtice they doe not onely deſerue temporall and ſpirituall bleſſings here in this world, but alſo eternall life and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting bliſſe in the world to come. In which doctrine, theſe three poynts are to be conſidered: firſt, that they make the good workes of the faithfull abſolutely and perfectly good,<note place="margin">Bell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de iuſt. li. 4. cap. 16.</note> able to ſtand out with the iuſtice of God, and anſwere the full rigour of the Law: ſecondly, they make them proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the reward, for betwixt <hi>meritum</hi> and <hi>debitum,</hi> properly taken, as they doe, there is alwaies a Geometricall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and thirdly, they place this meritorious dignitie in the worke done, as it is a worke, and that not paſſiuely, as it is wrought in vs by grace, but actiuely as it worketh by free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, as hath beene ſhewed.</p>

we are enabled to merit; and partly by vertue of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, whereby hee hath engaged himſelfe to crowne thoſe merits with glory, which he hath wrought in vs by grace: to which double obiection I returne this double anſwere. Firſt, if all good workes iſſue from the roote of grace, as they doe indeede, then how can we merit thereby, ſeeing that which doth merit, muſt bee our owne, and not anothers, eſpecially his of whom we looke to merit? (So ſaith <hi>Hilary</hi>) <hi>it is for him</hi>

               <p n="31">31. Secondly, I anſwere, that when God doth promiſe to reward our workes with eternall life, eternall life is due to vs,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1727:65"/>
but not for our workes ſake, but for his promiſe ſake: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are due by promiſe, which haue no reference to any deſert. As if the King ſhould promiſe one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants a thouſand pound of his mere liberality, for keeping a Hawke, he is bound to pay him ſo much: but is it from the ſeruants deſert, or from the Kings bounty? So God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth eternall life to our workes, and by reaſon of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, wee may challenge it as our due, but yet it is not for our worke, but for his word ſake, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, when he ſaith: <hi>God is become a debter, not by receiuing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de verbis Apoſtol. ſer. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>any thing from vs, but by promiſing what it pleaſed him:</hi> therfore a reward giuen by promiſe, is ſo far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> importing deſert, that it rather ouerthroweth the very foundation thereof, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a worke of mercy: as the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith in another place: <hi>The promiſe is ſure, not according to our merits, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy.</hi> The doctrine of merit then vndermineth the mercy of God, which way ſo euer they turne themſelues, whether to grace, as the cauſe of the worke, or to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as the cauſe of the reward.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Againe, by this doctrine, not onely the mercy of God is darkened, but alſo the merits of Chriſt quite euacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made of no force: for if Chriſts merits were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, what neede there then any ſupply of our owne: if our owne merits be neceſſarily required, then Chriſts merits were not ſufficient. If Chriſts merits were perfect, then mans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits cannot be added vnto them, for that is perfect, to which nothing can be added: but if mans merits muſt bee added to them, then it followeth, that Chriſts were not perfect; and ſo no merits at all: for this property is required in a merit, that it bee perfect: and ſo either they muſt denie the neceſſity of our meriting, or confeſſe the vnſufficiencie of Chriſt: either they muſt acknowledge Chriſts merits to be vnperfect, or ours to be vnneceſſarie, yea none at all. I but (they will ſay) Chriſt did not onely merit the pardon of our ſinnes, but alſo that our workes ſhould be meritorious of life euerlaſting: and by this (ſat they) are Chriſts merits more magnified then by vs, becauſe the greater the gift is, the greater is the glory of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1727:65"/>
the giuer: ſo that our meriting doth not argue any want in his merits, but rather proue a greater efficacie to be in them: for to this end will hee haue vs to merit, partly that we may ſhew our ſelues like vnto him, and partly to traine vs vp in good workes by this ſpurre. All theſe are but ſhifts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede mere cauils, for firſt, to ſay, that Chriſt did not alone merit for vs eternall life, but alſo grace, that ſo we might me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit eternall life for our ſelues: what is it, but to make vs our owne Sauiours; for all our merits come from grace and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will ioyned together, as hath beene ſhewne, and grace is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with them, except free-will concurre with it: for they teach, that we may receiue it if we will, and when we haue it, we may merit, if we will, eternall life, or elſe goe without it. What is this (I ſay) but to affirme, that a man is not ſaued by Chriſts merits, but that by the helpe of grace hee doth ſaue himſelfe by his owne merits? and ſo they ſhoue Chriſt out of his office, and put themſelues in his roome.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Secondly, I anſwere, that the efficacie of Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is greater in purchaſing eternall life for vs by himſelfe alone, then in giuing vs ableneſſe to merit it for our ſelues; becauſe it is a greater glory, and a token of greater power, to effect a thing immediatly without meanes, then by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation or vſurpation of any meanes whatſoeuer. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, all the honour is to the worker, in the later there muſt needes be ſome glory aſcribed to the meanes, and ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer attributed vnto them: and therefore to ſay, that Chriſt hath onely merited by himſelfe without vs eternall life for vs, is to giue the entire and perfect glory vnto him, and none vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelues: and to affirme, that hee merited to make our workes meritorious, is to derogate from his glory, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the efficacie of his death and paſſion.</p>
               <p n="34">34. And here we may ſee the vanity of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who to proue, that by this doctrine of theirs, they aſcribe<note place="margin">Bel.

                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:1727:66"/>
                  <hi>doe all theſe things by himſelfe without them, but rather of his omnipotencie, in that hee was not onely able to doe theſe things himſelfe, but alſo to giue power to thoſe creatures to doe them: ſo it is an argument of greater power in Christs merits, to giue ſtrength to our workes to merit heauen, then if hee did it for vs without our workes.</hi> I, but by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> leaue (that I may ſpeake with all humble reuerence to the diuine Maieſtie) the power of God had beene more manifeſt, and his omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie more conſpicuous (I doe not ſay had beene greater) if he ſhould doe theſe things immediatly by himſelfe, then it is by the glaſſe of the creatures. As when the Lord came downe in perſon vpon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and gaue the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the law from his owne mouth, his glory was more famous and fearefull, then when hee ſent it them after by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though written with his owne finger, as the other was ſpoken with his owne mouth. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. that the people were ſo aſtoniſhed at Gods voyce, that they deſired, that hee would ſpeake no more vnto them in his owne perſon, but by his ſeruant <hi>Moſes.</hi> Adde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, that God in his wiſedome ordayned thoſe creatures to that end and purpoſe, and therefore we muſt not diſpute (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth) whether it ſhould haue beene a greater to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his omnipotencie, if hee had, or if hee had not created them; but humbly ſubmit our ſelues to his wiſedome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that his thoughts are not like ours, nor his counſels like ours,</hi>

workes, but that is not by encreaſing, but by publiſhing and proclaiming of his glory: but the Romaniſts ſay, that the glory of Chriſts merits is augmented by our merits, which muſt needes be a moſt blaſphemous ſpeech. In a word, ſeeing we doe not finde in Scripture, that Chriſt died to giue merit to our workes; but to purchaſe pardon to our ſinnes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine life for vs; wee muſt bee content to thinke that this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth moſt for his glorie, and that the contrarie is derogatory thereunto.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Laſtly, where did we euer read, that wee muſt be like vnto Chriſt in meriting? we read, that wee muſt bee holy as he is holy, and humble and meeke as hee was humble and meeke, and patient as he was patient; to wit, in quality, not in quantity, in imitation, not in perfection: but to merit as he did, is no where to be found: nay, it is a thing impoſſible, for it is an infinite and omnipotent worke of righteouſneſſe, that can deſerue any thing at the infinite iuſtice of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God, and it muſt bee of infinite valew, that can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that infinite reward. And therefore it was neceſſarie, that he which ſhould be our Redeemer, ſhould alſo be God, becauſe neither Angell nor Archangell, nor any creature elſe could performe a worke of that price, which might be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to merit the kingdome of heauen. It is therefore a moſt groſſe blaſphemie, to ſay, that we muſt be like vnto Chriſt in the point of meriting: for it maketh euery man a <hi>Ieſus,</hi> that is, a Sauiour and Redeemer to himſelfe.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1727:67"/>
and Chriſts defaced, mans merits lifted vp, and Chriſts pulled downe, which cannot ſtand with the truth and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The fourth doctrine which tendeth directly to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor<note place="margin">4.</note> of God, &amp; the abaſing of Chriſts glory in the worke of our redemption, is their paradox of humane ſatisfactions: by which they teach, that Chriſt by his death hath made ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the guilt of our ſinnes, and the eternall puniſhment due vnto them, but wee our ſelues muſt ſatisfie the iuſtice of God, for the temporall puniſhment either in earth or in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: whereas we on the contrary teach and beleeue, that by Chriſts death and paſſion, a perfect and all-ſufficient ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is made to the iuſtice of God, for all the ſinnes of men, and for all the puniſhment thereof, both eternall and temporall. As for our doings or ſufferings, we acknowledge the one to be ſabordinately required as fruites of our faith, and the other neceſſary to be ſuſtained as meanes of our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. And touching offences againſt our brethren, we hold it neceſſary that we make ſatisfaction to ſuch whom we haue wronged any wayes, either by confeſſion, reſtitution, or puniſhment, as the caſe ſhall require; yea, wee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that a Canonicall or Eccleſiaſticall ſatisfaction is to be made to the Church, or any part thereof, when as we haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen iuſt ſcandall and offence there vnto. But in all theſe wee denie, that there is any vertue or power to expiate our ſinnes, or to make ſatisfaction to God for the puniſhment thereof, either temporall or eternall; that to do, is only proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Croſſe of Chriſt: for as the diſobedience of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brought vpon vs not onely eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but alſo temporall; ſo the obedience and merit of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> hath made ſatisfaction to God for both.</p>

And to the purpoſe, firſt, the very nature of ſatisfaction, which as they affirme, is the yeelding of a ſufficient recompence to God for a treſpaſſe committed, is inough to prooue that their doctrine tends to the ſingular impeachment of the Croſſe of Chriſt: for if Chriſt hath made a full and perfect ſatisfaction vpon the Croſſe, as without all doubt he did, he himſelfe conteſting in that his laſt ſpeech, <hi>It is finiſhed;</hi> then what neede any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of humane ſatisfactions? If there be ſuch a neceſſity of humane ſatisfactions, as they make, then Chriſts ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction muſt needs be imperfect, and ſo no ſatisfaction at all: for an imperfect ſatisfaction is no ſatisfaction, as the very word it ſelfe implyeth, importing a ſufficient recompence to be made to the party offended: And if it be perfect, it muſt be full and abſolute, that is, ſuch as needeth nothing elſe to be added vnto it. But they require ſomething to be added to Chriſts ſatisfaction; and therefore muſt needs hold that it is not a full, perfect, and abſolute ſatisfaction: for it implyeth a manifeſt contradiction to affirme any thing to be a full and perfect cauſe of it ſelfe alone, and yet to adde another to it, as a ioynt cauſe to produce the ſame effect.</p>
               <p n="40">40. But they will anſwere, that mans ſatisfaction is not to ſupply the want of Chriſts, but to apply it vnto vs, and to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his will and ordinance: for Chriſts ſatisfaction (ſay they)<note place="margin">Coſt.

And here obſerue the contrariety of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſpeech to another ſaying of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>Christ</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> (ſaith Saint <hi>Bernard) hath a double right vnto the kingdome of heauen, one by inheritance, as he is the Sonne of God, another by purchaſe, as he bought it by his death, the firſt he keepeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, this latter he imparts to his members.</hi> This by S. <hi>Bernards</hi> Diuinitie is all the right that a faithfull man hath to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, by Chriſts purchaſe: and vpon this onely doth that good man, and all other of Gods children relie: but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> giueth him another title, to wit, by purchaſe of his owne merits, which as it is a ſtraine of his owne wit: ſo let him keepe it to himſelfe, and make merry with it, for wee will haue nothing to doe with it.</p>
               <p n="41">41. As for that which they ſay, that our ſatisfactions ſerue not to ſupply the want, but to apply the efficacie of Chriſts vnto vs, is a more ridiculous and ſhifting deuice then the other: for firſt, how can that be, when as ſinne is firſt pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which is by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt? and then long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter commeth our ſatisfaction, if not in this life, yet ſure in Purgatorie. The applying of a thing, is a preſent act, ariſing betwixt the agent and the patient, therefore if our ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doe apply Chriſts vnto our ſoules, then it followeth, that Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for our ſinnes, till wee haue ſatisfied for the temporall puniſhment of them, which is flat contrarie to their owne principles. Secondly, that which applieth, hath relation to that which is applied, as to the obiect: but our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction hath no relation to Chriſts ſatisfaction, as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, but is onely referred to the temporall puniſhment, and to the iuſtice of God, as they affirme, therefore it cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it vnto vs. And laſtly, how diſſonant is it vnto reaſon, that a ſatisfaction ſhould apply a ſatisfaction, as if one medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1727:69"/>
ſhould apply another to the patient. It is the hand that applieth the medicine, and not another medicine: ſo it is faith that applieth Chriſts ſatisfaction vnto our ſinnes, and not our ſatisfaction. Nay, except the merits of Chriſt be applied to our beſt works and ſufferings, they cannot ſtand before Gods iuſtice, neither can they be meritorious, as they themſelues confeſſe: ſo that it will follow by this doctrine, that our ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions are both the hand to apply Chriſts, and the thing to which it is applied. All which is moſt repugnant, not only to Religion, but euen to reaſon it ſelfe.</p>

               <p n="43">43. Thus they deuide ſaluation, as it were party <hi>parpale</hi> betwixt Chriſt and man, and paralell them together. And whereas they ſay, that we muſt be like vnto Chriſt, as in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting, ſo in ſatisfying; what doe they but intrude man into the fellowſhip of Chriſts office? for our imitation of Chriſt ſtandeth in a conformity to his conuerſation and life, and of thoſe things onely which concerne his perſon, and are imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but not in being like vnto him in his office: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

when they ſay, that we muſt be like vnto Chriſt in ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, they make euery man that is ſaued, a Ieſus and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to himſelfe, becauſe they make him to imitate him in thoſe things, wherein conſiſteth his being our Chriſt.

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> argument. And firſt, by the doctrine of the Popes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, they detract from the power of Chriſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from his glory: for both they endow the Pope with thoſe titles, which properly belong to Chriſt, as to be <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bel. de Concil. lib. 2. cap. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>in Gods family, the vniuerſall Paſtor, the head of the Church, the husband and bridegroome of it:</hi> and all other names which are giuen to our Sauiour Chriſt in holy Scripture (whereby it is ſhewne, that he is aboue the Church:) and alſo they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the ſame power to the Pope, which belongeth properly to Chriſt, as to pardon ſinne, to diſpenſe with the law of God, to open and ſhut the gates of heauen, not miniſterially, but abſolutely and iudicially, to depoſe Kings, and to diſpoſe of Kingdomes, and ſuch like. Now, what a diſhonour is this to him, in whoſe thigh is written this glorious title, <hi>The King of Kings?</hi> Hee muſt not be the onely head of the Church, but the Pope muſt be a ioynt head with him, nor hee the ſole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor, but the Pope muſt be his Vicar: nor the ſole husband of the Church, but the Pope, in his abſence, muſt be her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in his roome. Could a mortall man endure this iniurie? And doe wee thinke that the Sonne of God will beare it? Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt is not able to gouerne alone, or not willing; they will not ſay not able, leſt their blaſphemy ſhould be too too odious: and if they ſay, not willing: how can hee not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to maintaine his owne glory, or not bee vnwilling to be confederated with a ſinfull Pope (for ſo often they are) in the diſpoſition of his Kingdome? Let them make the beſt that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1727:70"/>
they can of it: yet it appeareth, that Chriſts gouernment is diuided betwixt the Pope and him, and ſo muſt the glory alſo needs be diuided,</p>
               <p n="45">45. Secondly, by their doctrine of the Inuocation and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Saints, what doe they but diuide the office, and ſo the glory of the Mediatour-ſhip, betwixt Chriſt and them? for they teach that Chriſt is our Mediatour of Redemption, but the Saints Mediatours of Interceſſion, whereas we with the Scripture make Chriſt Ieſus to be the onely and ſole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour both of Redemption and Interceſſion. Wee honour the Saints, but wee pray vnto God alone in the name of his Sonne; they adore the Saints, and make their prayers vnto them as well as vnto God: yea, more prayers do they powre out by numbers vnto them, then vnto God. What is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God and Chriſt, if this be not?</p>
               <p n="46">46. Thirdly, by their doctrine of traditions, they derogate greatly from the glory of Gods mercy towards his Church: for they hold that the written word is not ſufficient for a Chriſtian man to ſaluation, without the helpe of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call traditions: whereby they plainely inſinuate, that either God had not that care of his family the Church, as he might haue had, ſeeing hee left not for it a perfect and certaine rule for the gouernment thereof, but ſent it ouer to vncertaine traditions; or that wiſedome which all Law-giuers labour to attaine vnto, ſeeing hee could not at the firſt prouide for all future occaſions; or that loue that he would not: one of theſe doth neceſſarily follow from their doctrine.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Laſtly, by their doctrine of worſhipping of Images, whereby they giue vnto ſtockes and ſtones part of that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip which is due vnto God. We teach that all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip is due vnto God alone. They on the contrary maintaine, that <hi>latria,</hi> that is, diuine worſhip is Gods due; but <hi>dulia,</hi> that is, ſeruice is to be giuen to Images. Yea, that the Crucifixe is to be worſhipped with diuine worſhip, which is due onely to God. Who ſeeth not what manifeſt iniury they offer to Gods glory, by this ſuperſtitious worſhip of dumbe and dead Images?</p>

And thus, omitting many other like poynts which might be inſerted in this place, I hope that the Minor propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is ſufficiently demonſtrated, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth by many doctrines derogate from the glory of God, and the merits of Chriſt. And therefore the concluſion muſt needs follow, being built vpon an vnmooueable foundation, that, that Religion which maintaineth ſuch doctrines, is not the truth of Chriſt, but the ſeduction of Antichriſt.</p>

If the word of God written, be the onely ground of faith, then that Religion which will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, dependance onely vpon the word written, is not to be beleeued, but to be ſuſpected as erronious: but the word written is the onely ground of faith, as hath beene proued: therefore that Religion which diſclaymeth it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance only vpon the word, deſerues iuſtly not to be beleeued, but to be ſuſpected as erronious: And in this regard, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion, though it be in our <hi>Pater noster,</hi> to wit, vnder the laſt petition, <hi>Deliuer vs from euill,</hi> yet it ſhould neuer come into our Creed, to repoſe our faith and our ſaluation vpon it.</p>

Now, to proue that the Scripture cannot<note place="margin">Bell. ibid. ca. 9.</note> be the iudge of Controuerſies, nor the Interpreter of it ſelfe, they vſe three chiefe reaſons: firſt, becauſe it hath diuers ſenſes: ſecondly, becauſe it is not able to ſpeake, but is mute and dumbe; and thirdly, becauſe in euery well ordered Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, the Law and the Iudge are diſtinguiſhed; and therefore, ſeeing the Scripture is the law, therefore it cannot be the Iudge.</p>

                  <hi>Sword,</hi> to be conuerted into many ſenſes, as <hi>Turrian</hi> the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite maketh it: for as of one body there is but one ſoule, ſo of one place of Scripture, there is but one true &amp; ſound ſenſe, which is the ſoule and life of it, the words being but the fleſh, and the skinne that couereth the ſame: and that true ſenſe is that which the Spirit of God intendeth, and not that which euery priuate ſpirit collecteth and deduceth out of the ſame: as for the Tropologicall, Anagogicall, and Allegoricall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they are not diſtinct ſenſes of the Scripture, but diuers collections and applications iſſuing out of one and the ſame ſenſe: all which may bee intended by the Holy Ghoſt, vnder that one literall ſenſe.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1727:74"/>
an Allegoricall application of it, to the illuſtrating of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he had in hand: and ſo when by a tropologie a morall doctrine is deriued out of a text of Scripture, as our Sauiour doth, <hi>Math.</hi> 12. 41. 42. applying to the <hi>Iewes</hi> the<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 41. 42.</note> repentance of the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> and the long iourney of the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> to ſee, and heare <hi>Salomon;</hi> or when as by a type any thing in Scripture is myſtically expounded other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the literall ſenſe doth beare: this is not a new ſenſe, but an accommodation of the right ſenſe to another purpoſe, which notwithſtanding is intended by the ſpirit of God: and this is confeſſed by diuers of their owne ſide. <hi>Cornelius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>

                  <hi>man Father vpon earth,</hi> for there is but one, your Father which is in heauen: his meaning is not to exclude earthly Fathers from their title, but to ſhew that God is the primer and principall Father, both in reſpect of time, order, and cauſe, and that the other are but ſubordinate vnto him: ſo in a Common-wealth the Iudge is ſubordinate vnto the law, and the law is the Iudges Iudge: and for that cauſe, as the Law is ſaid to be a <hi>dumbe Magiſtrate,</hi> ſo the Magiſtrate is ſaid to be a <hi>ſpeaking Law:</hi> and ſo in truth the Law is the Iudge pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, and principally, and the Magiſtrate is but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the law, and the Iudge ſubordinate. Now if this be ſo in a Common-wealth gouerned by humane Lawes, which are failing and imperfect in many things, being the ordinances of erring men, how much more may we deeme it to be ſo in the Church of God, whoſe Law-giuer is God himſelfe, and the law the word of God? and therefore, though the Paſtors
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1727:76"/>
and Miniſters of the Church may interpret the Scriptures, yet they muſt be tyed to this rule, to doe it by the Scriptures, and to expound the law by the law: for ſhall not a temporall Iudge giue ſentence out of his owne braine, but <hi>ſecundum leges &amp; ſtatuta,</hi> according to the lawes and ſtatutes of the Realme? And ſhall any Paſtour of the Church, be it the Pope himſelfe, giue iudgement in any queſtion out of his owne breſt, without the direction of Gods word? This is to preferre humane lawes before Gods law: and to make the ſtate of the Church farre inferiour to the ſtate politike: and to haue a more certaine rule for the deciding of ciuill controuerſies, then for the determining of queſtions of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith: ſo that in a word, the Scripture is both the law and the interpreter of the Law, the Iudge, and the Iudgement.</p>

Secondly, becauſe all things neceſſary to be beleeued are not contained in the Scripture, as by what meanes women vnder the law were clenſed from originall ſinne, wanting circumciſion, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that dyed before the eight day, and many Gentiles that were ſaued: againe, which are the books of Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that theſe are Canonicall, and thoſe are not: that the Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> was a perpetuall virgin, that the Paſſeouer is to be kept vpon the Sunday being the Lords day, and that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of beleeuing Parents are to bee baptized, and ſuch like. Thirdly, becauſe the Scripture is not one continued body, as a rule ſhould bee, but containeth diuers workes, Hiſtories,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1727:76"/>
Sermons, Prophecies, Verſes, and Epiſtles. Theſe be his three reaſons, by which the Ieſuite would euince, that the Scripture is not giuen to this end, to be the rule of faith.</p>
               <p n="17">17. To all which I will anſwere briefly, and diſtinctly, and firſt in generall, ſecondly in particular: In generall, if the Scripture be not giuen to be the rule of faith, why is it called Canonicall? It is therefore called Canonicall, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the Canon, that is, the rule of faith and life: this very inſcription approued by all, doth refute <hi>Bellarmines</hi> fond ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillation. Againe, if the Scripture was not giuen to bee the rule, but onely a monitorie, why were there ſo many Bookes written, ſeeing fewer would haue ſerued for monition? The multiplicity of Bookes proueth, that they ſerue not onely to put vs in mind of our duty, but alſo as an exact rule to ſquare our faith, and frame our life by. And laſtly, if the Scripture was not giuen to be a rule, why doth he himſelfe confeſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward that it is indeed a rule, but not a total and entire rule, but a partiall and imperfect one? If it bee any waies a rule, then it was giuen by God, and written by the men of God, to that end to be the rule. And ſo <hi>Bellarmines</hi> goodly reaſons hang together like a ſicke mans dreame, the one part wherof ouerthroweth the other.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But to anſwere in particular to them ſeuerally: To the firſt, I ſay, that it is not farre from blaſphemy to affirme, that there is any thing in holy Scripture that is vnneceſſary; for though all things are not of equall neceſſity and profit, yet there is nothing in the whole Booke of God, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Gen.</hi> to the end of the <hi>Reuel.</hi> but may haue moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and neceſſary vſe in the Church of God, if not for the eſſentiall forme of faith, yet for the adorning and beautifying of it: and this may truely bee verified, euen of thoſe things which he excepteth againſt, to wit, the Hiſtories of the Olde and New Teſtament, and the ſalutations in the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles: out of all which, how many excellent doctrines may be deriued both for the confirmation of faith, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of manners! And therefore as in mans body, God by nature hath not diſpoſed all parts to be alike neceſſary, but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1727:77"/>
ſome haue no other vſe but ornament and comelineſſe: ſo hath Almighty God mingled the parts of holy Scripture in that manner, that ſome are as it were bones and ſinews to our faith, ſome fleſh and bloud, and ſome againe but exteriour beautie and faſhion: yet as in nature nothing is made in vaine, ſo much leſſe in Scripture is there any thing to be accounted ſuperfluous and redundant: nay, in this diuine body, there are no excrements that may be caſt out and ſeparated, as it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in our earthly carkaſes, but all is entire, ſound and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. when hee<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 7.</note> ſaith, that <hi>the Law of God is perfect, conuerting the ſoule:</hi> and our Sauiour, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. 18. when he auoucheth, that <hi>till heauen</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="19">19. To his ſecond reaſon I anſwere three things: firſt, that it is entirely falſe, that the Scripture doth not contayne all things neceſſarily required to the Eſſence of faith; for if the Scripture be perfect, and <hi>giueth wiſedome to the ſimple;</hi> if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 7.

Laſtly, if God would giue vs a rule for our faith
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1727:78"/>
and life in the Scripture, then by the ſame reaſon hee would make that a perfect rule: for, ſhall any imperfect thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the authour of all perfection? When an imperfect creature is borne, wanting either limmes or forme, we aſcribe it to a defect and errour in the particular nature, from whence the creature is deriued, or to the indiſpoſition of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall cauſes, not to the generall nature which tendeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies vnto perfection. How much more then ought this Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite be afraid to aſcribe an imperfect creature, to the all-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creatour? eſpecially ſeeing it is the worke of his owne hands, without the intermingling of all ſecond cauſes, and proceedeth immediately from his owne ſpirit, the Prophets and Apoſtles, being but as <hi>Baruch</hi> to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> writers and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſers of that which the ſpirit did dictate vnto them? And therefore I may boldly and firmely conclude, that as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created word of God, begotten of the Father before all time, is perfect God, and can neither receiue augmentation nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution: ſo the word of God, pronounced firſt by the mouth of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and after by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is called the Scripture, is abſolute and perfect, and can neither be encreaſed nor diminiſhed, to make it more or leſſe perfect, and ſo is the onely true ſound and ſacred Rule, whereby both our Faith and life is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards the Kingdome of Heauen.</p>
               <p n="23">23.

                  <hi>can be ſufficiently refuted by Scripture alone,</hi> and that by no meanes it may be graunted, that either the holy Scripture, or the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking by the Scripture, ſhould be the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and generall Iudge of Controuerſies: and hee addes his reaſon, becauſe the Scripture cannot <hi>dicere ſententiam, giue ſentence on one ſide, as a Iudge ſhould doe.</hi> Nay, one <hi>Vitus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus</hi> (as <hi>Pelargus</hi> reporteth) is not aſhamed to ſay, that wee<note place="margin">Pelarg.

Let vs harken therefore to the voyce of the Church touching this poynt, that is, as they hold of the Councill, or rather Conuenticle of Romiſh Biſhops, aſſembled together at <hi>Trent,</hi> which they call the Church repreſentatiue.

               <p n="28">28. Laſtly, the Canon in giuing this indefinite power of interpretation, and determination of doubts to the Church, without any relation had to the Scripture, doth vtterly iuſtle out the Scripture from being the Iudge. And ſo <hi>Andradius</hi> the interpretour of this Councill doth expound the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Andrad.</note> thereof, when he ſaith, that <hi>the iudgement of the Church is,</hi> Principium vltra quod non ſit fas in inquiſitione progredi, <hi>Aprinciple, beyond the which it is not lawfull to proceede in inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi> By which he giueth to vnderſtand, that our faith muſt relye wholly and ſolely vpon the iudgement of the Church, that is, the Pope and his Prelates, without enquirie at all into the word of God, whether that which they propound be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the truth or no. As <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in a certaine diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Eraſ. ex Chem. exam. pa. 66</note> againſt the Papiſts, confeſſeth, that <hi>their opinion hath not ſure &amp; certain teſtimonies of Scripture, but that the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be better &amp; more clerely &amp; ſtrongly proued out of Gods word; notwithſtanding</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the Church bid, I will beleeue it, for I will captiuate my vnderſtanding to the obedience of the Church.</hi> And this indeed is the <hi>Babylonian</hi> ſeruitude of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherby they fetter the ſouls of their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to perpetual ſlauery, and lead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blindfold vnder the veile of an implicite faith vnto perdition: for this is the firſt ground they lay in the hearts of all their generation, that they muſt not examine the doctrine of the Church, but take it at their hands as good coyne, though it be neuer ſo counterfeit, <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina in Concilijs definit a cuſtodie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da eſt, non examinanda,</hi> (ſaith<note place="margin">Bell de verbo Dei, li. 3. c. 10.</note>

Scripture is thruſt cleane out of dores, from hauing any right or title in the deciſion of queſtions of faith: not onely by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men, but euen by their Church it ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Now here two things are to be obſerued of vs, for the plainer enucleation and clearing of this poynt: firſt, that in making the Scripture Iudge, we doe not exclude the Church, nor any member of the Church from the office of iudging and diſcerning, onely we place them in their due order and ranke: for this is it we intend, that the Scripture is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt abſolute Iudge, from the ſentence whereof there is no appeale to be made to any higher Court: and that the iudgement &amp; determination of the Church, or of any member therof, is ſubordinate vnto that, and to be ruled and guided by that, and where it is agreeable vnto that, there to be receiued, where it ſwarueth from that, to be reiected. For as in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill eſtate, the Iudges deputed to that office, haue no abſolute authority in themſelues, but are ſubiect vnto the lawe, and the Miniſters thereof, and therefore muſt not ſpeake what they liſt, but what the law directeth: ſo in the ſtate Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, they that are inferiour Iudges, are but the Miniſters of the law of God, and muſt not vary from the rule thereof in any reſpect. And for this cauſe, as the Iewes were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">Deut. 17. 10, 11</note> to obey the ſentence and determination of the Prieſt in all controuerſies, ſo the Prieſt was commanded to giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to the law, and no otherwiſe: and albeit the Hebrew gloſſe vpon that Text teacheth, <hi>that if the Prieſt ſay that the right hand is the left, or the left is the right, his ſentence is to be holden,</hi> (which is the plaine doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> Iudaizing in this as in many other things) yet <hi>Lyra</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lyra</hi> on Deu. 17</note> writing vpon that Text ſaith, that the gloſſe is manifeſtly falſe, becauſe the ſentence of no man, of what authority ſoeuer, is to be holden, if it be contrary to the law of God: ſo we admit the Church to be Iudge, and euery priuate Chriſtian alſo in his place, but we aſcribe the chiefe power and authority of Iudging to the Scripture alone. The next place we allow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, and the loweſt vnto the particular members thereof: Theſe laſt to be directed by the Church, but yet ſo
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1727:81"/>
farre as it bringeth it authority out of the Scriptures, and it to be limited by the bounds of the Scripture alſo: and if it iudge againſt the euidence thereof, not to bee heard nor beleeued. This is our opinion, that wee may not be miſtaken: but our aduerſaries aduance their Church vnto the higheſt place, and make the Scripture an inferiour vaſſall, and ſeruant vnto it, as I haue declared.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Secondly, note thereaſon that moueth them, thus to diſclaime from the iudgement of the Scripture: it is becauſe they know full well, that the mayneſt and chiefeſt poynts of their Religion, wherein they diſſent from vs, haue no ground nor foundation in the Scripture, but would vaniſh like a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning auſt, if the light of Gods word ſhould but ſhine vpon them: as for inſtance, their doctrines of worſhipping Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of taſting dayes, of prayer for the dead, of Purgatorie, of ſhrift, of pardons, of the communion in one kinde, of ſingle life, and of the priuate Maſſe, and ſuch like: all which poynts and many other, their owne Writers conteſſe, cannot be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proued out of the Scripture. And therefore <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Andrad. Orthod. explic. lib. 2.</note> doth fully and ingenuouſly acknowledge, <hi>that many poynts of their Religion would reele and ſtagger, if they were not ſupported by tradition:</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe ſaith, that it<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bel. de Euchar. lib. 3 cap.</hi> 23. How contrary is this to that of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> out faith ſhuld reele and tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptureſtand not faſt, <hi>Aug. de doct.

This is ther fore a cunning and witty policie, or rather a groſſe and palpable ſubtilty of theirs, whereby though they dazle the ſight of the ſimple and ignorant, yet they cannot bleare the eyes of the vnderſtanding and wiſe, from diſcerning into their fraud.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Hauing thus proued, that they reiect the Scripture, now I come to ſhew, that they allow of no other Iudges but themſelues: for the proofe whereof, there needes no long diſcourſe, ſeeing it is ſufficiently apparent, by that which hath already beene deliuered, that they appeale from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1727:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Scripture vnto the iudgement of the Church, and tye vnto the girdle thereof, the onely key of interpretation. Now by the Church, they intend firſt the Romiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, that is, all that whole bony which dependeth vpon the Pope for their head, and receiue as it were life, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment by his influence: for (as <hi>Bristo</hi> ſaith) the <hi>Romane</hi>

The Maior or firſt propoſition in this demonſtration,<note place="margin">MAIOR.</note> though it bee of an vndoubted truth, yet for the greater illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratio: thereof, two poynts are to be conſidered: firſt, what this Scripture is, which is oppoſed againſt: and ſecondly, what they are to be eſteemed which oppoſe themſelues vnto the Scripture. The Scripture contained in the Olde and new Teſtament, is, in a word, the holy and ſacred word of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God: which to haue ſaid of it, is an aſcription of the greateſt dignitie vnto it, as can bee deuiſed: for if it bee the holy and ſacred word of the eternall God, then muſt it needs be perfect. excellent, pure, vpright, cleane, permanent, wife, ſweet, and what elſe may be ſpoken for the ſetting forth of the excellency of a thing: all which attributes are giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the 19. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and doe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.</note> appertaine vnto it, being immediately deriued from that cleare and ſole fountaine of all goodneſſe and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For howſoeuer the holy Prophets were the penne-men thereof; yet thoſe were all and in euery parcell and particle inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> informeth vs, when hee ſaid, <hi>That no Prophecie in the Scripture is of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate</hi>

                  <hi>by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> For as the heathen Oracles were conceiued, and vttered by the immediate inſtigation of the Deuill, who guided both the hearts and tongues of his Prieſts, to bee the inſtruments of his malice: So the Oracles of Chriſtians, to wit, the holy Scriptures, proceeded from the ſacred inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Spirit, mouing the hearts, and directing the pens of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles his Secretaries, to commit to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that only which they receiued from God, both in reſpect of matter and manner. To this purpoſe is that notable ſaying of <hi>Hugo, In the holy Scripture, whatſoeuer is taught, is truth:</hi>

either to denie the Scripture to bee the Word of God, or to abuſe it with vnreuerent termes and reproches, or any wayes to diminiſh the credit and authority thereof, is not onely plaine blaſphemy, but alſo open and notorious Atheifme; and ſo in both high treaſon againſt the Maieſtie of God: for, if it be treaſon to vſe contumelious ſpeeches againſt the Kings perſon, or either by word to reuile, or by deede to reſiſt his decrees and proclamations: how much more doth that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the name of the higheſt treaſon, when the ſacred word of God, which is a diuine Law, iſſuing from his owne mouth, is blaſphemed, and the maieſtie of God moſt clearely ſhining, therein abuſed?

Will a mortall man commit the gouernment of his family, eſpecially if he loueth his wife and children, to a knowne Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin and a notorious villaiue?

As for the reſt of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh crue, both learned and vnlearned, though they bee, as I muſt needes confeſſe, for the moſt part, more infected with ſuperſtition, then with Atheiſme, (albeit neuer did any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try more ſwarme with that generation, then doth <hi>Italy</hi> at this day) yet in blaſpheming and debaſing the holy Scripture, they cannot be farre from, not onely giuing-way, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a wide dore to that horrible ſinne, but alſo from making an open profeſſion thereof.</p>

Thus the greatneſſe of this ſinne of Idolatry, is manifeſt, and from thence I may conclude my firſt propoſition, that that Religion which maintayneth and commandeth this ſinne, ſo full of folly, impiety, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to God, is worthy not onely to be ſuſpected, but euen abhorred, and deteſted of all men.</p>

               <p n="5">5. They deny both the <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition in this argument, and in denying them, eſpecially the <hi>Maior,</hi> they giue iuſt cauſe of vehement ſuſpition, if not of plaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that they are guilty of the crime whereof wee accuſe them: for if a thiefe ſtanding at the barre, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of a robbery by the high way ſide ſhould anſwere that

to take money from a man by the high way ſide at Noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, was not theft, all men would thinke that hee was guilty of the robbery, and ſo the Iurie would finde him: then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely the Romaniſts, by denying this to be the true definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Idolatry, which is propounded in the firſt propoſition, bewray their owne guiltineſſe, and giue vs more cauſe to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them, then we had before.</p>

Euen as they that worſhipped Chriſt vpon earth being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, did not worſhip him alone, but after a ſort his garments alſo. Here is a braue ſtraine of Diuinity, they worſhipped Chriſt in his clothes, therfore they worſhipped Chriſts clothes: So Chriſt is worſhipped vnder the formes of bread and wine: therefore the formes of bread and wine muſt be worſhipped. This is like the Aſſe, which bore vpon his backe the Image of <hi>Iſis:</hi> and when men fell downe before the Image, he thought they worſhipped him: but hee was corrected with a cudgell for his ſawcineſſe; and ſo are they worthy for their folly, that cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt a man and his garments, Chriſt and the ſignes of Chriſt, but promiſcuouſly confound the worſhip of the one with the other. Rather therefore may we thus conclude: they which worſhipped Chriſt on earth, did not worſhip his garments that he wore: therefore they which will worſhip Chriſt in the Sacrament, muſt not worſhip the outward Elements; and ſo it will follow, that as it had beene Idolatry in any to worſhip the garments of Chriſt: ſo it is in the Romaniſts, to worſhip the accidents of bread and wine.</p>

Firſt, that the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that ſacred and incomprehenſible deitie, by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may be pictured on a wall, and worſhipped in or at an Image; yea, that ſuch an Image ought at leaſt improperly bee worſhipped with the ſame worſhip that is due vnto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they picture God the Father in the ſimilitude of an old man, &amp; God the Son in the likenes of a yong child, &amp; God the holy Ghoſt in the likeneſſe of a Doue, which the Scripture in the ſecond Commandement condemneth as Idolatrie: and that the intendment of that Commandement is not againſt the Images of falſe gods onely, as the Romaniſts would haue it, but alſo of the true Iehouah: <hi>Moſes</hi> the beſt expounder of himſelfe, teacheth moſt plainely, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 16. when hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Take heed that you make not to your ſelues any grauen Image, or repreſentation of any figure: for you ſaw no Image in the day that the Lord ſpake vnto you in Horeb, out of the midſt of the fire:</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> confirming the ſame expoſition, ſaith, <hi>To whom will you liken God? or what ſimilitude will yee ſet vp vnto him? Eſay</hi> 40. 18. as if he ſhould ſay, it is impoſſible to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent<note place="margin">Eſay 40. 18.</note> God by any likeneſſe or ſimilitude. If they reply that they worſhip not the Image, but God in the Image, I anſwer, Firſt, that the very Image of God is an Idoll by this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: and therefore, the erecting of it to a religious vſe, is Idolatry. Secondly, that it is falſe which they ſay, that they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1727:103"/>
worſhip not the Image, but God in the Image: for their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is contrary, as hath beene ſhewed, and their practice is contrary, as ſhall be declared hereafter. Thirdly, though it be true which they alledge, yet the worſhipping of God before an Image, is Idolatry: for when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the two golden calues at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> they were not ſuch calues, to worſhip the outward calues, but God in them: and therefore the worſhip of them is called, <hi>the feare of Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uah:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Reg. 17. 28.</note> and yet they are branded for Idolaters in that reſpect. The like I might ſay of the golden Calfe in the wilderneſſe, and of that Image which <hi>Micha</hi> erected. Fourthly, and laſtly, that the<note place="margin">Iudg. 17.</note> true God worſhipped in or before an Image, is made an Idol, becauſe (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) <hi>they that worſhip God in any other ſort then he hath appointed, worſhip not him, but that which</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. de conſenſ. Euangel. lib. 1. cap. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>they had fayned, that is, an Idoll of their owne fancy:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture ſaith, when the Iewes worſhipped God in the golden Calfe, they turned God into the likeneſſe of a beaſt<note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 20.</note> which eateth graſſe.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The ſecond concluſion to bee obſerued, is, that by their doctrine the Images of Chriſt are to be adored with ſuch worſhip, as is belonging vnto Chriſt himſelfe, though impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly: and that this worſhip is to be bounded within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the Image, without relation to the Samplar. By which is euident: Firſt, that by their owne confeſſion they are Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters improperly: and ſecondly, that truſt and confidence is to be put in ſuch an Image, &amp; vowes, and prayers, and ſacrifices to be made vnto it: for all theſe are parts of diuine worſhip, which muſt be confined to the Image, and ſo they are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, but properly Idolaters: and then by this we may ſee that the caueat inſerted in the decree of the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> is but a meere ſophiſtication: for whereas the decree ſaith, that Images muſt be ſo worſhipped, that truſt and confidence be not placed in them: in affirming that ſome ought to bee worſhipped with <hi>Latria,</hi> they enioyne plainely, that men ſhould repoſe their truſt and confidence in them: and thus they bewray the fraud of the decree, and their owne ſecret impiety.</p>
               <p n="22">
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1727:103"/>22. The third concluſion is that ſame <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary reuerence, which they ſay is due to the Image of the bleſſed Virgin; and that <hi>Dulia,</hi> or common ſeruice, which they aſſigne to the Images of other Saints, is no leſſe then I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, let them extenuate the matter neuer ſo much by titles and diſtinctions; for it is religious worſhip: all which is due<note place="margin">Reuel. 19. 10. and 22. 9.</note> vnto God onely, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 19. 10. and 22. 9. The Angel would not ſuffer <hi>Iohn</hi> to performe any outward worſhip vnto him, nor ſo much as proſtrate himſelfe before him; but comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to worſhip God; and yet <hi>Iohn</hi> knew him to be but an Angel, and therefore meant not to giue him any thing but outward reuerence, yet he refuſed it vpon this ground, that all religious worſhip, both outward and inward, belongeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto God. So <hi>Mardochee</hi> the Iew refuſed to bow the knee to <hi>Haman</hi> the Agagite, becauſe the honour which was giuen vnto him, was more then ciuill; for he was made a petty God: and therefore in the fragments of <hi>Hester,</hi> this reaſon is giuen by himſelfe, <hi>I did it, becauſe I would not preferre the honour of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heſter 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>a man, before the glory of God, and would not worſhip any but thee, my Lord:</hi> therefore, the bowing of the knee, or proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the body after a religious manner, is due onely vnto God, and is part of diuine worſhip: to bow the knee, and proſtrate the body after a ciuill manner, is lawfull to Kings and Princes, and others that are either exalted in gouernment, or endued with excellent gifts and graces of God; but to doe the ſame in a religious reſpect, is proper onely to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it preſuppoſeth the knowing of the heart, an omni-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and an infinite power to helpe. And thus this ſame <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perdulia</hi> and <hi>Dulia,</hi> wherewith they worſhip the Image of the Virgin, and other Saints, is open and plaine Idolatry: and the rather, becauſe it is ſeldome or neuer ſeuered from <hi>Latria,</hi> that is, the inward worſhip of the ſoule, which, as they ſay, is onely due vnto God: as by their practice more plainely ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Thus we ſee the morrow and myſtery of their doctrine diſcouered: now let vs take a view of their practice. And firſt, what worſhip can bee more performed vnto God, then they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1727:104"/>

                  <hi>that this part of piety is little differing from flat impiety: for there are very many of the rude and ignorant, which worſhip the very Images of wood or ſtone, of marble, or braſſe, or pictures painted vpon the walls, not as figures, but euen as if they had verily ſenſe, and doe put more truſt in them, then they doe in Chriſt, or other Saints, to whom they are dedicated.</hi> Thus doth this man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the practice of their Idolatry; and much more might be found in him to that purpoſe, but that the Spaniſh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours haue taken order by their <hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> that he ſhall not doe them much hurt.

                  <note place="margin">Vaſq. Ibid. l. 3. c. 8. nu. 114.</note> are to be worſhipped with a right intention, and with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere faith. Thirdly, not to ſtand vpon priuate opinions; the determination of their repreſentatiue Church, the Councill<note place="margin">Concil. Trident. Decret. de Reliq.

If any man ſay, that the ignorance and miſdoings of ſome, is not to bee imputed as an errour to the Church: I anſwer, that it is not ſome, but all generally, for the moſt part, that are thus affected: and therefore <hi>Caſſander</hi> condemnes both good and bad, as guilty of this crime. But graunt, that many are otherwiſe minded; yet for all that, it cannot be denied, but the greater part are in this ranke: and that is inough to proue their Church Idolatrous, becauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Logicall axiome, euery denomination is to be taken from the greater part; neither is it a perſonall errour, but a dogmaticall poſition deriued from the grounds of their Religion, as from the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> which alloweth to worſhip them, <hi>Opis impetrandae cauſa,</hi> for to obta ne helpe of them, and from the reſt of their great Diuines: Some of whom would haue them to bee worſhipped with the ſame worſhip with Images, ſome with a greater reuerence then Images <hi>ob contactum:</hi> and they that mince it fineſt, with a religious reuerence, which they call adoration and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in all which is that, in a ſort, either openly or couertly allowed by their doctrine, which is practiſed by their people.</p>
               <p n="30">30. But let vs ſearch a little further into their practice. The cuſtome of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is to take the bodies, aſhes, or bones of Saints out of their graues, and to adorne them with gold, and ſiluer, ſilke, veluet, and ſuch like, and to carry them about in publike proceſſions, and ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to ſhew them to the people, to be touched, kiſſed, gazed vpon, and adored as a ſingular and meritorious ſeruice
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1727:107"/>
to God: is not this Idolatry? They teach, that God doth tye his grace and vertue to thoſe Reliques, whereof they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, that adore them with due reuerence, and offer preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gifts vnto them: yea, they promiſe vnto ſuch many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and Pardons for ſinnes. Is not this Idolatry? Againe, they teach, that their prayers are better, and more effectuall, and acceptable vnto God, if they bee made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reliques of Saints, and therefore their practice is in times of neceſſity, to goe a pilgrimage to ſuch places, where the moſt famous Reliques are; becauſe they are perſwaded, that their prayers ſhall bee there ſooneſt heard of God: yea, they make men beleeue, that the Euchariſt hath a great deale of holineſſe added vnto it, if Reliques of Saints bee included within the Altar.

               <p n="56">56. As for his reaſon which he braggeth to be vnanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, me thinkes, it halts of all foure: for, becauſe we entreat Gods children here in this world to pray for vs, doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Bell. de Sanctor. beat. li. 1. ca. 19.</note> follow that we muſt pray vnto them, being departed out of this world? By the ſame reaſon it may bee inforced, that we ought to giue almes vnto them, and entertaine them into our houſes, and waſh their feete, and comfort them, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe them, and preach vnto them: for all theſe duties of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity wee performe to Saints militant. If they ſay, Why, but they are remooued from vs, and alſo from their bodies; and therefore as they ſtand not in neede of our charity, ſo wee cannot extend it vnto them: The ſame anſwere cutteth the throte of this argument, they are ſo farre exalted aboue vs, and ſeuered from all commerce with our affaires, that though we vſed their prayers here on earth, yet it is in vaine to inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them in heauen, our prayers, as our deeds of charity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to ſtretch ſo farre. This I take to be a ſufficient ſolution to that vnſoluble argument: Albeit, we haue alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other anſwere in readineſſe, to wit, that there is not the ſame reaſon of the inuocation of Saints in heauen, as of the mutuall prayers of Gods children on earth, but a great difference; here we know one anothers neceſſities, there the Saints know<note place="margin">Eſay 63. 16. 2. Reg. 22. 20.</note> not our wants; here we are preſent with them whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to pray for vs; but we are not preſent with the Saints in heauen, nor they with vs; and therefore the one is a fruite of charity, but the other a practice of piety and religion: here one liuing man may requeſt anothers helpe by word of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1727:118"/>
mouth or letter: but inuocation of Saints is often perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſecret deſires of the heart, without the vtterance of any ſpeech: here we ſtand as fellow members in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and make requeſt for each other, not in our owne names, but in the name of Chriſt our Mediatour: but when men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate the Saints in heauen, they make them more then their fellowes, euen mediatours of interceſſion betweene them and God. Laſtly, for mutuall praying for one another here, wee haue both an expreſſe commandement, and plaine examples in the word of God; but for praying to the Saints, wee haue neither commandement, nor example, nor promiſe in the whole Scripture.</p>
               <p n="57">57. But that I may leaue theſe things, and come to the poynt in hand, that Saints are made Idols by inuocation, may appeare by theſe reaſons: Firſt, becauſe they aſcribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them an omnipotent power to know the heart, which is a peculiar property belonging vnto God onely, <hi>Ier.</hi> 17. 10.<note place="margin">Ier. 17. 10.</note> Secondly, an infinite preſence in all places, and that at once: for when one prayeth to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> another at <hi>Paris,</hi> another at <hi>London,</hi> another at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and all at one inſtant, muſt not he needs be preſent in all thoſe places, or elſe how can he heare their prayers? Thirdly, a diuine power to helpe and deliuer all thoſe that call vpon them, and that not onely from outward calamities, but from inward ſinnes and corruptions. Fourthly, a property belonging onely vnto God, namely, to bee beleeued in: for how ſhall they call vpon him in whom they haue not beleeued, ſaith S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10. 14?<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14.</note> And laſtly, a diuine worſhip, which is ſacrifice for prayer, is a ſpiritual ſacrifice of Chriſtians. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 13. which, as all know,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 13.

And as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, when he ſaith, <hi>We doe not ordaine Prieſts, nor offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to the Martyrs, becauſe it is vnfit, vndue, and vnlawfull, and due onely to God alone:</hi> and againe in the ſame Chapter, <hi>becauſe not they, but their God is our God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="58">58. Againſt theſe arguments our aduerſaries make a ſhew of oppoſition (and but a ſhew) after this manner: Firſt, that they doe not aſcribe to the Saints an omnipotent power, or

                  </gap> is glaſſe, in which all things are ſaid to be ſeene, is no where to be found in the Scripture, and therefore is a plaine forgerie of their owne braines: for we reade, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. That the pure in heart are <hi>therefore</hi>

                  </gap>aith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 23. that the Angels know not the houre of the laſt Iudgement: &amp; if not the Angels, much leſſe the Saints: but all theſe things doe in ſome ſort pertaine vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as well as the prayers of the liuing: and yet it is plaine, that they ſee them
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1727:119"/>
not in that glaſſe. Thirdly, if that be certaine, that they ſee in this glaſſe the prayers and neceſſities of their ſuppliants; Why doth <hi>Coſter</hi> and others affirme, that they attaine this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note place="margin">Coſter Enchir.</note> by the relation of Angels? and yet they aſſigne to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man but one Angell: ſurely, that Angel is well employed in aſcending and deſcending euery houre to carry newes to the Saints. And why doe others ſay, that the Saints are after a ſort by a wonderfull celerity of their glorified nature in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place? This is a wonderfull celerity indeed, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to be ſo; and yet be it as they would haue it, it cannot euince an audience of thoſe prayers which are made at one and the ſame inſtant, in diuers and farre diſtant places. And laſtly, why doe ſome others affirme, that they haue this knowledge not by the viſion of God, but by ordinarie and continuall reuelation from God? If by viſion, then not by reuelation: and if by reuelation, then not by viſion. And thus, like men in the darke, they fight with one another, and whileſt they forſake the light of the truth which ſhineth in the word of God, they fall into grieuous errours, hammered out of their owne fancies if they ſay it is no matter how they know our wants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but certaine it is that they doe know them: they take that for granted which is the queſtion to be proued, &amp; which by no ſufficient argument they can euince.</p>
               <p n="60">60. To the ſecond obiection I anſwere, that moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſons eſteeme the Saints, to whom they pray, as the very authours and giuers of thoſe good things which they pray for, without any reſpect vnto God, ſaue that they thinke hee hath put them into their hands to bee diſtributed at their pleaſure; and therefore they pray to one for their Horſes, and to another for their Hogs, and to a third for their Kine, &amp;c. Yea, not onely the ſimple ſort doe this, but it is the doctrine of their Church, as may appeare by this rime in their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized Seruice-Bookes, to the bleſſed Virgin.</p>

As for that place in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> it maketh nothing for this purpoſe; for there the word Faith is referred to the Lord Ieſus, and Loue to the Saints: neither ought Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> authority more preiudicate vs in this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, then it doth them in many ſuch like, whom they reiect as they do the reſt of the Fathers, at their pleaſures: eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, ſeeing no man elſe beſides himſelfe is of that minde: at leaſt wiſe, if he vnderſtand by faith, to beleeue in the Saints, and not to beleeue them onely: the one whereof is proper to the Creator, the other to the creatures.</p>
               <p n="62">62. To the laſt I anſwere, that Prayer is properly one of the ſacrifices of the New Teſtament; for here the ſacrifices are not corporall, but ſpirituall, as may bee prooued in generall by that which our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Iohn 4. God will be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Spirit, and truth.</hi> And in particular, by comparing <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 11. with 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. for whereas <hi>Malachie</hi> prophecying<note place="margin">Mal. 1. 11. 1.

Laſtly, thoſe Fathers which doe defend this Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet do not defend it as it is now practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for firſt, the Fathers, if they did allow of this Inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet it was in their priuate deuotions, not in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Leiturgie of the Church: for it cannot bee prooued, that in any of the ancient Leiturgies this Inuocation was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, vntill <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſts time (for as for that which was called <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> Maſſe, all know it is a baſtard brat, and not a true Child of that good Father) but in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is practiſed in their publicke ſeruice, and ſo is come from a matter of priuate deuotion, to a generall practice of Religion. Secondly, the Fathers, though they may ſeeme to haue prayed ſometimes vnto the Saints, out of the heate of their deuotion; yet it was but now and then, and as it were, by the way, whereas their ordinary prayers and deuotions were directed vnto God: but in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Saints are more prayed vnto, then God; he hath the leaſt, and they the greateſt ſhare in their deuotion; witneſſe the Leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> and the <hi>Marie</hi> Pſalter, and their Common practice. Thirdly, the Fathers, albeit they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their prayers ſometimes to the Saints, yet they repoſed moſt confidence in their prayers to God, and in the mediation

                  <hi>God, wee obtaine more, then when others pray for vs.</hi> But the ſuperſtitious Romaniſts thinke to ſpeede better when they pray to the Saints, then when vnto God: And therefore they are not aſhamed to ſay, that we muſt appeale from the Court<note place="margin">Bernardine in marial.</note> of Gods iuſtice, to the Court of his Mothers mercy. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Fathers did not ſo much as dreame of any merits of ſupererogation which ſhould be in the Saints, and by them ſhould be communicated vntovs: but all the intereſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which we haue to &amp; in the merits of the Saints, in their iudgement, was, by vertue of the Communion of Saints: that as the members of one body enioy the ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor that is in each other; ſo the members of Chriſt militant,<note place="margin">Aug. in Pſal. 130</note> receiue a certaine benefit from the gifts of God, beſtowed<note place="margin">Caſſand. conſult. de Inuoc. Sanct.</note> vpon the Saints triumphant, and doe as it were merite by their merits, becauſe they are all members of one and the ſame myſticall body. But the Romaniſts hold, that the Saints doe ſupererogate, that is, hauing more merits then they need themſelues, doe conferre ſome of their ſuperabundance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their poore brethren that want. Fiftly, the Fathers, when they ſpake of praying to the Saints, did not ſpeake poſitiuely, but tropically, and figuratiuely, by hyperbolicall, and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall <hi>Apoſtophers,</hi> as may appeare plainely in the Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> and other of their writings: But the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts conclude poſitiuely, and doctrinally, without any Rhetoricall figures, or Hyperbolicall elocutions. Sixtly, as <hi>Caſſander</hi> confeſſeth, when the Fathers ſaid to the Saints, <hi>Orate pronobis,</hi> they meant, <hi>Vtinam oretis pro nobis,</hi> Would to God they would pray for vs; and ſo they were rather wiſhes, then prayers: But the Romaniſts admit no ſuch extenuation, but flatly affirme, that wee ought directly to pray vnto them as our Patrons, Protectors, and Interceſſors. And laſtly, the Fathers relyed not vpon the interceſſion of Saints, except there were in themſelues a care and conſcience of a godly

life: but in Popery, notorious, wicked, and vngodly perſons, that neuer thinke vpon amendment of their liues, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere in their ſinnes without repentance: yet doe aſſure themſelues to bee ſaued by the merits and interceſſion of the Saints. And thus, howſoeuer they make a ſhew of Fathers, to cloke their Idolatry withal; yet the Fathers, if they be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtood, are as much different from them, as blacke is from white. And the Fathers might bee free from Idolatrie, when as they remaine guiltie.</p>
               <p n="66">66. The third and laſt way whereby they turne the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saints into Idols, is by putting their truſt and confidence in their merits and mediation: which kinde of ſpirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is due only vnto the diuine Maieſtie, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The truth of which aſſertion may be proued, firſt, by their doctrine, &amp; ſecondly, by the publike practice of their Church. Touching their doctrine, to omit the impious, impudent, and blaſphemous opinions of their Monkes and Friers, who haue egregiouſly exceeded the bounds of all pietie in this point, left the Romaniſts ſhould ſay, that they were but priuate mens conceits, and not the receiued doctrines of the Church; I will onely relate ſome few ſentences out of their moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and athenticke writings.</p>

Chriſt had all power commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him in heauen and earth: and <hi>Dominicke</hi> did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ſame power with him; for the Angels ſerued him, the Elements obeyed him, &amp; the Diuels trembled at him. Chriſt was the Lord abſolutely, and by authority: but <hi>Dominicke</hi> principally, and by poſſeſſion. Chriſt was laid at his birth in a Manger, and wrapped in clouts to keepe him from cold: but <hi>Dominicke</hi> being an infant, would often get out of his bed, and as if hee abhorred all delights of the fleſh, lye vpon the bare ground. Chriſt neuer prayed, but hee was heard, if he would; except in the Garden, when hee prayed that the Cup might paſſe away from him, where praying according to his ſenſuall part, would not be heard according to reaſon: but <hi>Dominicke</hi> neuer deſired any thing of God, but it was graunted vnto him. Chriſt being borne, a Starre appeared in the Eaſt, which directed the Wiſe-men to him, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed that he ſhould be the light of the world: but <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke</hi> being borne, and ready to bee baptized, his Godmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw a Starre in his forehead, foretelling a new light of the world.

               <p n="77">77. And this is the doctrine of the Romiſh Synagogue at this day; and their practice is correſpondent thereunto: for they kneele vnto the Croſſe, they kiſſe it, they creepe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, they pray vnto it; yea, they repoſe the hope of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in it: as appeareth in that forme of prayer vſed in their Maſſe booke:</p>

               <p>Now that this is heatheniſh Idolatrie, may appeare by theſe reaſons: Firſt, becauſe outward religious adoration is giuen to a piece of wood, or braſſe, or gold, or ſome other matter.<note place="margin">Aug. in Fauſt. lib. 15.</note> Secondly, becauſe diuine worſhip, euen <hi>latria,</hi> which <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith, is proper onely vnto God, is giuen to a creature: for ſuch is the Croſſe, at the beſt. Thirdly, becauſe they pray vnto it, as vnto a liuing thing. Fourthly, becauſe they repoſe the hope of their ſaluation in it. And laſtly, becauſe many, if not all of theſe Reliques, which are beleeued to bee frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſts Croſſe, are falſe and counterfeit; as hath beene ſhewed already.

This is <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 7.</note> owne aſſertion, and it is conſonant to ſound doctrine, confirmed both by manifeſt Scripture, and vniforme conſent of ancient Fathers: for Scripture, Chriſt is ſaid to bee like vnto vs; and not barely like, but like in all things, that is, both in nature, and in the qualities and quantities of nature. And to put the matter out of doubt, onely one thing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7. Heb. 2. 17. Heb. 4. 25.</note> wherin he is not like vnto vs, and that is Sinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is abſolutely left to bee like vnto vs in all other things. And leſt any ſhould thinke, that that was true onely whilſt he was here vpon earth, the Apoſtle in the forenamed places applyeth it to him being in heauen: for hee ſaith, <hi>Wee haue not an High-prieſt which cannot be touched with our infirmities, and therefore let vs boldly goe vnto the throne of grace:</hi> where the Apoſtles argument were of no force, if he were like vnto vs here on earth, onely in the ſtate of his humilitie, and not alſo now, being in heauen, in the ſtate of glory: for ſinfull man might thus reply, True, Chriſt was like our nature whilſt he liued amongſt vs; but now, being glorified, he hath put off our nature, and therefore we dare not preſume to come vnto him. Yes, ſaith the Apoſtle, he is ſtill like vnto vs, and hath not put off our nature, but the infirmities of our nature onely, which were the ſequels of ſinne, as we alſo ſhall doe when we ſhall be tranſlated into heauen after the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this Saint <hi>Luke</hi> more plainely auoucheth, when he
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1727:132"/>
ſaith, that after he had <hi>bleſſed them, he departed from them, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>was carryed vp into heauen: and that whilſt they beheld, he was taken vp by a cloude out of their ſight.</hi> Where we ſee plainely<note place="margin">Act. 1. 9.</note> a locall motion of Chriſt from earth to heauen: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there muſt needs be of him a locall ſituation in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. As alſo Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in expreſſe words doeth affirme, when he ſaith, that <hi>the heauens muſt containe or receiue him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>vntill the time of reſtauration of all things.</hi> Thus this doctrine is conſonant to holy Scripture.</p>

Againe, this body is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in a place, and the ſame body at the ſame inſtant is on the Altar, without being compaſſed about with place: to be in heauen, and to be in earth at one inſtant, are contradictory propoſitions, being vnderſtoode of finite ſubſtances, and not of that infinite eſſence which filleth all places: for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thus much, to be in heauen, and net to be in heauen; to be in earth, and not to be in earth, which be the rules of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke, and Reaſon the mother of Logicke, cannot be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true.

Notwithſtanding the aduocates of the Romiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue labour might and maine in this taske, and by many<note place="margin">Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> arguments endeauour to reunite theſe oppoſitions: firſt, by Gods omnipotency: ſecondly, by the qualities of a glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body: and thirdly, by arguments from the diſcourſe of reaſon. From hence they thus argue, All things are poſſible to God, and therefore this is poſſible; neither is there any thing excepted from the omnipotency of God, ſaue theſe things, <hi>Quae facere non eſt facere, ſed deficere</hi> (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaketh) that is, which to doe, is not to doe, but to vndoe, and doe argue rather impotency then potency, of which ſort (that one body ſhould be in many places at once, is not, ſaith he) becauſe it is not in expreſſe words excepted in Scripture, as to lye and to denye himſelfe are. To this I anſwere, firſt, that albeit the Scripture doth not expreſly except this from Gods omnipotency, to make one body to bee in two places at once, yet implyedly it doth, for it denyeth power or rather weakneſſe to God to doe thoſe things which imply contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 19.</note> of which kinde this is, for one body to be in many places at once. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe ſaith, that this is a<note place="margin">Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>firſt principle in the light of nature, euery thing is, or is not, which being taken away, all knowledge faileth.</hi> Secondly, I anſwere, that the power of God is not ſo much to be conſidered as his will, nor what he can doe, but what he hath reucaled in his word, that hee will doe; for if wee argue from his power to<note place="margin">Tertul. aduerſ. Prax. cap. 10.</note> the effect, <hi>Wee may deuiſe God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>to doe any thing, becauſe he could doe it.</hi> And therefore the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour ſaith, <hi>Dei poſſe, velle eſt, Dei nonpoſſe, nolle.</hi> God can of ſtones raiſe vp Children vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi>)<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 9.</note> Now if any ſhould hence conclude, that any of <hi>Abrahams</hi> children were made of ſtones, in a proper ſpeech, all would thinke him to haue no more wit then a ſtone. And to this accordeth <hi>Theodoret,</hi> when hee ſaith, <hi>That God can doe all</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theod. Dial. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>things which hee will, but God will not doe any of theſe things which are not agreeable to his nature.</hi> But for to make a body to be without quantity, and a quantity to be without dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and dimenſion without a place, that is as much to ſay, a

body without a body, and quantity without quantity, and a place without a place, is contrary to Gods nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot bee agreeable to his will, and ſo hath no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with his power. And laſtly, I anſwere, that it is no good reaſon to ſay, God can doe ſuch a thing, therefore he doth it; but rather thus, God will doe ſuch a thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can doe it: and thus the Scripture teacheth vs to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>Whatſoeuer pleaſed the Lord, that did hee in heauen and in</hi>

to pin vp our Lord in the Heauens, that he cannot be where he pleaſeth. And this is <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> opinion in expreſſe<note place="margin">Aquin. Sum. q. 57. art. 6. ad 3.</note> words, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> as expreſly contradicteth.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Thirdly, by diſcourſe of reaſon hee thus laboureth to reconcile theſe contradictions, and thus diſputeth: God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. c. 3.</note> but one ſimple and inuiſible eſſence, is in infinite places at once, and he might create another world, and fill it with his preſence, and be in two worlds at one inſtant: and the ſoule of man is wholy in euery part of the body, and God is able to conſerue the ſoule in a part that is cut off from the body: therefore it implieth no contradiction to be in two places at once: againe, one place may containe two bodies, and yet be not two places, but one; as when Chriſt roſe out of the graue, the Sepulchre being ſhut; therefore one body may be in two places at once, and yet not two bodies, but one. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there be many other myſteries of religion as ſtrange and difficult to be conceiued as this, and yet are beleeued, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this alſo is to be beleeued as well as they.</p>
               <p n="16">16. A miſerable cauſe ſure that needeth ſuch defences: the weakeneſſe of theſe reaſons argueth the feebleneſſe of the cauſe: for, who knoweth not, but that there is no ſimilitude betweene the infinite God and a finite Creature, nor any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt a Spirit and a body: and that <hi>à poſſe, ad eſſe,</hi> from may bee, to muſt bee, is no good conſequence? Adde that one place cannot hold two bodies, nor euer did, except they were ſo vnited, that in reſpect of place they made but one: And laſtly, that all thoſe myſteries of Religion which he nameth, to wit, the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the Creation, and Annihilation, &amp;c. haue their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in holy Scripture, and therefore are to be receiued as doct ines of truth, though tranſcending the ſpheare of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon: but this ſtrange myſterie of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation hath no ground in Scripture, as he himſelfe confeſſeth:<note place="margin">Bell. de Euchar. lib. 3. cap. 23.</note> and therefore it is not to be beleeued as the other are, without better reaſons then he bringeth for the defence thereof: but like lips, like lettuces; ſuch as the cauſe is, ſuch are the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both nought and weake, as any man may ſee that is not

               <p n="17">17. A third contradiction is alſo in and about the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">3.

by the body of Chriſt, but by the extraordinary power of God; and ſo this inſtance maketh nothing for this purpoſe neither.

               <p n="27">27. Laſtly, it is contrary to their owne diuinity: for they
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1727:138"/>
hold, that the parts of this Sacrament, as of all others, are two, to wit, the matter and the forme: the forme in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Bell de Sacram. lib. 1. cap. 18.</note> is to the whole word of conſecration, together with the ſenſe thereof: the matter is the whole element, with the ſignification thereof.

The wicked either receiue the whole Sacrament, or they receiue it not; if they do, then there is no difference betwixt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and them, for they receiue no more; and why ſhould not they be ſaued then as well as they? if they do not, then either they receiue not Chriſt at all, becauſe we are ſure they receiue the outward Elements: and therfore if any thing be wanting, it muſt needs be the thing ſignified, or there are more parts then theſe two of the Sacrament. Againe thus if the wicked receiue Chriſt in the Sacrament, and yet not the vertue of Chriſt, then they receiue not the whole Sacrament, becauſe the vertue of the Sacrament is in the Sacrament, as the vertue of euery thing is in the thing it ſelfe. And ſo it followeth, that the wicked in the Sacrament receiue Chriſt, and yet not Chriſt the whole Sacrament, and yet but a part of the Sacrament: and that there are but two parts of it, and yet more then two.

               <p n="33">33. Another contradiction in this Article, is this; that they<note place="margin">10.

Both theſe propoſitions they peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily defend, and take it in great ſcorne, that we charge them to be maintayners of works againſt grace: and call vs loud Lyers, in caſting that imputation vpon them. But by their leaues, they maintaine either works againſt grace, or elſe they breathe hote and cold out of one mouth (which the Satyre could not endure) and ſpeake contraries, let them chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the holy Ghoſt himſelfe placeth theſe two, <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> in diametrall oppoſition; <hi>If it be of grace, it is no</hi>

               <p n="34">34 <hi>Bellarmines</hi> exception is, that the Apoſtle here exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth<note place="margin">

To which I anſwere three things: Firſt, that the Apoſtle hath no ſuch diſtinction, but ſpeaketh
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1727:141"/>
generally of all works; and therefore according to the olde rule, <hi>Vbi lex non diſtinguit:</hi> Where the law diſtinguiſheth not, there we muſt not diſtinguiſh. To ſay therefore that it is both by grace and works, is to confront the Apoſtle, and to faſten vpon him a flat contradiction. Yea, it is to extinguiſh grace vtterly: for as it hath beene before alledged out of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> grace is not grace in any reſpect, except it bee free in euery reſpect. Secondly, that the Apoſtle meaneth works af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace, and ſuch as proceed from faith, as well as works of nature, appeareth by another like place; where works are alſo excluded, and oppoſed to the free gift of God, that is, to<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. 8.</note> grace: and that the Apoſtle intendeth works of grace, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the reaſon following in the next verſe (<hi>For we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt to good works.</hi>) Now in this laſt place, works of grace muſt needs be vnderſtood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith, we are created in Chriſt Ieſus vnto them: and therefore the ſame alſo muſt neceſſarily bee meant in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: vnleſſe wee will ſay, that the Apoſtle, or rather the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, diſputes not <hi>ad idem.</hi> Laſtly, I anſwere, that in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> iuſtification, who was the Father of the faithfull, and<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 2.</note> his iuſtification a patterne, how all his ſpirituall poſteritie ſhould be iuſtified, works of grace are excluded: for at that time, of which the Apoſtle there ſpeaketh, <hi>Abraham</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe acknowledgeth: and yet his works are excluded: therefore works of grace are meant by the Apoſtle. I, but replyeth the ſame Cardinall, when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle<note place="margin">Bell. Ibid. c. 19.</note> ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified by faith, and not by works, he excludeth thoſe works which <hi>Abraham</hi> might doe without faith: for they which haue faith, yet doe not alwaies worke by faith: as when they ſinne, or performe meere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall duties, without relation to God. But this is no better then a meere ſhift, without any ground of reaſon or truth: for if it bee true which the Scripture ſaith, that whatſoeuer is not of faith, is ſinne; then thoſe morall works, which hee mentioneth, being not of faith, are no better then ſinnes, and ſo need not to bee excluded by the Apoſtle; for they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themſelues. Beſides, it is manifeſtly falſe, that a iuſt,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:1727:141"/>
and faithfull man, doth any worke, which is not ſinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath not relation vnto God; if not in the particular act, yet in the generall purpoſe of his minde: for, euery morning he prayeth to God for the direction of all his wayes, and that all his works may be ſanctified by his Spirit. And thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that in ſaying, wee are iuſtified by grace, and yet by works too, they ſpeake contraries.</p>
               <p n="35">35. A third contradiction in this Article is about their<note place="margin">11.

Now if it be ſo, then as ſoone as a man hath faith, iuſtification is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and taketh roote in him, euen before he hath any other grace: and if it hath taken roote, then it is eyther whole iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, or a peece thereof: but a peece it cannot be; for it is indiuiſible; therefore, eyther whole or none. For grant there be degrees in iuſtification (as they ſay) which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

they are neuer able to prooue: yet they bee degrees of perſection, not of eſſence: as a man is a man as ſoone as hee is borne, though not a perfect man before hee come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete age, ſtature, and ſtrength. So their ſuppoſed iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is iuſtification in the roote, though not perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, vntill it come to ripe age. I ſpeake in their language, becauſe I deliuer their owne doctrine. Now how can theſe two contraries bee reconciled? Faith alone doth not iuſtify, and yet faith alone doth iuſtify? If they ſay, that they ſpeake of one kinde of faith, and we of another, they ſay nothing to the purpoſe: for euen that any faith alone ſhould iuſtify, is contrary to their owne poſitions, who affirme, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cauſe of our iuſtification, is the inherent righteouſnes of<note place="margin">Bell. de Iuſtif. lib. 1. cap. 18.</note> works: and not the righteouſnes of Chriſt, apprehended by faith.

Can ſinne, which is a tranſgreſſion of Gods law, and ſimply in it owne nature euill, be in any reſpect good, as it is ſinne? But to take cleare away this ſcruple, another of them auoucheth, that they are not onely morally, but euen Theologically good; for he ſaith, that ſuch works as are done<note place="margin">Salmer.

Now, how can ſinnes diſpoſe or prepare a man for iuſtification? is God delighted with ſinnes? Either therefore they are not ſinnes, or they doe not diſpoſe to iuſtification, neither farre nor neere: or which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent contradiction, they are ſinnes and not ſinnes, good and not good, at one time, and in one and the ſame reſpect.

And againe, if they, moſt holy and iuſt men, haue their works intermixed with many veniall ſins, for which they need to cry daily, <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes,</hi> how can they either perfectly fulfill the law of God, or doe ſuch works as may bee able to abide the cenſure of Gods iuſtice, ſeeing Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, that he that tranſgreſſeth one Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note>

and <hi>regular obedience.</hi> Theſe ſuperabounding actions and paſſions of Gods Saints, are the works of ſupererogation, ſpoken of, and magnified ſo much in the Church of Rome: which both are the Churches Treaſure, mingled with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabounding merits of Chriſts paſſion; and are layd vp in a Treaſury, the keyes whereof and diſpenſation is committed to the Pope of Rome, that hee, either by himſelfe or his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, may diſpence them at his pleaſure: that is, to them that will buy the ſame for money: and alſo (as they ſay) are more excellent, and perfect, and meritorious of a greater reward.

But I leaue this to others, who haue, or ſhall meddle in this argument: my taske is to ſhew, how it contradicteth both it ſelfe, and other doctrines of their Religion.</p>
               <p n="44">44. <hi>It ſelfe,</hi> thus: They teach, that works of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Bell.

Secondly, comparing the ſtate of men, obſeruing Euangelicall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, with the ſtate of them that onely yeeld obedience to Precepts: as if a man could be in a higher and happier eſtate then they are, which loue God with all their heart; and their Neighbour as themſelues: which is the ſumme of the Law. And thirdly, (marke this) comparing Counſells with any

precept whatſoeuer, euen with that great Commaundement of the Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi>

Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren labour for ſo much, let them take the more for their ſhares. Hence they conclude, that in reſpect of matter, the Precept is good; but the Counſels better: and in reſpect of<note place="margin">Bell. de Mona h. lib. 2. cap. 7.</note> the end, the fulfilling of Precepts hath a reward; but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of Counſels hath a greater reward. This is their plaine doctrine. And yet neuertheleſſe the ſame men teach, that the perfection of a Chriſtian man conſiſteth eſſentially, in the obſeruation of Precepts: and inſtrumentally, in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation<note place="margin">Bell.

And ſecondly, that the Precepts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie are the ends whereunto Counſels are ordayned: and the works of Counſels are but the way and meanes for the better<note place="margin">Aquin. 2. 2. q. 184. art. 3.

               <p n="45">45. Againe, it croſſeth another of their doctrines thus: They teach, that though the law of God bee poſſible to bee kept by the regenerate, &amp; the works of the faithfull be ſimply and abſolutely iuſt: yet they are mixed with many veniall ſinnes: and therefore there is none ſo iuſt, but that ſinneth ſometimes, and hath neede to vſe that petition in the Lords Prayer daily, <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes.</hi> According to that generall axiome of Sain: <hi>Iames, In many things wee ſinne all.</hi> Yea, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe affirmeth, that the regenerate may fall into many deadly ſinnes, and that hee cannot poſſibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd veniall ſinnes, <hi>Niſi priuilegio ſingulari: But by a ſingular</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:1727:146"/>
                  <hi>priuiledge.</hi> Which priuiledge hee cannot inſtance to haue beene granted to any man liuing or dead, except Chriſt only, who was God &amp; man. Obſerue now the contradiction: (to omit that this neceſſitie of ſinning doth ouerthrow the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of fulfilling the law, and doth imply an impoſſibilitie) how can theſe two extremes be reconciled? The regenerate cannot performe all they ſhould do, &amp; yet do performe more then they ſhould do. They cannot auoyd veniall ſins, and yet can ſupererogate. It is as much as to ſay, that a man is not able to pay his owne debts, but muſt aske pardon for them; &amp; yet hath ability to pay another mans, far greater then his owne. Or, an Archer cannot by any means ſhoot home to the marke &amp; yet with the ſame Bow &amp; Arrowes, ſent forth by the ſame ſtrength of his arme, he can ſhoote farre beyond the marke. He that is tainted and ſtained with many veniall ſinnes, in that reſpect, is not perfect: but hee that doeth ſupererogate, is more then perfect: For ſo they ſay, when they giue a higher<note place="margin">Bell. de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> degree of perfection to theſe works, then to the perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the law. If they ſay, that <hi>veniall ſinnes</hi> doe not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the perfection of good works: I anſwere, that neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they hinder the perfection of the worker: &amp; if they ſtick faſt to the worke it ſelfe, they hinder that alſo: as the leaſt ſpot of inke blemiſheth the whole face, and the lighteſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe diſableth the health of the whole body. Eyther there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt deny them to be ſinnes, and ſo ſpots &amp; defects in the ſoules of the regenerate: or they muſt confeſſe, that they are not ſo perfect as they ſhould be. And how then can they be more perfect then they ſhould be?</p>
               <p n="46">46. Further, they teach, that one degree of ſuperero ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">20. <hi>Contrad.</hi> Bell. de Monach. lib. 2. cap. 8.

From which ground a man may thus argue: If per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1727:146"/>
conſiſt in voluntary pouerty, which is an alienation of all proprietie of worldly goods; then Bſhiops, poſſeſſing Lordſhips and reuenues, are not more perfect then Monks, that haue renounced all: and if Biſhops, poſſeſſing, be more perfect then Monks, not poſſeſſing, then perfection conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the alienation of all proprietie of worldly goods. One or the other muſt needes bee falſe, except hee will place perfection in two contraries: to wit, poſſeſſing, and not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing. And the rather may this abſurditie appeare, becauſe, aske them, why Monks are more perfect then other men? they will anſwere, becauſe they remooue from them all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of their loue to God (in which ranke they place worldly wealth) and conſecrate themſelues wholly to Gods ſeruice. By which reaſon, Biſhops cannot bee more perfect then either they or other men, becauſe they retayne thoſe impediments: and ſo by their doctrine, doe not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate themſelues to Gods ſeruice.</p>

And yet, in truth, they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ſame by another croſſe doctrine of our owne ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions: for the ſame men ſay, that Chriſt hath onely ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the fault of our ſinnes, and the eternall puniſhment due vnto them: but wee our ſelues muſt ſatisfie for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall<note place="margin">Concil.

This is their abſolute doctrine: and yet the ſame men affirme, that Purgatory is ordayned to purge away the<note place="margin">Bell. de Pargat. lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> reliques of ſinnes, which in our life time wee haue not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for: and that many ſinnes ſticke ſo faſt and cloſe vnto vs, that we carry them with vs out of this life, to bee purged in that purging fire.

Or, laſtly, that the ſinne being remitted, yet the temporall puniſhment due vnto it, is to bee payd in Purgatory. To which I reply: firſt, that it is againſt the rule of their owne Religion, that none that are anoynted with this Oyle, ſhould goe to Purgatory:
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1727:148"/>
for then a very ſmall number ſhould goe to that place, ſeeing their Prieſts are ſo diligent, for their owne belly ſake, that they ſeldome ſuffer any to paſſe away without this Paſport. Secondly, for them which barre out the efficacy of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by their owne infidelity or impenitency, not that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fire of the Suburbs, but the deuouring fire of Hell it ſelfe is prepared, as they themſelues acknowledge. And thirdly, if there be not a purging away of ſome filthy ſtaines of ſinnes from the ſoule by that fire, but onely a ſatisfactory puniſhment, why do they call it a Purgatory?

then either the Pope is vnmercifull, if he can, and will not: for who would ſuffer ſuch a number of poore ſoules to bee ſo tormented, when with a word of his mouth he might releaſe them? or, if hee would, and cannot, then their doctrine is falſe of his abſolute Iuriſdiction. Let them chooſe whether they will. But of this, more hereafter. Now to the purpoſe. Some of them hold, that the paynes of Purgatory hold but ten yeeres: ſome, an hundred: ſome, two hundred: they that ſtretch them fartheſt, yet ſay, that they muſt end at the day of Iudgement: becauſe then, all muſt bee Sheepe or Goates, none betwixt both, of middle nature, as <hi>Beliarmine</hi> affirmeth. Well, then, if Purgatory dure no longer, then we ſhall not neede to feare it no more, then that fire which the Philoſopher calls, <hi>Ignis fatuus.</hi> For let any man goe to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and ſay but a prayer of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> printed in a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and he ſhall haue 82000. yeeres pardon: that is longer then the world is like to endure by their owne confeſſion, and therefore longer then needes. This indulgence was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eyghth. Or, if <hi>Venice</hi> be too farre a iourney, let him ſtay at home, and but nod the head at the Name of Ieſus, and hee ſhall haue twenty yeeres pardon for euery time. I would nod twenty times a day if this were true, and that commeth to 7300. in the yeere. O how a man may diſappoint this Purgatory, if he haue any wit in his head! This Indulgence came from Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth. Or, if this be alſo too great a matter, let a man weare but an <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Dei</hi> about his necke, and thinke onely in his heart on the Name of Ieſus at the houre of his death, and hee ſhall haue plenary forgiuenes of all his ſinnes. And for them that are there already, they are helped out daily, or at leaſt may bee, by the Suffrages and Maſſes of thoſe that are aliue: and if any remaine there, the fault is in the Prieſts, that ſay not Maſſes faſt enough: and the reaſon of that is, becauſe they receiue not money faſt enough: for there is the common Prouerbe moſt true, <hi>No penny, no pater noſter.</hi> To conclude,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>and therefore, after the diſſolution of the body and ſoule by death, remayneth onely in the ſoule, and not in the dead body.</hi> But this is firſt falſe: for albeit properly it is the ſoule that ſinneth, yet the body alſo ſinneth, by being an inſtrument of the ſoule in ſinning: and he himſelfe ſaith, that ſome ſinnes cannot bee committed but <hi>a toto compoſite,</hi> by the whole man. And if the bodie doe not ſinne as well as the ſoule, I wonder why it is puniſhed both in this life, with corporall diſeaſes and plagues, and after death, with putrefaction and depriuation of life, and in the day of iudgement, with eternall torment in hell fire. Secondly, if it were ſo, that a dead carkaſſe had no relique of ſinne in it, yet in that it was an inſtrument of ſinne, it is lyable to temporall puniſhment, which is the chiefe ground of Purgatory, as hath beene ſhewed. And therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that either the body goeth to Purgatory as well as the ſoule; or elſe a full ſatisfaction is not made for the temporall puniſhment: or at leaſt, that the fire of Purgatory is but an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary

Now hence thus we reaſon: If the Fathers prayed for them who were in poſſeſſion of bleſſednes, then their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies ſerue nothing for their purpoſe, who affirme, that ſoules in Purgatory are onely benefited by ſuch prayers: and if ſoules in Purgatory bee onely benefited by ſuch

Neyther doth this onely bewray their fraude in miſapplying the authorities of the Fathers: but alſo it implyeth a playne contradiction: for they teach, that though wee ought not to pray for the ſoules of the Saints that are in heauen, yet wee may pray for the reſurrection and glorification of their bodies, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are not tormented in Purgatory, but aſleepe in their graues. And ſo it followeth, that by their doctrine we may not pray at all for the Saints departed, and yet wee may pray for their bodies, which are the one halfe of them. And againe, we may not pray for any that are dead, except they be in Purgatory; and yet we may pray for the bodies of the dead, that are not in Purgatory, but in their graues.</p>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:1727:162"/>
doth reiterate it, then hee doth not apply it: and if hee doth apply it, then hee doth not reiterate: for to reiterate, is to doe againe that which was done before, and to apply, is to make vſe of that which was done, but not to doe it againe. Beſide, if the maſſe bee a repetition, and application of the ſacrifice of the croſſe, then how is it an vnbloudy ſacrifice? can that bloudy ſacrifice bee repeated and applied after an vnbloudy manner? that is aſmuch as to ſay, it is a ſacrifice, and yet not a ſacrifice, eſpecially no propitiatory ſacrifice: ſeeing as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> ſpeaketh, <hi>without the ſhedding of bloud, there is no remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes.</hi> Againe, if the maſſe be a repetition of that bloudy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Chriſt on the croſſe, then it is a repetition of Chriſts death, and a crucifying of him againe; for the ſacrifice of Chriſt, and the death of Chriſt is all one: and if it bee ſo, then it muſt needs be bloudy aſwell as that: for the repetition of a thing, is the doing of the ſame thing againe. And laſtly, if it bee an application of it, then it cannot bee a repetition of it: nor indeed the ſame in <hi>ſpecie</hi> with it; for the application of a thing, is not the thing it ſelfe in any reaſon: and thus theſe diſtinctions are at ciuill warre with each other: and indeed like deadly enemies doe cut each others throats.</p>

This <hi>Caſſander</hi> repeats to haue beene the opinion of the Latine &amp; Greeke Church, for
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1727:163"/>
the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres. What an vpſtart diſtinction then is this of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who notwithſtanding ceaſeth not to bragge that they haue all antiquity on their ſide?</p>
               <p n="25">25. Thirdly, wee haue Saint `<hi>Paul</hi> thus interpreting the words of his Lord and Maſter, who ſpake nothing but by the direction of the Spirit: for whereas our Sauiour ſayth, Drinke yee all of it, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, Let a man examine himſelfe,<note place="margin">1. Cro. 11.</note> and ſo let him eat of this bread, and drinke of this cup. But all muſt examine themſelues before they come to the ſacrament: therefore, all are enioyned to drinke of the Sacramentall cup: let vs chuſe then whom wee will beleeue, whether Saint <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> interprets this <hi>All</hi> one way, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cleane contrary.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Laſtly, reaſon it ſelfe diſapprooueth this expoſition: for firſt I would aske him, whether that which our Sauiour commanded to bee done at his laſt Supper, were to bee done once and no more, or often, euen to the end of the world? If hee ſay once, and no more, the words will confute him which ſay, Doe this in remembrance of me: if often, then by <hi>All,</hi> he meant not the Apoſtles onely; for the Apoſtles liued not till the end of the world. Againe, if by <hi>All</hi> was intended the Prieſts onely, then not onely the people ſhould bee excluded from the cup, but from the bread alſo: for if in theſe words, Drinke ye all of it, hee ſpeaketh to Prieſts onely, then in theſe words, Eat ye all of it, hee ſpeaketh to none but Prieſts: for they are both ſpoken to one and the ſame perſons. And thus the people ſhould haue no part of the Sacrament at all: for the ſame <hi>All</hi> that is in one, is in the other. And to conclude, if the Apoſtles ſtood heere in ſtead of Paſtors or Prieſts, why did they not miniſter the Sacrament? It is the part of a Prieſt, as hee is a Prieſt, to miniſter the Sacrament to others, and when hee receiueth it himſelfe, then hee ſtandeth for a common Chriſtian, and not for a Prieſt, for a ſheepe, not for a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. But they did not miniſter, but receiue; therefore they ſtood not here for Prieſts, but for the whole body of the faithfull. And thus this diſtinction being battered by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:1727:163"/>
of fathers, confeſſion of their owne Doctors, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſtrength of reaſon, doth fall to the ground like <hi>Babel:</hi> and this fift Antitheſis is nothing weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Sophiſtrie.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The Goſpell teacheth, that true repentance, or conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<note place="margin">6 Luk. 24. 47. Act. 26. 18. Mark. 1. 15.</note> to God, is an earneſt ſorrow of heart for ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and faith perſwading that they are certainely remitted for Chriſts ſake. But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition indeed is one of the parts of repentance: but they faine that it meriteth a remiſſion of ſinnes, and to it they adde au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion not commaunded by God, &amp; ſatisfaction, or voluntary workes, by which they ſay, that the puniſhments of ſinne are ſatisfied, &amp; that theſe alſo may be redeemed by money and purſe-penance. All which whole doctrine is very blaſphemous againſt the merit of the Son of God, who onely made ſatisfaction for our ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> heere from diſtinguiſhing, falleth to ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and accuſeth vs of manifeſt lying and falſhood, in laying that to our charge which wee are not guilty of: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the lyar hee, or wee, let the Reader iudge. Firſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that true repentance is not a bare ſorrow of heart for ſin, but ſuch a ſorrow, as is ioyned with, and ariſeth from faith, appeareth by this, becauſe contrition without faith, leads to deſperation, and not to ſaluation, as the wofull examples of <hi>Cain, Eſau,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> declare: and therefore the Romaniſts themſelues doe not exclude all manner of faith from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but onely that faith which apprehendeth remiſſion of ſinnes by Chriſt, which ſpeciall faith, whereby remiſſion of ſinnes is beleeued and obtained, is ioyned with repentance, <hi>Luke 24. 47. Act.</hi> 26. 18. This is our doctrine, and it is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the holy Scripture: though it pleaſeth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to ſay, that it is a bare aſſertion, without Scripture.</p>
               <p n="29">29.

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1727:164"/>
let all the world therefore know, to the eternall ſhame of the Romiſh Religion, that remiſſion of ſinnes, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, by their doctrine, may bee obtained by repentance, without faith, then which, what can bee more oppoſite to the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="30">30. If they reply that they make faith the foundation of repentance, I anſwere, why doe they then exclude it out of repentance? is the foundation no part of the houſe? yes, it is the chiefeſt part: either therefore it is not the foundation of repentance, or els it is neceſſarily required to the eſſence of it; one or the other muſt needs bee falſe: but heere is the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this iniquity: by faith they meane nor a beliefe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſinnes by the bloud of Chriſt, which is the true Euangelicall faith, but a generall perſwaſion of the truth of their Religion, and a particular conceit, that he which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the worke of penance, in the three parts thereof, ſhall thereby obtaine pardon of his ſinnes, and reconciliation with God.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Secondly, whereas hee ſayth, that wee doe not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for the eternall, but for the temporall puniſhments of our ſinnes, either heere in this life, or in Purgatory: hee ſpeaketh nothing for the clearing of their doctrine from oppoſition to the Goſpell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Goſpell teacheth, that Chriſt our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer hath made a full and perfect ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29. 1.

               <p n="34">34. The Goſpell teacheth, that marriage is permitted and<note place="margin">7 Heb. 13. 4. 1.

This is all that S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> words import; which, as they doe not deliuer them from oppoſition to the Goſpell, ſo they manifeſtly imply theſe two concluſions: firſt, that the Synagogue of Rome is not the Church of God, for it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth marriage to Prieſts, not as a leſſer good, but as a thing ſimply euill. And ſecondly, that they maintaine in this their Church that doctrine, which of S. <hi>Paul</hi> is called, The doctrine of Diuels: for they forbid both Meates and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age at ſome times, and to ſome perſons, as things ſinfull and vnlawfull. And whereas the Fathers, almoſt in generall, ſay,<note place="margin">Cyprian. lib. 1. cap. 11. Tertul. lib. de monogam. Coſter. Enchir. cap. 17.</note> that it is better for ſuch as haue vowed continency, to marry, then to fall into the fire of luſt; they conclude filthily, to their eternall diſgrace, It is better for a Prieſt to play the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, and keepe a Concubine, then after his vow of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency to be coupled in wedlocke.</p>
               <p n="39">39. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> couereth her nakedneſſe (whereof he<note place="margin">Bell. quo ſupra.</note> is, as it ſeemeth, ſome what aſhamed) with a figge leafe of a diſtinction: for he ſaith, that fornication is not ſimply bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then marriage, but in reſpect that a man hath before entred into a vow, in which regard to marry after the vow, is a greater ſinne then to commit fornication: and this hee proueth by an example from a married woman, whoſe huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is eyther continually abſent or ſicke, ſo that hee cannot performe the marriage debt vnto her. It is not ſayd vnto her, It is better to marry then to burne; but ſhee ought to keepe her faith to her husband, and by faſting and prayer keepe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and tame the concupiſcence of her nature: and therefore, ſaith hee, that precept or permiſſion, <hi>Let him marry,</hi> is not ſpoken to all, but only to ſuch as are free, and not if they be bound and haue giuen their faith vnto God.</p>

                  </gap> talke of, be onely againſt marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, or againſt all manner of incontinency? If they ſay that it is the vow of chaſtitie, and that it is againſt all manner of incontinency, then how can it bee that it ſhould bee broken more by marriage, then by fornication, by hauing a wife, then by keeping a whore? and that to marry, in reſpect of the vow, ſhould be a greater ſinne, then to commit whoredome? eſpecially, ſeeing marriage is Gods ordinance, and fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the Diuels inſtitution: that an honourable and holy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and this a filthy and vgly ſinne. If they ſay that the vow is againſt marriage onely, then what a Religion is Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that teacheth her people to vow againſt marriage, and not againſt fornication? againſt wiues and husbands, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whores and varlets? Surely that Religion that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth this, cannot be of God.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Secondly, to his example I anſwere: Marriage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be inioyned to her that is married already, albeit her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band bee eyther abſent or impotent: for that is contrary to Gods ordinance, <hi>Mal. 2. 14.

But the vow of ſingle life is not Gods ordinauce, eſpecially in ſo high a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as marriage is: for at the moſt it is but a Council, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other is a flat Precept to all that cannot containe: and beſides, they that are married, may expect the bleſſing of God vpon them, vſing the meanes for their reſtraint in a godly manner, and begging continency at Gods hand; becauſe they are in a calling ordayned by God: but they that are in a vow, who either enter raſhly, or are thruſt in againſt their wills, and contrary to Gods Commandement, not being able to abſtaine, but proudly preſume vpon their owne ſtrength, how can they hope for Gods bleſſing vpon them, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them againſt the temptations of the fleſh? And thus this example, together with the diſtinction it ſelfe, maketh no whit to the iuſtifying of their doctrine; but that it ſtill remayneth in plaine contrariety and oppoſition to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="41">41. The Goſpell teacheth, that there is one true and ſolide<note place="margin">8.</note>

               <p n="42">42. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſtinguiſheth of foundations, and ſaith, that Chriſt is the primary and principall foundation of the Church: but that doth not hinder, but that there may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary foundations: and for proofe thereof he alledgeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 20. where it is ſaid, that we are built the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles: and, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11. 14. where the twelue Apoſtles are made the twelue foundations of the Church.</p>

But thoſe Scriptures ſay, that the twelue Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are twelue precious ſtones, laid one by one vpon Chriſt, and not one vpon another: and twelue foundations equally proportioned to each other, and not one placed vpon the top of another: and ſo it is true, that as the prerogatiue of the onely ſingular foundation belongeth to Chriſt, ſo the honour of being ſecundary foundations, is equally deuided among the twelue Apoſtles: and ſo <hi>Peter</hi> in this reſpect hath no greater prerogatiue then the reſt. And therefore this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction deliuers them not from the ſnare, ſeeing that it maketh all the twelue Apoſtles altogether ioynt-foundations of the Church: and they would haue <hi>Peter</hi> to bee the onely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation next vnto Chriſt, vpon whom both the Church of

But the Romaniſts would not haue the doctrine of <hi>Peter,</hi> but the perſon of <hi>Peter</hi> to be this foundation: and for proofe thereof <hi>Bellarmine</hi> fetcheth this argument from the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Behold, I will lay in Sion a ſtone, a ſure foundation:</hi> which is a playne and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Prophecie of Chriſt, and not of <hi>Peter,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himſelfe expoundeth it: where, by the way, we may note the feareful outrage of theſe Romiſh Rabbies againſt the truth of God, and the God of truth, whilſt, to the end they may aduance their Popes dignity by <hi>Peter,</hi> they wreſt and peruert the Scriptures, and apply the Prophecies belonging to the Sonne of God, to his ſeruant <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo make <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nay, the holy Ghoſt, a Lyar. It were not credible, that ſuch blaſphemous thoughts and words ſhould neſtle in the heart, and iſſue out of the mouth of any, but that the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath fore-told vs, that in the time of Antichriſt, <hi>becauſe men would not receiue the loue of the truth, that they</hi>

               <p n="45">45. Thirdly, I anſwere, that both in truth, and alſo in proprietie of ſpeech, there can bee but one foundation of

one building: thoſe ſtones that are layd next to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not properly a ſecundary foundation, but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the building vpon the foundation: and for that cauſe, when <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles are called twelue foundations, it cannot bee vnderſtood, that they were any wayes properly foundations of the Church, either firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond: but that our Sauiour, who is the ſubſtance and ſubiect of their doctrine, is the onely true and ſingular foundation of the Church, and that there is none other beſides him: for if, when it is ſaid that we are built vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, is meant the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as muſt needes bee, becauſe the Prophets are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together with the Apoſtles, which liued not in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and therefore could not be perſonall foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, and Chriſt crucified is the ſubſtance of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: then it muſt needes follow, that the Apoſtles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is nothing elſe, but that we are built vpon Chriſt, whom the Prophets and the Apoſtles preached and beleeued in. And thus S. <hi>Hilary</hi> vnderſtood it, and Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Anſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>

               <p n="47">47. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> heere firſt confeſſeth, and ſecondly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth: hee confeſſeth, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power ouer all other Biſhops and the whole Church: and denyeth that eyther thoſe places here quoted, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe prooue the contrary.</p>
               <p n="48">48.

               <p n="49">49. Secondly, whereas he ſaith, that though the power of remitting and retayning finnes, and binding and looſing, was communicated to all the Apoſtles, yet <hi>Peter</hi> was ordayned chiefe Paſtor ouer them all; becauſe our Sauiour Chriſt ſayd vnto him alone, <hi>Feede my ſheepe:</hi> and, <hi>To thee will I giue the Keyes of the Kingdome of heauen:</hi> I anſwere, that in this hee croſſeth both himſelfe, the Fathers, and the truth: himſelfe, for elſewhere hee confeſſeth, that the keyes, both of Order<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom.

And againe, hee acknowledgeth that all the Apoſtles had both power and commiſſion to feede the ſheepe of Chriſt, when (<hi>Mat.</hi> 28.) he bade them all, <hi>Goe, teach and baptize:</hi> and they all did put that commiſſion in execution: therefore it muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that no ſingular power was giuen to <hi>Peter,</hi> when as Chriſt ſaid vnto him, <hi>Feede my ſheepe,</hi> vnleſſe we will ſay, that the reſt had not the ſame commiſſion.</p>

               <p n="51">51.

               <p n="52">52. Thus hee confeſſeth their doctrine: next he commeth to diſtinguiſh of it, namely, that their Apoſtolicall power was equall in reſpect of the people, but yet not equall betweene themſelues; in which reſpect <hi>Peter</hi> was not onely a common Paſtour with his fellow Apoſtles, but extraordinarily <hi>paſtor paſtoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> a Paſtour of the Paſtours, that is, of the Apoſtles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: this is his diſtinction: but it is idle and vaine, as may appeare by this reaſon: becauſe, if he were the chiefe Paſtour of the Apoſtles, then he either ordained them to their offices, or fed them with his doctrine, or gouerned them by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or did ſome part of the office of a Paſtour vnto them: but hee neither ordained them; for Chriſt himſelfe did that:<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 21.

               <p n="57">57. His ſecond diſtinction is that Chriſt is called the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mediatour, becauſe hee is the Mediatour, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his office, but alſo of his nature, for that hee is in the middeſt betwixt God and man, hee himſelfe beeing God and man. To which I anſwere, that it is moſt true which hee ſayth, but yet it is both contrary to that which hee himſelfe hath deliuered elſewhere, and alſo ouerthroweth that which hee holdeth heere: for the firſt, he laboureth to proue in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, that Chriſt is the Mediatour onely in reſpect of his humane nature, and here hee ſayth, in reſpect of both natures:
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1727:170"/>
how can theſe bee reconciled? mary, by another diſtinction: <hi>It is one thing</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>to bee a Mediatour in reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>

                  <hi>and another thing in reſpect of operation: in the firſt, Chriſt is the Mediatour by both natures in the ſecond, by his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture onely.</hi> As if hee did not operate and worke the Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſame reſpect that hee is Mediatour. I, but hee will ſay, the chiefe worke of our redemption was the death of Chriſt, but the God-head cannot dye: therfore, &amp;c. I anſwere, Though Chriſt died as he was man, yet the perſon that died, was God and man: for (as <hi>Tolet</hi> his fellow Ieſuite and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall<note place="margin">Tolet. comment. in Iob. 10.</note> obſerueth) Chriſt dyed not as other men, in whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it is not, either to hold the ſoule in the body, or to recall it backe againe, being expelled: but Chriſt ioyned his ſoule and body together at his pleaſure: as hee that holding a ſword in one hand, and a ſcabbard in another, puls it out, or thruſts it in at his pleaſure. By which it is plaine, that though Chriſt dyed in reſpect of his man-hood, yet the author of his death was his God-head, &amp; ſo he is our Mediatour in both natures. Secondly, he ouerthroweth his own poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by this diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for firſt, if Chriſt bee the only Mediatour in reſpect of office and of nature; then the Saints are no wayes our Mediatours: for if they bee, they muſt bee one of theſe two wayes, vnleſſe wee will ſay, that they doe that which belongs not vnto them, but like buſy-bodies, are pragmaticall in anothers charge: which, farre bee it from vs to thinke of thoſe bleſſed creatures; but both theſe wayes (he ſayth) Chriſt is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mediatour; therefore the Saints, by his owne concluſion, are no Mediatours at all.</p>
               <p n="58">58. His third diſtinction is, that therefore Chriſt is called the onely Mediatour, becauſe hee prayeth for all, and none for him: but the Saints are ſuch Mediatours, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtand in need of a Mediatour. I anſwere, that therefore they are no Mediatours at all: for if the Saints in Heauen ſtand in need of a Mediatour themſelues, then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that they are not Mediatours at all: for they that are parties, cannot bee vmpiers.

               <p n="63">63. But this diſtinction firſt vndermineth it ſelfe: for if Chriſts bee a ſatisfaction, then it is an actuall ſatisfaction: if it bee not an actuall one, then it is none at all. Did not he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dye, and riſe againe? Did not hee actually by that death of his, ſatisfy Gods iuſtice for all the Elect?

at the commaundement ofthe Pope. This is the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that man, who was authoriſed firſt to write by Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth, and after, his Booke was ſet foorth, by the priuiledge of <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth. So that here we haue two Popes maintayning this doctrine. <hi>Clement</hi> the firſt was of the ſame minde, who affirmeth, that hee, and<note place="margin">Clement. lib. 2. de ſentent. &amp; re iudicat. can. 2.</note> the reſt of the Popes, had a ſoueraignity and ſuperiority ouer the Empire: and vpon that ground he diſſanulled all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Proceſſes made by <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth Emperour. And ſo alſo was <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth, who in that famous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,<note place="margin">Extrauag. Com. lib. 1. de maior. &amp; obedient. c. vnam Sanctam.</note> 
                  <hi>Vnam ſanctam, &amp;c.</hi> directly affirmeth, that the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall authority muſt be ſubiect to the Spirituall: and that it is neceſſary to ſaluation, to beleeue that euery humane creature is ſubiect to the Pope of Rome. Now the reſt of the Popes muſt needes be of the ſame minde, or elſe they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne theſe of error, and that ſpeaking definitiuely, which is contrary to their Religion. And ſo indeede that they are, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> their Champion, in his late Booke againſt <hi>Barclay</hi> the Lawyer, doth manifeſtly declare, who moſt impudently maintayneth this poſition with all his wit againſt that learned man: as alſo in his laſt doting Apologie againſt our King, wherein, without doubt, he is authoriſed, and as it were tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on the backe, and called, A good childe, by the Popes Holineſſe himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="72">72. Thus we ſee this doctrine maintayned by the Popes and their Lawes. Let vs ſee alſo what the Cardinalls and the Ieſuites ſay vnto it. Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> a notable clawer of<note place="margin">Baronius.</note> the Popes, holdeth, that the Pope hath power directly ouer Princes, agreeing with <hi>Bozius</hi> and <hi>Triumphus:</hi> but Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> with others on his ſide, quallifieth the matter, and<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pontif. lib. 5. cap. 4 &amp; 5.</note> ſaith, that the Popes power ouer Princes in temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is not direct, but indirect, as depending vpon his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power, and in order &amp; relation vnto that. Let vs leaue theſe<note place="margin">Greg. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alen. tom. 3. Com. Tollet. in Ioh. cap. 21.</note> two Cardinalls fighting about direct &amp; indirect, and come to the other Ieſuites. <hi>Gregory de Valentia</hi> ſaith, that the Pope is ſubiect to none; but that by a certaine hereditary right he is exempted from all humane juriſdiction. <hi>Tollet</hi> affirmeth, that there may bee in the Church many holier and learneder then
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:1727:172"/>
the Pope, but none ſuperior or equall vnto him in dignitie. <hi>Turrian</hi> the Ieſuite ſaith, that Chriſt hath tranſlated all his<note place="margin">Turrian. de Eccleſ. l. 1. c. 3.</note> Kingdome on earth vpon the Pope, who beareth his perſon, and carryeth his Image. And laſtly, all of them, like lines in a circle, meeting in a Center, ioyne in this, that the Pope hath power to depoſe Kings, to tranſlate Kingdomes, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them vpon others, if it ſeeme to him neceſſary for the good of mens ſoules.</p>
               <p n="73">73. Thus we haue their doctrine concerning their Head, the Pope. Now let vs heare what they ſay touching the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that hangs vpon his head, their Clergie: <hi>Kings are not now any more Soueraignes ouer Clerks</hi> (faith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>) <hi>and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bell. de Cleric. cap. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore Clerks are not bound to obey them by Gods law or mans, except it be in reſpect of directiue lawes.</hi> And <hi>Emanuel Sa.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,<note place="margin">Emanuel. Sa. Aphoriſ. confeſ. verb. Cler.</note> that <hi>a Clergie man cannot be a Traytor, though hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, becauſe he is no ſubiect.</hi> And it was long agoe the doctrine of the Fryers; continued by the Ieſuites, that the <hi>King was not Lord ouer the Clergie; but that the Pope was their Lord: and therefore though a Clergie man had committed theft,</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or treaſon, yet hee ought not to bee called in queſtion, much leſſe puniſhed for it by a temporall Magiſtrate: but<note place="margin">Houeden. Hen. 2</note> ought to be iudged by Eccleſiaſticall Iudges, &amp; in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Court: and if hee were conuict, hee ſhould loſe his Orders, and ſo being excluded from Office &amp; Benefice Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiaſticall: if after this he incurred the like fault, then might he be iudged at the pleaſure of the King: yea, they goe ſo farre,<note place="margin">Maynard de Priuiledg. eccleſ. art. 17. nu. 10.</note> that if any offence were committed by diuers perſons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom there were one Clergie man, none of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders were ſubiect to temporall iuriſdiction. And thus we ſee, that neyther the Pope nor his Clergie will bee ſubiect to theſe higher Powers, to which the Goſpell commaundeth all men to ſubmit themſelues.</p>
               <p n="74">74. How will they diſtinguiſh here? Mary, they haue two diſtinctions to helpe this doctrine out of the myre, and yet all too weake. Firſt, they ſay, that when the Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> commanded euery ſoule to bee ſubiect, &amp;c. they meane generally, that all ſubiects ſhould obey their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:1727:172"/>
whether Spirituall or Temporall: and not that euery<note place="margin">Bell. de Rom. Pontif. l. 2. c. 29.</note> one ſhould particularly bee ſubiect to the King or ſecular power: which interpretation is firſt flat contrary to the text: for both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> mention expreſſely Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſuch as haue the right of the ſword: which they would neuer haue done, if Kings ſhould haue beene ſubiect to Popes, and not Popes to Kings: for then they would haue inſtanced in Popes, and not in Kings: and though Chriſtians were falſely accuſed of treaſon and rebellion to Princes, yet this could not be a ſufficient reaſon to mooue the Apoſtles to conceale ſo neceſſary a truth, eſpecially ſeeing they write to Chriſtians and not to Infidels.</p>
               <p n="75">75. Secondly, it is contrary to reaſon: for if <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo the Pope, his pretended ſucceſſor, had beene in their iudgement ſuperiors to Kings, then ſurely <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, writing not onely to the people, but alſo to the Elders of the Church, as appeareth, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. would neuer haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned them all to the obedience of the Ciuill Magiſtrate, but would haue reſerued ſome to his owne iuriſdiction, and bidden them all, both Magiſtrate and people, to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto him, as the head of the Church: or if he for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie might forbeare this imperiall iniunction; yet, without queſtion, <hi>Paul</hi> (had he beene of that minde) would not haue ſent euery ſoule to bee ſubiect to Kings, but would haue told them, that Kings and all ſhould be ſubiect to <hi>Peter:</hi> but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that neither of them both doth it, neither here nor elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and it is, as they thinke, ſo neceſſary a thing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued of all men, it is moſt euident that they neuer meant it.</p>
               <p n="76">76. Thirdly, and laſtly, whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth euery ſoule to be ſubiect, wee may conclude, that if the Pope be a ſoule, or haue a ſoule (for ſome of them haue thought that a man had no more a ſoule then a beaſt) then he muſt be ſubiect. And this concluſion a learned man, that was<note place="margin">

               <p n="77">77. Secondly, they diſtinguiſh vpon that place of <hi>Iohn,</hi> where our Sauiour confeſſeth himſelfe to be vnder the power of Pilate, to be iudged by him, and ſay, that eyther it is to bee vnderſtood of a permiſſiue power graunted by God, without the which, no not ſinnes can be committed: with <hi>Cyrill</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> or, if of the power of iuriſdiction, with <hi>Auguſtins</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> that then <hi>Pilate</hi> had power ouer Chriſt, not ſimply, but by accident: to wit, as he was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee a priuate Iew, and ſo no more then a meere man: by which ignorance of the perſon, his power was iuſtified to be lawfull: as if a Ciuill Magiſtrate ſhould condemne a Clerke in the habite of a Lay man, not knowing him to be a Clerke, he ſhould be free from blame. To which I anſwere: Firſt, that the power of the Emperour, though a heathen, was lawfull, and ordayned by God, as they themſelues confeſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as the Scriptures in many places prooue: but <hi>Pilates</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> power was from the Emperour, therefore it was a lawfull, &amp; not a lawleſſe power; and ſo not only by permiſſion, but alſo by ordination. Secondly, if it were onely a power by permiſſion, then <hi>Pilate</hi> had ſinned in executing that power vpon Chriſt: but becauſe of the miſtaking of the perſon, therefore hee ſaith, he was free from fault: as a Ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that ſhould iudge a Clerke, taking him for a Lay man. And ſo one part of his anſwere croſſeth the other. Laſtly, I anſwere, that though <hi>Pilate</hi> might erre in the perſon of Chriſt, yet Chriſt could not erre in the power of <hi>Pilate,</hi> who affirmeth of it plainely, that it was of God; and ſo it was indeede, in reſpect of the power it ſelfe, though the abuſe of it, in the condemning of an Innocent, was a ſinne: and ſo from the Diuell, and not from God.</p>
               <p n="78">78. The Goſpell teacheth, that before regeneration wee<note place="margin">14. Epheſ. 2. 1. Rom. 6. 13. Luk. 15. 31. &amp; 9. 60.</note> are dead in ſinne, and haue no more power to mooue in any worke of grace, then a dead carkaſſe hath in the works of

All this they affirme: then which, what can bee more contrary to the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, which ſaith, that wee are ſtarke dead in ſinne, and are not able to thinke a good thought of our ſelues: but that all our ſufficiency is in God, and that he worketh in vs both the will and the deed, &amp;c?</p>
               <p n="79">79. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> heere likewiſe endeuoureth to eſcape by<note place="margin">Bell. de grat. &amp; lib. arbit. l. 6. c. 13.</note> a double diſtinction: Firſt, he ſaith, that a ſinner, becauſe he is ſpiritually dead, cannot of himſelfe, or by his owne power, recouer life, or prepare himſelfe thereunto: but yet being preuented and helped by grace, he may cooperate with God that quickneth him: for that he doth not, as being dead, but as hauing a vitall vertue inſpired into him by God.</p>
               <p n="80">80. For anſwere whereunto, let me propound vnto him this queſtion, namely, Whether this ſpirituall life, which is the firſt degree of a ſinners conuerſion, bee inſpired into him altogether by the Spirit of God, without the helpe of his owne will? or whether it ariſeth partly from grace, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his will. If he ſaith, Altogether from the Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of his will: then how doth the ſinner coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with God in his firſt conuerſion? If he ſay, Partly from grace, and partly from free-will: then how is the ſinner dead, when yet he doth worke towards the obtayning of his owne life? Can a dead man cooperate at all, much more towards his owne life? I, but hee is preuented and excited to grace, and ſo doth worke: but then I would know, whether in that firſt exciting and ſtirring vp, hee doth worke with Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? whether he be actiue in that firſt motion, or paſſiue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? If actiue, then hee is not dead: if paſſiue, then the firſt
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:1727:176"/>
degree of his conuerſion and ſpirituall life is only from grace, without the coadiution of this free-will: for this excitation and ſtirring vp of his will, is the firſt ſparke of ſpirituall life in a ſinner; and this is that which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirmeth, ſaying,<note place="margin">Aug. de grat. &amp; lib. arbiter. c. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>that God without vs worketh in vs to will,</hi> (that is the firſt ſparke of life:) <hi>then worketh with vs, and helpeth vs when we doe will,</hi> (this is the ſecond.) And againe, <hi>The will is firſt changed from</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem. cap. 20. Idem. Enchirid. cap. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>euill to good, and helped when it is good.</hi> And againe, <hi>He prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the good will that is to be helped; and helpeth it when it is prepared.</hi> In all which paſſages, the firſt conuerſion of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is aſcribed to God alone, and mans will is a dead thing that mooueth not: but the ſucceeding works are attributed ioyntly to God and vs. And this is the very doctrine of the Goſpell: which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> plainely croſſeth by his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though ſubtilly hee ſeemeth to doe nothing leſſe: for he ſaith plainely in another place, that <hi>in the act of our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>

                  <hi>will is truely free, and determineth it ſelfe, though God moue and apply it to the worke.</hi> And another compareth the will to <hi>an eye in a darkeplace,</hi> which though it ſee not, yet can ſee as ſoone as light commeth, becauſe in it ſelfe it hath the faculty of ſeeing: then which, what can bee more contrary to the Goſpell? the one affirming, that a ſinner is dead before his regeneration: the other, that he is but halfe dead, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and hath ſome power, and therefore life in himſelfe to grace and rghteouſnes.</p>
               <p n="81">81. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> perceiuing the weaknes of this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, flyeth for ſuccour to another: and that is, though a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be dead to grace, yet hee is aliue to nature; and ſo is not altogether dead: and that by the power of that naturall life, hee being helped by grace, can cooperate with God in his conuerſion: and therefore that the ſimilitude of a dead man doth not in euery reſpect agree vnto the vnregenerate; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a dead man hath no life in him at all; but a man vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate hath notwithſtanding the life of nature in him. But this is more abſurd then the former: for, firſt it is plaine, that the vnregenerate are as dead in reſpect of grace, as a dead carkaſſe is in reſpect of nature: for they haue no more ability
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:1727:176"/>
to the workes of grace, then a dead man to the workes of nature. A dead man hath no appetite or deſire to naturall things: no more hath the vnregenerate to ſpirituall things. A dead man hath no vnderſtanding of the things of this world: no more hath the vnregenerate of the things that are of God. A dead man cannot moue the members of the body, nor vſe the naturall ſaculties of the ſoule: no more can the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate mooue one haire bredth to Heauen-ward, nor vſe any graces of the Spirit. A dead man hath no ſenſe, nor feeling, though hee bee neuer ſo ſharply handled, ſeeth not, though the Sunne ſhineth neuer ſo bright, heareth not, though a trumpet be ſounded in his eare: no more can the vnregenerat feele the wounds of Gods Lawes, heare the ſound of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, nor ſee the cleare light of truth that ſhinethround about him. Laſtly, in a dead man, there is a ſeparation of the ſoule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body: ſo, in the vnregenerate, there is a ſeparation of Gods Spirit from the ſoule, which is the ſoule of the ſoule. For this cauſe S. <hi>Aug.</hi> likened the vnregenerate man, to the Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites<note place="margin">Aug. de verbis Apoſtol. ſer. 11.</note> ſonne, beeing dead, whom the Prophet <hi>Elizeus</hi> raiſed from death, to life; and others, to <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſtinking in the graue, or, to the widowes ſonne of <hi>Nai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>,</hi> lying dead; vpon the beare; or, to <hi>Iairus</hi> daughter, that was dead in the houſe: noting three degrees of ſinnes, one more notorious then the other, yet all in the ſtate of death, vntill Chriſt by his Spirit ſhall inſpire life into them: and this is the perfect analogy and proportion, betwixt a dead man, and a ſinner: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bellarmines</hi> exception is falſe, that they doe not agree in all things: for there is nothing, wherein they doe agree, not, if the compariſon bee rightly proportioned.</p>
               <p n="82">82. Secondly, if they did diſagree in other things, yet in this, wherein lyeth the life of the ſimilitude, they muſt needs agree, that as a dead man hath nothing, whereby he can helpe himſelfe, for the recouery of his life: ſo man ſpiritually dead, hath nothing in him, no faculty, or power of the ſoule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he can any way further the obtaining of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this was Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> opinion, agreeable to the Goſpell:<note place="margin">Aug. de grat. &amp; lib. arbit. cap. 5.</note> for his words are plaine, concerning <hi>Pauls</hi> conuerſion, that he

was called from Heauen, and by that mighty and effectuall calling conuerted. <hi>Gratia Deiſolaerat: It was onely the grace of God.</hi> And no otherwiſe did <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> conceiue<note place="margin">Iuſtin.

               <p n="83">83. Thirdly, and laſtly, it is moſt abſurd of all, which hee ſayth, that becauſe a ſinner liueth naturally, therefore he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth towards grace, more then a dead carkas to nature, which hath no life at all: for in reſpect of grace, it is all one to haue no life at all; and to haue no life of the Spirit. For nothing can worke aboue the compaſſe of it owne beeing. Naturall life cannot tranicend the Spheare of nature, nor any way moue to the Spheare of grace. For as Plants that liue the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatiue life, cannot ariſe to the ſenſitiue life, which is in beaſts, nor they to the rationall, which is in men: So neither can theſe ariſe vp any whit to the life of the Spirit, which is in Gods Saints, till a new life bee inſpired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: which new life, as it is the conuerſion of the ſoule to God, ſo it is the foundation of all ſpirituall actions, ſeeing life in euery kinde is the foundation of all the actions in that kind. For vntill there bee life in a plant, it doth not grow, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it bee in a beaſt, it doth not moue nor feele, vntill in a man, hee doth not thinke, ſpeake, or remember; and ſo vntill this life of the Spirit bee in the ſoule, it cannot will, nor worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that is good. Therefore I conclude, that though a ſinner liue naturally, yet beeing dead to grace, that that life doth no more helpe to his conuerſion, then the ſenſitiue life of a beaſt doth to the obtaining of reaſon, or the vegetatiue<note place="margin">15 Ioh. 5. 39.

But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, that all men muſt not read the Scripture, to wit, Laymen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they bee permitted by their Ordinary, becauſe pearles are not to bee caſt amongſt ſwine: nor a ſword, or a knife put into a childes hand; nor occaſion of errour offered to the ignorant, nor matter of offence to the weake: as alſo, becauſe they are more obſcure then can bee vnderſtood of the Laicks, and common ſort of people. Thus they paint ouer the foule wrinkled face of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> with falſe colours: but yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety is plaine. All ought to read the Scriptures: and ſome ought not to read the Scriptures. The one is the doctrine of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> The other, of the Pope and his Church.</p>
               <p n="85">85. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſtinguiſheth two wayes. Firſt, that there is a double way of knowing the Scriptures; one by hearing, and another by reading. The firſt is commanded to all, and therefore neceſſary to be vſed of all. But this laſt is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to any, but to the Clergie, and thoſe whom they ſhall thinke fit to read them with profit, and without danger. But who ſeeth not, that when our Sauiour willeth to ſearch the Scriptures, hee ſpeaketh of reading? And when the Bereans examined <hi>Pauls</hi> ſermon by the Scriptures, they did it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. And when <hi>Abraham</hi> remitteth <hi>Diues</hi> brethren to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, hee ſendeth them to reading. For <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets were dead in their perſons, and liued onely in their writings. And laſtly, when the Apoſtles wrote their Epiſtles to the ſeuerall Churches, they wrote them to this end, that they might bee read of all. For ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth the Coloſſians, after they had read the Epiſtle, that they themſelues would cauſe it alſo to bee read in the Church of the Laodiceans. Beſides, if it bee a dangerous thing for the ignorant to read the Scriptures, for feare they ſhould peruert the ſenſe, &amp; ſo fal into hereſie, or impiety; then
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:1727:178"/>
much more dangerous is the hearing of it, ſeeing there is no preaching ſo pure as the word it ſelfe; man euer mixing ſome dregs of his own corruption, with the pure wine of the word; nor any preacher ſo ſincere, but he doth often erre: and ſo the hearer being debarred from trying his doctrine by the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the Scripture, muſt needs irrecouerably fall into errour.</p>
               <p n="86">86. Secondly, hee ſayth that there are two kindes of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.<note place="margin">Bell. quo ſupra.</note> One that read with fruit and profit; others that read without fruit, yea rather with hurt. Now the Scripture may bee read of the firſt, but not of the ſecond. But I would know of him againe, who hath that power to diſcerne betwixt theſe two. Doe they know the heart of a man? Or, can they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of that which is to come? If they cannot doe theſe things, then they ought not to locke vp the Scriptures from any, vpon this ſurmiſe; but permit the vſe of that which is good to all, and leaue the ſucceſſe to God. Againe, becauſe ſome peruert the Scripture to their damnation, ſhall therefore all bee forbidden to reape comfort by it? Becauſe the theefe robs, and kils with his ſword, ſhall not therefore an honeſt man vſe one for his owne defence? Becauſe the Spider ſucks vp poyſon out of the flowre, therefore ſhall not the Bee ſuck honey? This is to take away the vſe of all good things. For as the Poet ſayth, <hi>Nil prodeſt quod non laedere poſſit idem:</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">Ouid. de triſt. lib. 2.</note> ſo profitable in the vſe, but in the abuſe may be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and nuiſant.</p>
               <p n="87">87. Laſtly, are the ignorant common people more ſubiect<note place="margin">Eſpe.ſ. us com. in tit. c. 1. &amp; 2.</note> to erring and hereſie, then the learned? Let <hi>Eſpenſaeus,</hi> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Biſhop of their owne, informe him to the contrary. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>that an Italian Biſhop told me, that his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men were ſcarred from reading the Scriptures, leſt they ſhould become heretikes:</hi> as if hereſies did ſpring from the ſtudy of the Scriptures, and not rather from the neglect and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them. And if he will not beleeue him, let another<note place="margin">Alphouſ. de caſt. haereſ. l. 1. cap. 13 Maldon. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangel.</note> learned Roman ſi ſtep out &amp; tel him, that <hi>very few ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were the authors of hereſie:</hi> &amp; another, that <hi>learned men, &amp; indued with great wits, fall by their pride into hereſie:</hi> ſo that he

need not ſo much feare, leſt hereſie ſhould build her neſt in the boſome of the poore ignorant man, as leſt like the Eagle ſhee ſhould flye aloft, and ſet her ſelfe in the top of the high Cedars of the Church.</p>
               <p n="88">88. But what doe I ſtand to ouerthrow this vaine excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince it is no better then a meere deception, confuted by the practice of their owne Church? for without difference, any that will pay for it, beeing neuer ſo ignorant, might haue a licence to read the Scriptures. And we had heere in <hi>England</hi> in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, a Romiſh indulgence, that hee that<note place="margin">

So that is as cleare as the day, that it is not the fruit and benefit that ſhould come to the Reader, that they regarded, but the profit and gaine that ſhould accrue to their owne purſes: neither was the feare of erring the cauſe of their prohibition: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the feare of too much knowledge, leſt thereby the groſſe and foule abominations of their Church ſhould bee diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſo come to bee abhorred and deteſted.</p>
               <p n="89">89. The Goſpell teacheth, that none can forgiue ſins, but<note place="margin">16 Eſay 43. 25. luk. 5. 21.</note> God: becauſe ſinne is a preuarication of Gods Law; and therefore none can remit it, but hee againſt whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

And that therefore God abſolueth differently from the Church; God by remitting the ſinne, &amp; purging the ſoule from the blemiſh thereof, and freeing it from eternall puniſhment; the Church by declaring who are abſolued by God. By which not onely his opinion is manifeſt, that the Prieſt hath no abſolute power of abſoluing a ſinner, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of declaring that hee is abſolued, which is our doctrine: but alſo his reaſon is inuincible, that becauſe the Prieſt may erre in his abſolution; therefore hee hath no ſuch abſolute power committed vnto him.

For they do not profeſſe any other abſolution, but ſuch as may be hindered by the party to by abſolued, to wit, if by want of faith, or repentance, he put an inuiſible bar to ſtop the power thereof. Now, if the ſinner may hinder his own abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then the Prieſt hath no power to abſolue him, except he be fitly diſpoſed for the receiuing of it; &amp; this diſpoſition is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God: and therefore in God is the onely power to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue; and in the Prieſt, onely to declare who is abſolued, and that conditionally, if h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For if the power of abſoluing, or not abſoluing, depend vpon the putting in, or taking away the barre of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency; then he onely can iudicially abſolue a ſinner, that can giue him repentance: but neyther the Pope, nor any mortall man is able to doe this, as the Scripture teſtifieth in many places: and therefore neyther Pope nor Prieſt can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue a ſinner any further then by a declaratiue ſentence.</p>

Both the one and the other therefore, namely, their direct oppoſition to the Goſpell on the one ſide, and their elaborate diflinctions, to make good their cauſe on the other, doth euidently euince the concluſion of this ninth demonſtration, that that Religion, which is built vpon ſuch deſperate and dangerous principles, cannot be the truth of Chriſt, but the doctrine and Religion of Antichriſt.</p>

If they ſay, that the people muſt be content for their knowledge to depend vpon their Prieſts, and to draw it from their lippes, and ſo by that meanes may attayne a ſufficient meaſure of inſtruction: I anſwere, that the Prieſts are for the moſt part as ignorant as the people, as ſhall be ſhewed afterward: and if any be furniſhed with gifts, yet they ſeldome teach the people; and when they doe, they preach, in ſtead of Gods word, their owne inuentions, idle tales, and meere tales, and fables: witneſſe <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi>

Why is it not lawfull to examine them by that rule? and why ſhould all Bookes elſe, which any thing make againſt their Religion, be ſuppreſſed? and by great penalties forbidden?

               <p n="16">16. This is their Doctrine. Now what fruits doth it bring foorth? Surely the beſt fruit is ignorance, a worſe then that error, and the worſt of all ſuperſtition and and idolatry: for howſoeuer, we deny not that there may be an hiſtoricall and ciuill vſe of Pictures, either to put vs in minde of our abſent friends, or to repreſent ſome obſeruable hiſtory and notable deede done, or to ſtirre vs vp to the imitation of the vertues of Godly men and women: yet we conſtantly affirme, that to make them the Bookes of Lay men, either to be inſtructed by them alone, without the Booke of God, or to finde better and more perfect inſtruction in them then in it, is to inwrap the people in a cloude of foggie and miſtie ignorance, and to hood-winke their eyes, that they ſhould not ſee the bright ſhining light of truth: for where is all ſound &amp; ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to bee found, but in the holy Scripture? whither doth our Sauiour Chriſt ſend his Diſciples, but vnto them? he doth
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:1727:188"/>
not ſay vnto them, Gaze vpon Pictures, <hi>for they be they that teſtifie of me:</hi> and, <hi>In them yee ſhall finde eternall life:</hi> but, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for, &amp;c.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> that <hi>it is the Law of God that giueth wiſedome vnto the ſimple; and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 7. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>that conuerteth the ſoule, and giueth light vnto the eyes:</hi> and not the Pictures of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> or of any of the Prophets. And therefore though a man may be inſtructed by a Picture, touching a thing done; yet moſt certaine it is, that more excellent, and more perfect inſtruction is gotten by the Scripture: for let an vnskilfull man returne neuer ſo often to the beholding of his Picture, it will alwaies repreſent the ſame thing vnto him; and if any ſcruple or doubt remaine in his minde, it can anſwere nothing for the explication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: whereas in holy Scripture, that which is obſcure in one place, is explained in another; and that which in one Chapter we cannot conceiue, in the next following it may be is ſo cleerely ſet downe, that a childe may diſcerne it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out erring: ſo that as a man may diſcouer his meaning by ſignes and becks, yet it is not ſo effectuall as if he vtter it by word of mouth: ſo Pictures may teach, but yet Scripture teacheth more fully and effectually. And therefore to tye the people to theſe dumbe Bookes, and diſcharge them from ſearching into the Booke of God, is to depriue them of the chiefeſt meanes of knowledge, and ſo to foſter them in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But yet this is not all. For beſides that it occaſioneth ignorance, an Image alſo is <hi>a teacher of lyes,</hi> as the Prophet<note place="margin">Habak. 2. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Habakuk</hi> calleth it, and a mother, and a nurſe of ſuperſtition, and Idolatry. For firſt, how many Pictures are there in their Churches, of Monſters, and miracles that neuer were? As of Saint <hi>George,</hi> killing the Dragon. Saint <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> carrying Chriſt vpon his ſhoulder, ouer the Ford. Saint <hi>Catherine</hi> tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented vpon the wheele, and diſputing with the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.

he, nill hee. And an infinite number ſuch like, which either neuer were extant in the world, or were not ſuch, neither euer did worke ſuch feates as are repreſented by their Pictures. Two Pictures I cannot paſſe ouer in ſilence, which I haue ſeen and obſerued with my owne eyes: the one at the Church of <hi>Ramſey,</hi> in <hi>Huntington</hi>-ſhire, neere adioyning vnto that, <hi>quondam</hi> a famous and rich Abbay. In this Church, in the loweſt window, in the right Ile, is a picture of a paire of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, in one skole whereof is the Deuill, and in the other, a woman, and the woman is more ſinfull then the Deuill, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighing him euen to the ground. Behold, a Lay mans book, whereat wiſe men may wonder, fooles may laugh, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may bee inraged, and euery one may read the folly and prophanenes of thoſe times. Sure I am, heere is little inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſoules health. The other is in the Cloiſter window of the cathedrall Church of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> where is painted out at large the hiſtory of Chriſts paſſion. In one place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, our Sauiour Chriſt ſitteth with his twelue Apoſtles, eating his laſt Paſſeouer: which becauſe it was vpon the Thurſday night before Eaſter, commonly called Maundey Thurſday: therefore they picture before him in a diſh, not a Lambe as the truth was, but becauſe it was Lent, (O miſerable blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) three pickerels: ſo that now the Paſchall Lambe is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a Paſchall pickerell, and all forſooth, to nouriſh in the people, the ſuperſtition of the Lent faſt.

So, no errour nor falſhood ſhould be tolerated in Images and Pictures in the Church, ſeeing that an errour not reſiſted, is receiued for a trueth.</hi> And in the ſame place, the ſame <hi>Caſſander</hi> doth bewaile the abuſe of Images in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> affirming that <hi>ſuperſtition was too much pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered thereby, &amp; that Chriſtians were nothing behind the Heatho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the extreme vanity of framing, adorning, and worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Caſſander:</hi> out of which we may perceiue the chiefe leſſons that are learned out of theſe Lay bookes, to wit, ignorance, ſuperſtition, and Idolatry.

Then which, what can be a greater nouriſher of ignorance, and quencher of knowledge? For if I may bee ſaued by anothers mans knowledge and faith; And if it bee not required that I ſhould know al things neceſſary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:1727:189"/>
in my owne perſon, but may haue a ſhare of another mans knowledge, what need I greatly ſeeke for knowledge my ſelfe? And why may I not repoſe the hope of my ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon other men? And heereby wee may obſerue their groſſe abſurdity, In the caſe of iuſtification they teach, that wee are not made righteous by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, imputed vnto vs, though hee bee the head of the body of the Church, and the Spirit that animateth it, proceedeth from him; and yet heere they ſay, that a man may be made wiſe and knowing, by the knowledge of other their fellow members in the ſame body, abiding in the vnity of Chriſts Church. What is this, but to aduance the members aboue the head, or at leaſt, to forget themſelues, not caring what they ſay, ſo that they maintaine the cauſe they haue in hand?</p>

                  <hi>alſo hath he, whoſoeuer hath any thing in it: it is thine which I haue: it is mine which thou haſt.</hi> And againe in another place hee ſayth: <hi>When Peter wrought miracles, he wrought them for me, becauſe I am in that body, in which Peter wrought them. In which body, though the eye ſeeth, and not the eare: and the eare heareth, and not the eye: yet the eye heareth in the eare, and the eare ſeeth in the eye, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, all the grace and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that is in any other of Gods Saints, either liuing, or dead, is ours by participation: And ſo, that which was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in them, for their ſaluation, is alſo enough for vs, for ours, though wee haue little, or none of our owne. Thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our Rhemiſts, in the place before quoted. But I anſwere firſt, with our reuerend, learned countrey-man, Doctor <hi>Fulk,</hi> that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vnderſtandeth that place of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> of an actuall, and perſonall knowledge, inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, concurring with the outward miniſtery of the Church, and not of any generall knowledge infuſed into the Church, to bee transfuſed, and diſperſed among the members, by an imputatiue participation. Secondly, if a man may know by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans knowledge, why may not a man bee righteous by anothers righteouſneſſe? And if the knowledge of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members may bee imputed to vs, that wee thereby may bee ſaide to know, why may not the iuſtice of our head bee ſo
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:1727:190"/>
imputed vnto vs, that thereby wee may bee made iuſt? Theſe things are ſo paralell, that the one being granted, the other needs muſt follow. Thirdly, and laſtly, that communion which is betwixt the members of a body, either naturall or myſticall, is not an actuall tranſlation of gifts from one to another: but either a participation in the fruit of thoſe gifts, or a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the like in others, by doctrine, example, exhortation, prayers, and ſuch like meanes. And ſo wee may truely ſay, that euery one that is in the body of Chriſt, reapeth fruit and benefit, by all the graces and gifts that euer haue, or ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to any member thereof, though not for merit, yet for comfort, inſtruction, edification, and increaſe of grace. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as one candle lighteth another, and one ſteele ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and whetteth another: So wiſedome and grace is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from one to another; either by naturall commerce of ſpeech, or patterne of example. Thus much did Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> intend, and no more: and therefore, it neuer came into his minde to thinke, (as theſe idle braines would make him) that the knowledge which reſided in the Saints of God, is actually in all Gods Children, or that they are partakers of their gifts and graces, to their ſaluation. For he that will be ſaued, muſt beleeue for himſelfe, and know for himſelfe, and liue godly for himſelfe. If hee doe all theſe things by a proxy, hee muſt alſo goe to Heauen by a proxy, and not by himſelfe. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therefore is a manifeſt breeder and maintainer of ſuch groſſe ignorance, as both Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and all other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men haue alwayes condemned for a ſinne.</p>

And this is the Colliers faith ſpoken of before, ſo much commended by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their greateſt Clarks. Now how can this but nouriſh moſt groffe ignorance?

Surely, in matters of Religion, ſo great is the auerſeneſſe of our nature, that wee are all ſo farre from endeuouring to get more then is needfull; that few ſeeke for ſo much. And therefore they that bound our knowledge within ſo narrow limits, cheriſh this corruption, and by ſpeaking pleaſing things vnto it, lull it aſleepe in the bed of ignorance.

whom we may ſee the true fruit of theſe their doctrines. It is both ſtrange and lamentable to behold the prodigious igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of moſt, both men and women, that liue vnder Popery, and haue receiued the marke of the Beaſt on their foreheads: for as the Prieſts teach, ſo the people follow, like a flocke of ſheepe following their Belweather; the one commending ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, the other imbracing it with all their hearts. Some of their owne Writers affirme, that the Common people, for the<note place="margin">Vincent. de fine mundi.</note> moſt part, amongſt them, knew not the Articles of the faith: and if they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knew not the Articles of the faith, how can they giue a reaſon of them? which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> requireth of euery man. As the multitude of the <hi>Nineuites</hi> knew not their right hand from their left; ſo this rabble know not the right hand of Religion from the left. As for the maine points of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, how can they know them, whereas they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the grounds thereof? For the Lords Prayer, the ten Commandements, and the Creede, they rumble vp in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine tongue, not vnderſtanding one word what they ſpeake. They ſay <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> and <hi>Credo in Deum,</hi> and yet they know not what <hi>Pater</hi> meaneth, nor what <hi>Credo</hi> ſignifieth. Yea, for the moſt part, they ſo miſtearme the words thereof, that their language is more like to the babling of Infants, or rather the prattling of Parrats, then the ſpeech of men. Neither is this ignorance onely to be found among the baſeſt of the people, which haue no teaching and education, but euen amongſt the better ſort of them, that are well borne and brought vp: and after ſo ſtrange and ſtrong a faſhion, that by no meanes can they be withdrawne from this inueterate and continued cuſtome of their Anceſtors. Hence ſpringeth all that groſſe ſuperſtition which is vſed of them: as, creeping to the Croſſe, falling downe before Images, adoring and beautifying them with new-faſhioned garments, running a Pilgrimage to this Saint and that, ſetting vp Tapers before their ſhrines, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about their necks the beginning of the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> as a preſeruatiue againſt the Diuell, and the herbe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, being croſſed and bleſſed, againſt blaſts, the white <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter noſter,</hi> and the <hi>little Creede,</hi> with an infinite number of

ſuch like ſuperſtitious vanities, whereof there is neyther head nor foote.

For the cleere manifeſtation of which point, it is firſt to be obſerued, that there is a double antiquitie; one primary, another ſecundary: Primary is that, which was from

Beſides, it is as certaine that that Church, which next ſucceeded the Apoſtles, was the moſt pure and abſolute Church, whether for doctrine, or manners, matter, or forme, that euer was in the world: and therefore to degenerate from that, muſt needes be, to degenerate from the puritie and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of Religion.

The orders of <hi>Dominick &amp; Francis</hi> ſprung vp vnder <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, in the time of the <hi>Laterane</hi> Councill, about the yeere 1220. For when Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> would not be perſwaded to confirme to <hi>Dominick</hi> his order of preaching Fryers, hee dreamed that the Church of <hi>Laterane</hi> was ready to fall, and that <hi>Dominick</hi> came in, and with his ſhoulders vnder-propped it.

Now vpon this tree was Chriſt crucified, which being afterward buried againe in the earth, was found out by Queene <hi>Helene</hi> the mother of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> through the diſcouery of one <hi>Iudas</hi> a Iew, who was conuerted to the Chriſtian faith, by the ſweet ſauour that aroſe from the Croſſe, and the quaking of the earth: and then that Croſſe was diſcerned from the two other Croſſes of the theeues, by reſtoring life to a dead corps, whereupon it was

               <p n="43">43 Secondly, in the age of Ieſus Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, there was no precept nor example for the worſhipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, nei. her did they commend vnto the Lay people Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Pictures, as fitteſt bookes for their capacities, but the word preached and committed to writing, by which they
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:1727:209"/>
ſhould bee brought to ſaluation. And when as they aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the worſhip of Idols, and brought in the worſhip of the true God, wee doe not read, that either they tranſlated thoſe Idolatrous ſtatues to the worſhip of the true God, or ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted other Images of God himſelfe, for of holy men to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their roome; but taught that God who is a Spirit, ought to bee worſhipped in Spirit and truth.

Thirdly, the age alſo after the Apoſtles, was free from Images: for amongſt thoſe Eccleſiaſticall rites, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to haue been vſed in the firſt 300. yeeres after Chriſt, there is not ſo much as any mention made of Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,<note place="margin">Theodor. de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. l. 1.</note> except it bee amongſt thoſe that were condemned for Heretikes: as the followers of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his Image, and of his harlot <hi>Selene;</hi> and the Diſciples of <hi>Baſilides,</hi> whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirmeth to haue vſed Images, and<note place="margin">Iren. l. 1. c. 23.</note> Inuocations: and the Carpocratians, and Gnoſticks, who bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned incenſe to the Images of Chriſt and <hi>Paul, Homer</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> &amp;c. as teſtifyeth Saint <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> but the true<note place="margin">Aug. de haereſ.</note> Church of God condemned theſe, and abhorred all ſuch kind of worſhip; and therefore amongſt the accuſations which the Heathen obiected to Chriſtians in that age, this was one, that they profeſſed a Religion without Images, as witneſſe both <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and <hi>Origen;</hi> the one whereof li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued<note place="margin">Clem.

               <p n="46">46. Laſtly, it is a knowne and confeſſed truth, that Images were neuer generally receiued &amp; inioyned vpon the Church, vntill the ſecond Nicene Council which was eight hundreth yeeres after Chriſt: and alſo that the decree of that Councill was abrogated by another Councill held at <hi>Frankeford,</hi> not long after; ſo that it is manifeſt, that the petigree of this ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard is of no great continuance, not fetched from the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, which is the thing we haue in hand to prooue, but ſpringing vp in the more corrupt times, when ſuperſtition had darkned the light of true Religion, and almoſt baniſhed it out of the world.</p>
               <p n="47">47.

               <p n="48">48. For particulars, one part of this ſupremacy is, that the Pope is abſolutely aboue a Councill, which notwithſtanding<note place="margin">Cuſan. l. 2 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. c. 17.</note> was condemned by the Councils of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſill.</hi> And as Cardinall <hi>Cuſanus</hi> confeſſeth, was not acknowledged in the dayes of Saint <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> and other Fathers and Councils, which liued before the firſt ſix hundreth yeere.

That it is contrary to Chriſts firſt inſtitution, it is euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt at his laſt Supper did not take the bread and wine alone, his Apoſtles beholding, and looking on, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate them, and ſo eat and drinke them himſelfe, but gaue both the Elements vnto them all, and bade them eat and

drinke them in remembrance of him: this was the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacrament, which ought to be a patterne to the Church of God for euer. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayth, that it was but<note place="margin">Bell. de miſſa. l. 2. c. 10.</note> an affirmatiue precept of our Sauiour, &amp; therefore did bind no further then the circumſtance of time, place and perſon would permit; and that to communicate in the Sacrament, was no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall part thereof; and therefore might bee omitted vpon occaſion. To which I anſwere, that though it bee falſe which hee ſayth, touching communicating in the Sacrament, that it is no eſſentiall part thereof: for the contrary may be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both by Scripture, which calleth the whole Sacrament a Communion, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and by analogy of the Paſſeouer in the Law, which was to bee eaten of all: &amp; by the confeſſion of their owne learned Schooleman <hi>Gabriel Piel,</hi> who ſayth,<note place="margin">Gabriel Biel. in Canon. lect. 26. tit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="55">55. Secondly, that it is contrary to the doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Apoſtles, appeareth by this, becauſe the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes calleth the miniſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a <hi>breaking of bread,</hi> and <hi>that through houſholds.</hi> By which<note place="margin">Acts 2. 46.</note> is neceſſarily inſinuated a diſtribution and diſpenſation of it<note place="margin">1.

               <p n="56">56.

               <p n="57">57. But beſides thoſe Lyturgies, wee haue the plaine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of ancient Fathers: one <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> for breuities ſake<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. hom. 3. in Epheſ. c. 1.</note> ſhall ſtand inſteed of all: hee thus propoundeth the cuſtome of the Church in his time: <hi>The dayly oblation</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is made in vaine, when there is none to participate:</hi> and again, <hi>Whoſoeuer is not partaker of the myſteries, ſtand by as a fooliſh and wicked man.</hi> This is flat contrary to the Romiſh practice, where the Prieſt maſſeth alone, &amp; the people kneele, by knocking, their breſts, and lifting vp their eyes to their breaden God: you ſee then there was no ſuch cuſtome in <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> time: and this further may bee confirmed by the tenth Canon of thoſe that are called Apoſtolicall, which doth forbid any to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but ſuch as doe communicate; ſaying, that they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbers of the order of the Church: the ſame Canon alſo is<note place="margin">Bell. de miſſ. l. 2. c. 10.

is to bee obſerued, that thoſe Fathers which doe patronize this Purgatory, yet propound it not as an article of faith, but as a free opinion to bee receiued or contradicted, as men thought good, or ſaw reaſon; and theſe alſo were none of the moſt ancient: For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> climmeth no higher for it, then to <hi>Athanaſius Baſill,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzene:</hi> for as for <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> all knew him to bee a counterfeit; but thoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after the age of the Primitiue Church: as for thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which liued in thoſe purer times, there is not a ſillable found in them for the defence thereof.

Laſtly, to tye vp for breuities ſake many points in one<note place="margin">12.</note> bundle, prayer for the dead, as it is vſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath no ground of antiquity: For though it cannot be denyed, but that it hath beene an ancient cuſtome in the Church, and frequently vſed by the ancient Farthers, yet their manner of praying was not of that nature, as it is now in the Romiſh Synagogue: For firſt the Ancients prayed for thoſe whom they were perſwaded to bee already in bliſſe, as hath beene formerly declared: but the Romaniſts ſay, that ſuch<note place="margin">Bell. de Purgat. l. 2. c. 18.</note> prayers are auaileable onely for ſoules tormented in the fire of Purgatory, and that wee may not pray either for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or the damned. Secondly, many of the Ancients ſuppoſe that all ſoules were reſerued in a certaine ſecret place, from the preſence of God, which they called <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:1727:216"/>
Paradiſe, the port of ſecurity, the outward court of Heauen, &amp;c. And therefore could not pray for their deliuerance from Purgatory, as the Romaniſts doe.

                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> confeſſeth) not in regard of any miſery wherein their ſoules were, but for the glorifying of their bodies in the day of the generall reſurrection: but the Romiſh prayers are onely for thoſe that are in paines, that they might bee deliuered. Laſtly, the Ancients ſpeake of the matter doubtfully; as Saint<note place="margin">Aug. de ciuitat. l. 21. c. 27.</note>

               <p>IT is a wonder to ſee what deuiſes, ſleights, impoſtures, and deuiliſh practices the Romaniſts haue, and now at this day doe more then euer vſe, to vphold their rotten Religion, &amp; to enſnare mens minds with the forlorne ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome being ready to fall, they care not with what props they vnder-ſhore it, and the truth preuailing againſt them, they care not with what engines, though fetched from hell it ſelfe, they vndermine it, ſo that they may any wayes batter the walles, or ſhake the foundation thereof. My purpoſe is in this Chapter to diſcouer ſome of the Sathanicall practices of theſe ſubtle Enginers, I meane, the Ieſuites and Prieſts, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:1727:219"/>
other rabble of Romiſh proctors: It is not poſſible to reckon them vp all, being ſo many and various: ſuch therefore (God willing) ſhall be heere diſcouered, as are for villany moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, for impudency moſt ſhameleſſe, and for certainty moſt perſpicuous; and by them let the Chriſtian Reader that loueth the truth, iudge of their Religion and Church, what it is.</p>

Now trueth and falſhood, good and euill, godlineſſe, and vngodlineſſe, are thus contrary; and therefore naturally expelling each other, they cannot bee meanes of each others preſeruation: that cannot then bee the trueth, which ſecketh to with-hold it ſelfe by falſhood, nor true Religion, which is a doctrine according to godlineſſe, which maintaineth it ſelfe by vniuſt, vngodly and wicked practices: this is natures voyce, to which reaſon ſubſcribeth, when it concludeth, that it is not onely improbable, but impoſſible that Vertue ſhould ſeeke for Vices helpe, to fortifie it ſelfe withall; or trueth for falſhood to maintaine it: ſeeing the chiefe eſſence of Vertue is to fly Vice, and of Trueth, to bee free from Falſhood. <hi>Pln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchs</hi> Morals, <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Ethicks, <hi>Tullies</hi> Offices, and all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And ſecondly, Saint <hi>Francis</hi> had a Cade Lambe, which vſed to goe to Maſſe, and would duely kneele downe at the eleuation, and adore. And thirdly, that a certaine deuout woman, to cure her Bees of the murren, and to make them fruitfull, put a conſecrated hoaſt into the Hiue, which when after a time ſhee tooke vp, ſhee not onely found a miraculous increaſe, but ſaw alſo a ſtrange wonder, the Bees had built a Chappell in the Hiue, with an Altar, and windowes, and doores, and a ſteeple with Bells, and had laid the hoaſt vpon the Altar, and with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly noyſe flew about it, and ſung at their Canonicall houres, and kept watch by night, as Monkes vſe to doe in their Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Who would not beleeue now but that the hoaſt is to be adored, if hee be not more ſenſleſſe then a horſe, or a Bee, or a Cade Lambe? But if this be true, why are Mice ſo prophane, that they dare rend it with their teeth? And why doth not the Popes Hackney kneele downe, and doe reuerence vnto it, when hee carrieth it on his backe, accompanied with mulet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and horſe-keepers, and Courtiſans, and Cookes, with ſumpter-horſes, and all the baggage of the Court, as oft as his<note place="margin">Iohan.

               <p n="29">29. But let vs heare their reaſons why we are all Infidels: mary they propound two principall ones, and thoſe very ſtrong, as they thinke: firſt they ſay that all learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are Infidels, becauſe they build their faith vpon their owne priuate expoſition of Scripture: and ſecondly, that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Proteſtants are Infidels, becauſe they rely their faith vpon their Miniſters credit. To the firſt, I anſwere two things, firſt, that wee doe not interpret the Scripture by our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate iudgements, but by the Scripture it ſelfe: for ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſo plaine, &amp; thoſe principally that contain the grounds of Religion, that they need no expoſition, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>

                  <hi>thoſe points which containe faith and manners:</hi> and thoſe things which are obſcure and hard in Scripture, we do not expound by any forraine or priuate interpretation, but by conferring them with other more plaine and perſpicuous places: and ſo except they ſay that the Scripture it ſelfe is of a priuate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, they cannot condemne vs of that crime. Now that this is the beſt way of interpreting, let the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vs, who ſayth, <hi>That there is nothing contained in hard</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem Ibid. l. 2. c. 6.</note>

               <p n="30">30. I, but wee follow not the iudgement of the Church, (ſay they) which hath the onely key of interpretation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto it: if they meane by the Church the fathers, we may iuſtify our ſelues by condemning them of the ſame fault: they deale with them as the Iewes dealt with their wiues, if they pleaſe their humors they hold vnto them; but if they croſſe or thwart them, they ſue out a bill of diuorce againſt them, and put them away: nothing is more common then this in all their writings: and therefore it needs no inſtances to prooue it: if they meane the Councils; why, by their owne teaching, no Councill is of ſufficient authority, except it bee confirmed by the Pope: nor any decree or interpretation to bee entertained without his approbation. Therefore they muſt needs meane the Pope alone, and if they doe ſo, then we confeſſe that wee haue iuſt cauſes not to tye our faith to his girdle, nor our vnderſtanding to his braine: ſeeing many of that ranke haue beene open Heretikes, ſome notorious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, all men and therefore ſubiect to errour: yea ſeeing the body of their Church is an Apoſtate harlot, and the ſurmiſed

head on earth, that man of ſinne, the great Antichriſt, ſpoken of in the Scriptures. If to vary from him then, and his <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> in our expoſition of Scripture, bee priuate interpretation, wee confeſſe our ſelues guilty, but in all other reſpects cleare and innocent.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Secondly, grant that wee doe in ſome points follow on our owne priuate expoſition, yet wee are not therefore Infidels: for then moſt of the Fathers ſhould bee infidels aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as wee: for there are few of them which haue not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times priuately, vea and falſely expounded the Scriptures: as their owne Doctors confeſſe. <hi>Canus</hi> ſaying <hi>that they ſpake</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Canus loc. l. 7. c. 3. Poſſeu. biblioth. ſelect. l. 12. c. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>with a humane ſpirit, and erred ſometimes in things which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward haue appeared to appertaine to the faith:</hi> and <hi>Poſſeuine, that there are ſome things in the Fathers, wherein vnwitingly they diſſented from the Church;</hi> either therefore they muſt tax them with infidelity aſwell as vs, or cleare vs aſwell as them, if al the force of the argument hang vpon this pin, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are Infidels, becauſe we priuatly expound the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="32">32. To the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> that all vnlearned Proteſtants are Infidels, becauſe they rely their faith vpon the credit of the tranſlatours, I anſwere three things; firſt, that they doe not rely their faith vpon the credit and fidelity of any tranſlatour, but partly vpon the iudgement and authority of the Church, which receiueth ſuch tranſlations, and alloweth them, and is able to iudge of them: and partly and principally vpon the word tranſlated, which containeth ſuch holy and heauenly doctrine, as none that readeth, or heareth it, can chuſe but acknowledge the Maieſtie of Gods Spirit ſpeaking in it.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Secondly, if our people are therefore Infidels, becauſe they cannot examine the tranſlations by the Hebrew and Greeke, and doe therefore rely their faith vpon the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours credit: then <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was an infidell, who knew nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe languages, but was as it is written of him, <hi>mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſſos:</hi> and then many godly Doctours and Fathers of the Church were Infidels, who for the moſt part were all igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Hebrew tongue, and ſome of them of the Greeke
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:1727:232"/>
alſo: and laſtly then all the godly Chriſtians in the purer times<note place="margin">Theodor, de cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Graecor. affection. lib. 5.</note> who both read and heard the Scriptures tranſlated into their mother tongues were infidels, for they all relyed their faith vpon the word tranſlated, but not for the tranſlators ſake, who might erre in tranſlating many places, but for the ſound, holy, and heauenly doctrine therein contayned.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Thirdly, if this maketh men infidels to relye their faith vpon man; then the ignorant Romaniſts muſt needs be all infidels, whoſe implicite, Colliarlike faith is grounded onely vpon the Church: that is not onely vpon the Pope, who is in power the whole Church, but alſo vpon euery ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, be he Ieſuite, or Prieſt, or Frier, or any other, whom they are (according to their diuinity) bound in conſcience to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue whatſoeuer they teach, as hath been ſhewed: now this is to rely their faith vpon the fidelity and credit of man, and therfore the blame of infidelity falleth vpon them more iuſtly then vpon vs: and thus this accuſation of theirs, that we haue no faith, no religion, no God, no Chriſt, but are plain Infidels, is a moſt notorious and open ſlander.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Thus generally they ſlander our religion, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors<note place="margin">2.</note> thereof, but not content therewith, they ſet vpon particular perſons, and thoſe that are moſt eminent in our Church, either in authority of place, or excellency of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that like Captaines march in the head of the ranks.

it not beene ſo notorious and famous, that it could not bee hidden.</p>
               <p n="43">43. To conclude, that not onely by probable coniecture, but by euident proofe their ſlanders may appeare: wee haue two notable arguments of the ſame; the firſt is that ſtrange tale ſpread abroad in <hi>Italy,</hi> touching <hi>Luthers</hi> death, before he<note place="margin">Lonicer. theat. hiſtor. pag. 246.</note> was dead: how in his ſickneſſe hee deſired the body of our Lord to bee communicated vnto him; and after when he ſaw his end approach, entreated that his body might bee laide on the Altar, and worſhipped with diuine honours: and how at his buriall Almighty God raiſed a great noyſe and tumult, and that the holy hoſte hung in the aire, and in a thunder that his body was taken out of his graue, and nothing left but a ſtinke of brimſtone, which had well nigh ſtifled all the ſtanders by. This tale was publiſhed before <hi>Luthers</hi> death, and a copie thereof came into his owne hands, which he read with a glad heart, and deteſted the blaſphemy therein contained. The like<note place="margin">Beza epiſt. ante Annot. iu nouum teſtam.</note> ſlander was raiſed vp touching <hi>Beza</hi> his death, long before hee dyed, and came alſo into his hands, as may appeare in his Epiſtle before his annotations vpon the new Teſtament; by which wee may ſee what manner of reports they bee, which are deuiſed by theſe Romaniſts againſt vs; and <hi>ex vngue leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> by this iudge of the reſt. The ſecond is the confeſſion of that perfidious Apoſtate <hi>Bolſek,</hi> who (as it is reported) in a publike Synode with weeping eyes, acknowledged with what vniuſt and ſlanderous reproches he had loaden <hi>Caluine,</hi> and that all which hee had written of him to his diſgrace, was falſe and vntrue: now what <hi>Bolſeck</hi> did againſt <hi>Caluine,</hi> wee haue iuſt cauſe to thinke to hane beene the practice of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, againſt the reſt of the fore-named godly men, and all other of our profeſſion, knowing that old Prouerbe to bee true, that though the wound of a mans good name be healed, yet a ſcarre will euer remaine. Let this ſuffice, touching their perſonall ſlaunders, though much more might bee added: for their malice in this kinde, is of an vnlimitable extent.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Secondly, they calumniate our gouernment, and that<note place="margin">3. Sander. lib, de Schiſmat.</note> which two notable falſe accuſations: firſt, of vniuſtice, both
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:1727:235"/>
in the ſubſtance of the Lawes, enacted againſt them, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of cruelty in the execution of the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lawes: but it is an eaſie matter to diſcouer their ſlanders, and to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſtate from both theſe imputations: for touching our Lawes; firſt of all they are of that nature, that except they will condemne all the ſtatute Lawes that euer were made, either in this, or any other common wealth, they cannot condemne them of iniuſtice: they were not made in a corner, or deuiſed by the braine of any <hi>Licurgus, Solon,</hi> or <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the conference and counſell of ſome diuine power, to gaine authority vnto them; but by the whole ſtate of the kingdome aſſembled in Parliament, the Lords ſpirituall and temporall, with the Commons, a ſelect company, gathered out of the wiſeſt, ſageſt, and diſcreteſt perſons of the whole land: and that which is the happineſſe of this kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others, not raſhly or ſuddenly, but after mature and graue deliberation: neither by the Prince alone, without his ſubiects, nor the ſubiects alone, without their Prince, but by both conſenting, ſubſcribing, ratifying, and approouing the ſame. Now doe they imagine any man to bee ſo ſimple, as vpon their bare word to condemne Lawes, thus made as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, and not rather to condemne them as vniuſt ſlanderers, and impudent ſycophants, that thus rage againſt a whole ſtate, vpon a priuat malitious ſpirit? eſpecially ſeeing no Law bee it neuer ſo iuſt, doth pleaſe the humour of malefactors, that would gladly liue without Law, that their wickedneſſe might goe vnpuniſhed: for the Law <hi>Iulia</hi> could not pleaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, nor the Law <hi>Cornelia</hi> murtherers, nor the Law <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minia</hi> promooters: and yet theſe Lawes were neuer the worſe for that ſuch malefactors diſliked them; but they rather the more deſperate, for accuſing the Lawes of iniuſtice: as if a theefe condemned of a robbery, ſhould cry out that the Law was vniuſt, by which hee was condemned: ſo theſe fellowes being guilty of treaſon againſt the Prince and ſtate, haue no wayes to cloake themſelues, but with this out-cry, the Lawes are vniuſt; whereas they ſhould rather keepe themſelues
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:1727:235"/>
innocent, and then the Lawes would neuer take no hold of them.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Secondly, if it bee true which <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſayth, that <hi>then Lawes are ſaid to bee iuſt; firſt, when they are made</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 96 <hi>art.</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>for the common good: ſecondly, when they exceed not his power that maketh them; and thirdly, when they haue their due forme, to wit, when the burthens are impoſed on the ſubiect, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine equality of proportion in order to the common good:</hi> then our Lawes are iuſt and good Lawes; for they are made by full authority in Parliament, they tend to the conſeruation of the Kings Maieſty, and whole Common-wealth in tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and peace: and their penalties are ſo proportioned, that by the gentle puniſhment of ſome few, the whole ſtate is preſerued.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Thirdly, they themſelues were occaſioners at leaſt, if not cauſers of thoſe Lawes that were made againſt them: for the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> which came roaring into this land, in the tenth yeere of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereby the Queene was accurſed, and depoſed, and her ſubiects diſcharged of their obedience and oath, was the root of all this miſchiefe: for it cauſed the firſt Lnw made, <hi>anno</hi> 13. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and not onely gaue occaſion to it, but bred recuſancy in ordinary Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, which vſed to come to Church before time, and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rebellion in the Prieſts and Ieſuites, and ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons; yea and manifold bloudy practices, by treaſon againſt her Maieſties ſacred perſon, and the ſtate. Theſe peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous effects procured other Lawes to be deuiſed, more ſeuere and ſtrict then the former, againſt recuſants, ſeditions books, Ieſuites and Prieſts, that beeing borne Engliſhmen, ſhould goe beyond ſea, and take vpon them the Romiſh Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and ſo returne into theſe dominions to infect her loyal ſubiects with the poyſon of their doctrine: and what were the cauſes, I pray you, ſince his Maieſties comming to the Crowne, of the reuiuing thoſe former ſtatutes, and enlarging them in ſome points; and of the new oath of Allegiance, which hath ſtirred vp ſo many pens to write both for it, and againſt it? were not the treaſonable practices of many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:1727:236"/>
male contented perſons? ſure it was high time to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne againſt them, by ſome Chriſtian politike Lawes, when their malice was growen to that hight, that they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not what miſchiefe they wrought, ſo that they might worke their willes: by all which it is euident, that they may thanke themſelues for thoſe Lawes, and not our ſtate, which were drawen vnto the making therof, with vnwilling minds, and more vnwillingly to their execution. So that as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old ſaying, <hi>Good Lawes ſpring out of euill manners;</hi> ſo from the fountaine of theſe fearefull treaſons, horrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, and bloudy practices, ſprung all theſe Lawes which they ſo calumniate.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Fourthly, the Lawes thus occaſioned by their owne villany, doe not run vpon them with violence, but they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratly runne vpon the point of the Lawes: for if they keepe themſelues at home in quiet, they might enioy the liberty of their Conſcience, without any danger from the Lawes, ſaue only a gentle mulct impoſed vpon them, for refuſing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with vs in the ſeruice of our Church: and if like fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue children they ſhould flee from their own naturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vnto a ſtep-dame in forraine Countreyes, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vpon them not onely the Character of Romiſh Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but alſo into them the poyſon of treaſon, they might ſtay there ſtill, without any coaction from the Lawes: for they were directed onely againſt ſuch as beeing prieſted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into their countrey to practiſe treaſon, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the peoples hearts from their obedience, and reconcile them to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that the Law is but like a naked ſword, held foorth by the hand of the ſtate for it own defence, which theſe deſperate Prieſts run voluntarily vpon, and kill themſelues: and therefore they themſelues are guilty of ſelfe-murder, and not the Law of iniuſtice.</p>
               <p n="48">48. Fiftly, and laſtly, this matter may be yet more euident, all men know that there was neuer any Law hitherto enacted in this kingdome, to put to death any Romaniſt for his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; except hee either paſſed ouer the Seas, and returned backe with the order of Prieſt-hood, his heart beeing full of
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:1727:236"/>
treaſon, and his hands of violence, as was ſaid before, or gaue entertainment to ſuch traytours in his houſe a certaine time, that lurked for an opportunity to doe miſchiefe, or moued ſeditions or rebellion in the State, let them name but one in theſe 57. yeares of our late Queens and now Kings regiment, that hath been puniſhed with death meerely for his religion, and wee will confeſſe them not to be ſuch malicious ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, albeit in truth to puniſh Idolaters, and ſuch as perſwade to an Apoſtacy from God, with death, is no vniuſt law, but euen grounded vpon the law of God it ſelfe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 5. 8, 9. our lawes then are ſo farre from exceeding the bounds of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that they rather offend in comming too ſhort thereof, which indeed is the leſſe offence of the two, becauſe it appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth neerer to the <hi>medium;</hi> and that our Law-giuers knew right well, which moued them to be rather too remiſſe, then too extreame.</p>
               <p n="49">49. Adde hereunto that all of them, both prieſts and people, that are abſolute Papiſts, muſt needs nouriſh ſecret treaſon in their hearts, whatſoeuer they pretend in outward ſhew, for euery true Romaniſt is bound to obey the Ieſuite or Prieſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him vpon paine of damnation; and the Ieſuite errant muſt obey the Preſident reſident of his Colledge, and be at his direction, and the Colledge Gouernour muſt obey his ſuperiour of the order, and he fetcheth his influence from the Pope, ſo that if the Pope being the higheſt Spheare moue in a violent motion, and command to depoſe or kill the King, as <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> did our late Queene, then all the inferiour Spheares muſt be caried about with the ſame kind of agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if they make either a trembling or retrograde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are not fit Planets for the Romiſh Spheare, and thus in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time all the rabble of them, I meane both Prieſts and abſolute lay Papiſts were traytors either in heart, or act, becauſe the firſt mouer by his Bull moued that wayes, and ſo if they are not at this day by refuſing the oath of allegiance, yet if the Pope ſhould ſhoot out his thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt, and actually excommunicate and depoſe our King, they muſt needs either renounce their allegiance, or their

               <p n="50">50. Touching cruelty in perſecution of them (which is the ſecond crime whereof they accuſe the gouernment of our ſtate) it is ſo ſhameleſſe an accuſation, and ſo farre from ſhew of truth, that there is none that either dwell amongſt vs, or that know the mild and gentle adminiſtration of this common-wealth, but will with one voyce and verdict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne it for a notorious ſlander. But for further direction of them in this point, and for ſtopping of the mouthes of thoſe malicious perſons, that out of the rancour of their hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs haue vttered forth theſe vntruths, let theſe few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations be remarked, firſt, that neuer any of them hath bin put to death in this kingdome, but by forme of iuſtice and due proceeding according to the lawes, whereas the Proteſtants haue bin ſlaine by them partly by treaſon, and partly by maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres, and that in great multitudes, as is before declared.</p>
               <p n="51">51. Secondly, that ſuch as haue thus by law been executed amongſt vs were ſo handled, not for their religion, but either for treaſon or rebellion, or ſome other notable crime, which to be true, this one reaſon doth ſufficiently prooue, becauſe there was no law euer yet made in this land to puniſh Romiſh recuſants by death, if they kept themſelues within the limits of their religion, and did not flye either beyond ſea, and there become Prieſts, or remayning at home, entertaine ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into their houſes, and mayntaine them againſt the State: whereas they on the other ſide haue committed to the edge of the ſword, and the fury of the fire infinite Proteſtants onely for their religion, without any other crime or cauſe layd to their charge, as the ſix Articles in <hi>Henry</hi> the eights time, and the miſerable burning of many poore ſoules in Queene <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>

               <p n="53">53. Thirdly, that in all Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time by the ſpace of 44. yeares and vpwards, there were executed in all not aboue 180. Prieſts, receiuers and harbourers of them: and ſince king <hi>Iames</hi> came to the Crowne of the latter ſort not any, and of the former not much aboue a dozen, (I ſpeake within compaſſe) except thoſe Powder-villaines, who they themſelues dare not for ſhame but confeſſe that they receiued a iuſt reward for their demerits, whereas in Queene <hi>Maryes</hi> fiue yeares raigne, neere vpon three hundred perſons were cruelly put to death for religion, as the publicke actes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of our Church do teſtifie. Fourthly, that all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted vpon our recuſants, if they kept themſelues peaceable and quiet from actuall treaſon, and entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of traytors, was, and is, but a pecuniary mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="92">92. Laſtly (to omit a number more of their ſſlanders in this kind) they charge our Religion it ſelfe, to lead to looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſenſualitie by diuers doctrines thereof: eſpecially theſe foure, to wit, freewill, iuſtification by faith alone, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance in grace; and impoſſibilitie to keepe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: but with what ſpirit of malice, let the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reader conſult and iudge.</p>
               <p n="93">93. Firſt, for our doctrine touching the inabilitie of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, doth it lead a man to looſeneſſe? nay, rather doth it not teach him to deny himſelfe, and to ſeeke for all grace and goodneſſe from God? humilitie and prayer are the fruits of this doctrine, and not looſneſſe and libertie: and to make it cleare to any ſingle eye: We teach that a man is onely voyde of freewill to grace before his regeneration, and that hee is paſſiue onely in the very act of regeneration: but after his will being quickned, and ſtirred vp by Gods ſpirit, he willeth and worketh forth together with the ſpirit of God, his owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Now, few or none there are, that are Chriſtians, but preſume, though falſely, that they are regenerate: and therefore this doctrine cannot giue libertie to any to ſinne, but rather bindeth them faſt to obedience; nay, doth not their doctrine rather open a gappe to libertie? For when they teach, that it is in a mans power either to accept or reiect the grace of God offered vnto him: What doth this but incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage men to deferre their repentance &amp; conuerſion, ſeeing it is in their power to accept it when they liſt?</p>

                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:1727:250"/>94. Secondly, how can the doctrine of iuſtification by<note place="margin">11.</note> faith alone tend to looſeneſſe, ſeeing we teach, that <hi>faith is neuer ſeuered from good workes,</hi> nor <hi>iuſtification from ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> nor a <hi>right beliefe</hi> from an <hi>vpright life,</hi> as hath beene ſhewed, and that they which ſeuer and part thoſe things which God hath coupled together, ſeuer themſelues from the mercie of God, and merit of Ieſus Chriſt? With what brow of braſſe then can they call this a ſolifidian portion, and a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of libertie? I, but manie take libertie hereby to lead a looſe and wicked life, building vpon this ground, that they are iuſtified by faith alone, and ſo they neglect all good workes. True indeed, many ſuch there are: but is it from our doctrine? is it not rather from their miſtaking of it? So the Capernaites tooke offence at our Sauiour Chriſts heauenly doctrine, <hi>Ioh. 6.</hi> touching the ſpirituall eating of his fleſh, and drinking his bloud: inſomuch that many of them depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him: was his doctrine therefore erronious? or were not they rather ignorant in miſconſtruing, &amp; impious in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting the ſame? So is it with this myſterie of iuſtification, which is the verie doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt: if any by miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, or by taking vp one piece of it, and leauing another, doe animate themſelues vnto ſinne, is the doctrine to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? and not they rather, that diſtort it to their owne ſhame and confuſion? In a word, if this were a iuſt exception againſt this doctrine, then no doctrine either of their or ours, or the Goſpell it ſelfe might bee freed from this challenge. For as there is no herbe ſo ſweet and wholſome, but the Spider may ſucke poyſon out of it, aſwell as the Bee hony: ſo there is no truth ſo ſacred and holy, but an vngodly minde may peruert and make it an occaſion of his impietie.

                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:1727:251"/>95. Thirdly, our doctrine of perſeuerance, though ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">12.</note> 
                  <hi>Wright</hi> ſayth of it, that <hi>Epicurus himſelfe could not haue found a better ground to plant his Epicuriſme: nor Heliogaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus haue better patronized his ſenſualitie: nor Bacchus and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus haue forged better reaſons to inlarge their dominion:</hi> yet, to any ſingle eye (for his eyes are double-ſighted with malice, as Witches eyes are ſaid to be) it is rather a ſtrong bridle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine from ſenſuality and Epicuriſme, and a bond to bind to obedience, then a provocation vnto ſinne: for when men are perſwaded that ſincere faith, true charitie, and ſauing grace cannot be loſt, it will cauſe them to take heed how they fall away, leſt they proue themſelues to haue beene hypocrites before, and their faith and charitie not to haue beene true, but fained: for he that falleth from God whom he pretend: d to ſerue, to the Deuil by an actual Apoſtaſie into ſinne, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proueth that hee had neuer the ſeed of the ſpirit ſowne in him, nor the habit of charitie in his ſoule: this is then a bridle to withhold men from ſinne, and not a ſpurre to pricke them forward vnto it. And therefore whereas they ſay that men will thus reaſon: If I be the child o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God, I cannot fall away: therefore I will doe what I liſt. The contrarie is rather true, that euery child of GOD, yea, euery one that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that hee is the childe of GOD, will reaſon thus from the grounds of this doctrine: I will not doe what I liſt, neither will I giue my ſelfe ouer vnto ſinne, leſt I proue my ſelfe by my falling into ſinne, not to be the child of God, but an hypocrite. Adde hereunto, that as we teach, that true faith and charitie cannot bee vtterly extinct in the elect: So alſo we teach, that this faith and charitie muſt bee nouriſhed and preſerued by the practice of all holy &amp; Chriſtian duties: and therefore they which neglect the conſeruation of their faith, and charitie, and ſeek to extinguiſh them by the luſts of the fleſh, it is a ſigne that they neuer had theſe graces in graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their ſoules. And what perſwaſion can be more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, I pray you, to ſtirre vp men vnto godlineſſe, then this is?</p>
               <p n="96">96. So we may truly anſwere concerning the fourth do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<note place="margin">13.</note> obiected, namely, the impoſſibilitie of keeping Gods
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:1727:251"/>
Commandements, which though it be true in ſome part, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, not as they ſlanderouſly impute vnto vs. For wee hold that the regenerate perſon is able in ſome meaſure to keepe Gods Commandements, though not to that perfection which the Law requireth, exacting of euery one of vs the loue of God with all our heart, ſoule and ſtrength; yet this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth not, but rather ſtoppeth the gap vnto fleſhly libertie. For, is any man ſo madde as to ſay, I will giue ouer all care of keeping Gods Law, becauſe I am not able fully and exactly to performe it? rather euery one that hath but a reaſonable ſoule will thus determine, Becauſe I am not able to performe perfect obedience to God, therefore I will indeuour to doe what I can, that my imperfections and wants may bee made vp by the perfect obedience of my Sauiour. All men will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a wilfull wicked wretch, who being greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, becauſe he is not able to diſcharge the whole ſumme, therfore will take no care to pay any part thereof, which he is able to doe, but lay all vpon his ſureties backe: ſo we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him for a deſperate and damnable perſon, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not able to ſatisfie the whole debt of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, therefore will not indeuour to pay as much as he can: beſides, we teach withall, that though this perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not attained vnto in this life, yet there muſt be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall growth and increaſe in grace and goodneſſe in all that belong to God, that at length, after this life ended, they may doff off the olde man, with the inabilities and corruptions thereof, and attaine to the higheſt degree of perfection in the life to come: the fruit of this doctrine then, is not ſenſuall libertie, but Chriſtian humilitie, not a prouocation to ſinne, but an incentiue, and ſpurre vnto godlineſſe.</p>
               <p n="97">97. Thus I haue propounded vnto the view of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader, a ſhort Epitome of the great volume of their ſlanders, darted forth by them, both againſt our perſons, our gouernment, and our Religion it ſelfe: all which indeed is but a taſte and ſay of that, which might be ſpoken in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and which requireth an entire worke for the diſcouering of ther malice in this kinde: and ſurely, I thinke that labour

For they are perſwaded, that whatſoeuer is written or ſpoken by a Prieſt or Ieſuite, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, it being allowed (as all their writings commonly are) by the authoritie of the Church, and the Cenſors and viſiters appointed for that purpoſe, and therefore account it a deadly ſinne once to call the credit thereof into queſtion.

                  <note place="margin">Bell. de Chriſto l. 1. c. 10. &amp; de Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric. lib. 1. cap. 15.</note> are cenſured by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> peremptorily to bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.

Thirdly, <hi>liber Hypognoſticon, Bellarmine</hi> concludes, that it is none of Saint <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> yet hee alleadgeth it as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem de miſſ. lib. 2. cap. 12.</note> to proue Euangelicall Councels: ſo <hi>Liber ad Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium</hi> is confeſſed by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to bee none of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,</hi> and yet hee is alleadged by him in another place, to proue the Booke of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> authenticall. Laſtly, the Commentaries vpon the Epiſtles that goe vnder the name of Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> are iudged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to bee none of his, and yet he produceth teſtimonies out of them, to proue the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of traditions, <hi>Peter</hi> to be the rocke of the Church, and that children may without their parents conſents enter into a religious Order. And this is ordinarie, not onely in <hi>Bellarm</hi> but in all other of their writers, as you may ſee particularly and plainly diſcouered in Doctor <hi>Iames</hi> his Treatiſe, touching the corrupting of Scripture. Councels and Fathers, by the Prelates and pillars of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> By which wee may note: Firſt, their conſcience, in that they know them to be Baſtards, and yet obtrude them as true borne. Secondly, their fraud, in that when they make little for them, or it may be againſt them, then they brand them with counterfeit: but when they ſpeake on their behalfe, then they are as true as ſteele: and thus with a blunder of counterfeit Fathers, they dazle the eyes of the ignorant: but the wiſe will iudge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, and learne to diſcerne the Lion by his paw.</p>

Touching their corrupting of true Authors, I will vrge againſt them but foure examples as in the former: but thoſe moſt famous, and three of them corrupted by their moſt famous Ieſuite <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> The firſt is of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> in his ſeuenteenth Homily vpon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> where he readeth, <hi>Shee</hi>

O, but becauſe this reading in the tranſlated Copie maketh for the worſhip of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> therefore in our Ieſuites diuinitie it muſt be preferred.

Firſt, that it is a practice both lawfull and commendable. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if it be vnlawfull, we are more guiltie of it then they. And laſtly, though they meddle with new Writers, yet the Fathers workes are ſincere and free from all corruption.</p>
               <p n="105">105. To whom I reply briefly thus, that as touching his laſt anſwere which concerneth the Fathers, it is manifeſtly falſe, as I haue alreadie diſcouered in foure particulars, and is by Doctor <hi>Iames</hi> in his Booke in many more, and I doubt not but ſhall be more fully ere long made knowne to the world: and therefore, though that there was no rule preſcribed by the Councell of Trent, for the purging of the Fathers; as of yonger Writers: Yet it followeth not but that they might doe it without rule, which alſo <hi>Gretzer</hi> the Ieſuite percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Gretzer de iure &amp; more prohib. lib. 2. c. 9. &amp; 10. pag. 321. 328.</note> to be true, ſeeketh to mend the matter by a fine diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by which indeed he matres it vtterly, and that is that the <hi>Fathers workes, as they are Fathers, need no purging, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered as Sonnes, their words may bee corrected and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the Church; or not as Fathers, but as Fathers-in-law;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Non vt patres, ſed vt vitrici.</note> for when they feed the Church with ſound and wholſome
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:1727:254"/>
doctrine, they are Fathers: if otherwiſe, Fathers-in-law: thus by this fine diſtinction he granteth, that when a Father ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any thing which they account falſe doctrine, he may be corrected, or rather corrupted, for then they eſteeme him not a Father but a ſonne: nor a true Father, but a Father-in-law; ſo that it is apparently falſe, which our new Author affirmeth, that none of the Fathers are corrected by them.</p>
               <p n="106">106. Secondly, touching his middle anſwere, that if it be a fault, we are more guiltie thereof then they. I anſwere, that that is as falſe as the former, for let it bee granted, that ſome Bookes are corrected by ſome Proteſtants; yet firſt, they are the deeds of priuate perſons, and not the acts of the Church, not at all approued, much leſſe authorized by the Church, as theirs are: nay, all of ſounder iudgement in our Church doe aſmuch condemne that practice in our owne, as in any elſe. Secondly, ſuch corruptions or corrections are not frequent with vs, but rare and ſeldome. I dare boldly ſay, for one place altered by vs in any Writer, there are twentie by them, as their owne expurging <hi>Iudices</hi> doe beare witneſſe: and for this, I challenge any Ieſuite, or Romiſh Prieſt whatſoeuer to the encounter. Thirdly, moſt of thoſe Bookes which they lay to our charge, to haue beene corrupted by vs, as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines Meditations, Granadoes Meditations, The conuerſion of a Sinner, The Chriſtian Directorie, Oſianders Enchiridion,</hi> with other more, are not corrected in the originall themſelues, but in their tranſlations into our Language, ſome things are left out, ſome added, ſome changed and altered, as the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators thought good; whereas they corrupt the verie Texts and originall Copies of moſt Writers without difference. Fourthly, we ſeldome alter or change any Booke in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but withall we eyther confeſſe in the beginning of the ſaid Bookes, or profeſſe in the publiſhing of the ſame, this correction or alteration: but they haue practiſed this in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, by certaine Enquiſitors appointed to that purpoſe, the myſterie of which art was long hid from the World, and had ſtill lien in darkneſſe, had not the prouidence of God, for the<note place="margin">Iunius praefat. in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indic. Belgia.</note> good of the Church, firſt diſcouered the <hi>Belgicke Index</hi> by
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:1727:255"/>
mere accident to that godly and bright ſtarre of our Church, <hi>Iunius,</hi> who made it preſently knowne to the world: and at this day few there are that vnderſtand the myſteries of that art: ſo cloſely and cunningly doe they conuay their matters: as for the Books themſelues they do ſeldome or neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their correction in the forefront and beginning of them as wee doe, but by all meanes labour to hide and conceale the ſame. Laſtly, though ſome amongſt vs, haue more raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then wiſely, falſified ſome Writers of leſſer note, in ſome few things: yet they haue not meddled with the Fathers nor Councels: neither haue they done it, to gaine any thing thereby in diſputation, but onely to keepe the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from infection: whereas they ſpare none, neither Fathers nor Councels, nor moderne Writers: and that, not ſo much leſt the common ſort ſhould bee infected, as that the learned might be depriued of thoſe weapons wherewith they might fight againſt them, and wound their cauſe. Seeing the caſe now ſo ſtands, that hee which can muſter vp together the greateſt armie of Authours, to fight vnder his colours, is thought to haue the beſt cauſe: their dealing then with vs, is like that of the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who deſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them of all weapons and inſtruments of warre, that they might dominiere ouer them with greater ſecuritie; but ours is not ſo towards them. And therefore, both in this, and all the former reſpects, it is a miſerable vntruth and a deſperate cua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to ſay, that wee are more guiltie of this crime then they are.</p>
               <p n="107">107. Laſtly, whereas in his firſt anſwere, hee pleadeth the lawfulneſſe of the fact, let vs heare his reaſons to moue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and in the <hi>interim</hi> remember, that in prouing it to bee lawfull, hee confeſſeth it to bee done. But why is it lawfull? Mary, firſt, becauſe the Church being ſupreme Iudge on earth, of all Controuerſies touching faith and Religion, hath authoritie to condemne Heretikes. And therefore alſo, the workes of Heretikes: and if this, then much more to correct and purge their Bookes, if by that meanes ſhee can make them profitable for her vſe, and beneficiall to her children.
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:1727:255"/>
To which I anſwere two things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt, that it is not the Church that doth this, but the ſacred Inquiſitors, to wit, certaine Cardinals and Lawyers deputed to that office, who for the moſt part are ſo farre from being the Church, that they are often, no ſound members thereof: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it be ſaid, that they haue their authoritie from the Pope, who is vertually the whole Church: why doe they then ſpeake ſo darkly, and ſay the Church hath this authoritie, when as, they might in plaine termes ſay that the Pope hath it; but that hereby they ſhould diſplay the feebleneſſe of their cauſe, and the fillineſſe of this reaſon? for thus it would ſtand: Why, is it lawful for Books to be purged? becauſe the Pope thinkes it lawful. And muſt not he needs think ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the Authors croſſe his triple crowne, and ſpeake againſt his ſtate and dignitie? Adde hereunto, that it is a fallacie in reaſoning, when that is taken for granted, which is in queſtion. For we deny their Synagogue to be the true Church: and much more the Pope to bee the ſupreme Iudge: and therefore till thoſe things be proued, the reaſon is of no effect.</p>
               <p n="108">108. Secondly, moſt of thoſe things which are purged by them, are ſo farre from being hereſies or errours, that they are, the moſt of them, ſound doctrines of faith, grounded vpon the authoritie of Gods ſacred truth: for they blot out many things, in both olde and new Authours, that they themſelues dare not accuſe to bee hereticall: as that place in Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> before mentioned touching the power of faith, which is no more in direct termes, then that which is ſaid in the Scripture, <hi>Act. 15. 15. that faith purifieth the heart:</hi> and that in the <hi>Baſil Index of Chryſoſtome, The Church is not built vpon a man,</hi>

Theſe they purge out of <hi>Stephens Index,</hi> which notwithſtanding are directly, and in

as many words recorded in the Booke of God: and ſo it may iuſtly be thought, that they are ſo farre from clenfing Bookes from the droſſe and dregs of errour, that they rather purge out the pure gold and cleare wine of truth, and leaue nothing but dregs and droſſe behind.</p>
               <p n="109">109. His ſecond reaſon is, becauſe nothing is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to infect true Chriſtian hearts, then bad Bookes. Therefore it is not onely lawfull, but needfull and behooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Church of God, that ſuch Bookes <hi>ſhould bee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and burned too, if it bee ſo thought meete by the Church, to the end that the ſinceritie of one true faith and Religion might be preſerued.</hi> I anſwere, all this is true which he ſaith: but are they hereſies which they purge? no, they are ſound and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox opinions, for the moſt part, as hath beene proued in the anſwere to the former reaſon. And doe they it, to keepe Chriſtian men from infection? no, their chiefe end and drift is, to depriue their aduerſaries of all authorities that make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that ſo they might triumph in the antiquitie of their Religion, and noueltie of ours: which is one of their principall arguments which they vſe (though with euill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe) for defence of their cauſe: dealing herein as <hi>Holofer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> did with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Bethulia,</hi> breaking the Conduits, cutting the pipes, and ſlopping the paſſages, which might bring vs prouiſion of good and wholſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, out of the ciſternes of olde and new Writers; this is their purpoſe and no other, whatſoeuer they pretend: for if they meant any good to Gods people for preuenting of infection, they would haue purged their lying Legends of infinite fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, their Canon Law of horrible blaſphemies, and their Schoolemen of many ſtrange opinions. Yea, they would haue condemned the Bookes of <hi>Machiauel,</hi> and of that Cardinall that wrote in commendation of the vnnaturall ſinne of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domie,</hi> and a number ſuch like filthy and deuilliſh Writings, which are printed and reprinted among them without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulement. And againe, is it vnitie in the true faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that they ſeeke? no, it is conſpiracie in falſhood, and conſent in errour: and not vnitie in the truth: till the Romiſh
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:1727:256"/>
Religion bee proued to bee the true Religion (which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be) this reaſon is of no force, to iuſtifie their proceedings. Laſtly, is it Chriſtian policy? no, it is deuiliſh ſubtletie, and craftie forgerie: for the caſe ſo ſtands betwixt them and vs, as in a tryall of land betwixt partie and partie: wherein hee that bringeth beſt euidence and witneſſe, carrieth the cauſe: now, if one partie either ſuborne falſe witneſſes, or corrupt true, or forge euidences to his purpoſe, or falſifie thoſe that are extant, all men will count him as a forger, and his cauſe deſperate, and iudge him worthie the Pillorie: ſo betwixt vs the queſtion is, who hath the right faith, and the beſt title to the Church. Our euidences are firſt and principally Gods Word, then the writings and records of godly men in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: now then, they that ſhall purge, pare, raze, blurr, falſify or corrupt any of theſe, muſt needs bee thought to bee ſubtle and craftie companions, and not honeſt and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing men. The caſe then thus ſtanding, this practice of theirs cannot be termed Chriſtian policy, but plaine ſubtlety, to giue it no worſe a name.</p>
               <p n="110">110. His laſt reaſon is drawne from the practice of the Church of God in all ages, which hath alwaies forbidden the Bookes of Heretikes to be read, and condemned them to the fire: and to this purpoſe he produceth diuers fit and pertinent authorities: to which I anſwere, firſt, that he fighteth herein without an aduerſarie: for we confeſſe, that this was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and commendable practice, to prohibit, condemne, burne and aboliſh all ſuch Bookes as tend to the corrupting of the Chriſtian faith, and alſo to preuent them in the birth, that they may not come to light: but yet for all that, this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not their purging and paring of Bookes: for they cannot giue vs one example in all antiquitie of this dealing, except it bee drawne from Heretikes, whoſe practice it hath<note place="margin">Bel. de verb.

               <p>III. Secondly, the Fathers condemned onely the Bookes
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:1727:257"/>
of Heretikes: but our holy Inquiſitors condemne not onely thoſe whom they call Heretikes, as <hi>Caluine, Luther, Beza, Melancthon;</hi> but mangle and purge the Fathers themſelues, and their owne deare children, whom they dare not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne for Heretikes, as this Author himſelfe confeſleth; thoſe they chop and change, wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="112">112. Thirdly, and laſtly, the Fathers, when they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any Heretike, or hereticall Booke, did it openly to the view of the World, and not ſecretly in a corner, not aſcribing vnto them other opinions then they held, eyther by adding vnto, or detracting from their writings: But our <hi>Romiſh</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors, like Owles, flye by moonſhine, and ſo cloſely c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. That the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not ſo ſafe<note place="margin">Minor.</note> as ours, may appeare by comparing our principall doctrines together: and firſt to begin with the Sacrament. That the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt is truely, really and effectually preſent in the Euchariſt, both they and we hold, grounding vpon that text of Scripture (<hi>this is my bodie:</hi>) but concerning the maner of this preſence, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> hold, that it is by tranſub ſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, there is no change of ſubſtances; and therefore, as much danger of Idolatrie, as eyther of a falſe Prieſt, or of a true Prieſts falſe intention. But in our doctrine there is no ſuch danger, and yet as true, reall and powerfull an exiſtence of Chriſts bodie in the Sacrament, as with them, if not more: ſeeing the more ſpirituall a thing is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the more powerfull it is, according to the rules of reaſon: for wee are not in danger to worſhip a creature in ſtead of the Creatour: but wee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Creatour himſelfe, euen Ieſus Chriſt our Redeemer, who is there preſent after a ſpirituall manner, and that as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently, deuoutly and ſincerely, as they doe a piece of bread.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Secondly, by this doctrine our aduerſaries incline to fauour the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> who had a conceit of a corporall and fleſhly eating of Chriſts bodie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and giue iuſt cauſe to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>

But our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth giue no ſuch occaſion, eyther to the Heretikes on the one ſide, or to the <hi>Pagans</hi> on the other, neyther hath it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conſanguinitie with the <hi>Capernaites;</hi> and yet wee retaine as certaine and powerfull a participation of our Sauiours bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud as they doe. I know, they thinke to eſcape from this rocke, by a diſtinction of viſible and inuiſible ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:1727:259"/>
as if the <hi>Capernaites</hi> dreamed that Chriſt would haue his bodie to bee eaten viſibly, but they inuiſibly, that is (ſay they) ſpiritually: which indeed is no cuaſion, for an inuiſible eating is a true eating. As when a blind man eateth, or a ſeeing man in the darke, and cannot therefore be called a ſpirituall eating, but a corporall: neyther doth this free them from approching neere to the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> though they ſomewhat differ from them, nor from giuing iuſt cauſe of offence to the Heathen; from both which our doctrine giueth full and perfect ſecuritie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thirdly, and laſtly, their doctrine of tranſubſtantiation doth not onely countenance, but confirme the ancient here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the <hi>Marcionites, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentinians</hi> and <hi>Eutychians,</hi> that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned the truth of Chriſts humane nature, for they taught that he had not a true, but a phantaſticall bodie; and what do our aduerſaries but approue the ſame indeede, though they ſeeme to deteſt it in word? when they teach that his bodie is preſent in the Sacrament, not by circumſcription, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, but by a ſpirituall and diuine preſence, <hi>quomodo</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bell. de Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. lib. 3. cap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Deus eſt in loco,</hi> as God is in a place, which is aſmuch as to ſay, that his bodie is not a true bodie, but a ſpirituall bodie, that is, indeed a phantaſticall bodie. Againe, the bread which they ſay is the bodie, is not bread in truth, but in ſhew, after it is conſecrated: for there is nothing of bread, but the mere accidents without a ſubſtance, according to their doctrine; and ſo it is in all reaſonable conſtruction no better then a phantaſticall thing, ſeeming to the outward ſenſe, to bee that which in truth it is not. Why may not thoſe Heretikes then reaſon from theſe doctrines thus? If Chriſts bodie be a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bodie in the Euchariſt, and the bread be phantaſticall bread, then why might not his bodie be ſo alſo, when he was on the earth? But the former is true by your doctrine, O ye <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> therefore why may not the latter, which is our doctrine, be alſo true? But none of theſe Heretikes can haue any ſuch aduantage from our doctrine, which teacheth that Chriſt, in reſpect of his humane nature, is reſident in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, circumſcribed by place, and that hee is preſent in the
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:1727:259"/>
Sacrament, by the <hi>efficacie of his inuiſible, and powerful grace, after a ſpirituall manner,</hi> as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. tract. 50. in Ioh. in v. 8. c. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that both the bread remaineth bread after conſecration, and the bodie of Christ remaineth ſtill a naturall bodie, after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> retaining ſtill the former circumſcription, as <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Theodoret Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. 2. 105.</note> auoucheth: <hi>this taketh away all aduantage from Heretikes,</hi> which their doctrine doth manifeſtly giue vnto them.

                  <hi>could be accorded with the Churches determination.</hi> And Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham, that it is <hi>ſubiect to leſſe incommodities, and leſſe repugnant to holy Scripture.</hi> Thus wee ſee, that in this firſt doctrine touching the Euchariſt, there is more ſecuritie, and leſſe danger in our doctrine and Religion, then in theirs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I come to a ſecond point, which is, touching the merits of works: whereby the Romiſh Religion doth caſt men into three eminent dangers which by our doctrine they are free from. Firſt, of vaine glory: for when a man is perſwaded that there is a merit of condignitie, in the worke which hee hath wrought, how can he chooſe but reioyce therein, and conceiue a vaine-glorious opinion of his owne worthineſſe: as the proud Phariſe did, when he bragged that he had faſted and prayed, and payd his tithes? ſeeing it is impoſsible, but that the nature of man which is inclinable vnto vaine-glory, and ſelfe-loue: if it haue a conceit of any ſelfe-worthineſſe, ſhould bee puffed vp with a certaine inward ioy, and pride: and therefore <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> taketh it for wholeſome counſel, to ſay, <hi>that wee bee vnprofitable ſeruants, leſt pride deſtroy our</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chryſ. in Luc. 17</note> 
                  <hi>good workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Secondly, of obſcuring and diminiſhing Gods glorie and Chriſts merits. For where merit is, there mercie is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: and where ſomething is aſcribed to man for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of ſaluation, there all is not aſcribed vnto Chriſt: and although they colour the blacke viſage of this doctrine, with a faire tincture, to wit, that all our merits are from Gods mercie and grace, and that our good workes are dyed in
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:1727:260"/>
Chriſts bloud, and thence receiue all their vertue, and rigor: yet it is but a falſe pretence: falſe, becauſe they acknowledge ſome merits before grace, as thoſe of congruitie, and ſuch as iſſue from grace, yet in part, to be of nature aſwel as of grace, as hath beene alreadie diſcouered: and a pretence, becauſe, if they receiue all their vertue from Gods grace and Chriſts bloud, then they are not to be termed our merits, but Gods: neither can bee ſaid to deſerue any thing at Gods hand of a proper worthineſſe, as they teach, they doe, but of Gods grace and mere mercie, which they diſclaime: a falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence then is this, and doth not free them from this danger of diminiſhing Gods glorie: and this alſo is confeſſed by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who ſayth, <hi>that we liue more ſaſely, if we attribute</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Thirdly, of making the beſt vncertaine of their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for as they teach, no man can bee certaine of his owne righteouſneſſe, nor of the goodneſſe of his workes, by reaſon of the manifold defects that cleaue vnto their beſt deeds, and alſo in reſpect of the vnſcrutable deceit of mans owne heart, which is hidden not onely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eies of other men, but euen from a mans owne ſelfe, and is knowne onely vnto God, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> telleth vs, and alſo in reſpect of the ſtrict<note place="margin">Ier. 17. 9.</note> rule of Gods iuſtice, whereby they muſt bee examined.

                  <hi>That though Iob was a righteous man, yet he himſelfe was afraid of himſelfe.</hi> And <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaketh to like effect, when hee ſayth; <hi>That the holy man Iob, becauſe he ſaw all the merit of our vertue to be faultie, if it be ſtrictly iudged by him which iudgeth within, ſayth rightly, If I will contend with him, I ſhall not bee able to anſwere one for a thouſand.</hi> Now, that which befell righteous <hi>Iob,</hi> how can it but bee incident to all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? So, that though they talke of meritorious workes in

generall, yet no man can be ſure that his workes in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar are ſuch: and therefore no man, be he neuer ſo iuſt, can be ſure of his ſaluation. I ſpeake not here of that certaintie which is by faith, which they deny, but that aſſurance which is by hope, which they confeſſe: for a man cannot poſſibly hope that he ſhall by ſaued by his workes; when as he cannot poſſibly know, whether his beſt workes are ſuch as deſerue the fauour or disfauour of God. And if it is the propertie of all Gods children by the example of <hi>Iob</hi> to be afraid of their workes, then how can they repoſe any hope and confidence in them? now all this is ſo euident, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe is<note place="margin">

               <p n="8">8.

therefore our owne workes being tainted and ſtained with ſuch ſinnes, cannot ſtand in proportion with it.

I know, their cuaſion is, that indeed it doth require an infinite vertue, to ſatisfie for the euerlaſting puniſhment of ſinne: but the temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment being limited, may bee ſatisfied for, by a temporall ſatisfaction: a mere colluſion: for firſt, if a temporall paine, or finite action, can merit and purchaſe an euerlaſting reward, as they teach, why ſhould not the ſame redeeme from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting puniſhment? their confeſſion in the one condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their aſſertion in the other: and becauſe they deny that our merits of ſatisfaction can rel eaſe from hell, they muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of neceſſitie deny, or at leaſt bluſh to auouch, that our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of purchaſe are of ſufficient valew to deſerue heauen: hell and heauen being as of equall diſtance from man, ſo of equal merit or demerit to man.

Whereas if our doctrine bee falſe, wee onely detract from the glorie of the creatures, and giue it vnto the Creatour. Now, by how much it is a greater ſinne to doe iniurie to the Creatour, then to the creature, by ſo much the more dangerous is their doctrine, then ours: and as it is ſafer to aſcribe that glory to God, which is due to man, then to man that, that is due to God; ſo is there more ſafetie in our doctrine then in theirs.</p>

Secondly, in reſpect of charitie: if they erre in this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, then doe they turne the holy Saints of God into ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominable Idols, and ſo offer that wrong vnto them, which, they being iealous of Gods glorie, of all things moſt deteſt: as the examples of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the<note place="margin">Act 14. 15.

of them in our Churches. Now in charity, whether is a greater wrong to the Saints, to turne them into Idols, that is, into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, or for zeale of Gods glorie, to take from them a little of their due honour?</p>

Now let vs conſider, and examine whether of theſe two doctrines are more ſafe for a man to repoſe his ſoule vpon. And that our doctrine is ſo, may appeare firſt by the nature of the queſtion it ſelfe, which is controuerted betwixt them and vs: for the queſtion is not, whether the Scripture bee the Word of God, or no: therein wee ſhake hands, as an vndoubted truth: but whether tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions bee the Word of God or no: the affirmatiue they hold, wee the negatiue, and that by great and ſtrong grounds, which our aduerſaries themſelues cannot deny, but that they carrie great ſhew of reaſon and probabilitie. Now whether is the ſafer courſe, to relye our faith vpon thoſe principles that are vnqueſtionably Gods Word: or vpon thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted, diſputed, and called in queſtion? Any man that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to buy a purchaſe, will ſooner venture vpon ſuch a title which was neuer called in queſtion, nor can indeed bee doubted of, then vpon a broken, diſputable, and vndecided title: he will looke twice vpon his pennie, before he part with it, in ſuch a caſe, leſt <hi>caueat emptor</hi> proue him to bee of little diſcretion, and teach him to repent when it is too late.

How much more then ſhould it preuaile in caſes of conſcience, where the damage is not of houſe and land, but of our ſoules, which to euery man ought to be more precious then the whole world?

His ſuffering them to continue in that cruell torment, argueth him either to want power to relieue them, or mercie to put that power in execution: both which are vnbeſeeming qualities for Chriſts Vicar.

But the Popes indulgence can helpe that, for hee hath in his Treaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe ſuch a ſurpluſſage of Saints merits, that can ſerue to make good whatſoeuer is wanting in their behalfe: and the Pope by their doctrine hath authoritie to diſpence &amp; diſpoſe of theſe merits, at his diſcretion. Or is it for feare leſt purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie ſhould bee emptied, and ſo hee ſhould loſe one part of his Kingdome?

                  <hi>Paul</hi> attributes to his regiment <hi>things vnder earth,</hi> that is, in hell: and wil his Vicar needs haue a larger dominion then his Maſter? But indeed this is the true reaſon. For if hee ſhould make a goale deliuerie, out of this infernall priſon: then his chiefeſt ſway were gone, yea, and his reuenue too. It ſtands vpon him therefore not to bee pleaſed to deliuer any out of theſe paines, vnleſſe he bee well pleaſed for his paines: and if

hee bee ſo, then the ſoules ſhall flye out of that place to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in whole troupes, as they ſay they did, at the Prayer of a certaine holy man, &amp;c.

               <p n="33">33. Another dangerous conſequence ariſeth hencefrom, to all the profeſſors of Religion in generall: that is, a feareful preſumption and ſecuritie of ſinning, when they are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that after this life they may be releaſed from the paines of purgatorie by the prayers, almeſdeeds, Maſſes and other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious workes of the liuing: for who would bee afraid to ſinne, or carefull to make his ſaluation ſure in this life with feare and trembling, when hee beleeueth, that by giuing a ſumme of monie at his death for <hi>Maſſes and dirges</hi> to be ſung for his ſoule, he ſhall be certainly deliuered out of purgatory? This muſt needs caſt men into manifeſt preſumption, if not of all ſinnes, yet of veniall ſinnes, and ordinarie offences, which are to be purged by that fire, as they teach. Is not our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine more ſound and ſafe, that informeth vs, that ſuch as die in their ſinnes, ſinke downe to the loweſt Hell, as hopeleſſe after death to bee relieued by anything that can bee done for their ſakes by the liuing? doth not this teach men betimes to bee wiſe? and to finiſh vp the worke of their ſaluation <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the night come? and make their peace with God, whilest they are here in the way of grace, not deluding their ſoules with a fond expectation of other mens deuotions?</hi> Sure it is, that the opinion of purgatorie and prayer for the dead, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie nouriſh a preſumption of veniall ſinnes at the leaſt, which our doctrine adiudgeth to hell, without repentance, aſwell as any other: and becauſe few are able to diſtinguiſh betwixt mortall and veniall ſinnes, but iudge them veniall which are to Gods iudgement mortall, as their Ieſuite <hi>Coſter</hi> confeſſeth,<note place="margin">Coſter Enchirid. de ſide ſpecial.</note> when hee ſayth, that <hi>that may ſeeme a light offence vnto man, which is haynous in Gods ſight:</hi> therefore it muſt needs alſo bee in danger to breed a ſecret preſumption of mortall ſinnes alſo.

our neighbour, and certaintie to a mans conſcience: and conſequently our doctrine that holdeth the contrarie, is more ſafe, in all thoſe reſpects.

Then it muſt needs follow, if the ſame priuiledge be not granted to the children of Chriſtian Parents, that the couenant of the Goſpell is not ſo large, as the couenant of the Law: nor Gods mercie ſo bountifull to Chriſtians, as to <hi>Iewes;</hi> nor the merits of Chriſt ſo effectuall after his comming in the fleſh, as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: by all which the glorie of the Goſpell and grace of Chriſt is much defaced, and the vnbounded Ocean of Gods mercie limited and ſtinted.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Touching charitie, is it not an vncharitable conceit, to deſpaire of the ſaluation of poore infants dying without Baptiſme? and that, both towards the infants themſelues, who though they are borne in originall ſinne, yet are innocent from actuall tranſgreſſions: and towards the Parents, who being themſelues within the couenant, hereby are depriued

of that chiefe comfort of the couenant, which is, that God is not <hi>onely their God, but the God of their ſeed:</hi> and towardes the Church, that hereby is robbed of a great part of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and made vnable to preſent young infants to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Chriſt Ieſus.

               <p n="37">37. Laſtly, touching the perilous conſequences that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vpon this doctrine, I need name but theſe three, to wit, firſt, that it maketh God more mercifull to men of yeeres, then vnto tender infants: for they teach, that men of yeeres (as <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour) may be ſaued, <hi>by the Baptiſme of the Spirit, or by the Baptiſme of bloud, which is Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, though they want the Baptiſme of water:</hi> but infants, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they may haue the Spirit of ſanctification, euen in the wombe, as <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> had, <hi>and may be Martyrs according to</hi>

                  <hi>their opinion, as the children that Herod cauſed to be ſlaine,</hi> yet if they want the Sacrament of water, they adiudge them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily to be baniſhed from Gods preſence for euer. Now then children and men being in the ſame predicament: either the one muſt be admitted to Gods fauour aſwell as the other, or it muſt needs follow, that God is partial and more fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the one then the other. If they ſay that men, though they haue not the act of Baptiſme, yet they haue <hi>votum,</hi> a deſire vnto it, which being intercepted by ſome ſodaine accident, is ſupplied by inward grace: I anſwere with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that<note place="margin">Bell. de baptiſ. l. 1 cap. 9.</note>

                  <hi>to the act of other: becauſe the mercie of God imputeth to them as their owne will, the will of another.</hi> Inſants therefore ſtand ſtill in as good caſe in euery reſpect, as men of yeares, if not in better, both being vnbaptized, and the one dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God by their owne deſire, the other by the purpoſe &amp; deſire of the Church: and therefore, either theſe may bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aſwell as they, or elſe God is not ſo mercifull to them, as to theſe: which is no leſſe then impietie to thinke, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie to pronounce.</p>
               <p n="38">38.
