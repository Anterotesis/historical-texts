            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was not my intendment to have appeared thus publickly, but being requested by the near Relations of this worthy Minister deceased to print my Sermon, (which by their appointment was preached) I knew not well how to withstand their importunity. Indeed I was the more willing to let these lines be published, that I might raise a <hi>Pillar of Remembrance</hi> to the precious name of Mr. <hi>Stubs.</hi> The Subject-matter treated on is the Christian <hi>Combat</hi> and <hi>Crown.</hi> O blessed Crown which cannot be fully pencilled out in its orient colours, though an arch-angel should take the pencill. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours had three several Crowns set upon their head; the first was of Iron, the second of Silver, the third of Gold. God sets three Crowns upon the Elect, <hi>Grace, Joy, Glory.</hi> What should we thirst after but this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible bliss! Did our thoughts dwell above, we should live sweeter lives. The higher the Lark flys, the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it sings. <hi>Cyprus</hi> was anciently called <hi>Macaria,</hi> the <hi>blessed Island;</hi> but it is more true of Heaven, it is the <hi>blessed Island.</hi> 'Tis a place where sorrow cannot live, and joy cannot die. It may be compared to the fields of <hi>Sicily,</hi> where there is continual Spring, and flowers all the year long. Could our Meditations mount up to the Empyraean delights, how would the World disappear

and shrink into nothing! <hi>

            <p>THese words were spoken by <hi>Paul the aged</hi> not long before his death, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>I am now ready to be offered,</hi> or (as the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> signifies) to have <hi>my blood poured out in sacrifice.</hi> And what a comfort was it to make this noble profession before his departure, <hi>I have fought a good fight,</hi> &amp;c. The Text falls into three Parts:</p>
            <p n="1">1. St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Courage, <hi>I have fought a good fight.</hi>

life is not effeminate and slothful, but like the Soldiers life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In respect of <hi>hardship:</hi> A Soldier hath not his soft bed or daily fair, but undergoes tedious marches; such is the Christian life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</hi> We must not be <hi>delicatuli</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks) silken Christians, but expect to wrestle with difficulties: The naked neck is too soft and tender to bear the Cross of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In respect of <hi>Watchfulness:</hi> A Soldier gets up to his Watch-tower, and sends abroad his scouts for fear the Enemy surprize him; a Christian must <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubias agere,</hi> stand sentinel, be ever upon his guard. It was Christs Watch-word, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 37. <hi>I say to you all watch.</hi> When you have prayed against sin, watch against temptation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In respect of <hi>Combat,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Fight the good fight of faith.</hi> In order to which fight, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian must get his Armour and Weapons ready.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He must get his <hi>Armour</hi> ready, the care of most is to get riches, not armour; there are two things absolutely needful, <hi>food</hi> and <hi>armour;</hi> 'tis necessary to get Christ for our food and grace for our armour without this there is no abiding the day of Tryal: A Soldier that wears his Princes Colours, but hath no armour, will soon fly the field; such as by a profession wear Christs Colours, but have not the <hi>Armour of God</hi> upon them, will turn their backs in the day of battel.</p>
            <p>There are two chief pieces of the spiritual armour. 1. The <hi>Helmet,</hi> that is, <hi>Divine Hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>For an helmet the hope of salvation:</hi> An Helmet is to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56007:4"/>
defend the head that it be not hurt <note n="*" place="margin">Galta caput tuetur.</note>; so the hope of salvation as an Helmet defends a person, and makes him lift up his head in the greatest dangers. But Christians, be sure ye get the right helmet, the helmet of hope may be counterfeited.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first deceit of the Helmet, or a false hope, is a dead hope; Hypocrites have a faint velleity, they hope for Heaven, but exert no activity in working out salvation; but true hope is a <hi>lively hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 3. Hope of Glory sets an edg upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and adds wings to the endeavour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A false hope is an unclean hope, a man hopes, but sins; 'tis vain to speak of hopes of salvation, yet have the marks of damnation: True hope is an Helmet made of pure metal, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. <hi>He who hath this hope, purifieth himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A false hope is vanishing, 'tis not an <hi>Helmet,</hi> but a <hi>spiders Web</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Job 8. 14.</note>; the least terror of Conscience shakes it, but a true hope is permanent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 32. <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death,</hi> in a dying hour his hope is in a living God. When <hi>Quintian</hi> the Persecutor commanded to cut off the breasts of <hi>Agatha</hi> a Martyr, Do thy worst Tyrant (said he), yet I have two breasts which you cannot touch; the one of Faith, the other of Hope. <note n="*" place="margin">Duae tamen supersunt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millae, una fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei, altera spes.</note> O get the right Helmet, the Devil laughs at Hypocrites to see how they are cousened with false armour: A fool is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a Paper-helmet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second piece of the Spiritual Armour is the <hi>brest-plate,</hi> which is <hi>Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Putting on the breast-plate of Love.</hi> This breast-plate is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable, it may be shot at, but it cannot be shot thorow, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 7. A soul armed with love, will

                  <hi>Non pugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti sed vincenti dabitur corona,</hi> Aug.</note> This is the glory of a Christian not only to <hi>hold forth</hi> the truth, but to <hi>hold fast</hi> the truth, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 16. <hi>Mnason of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus an old Disciple;</hi> 'tis a beautiful sight to see sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hairs crowned with golden vertues. It was the honour of the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> her <hi>last works were better than her first,</hi> Rev. 2. 19. The excellency of a medicine is when it keeps its vertue. To finish the course and keep the faith, is like generous Wine that keeps its spirits to the last drawing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. Here is a bill of inditement against such as before the finishing of their course, have departed from the faith; they are fallen to worldliness or wantonness, the very mantle of their profession is fallen off. <hi>Desinit in Piscem mulier formosa superne.</hi> Such were <hi>Lucian, Porphiry, Peter Castellon, Judas. Judas</hi> hath many successors. <hi>Demas</hi> forsook God, <note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 10.</note> and afterwards became a Priest in an Idol-Temple, saith <hi>Dorotheus. Julian</hi> bathed himself in the blood of beasts offered in sacrifice to Heathen gods, and so as much as in him lay, washed off his Baptism. Things which move from an artificial spring quickly cease; unfound hearts having only external artifices of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but wanting a <hi>vital</hi> principle of Grace, soon make a stop in Religion. How can they adhere to God who never loved him? The Soldier who hath no true love to his <hi>commander,</hi> will throw off his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours., <hi>Hos.</hi> 8. 3. <hi>Israel hath cast off the thing that is good.</hi> We have had more shipwracks at <hi>Land</hi> than at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56007:8"/>
               <hi>Sea,</hi> men have made shipwrack of their <hi>conscience,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. Apostates unravel the work they have been doing for Heaven, they pick out all their gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den stitches, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 14. As if a Limner should with a pencil draw a curious piece, and then come with his spunge and wipe it out again. Apostates drop as windfalls into the Devils mouth, they having disparaged the ways of God, <hi>and put Christ to open shame,</hi> Heb. 6. 6. God will make them do penance in Hell <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10. 38.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. Persevere in the Faith. What is a man the better to run some part of the race and then tire? so to go within an inch of Heaven, and then fall short <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Non quarun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis initia, sed finis.</hi> Hierom.</note>. Who makes reckoning of corn that sheds before harvest? or fruit that falls from the tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be ripe? O Christians, remember your <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is now nearer,</hi> Rom. 13. 11. You are within prospect of the Holy land, and will you now tire in your march? this is as if a Ship laden with Jewels and Spices, and within sight of the shore should be cast away; or as if a <hi>Jew</hi> had been running to the <hi>city of refuge,</hi> and had gotten within half a furlong of the city, and then had fainted, and been slain by the avenger of blood. 'T was <hi>Beza</hi>'s Prayer, <hi>Lord, perfect that which thou hast begun in me, that I may not</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Domine quod capisti perfice, nè in portu naufragium accidas.</note> 
               <hi>suffer shipwrack when I am almost in the haven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mot.</hi> Consider, persevering in the Faith is a note of discrimination between a true Saint and an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; the hypocrite he sets up in the trade of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but will soon break; he advanceth his mast and topsail, and sets out fair for Heaven, but in <hi>time of temptation</hi> falls away, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. but a true Christian is fixed in holiness; he is not as a <hi>wave</hi> of the Sea, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56007:8"/>
as a <hi>Rock</hi> in the Sea. His zeal like the fire of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal Virgins</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> is always kept burning.</p>
            <p>That we may spin out this fine thread of Religion to its full length, and hold out to the end,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us be well grounded in the Fundamentals of Religion, the Doctrine of Justification, Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Resurrection, and the eternal recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Grounded and setled;</hi> such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled will be led into any error, the <hi>Masse</hi> or the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> you may lead a blind man any whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he will hardly ever suffer for the truth that doth not know it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we would hold on in the Faith let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a jealous fear of our selves; fear is the souls life-guard, it causeth vigilance, it banisheth presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>Be not high-minded but fear.</hi> If God lets go his manu-tenancy we fall. How many have been over-turned with self-confidence as the vessel with the sail. <hi>Pendleton's</hi> proud brag was soon confuted, instead of his fat melting in the fire, his heart melted; the fear of falling keeps us from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Fear begets prayer, and prayer begets strength, and strength begets constancy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we would keep the Faith to the end, let us labour to tast the sweetness of Religion in our own souls, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 8. <hi>O tast and see that the Lord is good.</hi> The light of Truth is one thing, the rellish is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 103. <hi>How sweet are thy words unto my tast, yea sweeter than honey.</hi> Many fall away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they never tasted what Religion was; they could tast some sweetness in corn and oyl, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises were <hi>dry brests.</hi> If the wine of the Word have ever chear'd our heart, we will never part with it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56007:9"/>
4. If we would continue our progress in the ways of God, let us be inlaid with sincerity; this silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread must run through the whole chain of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. A Christian may have a <hi>double principle,</hi> but he hath not a <hi>double heart;</hi> he is <hi>perfect with the Lord, Deut.</hi> 18. 13. Nothing will hold out but sincerity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 21. <hi>Let integrity preserve me.</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> could not hold fast his Estate, yet he held fast his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; whence was this? from his sincerity, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 6. <hi>My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go, my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</hi> The garment of <hi>Job's</hi> profession did not tear, because it was lined with sincerity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third part of the Text is St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Crown, <hi>Henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness;</hi> it is <hi>Corona recondita,</hi> a Crown laid up. A Christians best things are to come <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>And what Crown is this? <hi>a Crown of Righteousness.</hi> The felicity of Heaven is described sometimes by a <hi>city</hi> for riches, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 10. sometimes by a <hi>country</hi> for pleasure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 16. sometimes by a <hi>Crown</hi> for honour. And this Crown hath various Appellations:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is called a <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 4. it is full of splendor, therefore said to be bespangled with Stars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1. We can no more bear a sight of this Crown till God enlarge our capacities, than a weak eye can bear the dazling beams of the Sun.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is called a Crown <hi>of life,</hi> Jam. 1. 12. whoever heard before of a <hi>living Crown?</hi> It is a Crown of

life, not only (as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith) because it is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the life to come, but because it enlivens with joy; it not only Crowns the head, but chears the heart. 'Tis a <hi>living Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is called a <hi>Crown of Righteousness</hi> in the Text; not that it is of right due to us, or comes of <hi>merit,</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> corruptly gloss; we cannot deserve a <hi>crum</hi> at Gods hands, much less a <hi>Crown.</hi> That which merits must be a <hi>gift,</hi> not a <hi>debt,</hi> whatever service we do for God is a <hi>due debt;</hi> nay, we cannot pay <hi>all;</hi> nay, that which we pay is not in <hi>currant money,</hi> our duties are stained with sin, where then is merit? but it is called <hi>a Crown of Righteousness,</hi> because it is purchased by Christs righteousness, and because God having promised this Crown, it is righteous in him to bestow it.</p>

The Heavenly Crown is expressed by a <hi>weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17. This Crown of righteousness doth out-vye, and exceed all earthly Crowns.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is more <hi>refined;</hi> earthly Crowns are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with troubles; they are not made without crosses.

may be said of them, as <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>Madness is in their heart.

Let this be as <hi>Bezoar-stone</hi> to revive and bear up your hearts under all your present sufferings, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 23. <hi>Bonds and afflictions abide me.</hi> Affliction is the Saints diet-drink; instead of Roses they are <hi>crowned with thorns.</hi> You may aswell separate weight from lead, as sufferings from a Saints life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 8. <hi>We are troubled on every side.</hi> Believers are as a ship that hath the waves beating on both sides, but this Text may buoy them up from sinking, there is glory which doth succed and exceed all their sufferings. The Saints now drink in a wormwood-cup, but shortly they shall drink in a <hi>spiced cup,</hi> and tast the same heavenly <hi>Nectar</hi> as the Angels. One days wearing the Coelestial Crown, will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly pay for all their sufferings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon that the sufferings of this present time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</hi> The weight of glory makes affliction light. O ye Saints who are the true <hi>birds of paradise</hi> sing in winter, there is glory behind, and every suffering will be like a grain put in the scale to make your glory weigh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier. Suffering Saints shall have more Jewels hung upon their Crown.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let this be an antidote against the fear of death. The day of death is (as <hi>Seneca</hi> calls it) <hi>aeterni natalis, the birth-day of eternity;</hi> believers are not fully hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py till death <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sicut testa ovorum quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis pulchre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata, necesse est tamen eam frangi ut inde pullus procedat; ita hujus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris necesse est testam, ut sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ille sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limior regni coelestis efful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geat.</hi> Clem Al.</note>. Death therefore is made a part of the inventory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Death is yours.</hi> When the mantle of the flesh drops off, the soul ascends in a triumphant chariot; God hath promised his people a <hi>portion,</hi> but it is not paid them till the day of death. 'Tis <hi>their fathers good pleasure to give them a Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12. 32. but they cannot see it till death hath closed their eyes. Why then should the Saints be troubled at death? indeed I wonder not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56007:16"/>
that the wicked are appal'd, and scared at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the <hi>King of terror;</hi> they are in debt to Gods justice, and death as Gods Serjeant arrests them, and drags them before the Divine Tribunal. But why should any of Gods children be under such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation, and have <hi>the trembling at the heart?</hi> What hurt doth death do to them? it pulls off their fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and puts jewels upon them; it leads them to gates of Pearl, rivers of pleasures. Faith gives a title to Heaven, death a possession.</p>
            <p>Go forth my soul, said <hi>Hilarion</hi> on his death-bed, what fearest thou? why should the godly dread their priviledg? is a Prince afraid to cross the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas who is sure to be Crowned assoon as he comes at shore? This puts Roses into the pale face of death, and makes it look more ruddy and amiable; it is <hi>aditus ad gloriam,</hi> it crowns the Saints with all the delights of the Empyraean Heaven.</p>
            <p>I Have done with the Text, it remains that I should speak something to the occasion.</p>
            <p>It hath pleased the all-wise God to take to himself lately, that reverend and faithful Minister Mr. <hi>Henry Stubs,</hi> whose death we now commemorate. <hi>The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the just is blessed. Fulgentius</hi> calls a good name <hi>the godly mans heir,</hi> it lives when he is dead. This <hi>man of God</hi> hath left a sweet favour and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume behind in Gods Church, besides his atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of humane learning, he was enriched with the knowledg of <hi>Christ crucified.</hi> The Graces excell the Muses.</p>
            <p>He was very humble; humility is the best garment a Minister can preach in <note n="*" place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 5.</note>. He was <hi>one of a thousand</hi> for integrity. The plainer the Diamond is, the richer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:56007:16"/>
He was a grave Preacher, and did chuse rather to speak <hi>solidè</hi> than <hi>floridè.</hi> He spake <hi>as became the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God.</hi> Levity is below the majesty of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>He was a painful labourer in Gods Vineyard; he preached <hi>in season and out of season.</hi> The souls of people were dearer to him than his life <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nec propter vitam vivendi perdere causam.</hi> D. Reyn.</note>. Praying and Preaching was rather his <hi>delight</hi> than <hi>task.</hi> He was a <hi>burning lamp</hi> consuming himself to give light to others.</p>
            <p>He preached feelingly; he felt those truths in his own soul which he recommended to his Auditors; an unconverted Minister is like a Lute, making sweet Musick to others, but it self is not sensible; this <hi>elect vessel</hi> retained a scent and rellish of those sacred Truths which he poured out to others.</p>
            <p>He lived much by faith, and had sweet converse with God; all the Saints have Gods heart, but some have more of his company.</p>
            <p>He was Exemplary in his deportment; he did <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Ministers by vertue of their calling, approach nearer to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 22. The Elements the higher they are, the purer; the fire is purer than the air. The higher we are by office, the holier we should be. <hi>Quo sublimiores, eo sanctiores.</hi> This bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed person deceased, did live as an incarnate Angel. I may say of him as <hi>Basil</hi> of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> he thundred in his Doctrine, and lightned in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</p>
            <p>He was charitable-minded. I have been credibly informed, that out of that little he had gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether while he was in his Living, he appointed two hundred pounds (which he intrusted in the hands of Feoffees) to be improved annually for the good of the poor to buy them Bibles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56007:17"/>
He was of a sweet temper, never fierce but against sin. He was devout towards God, affable to his Friends, loving to his Relations.</p>
            <p>The Lord honoured his Ministry very much, he had a double Crown; the souls he converted were his <hi>Crown of rejoicing</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Thes. 2. 19.</note>, and now he wears a <hi>Crown of Righteousness.</hi> How great a loss hath <hi>Glocestershire</hi> and <hi>London</hi> of this eminent Minister. It hath been told me, that he set apart some time every day to pray for the Church of God; he (like <hi>Moses)</hi> lay in the breach to turn away wrath; we shall soon grow poor if we lose such praying friends. During the time of this good mans sickness, he was asthmatical, and laboured much for breath, so that he could not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himself so freely, but what was heard to drop from him was very savoury. He said he had fled to the <hi>city of refuge,</hi> and recited that Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.</hi> I pray God give all who are concerned in this loss, wisdom to improve this present stroke, and make a living Sermon of their dead Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. He is now <hi>voti compos,</hi> he enjoys the sight of that God whom he so pathetically longed for upon his death-bed. He is got into the upper region above all storms. His body is returned to dust, and his soul to rest. He is enclosed in happiness, as the word for <hi>Crowning</hi> imports <note n="*" place="margin">
