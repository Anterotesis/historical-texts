            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

beſtow their trauayles, and learnedly lend
the practyſes of their pennes to diſplay, diſcipher, and offer
out to the gazing view of the world, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtore of their cunning,
and the gallauntneſſe of their inuentions: Some tende to

ſome conduce to the aduauncement of vertue &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of the wel deſeruing: ſome to the ſuppreſſing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling,
beating downe, and ſubduing of vyce, with a deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the loathſome lyfe of the wicked, and the ruynous

according to his ability, to further and promote vertue, and
by al conuenyent meanes to rehate loſe lyfe, &amp; to bring vyce
into contempte among all men: the very practiſe whereof,
bringeth deteſtation, and the end wherof bredeth confuſyon.
And becauſe no way ſéemeth ſo redy to exhort, anymate, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyſe,
and incourage to well doing, neyther any courſe ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
to dehort, terrifye, abaſh, and diſcorage from euill doing,
and eſpecially them of the yonger ſorte (wherein is moſte
daunger, and who yet ſtand tottering and balauncing in the
ſcales of aduyſement, vncertayne which way to wende, or
what path to trace) from the ordinary purſuit of their wilful
affections and inordinate appetites, then by the Examples
of others, that haue trodden the way afore, whoſe ſucceſſe
they may applye to their owne direction: therfore haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good Aucthours, both old and new, peculyarlye intituled

their workes by the name and tytle of Examples, Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically

ſome for vertue, haue ryſen to honour, fame, dignitie, and
renowne, and ſome for vyce haue bene throwne downe, and
buryed in the pit of diſhonour, ſhame, reproch, and eternall
infamy. So that the worthy aduancement of the one, maye
be a ſharp ſpurre to ſtyrre vp to goodneſſe, and the lothſome

<pb facs="tcp:24834:5"/>
reducing the ground of his conceyued meaning, into a méete

But this Duke was renowned for the

I beleeue that Bucyrus Phalaris, or that
Thracian King which foſtred his Horſes with

chaunced which I am now about to deſcrybe
vnto you, to the ende you may beholde the two
great and extreame vyces, the one of Auaryce
in a Prieſt, and the other of the crueltie, of the
Duke. Iohn Maria ryding one day thorough
his Cittye, as commonly he did, not onely for to
beholde the faultes of his ſubiectes, but more to
ſearch out if any one durſt complayn of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
maners of his lyfe, and the very hauty

him, that ſhoulde complayne without cauſe of
his Lord, that as yet had giuen him no occaſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Thus as he made theſe Iorneys, he hard a
farre of, a great crye, and the voyce of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
complayning, who clapping her hands,
did eleuate her voyce verye high, thinking
that GOD was deafe, and that he will not
heare our neceſſityes, without ſuch a ſturre, to
whome he ſent one of his ſeruaunts, to know
the cauſe of a crye ſo fearefull, who found it at

lately deceaſed, that thus complayned, as well
for the loſſe of her companyon, as alſo for that
<pb facs="tcp:24834:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhee had not wherewith to bring him to the
earth. Alas, ſayth the woman (half deſperate)
whether may the pore haue their recourſe? ſyth
the very Church hath denyde their duetyes to
them, vnto whome they be bounde, to whome
may I adreſſe my ſelfe? not hauing wherewith
to ſatiſfye, or glent the deſyre of my vnſatiable
Curat, that is neyther content with the gayns
which he hath, ſuffring this body without life,
to remayne without Sepulture, onely for the

me in this world for my comforte, for if I wyll
haue him interred, of neceſſitye I muſt ſell all

I beſeech God to puniſh with ſome great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
both thee and them which are of lyke
condicions, ſaying ſo, with cryes, teares, ſobs,
and ſighes, ſhe pardoneth not her own cheekes

               <p>The woman who knewe by his Lyuerye,
that hee was one of the Dukes Seruauntes,

agreeable vnto her, in thynking that hee
came there but onelye to ſeeke ſome praye, yet
not fearing anye worſe aduenture then her

then the eſtate wherein ſhee was, and alſo
for that death to her woulde haue bene great

               <p>Alas Syr, beholde there the deade bodye
of my Huſbande, which the Prieſte of thys

This is the occaſyon why I torment my ſelfe,
not knowing how I maye interre the deade
Corpes, the onely memorye whereof, hath
made mee ſo full of ſorrowe and dule, and
to ſhowe before your eyes this outrage. The
Duke which this ſpace attended to know the

occaſyon of this crye, vnto whome his man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
retourned, ſayth: My Lorde, in this houſe

wyth ſmall Chyldren, (whoſe Huſbande thys

to burye the bodye of the deade, but hee vnleſſe
ſhee will paye the interrage, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed

her to goe aboute it, wherefore ſhee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this noyſe, not hauing wherewith to doe

               <p>Iohn Maria hearing him tell of a Facte
ſo Vylonyous, and of a couetouſneſſe ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable,
began to laugh, whoſe laughter was
a prognoſtication of the teares of ſome man.
Then tourning to them of hys Trayne, hee
ſayth.</p>
               <p>Truely this mayſter Curate is very vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable,
and greatly giuen to his owne profyte,
ſo to denye his helpe to them that requyre him,
ſyth that it is his duety, and hee is hyred to
doe it. Therefore it is good that I ſhewe him
the waye, and excercyſe our Charitye in this,
cauſing this body to be intombed, and then to
extende our almes to this woman, that
lamenteth as well for her owne loſſe, as
<pb facs="tcp:24834:9"/>
for that ſhee beholdeth her ſelfe charged wyth
Infantes, and not knowing howe to keepe
them, ſhoulde not this be well done? ſayeth he
to his Gentlemen: Truely my Lorde aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
one of the trayne, this acte would bee as
greatly prayſed, as any good deede that you
can doe in this worlde, and eſpecially for that
your excellencye in forgetting your Nobillity,
ſhall ſo much abaſe your ſelfe, as to accompany
the moſt pore to the earth, and to ſuccour their
widdowes, although they neuer did you anye
ſeruyce: Let vs go then (ſayth the Duke,) the
Prieſt as it may be, will doe his duetye to this
partye, at my deſyre, wherefore I will giue
him ſuch a Salary for his paynes, as all hys
lyfe after, he ſhall not haue cauſe to complaine:
He ſayth this, thinking ſo well to chaſten the
Prieſt, that from thence forth he ſhoulde make
no more ſuch refuſals, commanding then, that
he which had bene firſt at the houſe of the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe,
ſhould go for the Curate to come talke
with the Duke, for a matter of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce.
The mayſter Chaplen which thought
of nothing leſſe, then the fault which he had
done, and remembred not at all of the dead, the
corpes of whome, remayned without Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
came ſodaynly to the Dukes preſence,
whome after the Duke had wel beholden, and
ſeeing him fat, groſſe in euery poynt, and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in rich Apparell, was not abaſhed at all
<pb facs="tcp:24834:9"/>
of the refuſal that he had made to the pore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
as well for his well lyking, whereby hee
ſhewed that one hower of pleaſure, was an
hundered tymes more agreable vnto him, then
a thouſand yeres of ſeruitude, and that alſo to
nouriſh ſuch a belly, it was needefull to haue
more gaynes, then roſe of his cure, hauing his
Vyſage more lyke the picture of ſome ſwollen
Bacchus, then of one profeſſing the ſtudye of
diuinitie, fynally this Prieſt did not vary at all
from the moſte parte of them, that at this daye
to the great domage of all Chriſtendome, haue
entered into the Miniſtery, who thinke that
they haue done their duety, in making a feaſt
or dinner to their equalles, without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the reſt of their office, neyther to viſyte
the poore, nor to ſuccour them, according to the
ſtatutes, and ordinaunces of the holy Canons,
ordayned by the generall and ſacred counſels,
but are become feeders of their owne bellyes,
and dumme dogges, ſo that the onely name of
Prieſthood ought to ſhadowe them, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce
as they imagyne, wythout neceſſitie to
put their hand to the worke, and to ſatiſfye by
effect, that for which they be called. Our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
then bolde and aſſured, preſenteth hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to Iohn Maria, ſaying: My Lord, it hath
pleaſed your excellency to commaunde mee to
come before you, may it alſo pleaſe you to ſhew
me the thing wherein you wyll imploy me, in
<pb facs="tcp:24834:10"/>
which I will obey you, as he that deſireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

for the ſmall pittie I ſhewed vnto her. What
arte thou no more bolde (ſayeth Iohn Maria,
being ſo vnpittifull) that thou arte afearde of
the ſhadowes of them that floate on the Ryuer
of Death, and forgetfulneſſe, take thou no care

Therefore calleth hee to the others, that they
ſhoulde diſpatch, that the good Synger ſhould
not trouble him any more with his prayers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all at once they began to laye downe the two
bodyes, to couer them with earth, when as the
Prieſt cryed. Alas my Lorde, if you haue no
pitty of the bodye, yet haue compaſſyon of the
ſaluation of the ſoule, as much as is in your
power, and ſuffer me not to dye, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
my faultes, before ſome Miniſter of
God, according to the inſtitution of the church.
Go, go, ſayth the Duke, thou hadſt more neede
to appeaſe the Porter of Hell with thy Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſynce thou canſt not get a Prieſt at thys

abſolucyon that thou haſte, geue him whom
thou imbraceſt, that may ſerue for the ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of the heape of all thy offences. Wyth
ſuch rayling, the inhumayn Prince cauſed the
two bodyes to be caſt into the pit, with no leſſe
abaſhment of al men, then as a thing that they
had neuer ſeene done before, which thoughte
not that the Duke ſo vnaduyſedly, and of ſuch
a beaſtly maner would haue put men to deth,
but his lyfe was no leſſe deteſtable, then the
lyfe of the Emperour Macryne, who vſed
lyke manners, and puniſhed more cruelly then
<pb facs="tcp:24834:14"/>
he did, ſyth the Prieſte was preſt and choked,
as well by the ſmell of the dead bodye, as by
the earth that was caſt vppon him, the graue
being verye deepe, whereas the Emperour
wythout pyttye, cauſed ſuch as hee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
to bee bounde lykewyſe to the deade
carcaſes that putrifyed the Ayre, not ſuffering
them to be buryed, but let them ſo remayne
till that eyther by fayntneſſe, or ſtinche of the
dead body, and the multitude of Vermyn, they
cruelly departed out of this lyfe. Nor more
curteous was Maximiniam, who cauſed ſuch

an Oxe, vnto the head, where they ended their
miſery by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> blood that ran out of the beaſt, but
the barbarous tyme, doth excuſe theſe Galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
that being Panims, and without knowledge

Cittizens, and I thinke that in our tyme there
be ſome that haue made ſacryfyce of heads, &amp;
other members, &amp; who lyke Diomedes haue
cauſed their Horſes to eate the bodyes of men.
But I beleeue that God will not leaue ſuche

amorous at the very end of his age,
for the extreame Ieloſy of his Concubyne, was cauſe

armies were diſcouered through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Italy, for the Conqueſt of
Myllayne, cauſing all the ſtate
of the Venetians to tremble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Lewis the
ſeuenth had brought his affayres in ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes,
that he pitched his Campe euen in the
ſight of their next Citie, breaking down their
walles, and ouerthrowing with the force of
his Canons their Towers of defence, that
Venis neuer felte any greater, or more migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer

               <p>The Venetians not knowing howe, or by
what meanes to quyet their bondes, and to
appeaſe the diſpleaſure of a King, iuſtly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
agaynſte their infydelitie and arrogancie,
about that tyme (I ſaye) there was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Milinois, which for the troubles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming,
doth conuay himſelfe to a Caſtle, that hee had
before <hi>Monſe,</hi> as lykewyſe did the moſte parte

<pb facs="tcp:24834:16"/>
of their Lord, or who (as it might bee) were
not able to indure the inſolencye, and crueltye
of the French Souldyers.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman of whome I intreate,
was a Wyddower, to whome there was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning
onely two chyldren, the one of the
Age of ſeuen or eyghte yeares, the other
approaching neare to the age of twentye, the
olde man ſeeing hymſelfe wythoute a wyfe,
although hee hadde almoſte paſſed the age
of threeſcore yeares, neyther hauing regarde
to hys Age, nor to hys approaching death,
doeth become amorous of a gyrle, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a Meſſenger, both fayre and well fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured,
of whome hee had his pleaſure, by
the meanes of the onely Father of the Gyrle,
which ſolde her vnto him.</p>
               <p>This is a marke very certayne, to bewayle
any man, which we ſee in his age to become a

him, that through the pryce of hys lyfe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
vs out of the handes of hym, whyche
helde vs in bondage, wherefore the Gentiles
and Infydels of tyme paſte, doe exceede
and vanquiſh vs in Iuſtice and polliticke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges,
more right then oures, that they haue
thereby attayned the glory of puniſhing faults
whyche we behold, endure, and approue, and
as executers therof, do glory and prayſe them.
Vnhappy ſurely is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, where vyce beres
the name of Iuſtyce, and Iniquitye is prayſed
as a vertue, infortunate is the place where
ſuch fauoure is ſhewed to the wicked, that
their infamye is ſuſtayned, and approoued
by the moſte mightye. But the wycked
doe not remember at all, that GOD is in
Heauen, regarding and beholding the deedes
of men, for to doe Iuſtice one daye, by the
ſtrength of his hande, and the inuytable
force of his ſcourges, by whyche (wythout
exceptynge of perſons) hee indyfferentlye
doeth puniſhe both the faulte of the offender,
and of him that fayleth to execute the auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye,
and the ſworde that God hath put into
his handes. But nowe to retourne to our
former matter, thys verye lybydynous
and wanton olde man, keeping this Gyrle
at bed and boorde in his Caſtle, lying ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
<pb facs="tcp:24834:17"/>
with her, and chafeth the cold &amp; vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
fleſhe of the vyle Mountayn Satyre, that
ſeketh to contynue that whiche nature doeth
deny him, and aſſayeth to ouercome his own
force. The eldeſt ſonne ſeeing the diſhoneſty of
his father, was ſad beyonde all meaſure, vſing
neuertheleſſe ſuch a modeſtye and vertuous
diſſimulation, becauſe he would not make ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
his father, that hee ſhewed a better
countenaunce to the Palyarde, then he coulde
well, whome he hated to the death, as well for
that ſhe was ſuch a one, as for that he knewe
ſhe would be the ruine and ſhortning of the life
of the vnhappy olde man, and alſo for that hee
ſaw her ſo fonde and vnſhamefaſt, that one
mighte eaſilye iudge by her, ſhe would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the intertayning of another Captayne,
which might furniſh her ſomewhat better, for
the old man doth ſerue onely for the increaſing
and prouocation of her ſenſualitie, without
power at anye tyme to contente the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
wantonneſſe, that burned within her
mynde, and therfore ſhe thinketh to practyſe a
combate more luſtye and of better hope, which
ſhe did, becauſe the olde man was not able to
ſuffice her: Ah inſaciable deſyres, and depth
not to be fylled, that is the wantonneſſe of an
harlot, what deteſtable euils haue chaunced
by theſe loues, to them that without all ſhame,
haue put all their glory and pleaſure in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes
<pb facs="tcp:24834:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and flatteryes of the worlde, onely
Sampſon, Salomon, and Hercules may giue
ſure teſtimony. Now this gyrle as we ſayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
feeling the dimiſſing of the forces of her
louer, doth deliberate to purſue another pray,
therefore ſhe impudently caſteth her lookes on
the ſonne of the Gentleman, and in beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming
Amorous, ſhee purpoſeth, if it be poſſyble, to
make him the Liefetenaunt, and ayde of hys
Father, and this ſhe doth not for anye curteſy
that was hid vnder the Haggard and ruſtick
nature, and bringing vp of the rude countrey,
but for that ſhe ſaw the yong man fayre, well
proporcyoned of his members, and for that ſhe
iudgeth him apte to performe the Chaſe, in
which his father was able to giue but ſymple
attemptes, ſodaynly ſhee ſeaſeth from her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpryſe,
as do the yong Louers, not experte or
able ynough to detayne their pray, by and by
agayne, ſhe goeth about to ſhew him al friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and familiaritie that ſhe coulde, and often
tymes ſhe ſeeketh hym, fynding him at his
boke, where ſhe ſheweth euidently the deſyres
that cauſe her to purſue him. But the good
chyld, neuer thought of ſuch a wickedneſſe, as
well to be chaſte of his nature, as for the feare
of God, and offending of his father, and for
that as yet, hee had neuer bene kyndled wyth
loue, nor taken in the trap of worldlye follyes:
But the Concubyne perceyuing that ſhee tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
<pb facs="tcp:24834:18"/>
in vayn, thinking to make him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
her deſyres by ſygnes, doeth deliberate,
(as ſoone as occaſyon ſhoulde be offered) to
manyfeſt it vnto him by worde, which ſhe dyd
one day, his Father being gone to ſee one of
his neighboures, and before ſhe would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulte
the yong man, ſhee doeth inſtructe
in that myſchiefe a Chambermayd her Coſen,
to the end that when her perſwaſyons ſhould
fayle, the other myghte ſupplye her wante,
as ſoone as theſe eloquente Ieayes hadde
prepared themſelues, they wente to ſeeke
the Gentleman, whome they founde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatyng
himſelfe in the myddeſt of a great
Chamber, the fayre Forreſt Nymphe, aſſyſted
wyth the keeper of her bed, began to ſaye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

your hart is not to be attached with any amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

that if any fayre dame of what ſtate ſoeuer ſhe

I haue committed this faulte, for a faulte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyres

you would amend the wrong which you haue

And would you haue her diſpayre of that

not willing to ſee any thing in ſo playne a

               <p>Thys is, then ſayeth the Chambermayd that

               <p>The olde man hearing ſuch pittifull newes,
remayned ſo troubled and aſtonyed, that for a

that he whom I haue more dearely loued then
myne owne lyfe, hath ſo much miſtaken hys
gentleneſſe, that he would diſhonour the loue
of his father. Ah infortunate chylde, and I a
father greatly to be lamented, ſyth I am tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by myne owne bloud, of whome I
thought to haue had ſome greater ioy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then he
helde his tongue and ſate downe, caſting his

a man might iudge the greefe of his mynde to

be more exceſſyue then his ſtrength was able
to ſuffer, yet ſayth he to the Rybawde, I pray
thee my friend, tell me the veritie of this fact,
to the ende I ſhall not doe any thing that may
hereafter cauſe me to late to repente. Ah poore
and caytyfe woman that I am, ſayeth the
ſhameleſſe Pallyard, I ſee well that if this
trompery of your ſonne, had not bene diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by me, but that by ſome other it had come
to your knowledge, you would haue done ſuch
Iuſtice, that men ſhoulde haue taken example
by me in tyme to come, and nowe ſyth I haue
ſhewed my ſelfe ſo faythfull towardes you,
you doubt of my fayth, and eſteeme my words
for boordes and mockeryes, inquyre you ſyr of
this Gyrle which hath ſeene all the myſterye,
and then doe with me as you ſhal think good,
for I know not well how to liue anye longer
here, where men giue ſuch ſyniſter intertayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

playde her part better then her Miſtreſſe, and
and incenſeth the Father ſo ſharpely agaynſte
the ſonne, that he purpoſeth to puniſhe him ſo
greeuouſly, as the lyke hath neuer bene hearde
of, rauiſhed then in this extaſye of anger, hee
ſpeaketh a thouſand follies, and was changed
into ſuche a choler, by the impoyſoning of the

fretting with anger, as one preſſed and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

through famyne or deſyre of companye,
ſeeing the yong man, entered into ſuch a fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye,
that wythout ſpeaking what hee woulde

is it I that muſt ſeeke the meanes to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
thy rybaudry? By God this ſhall be the

the furyous menace of his Father, not

proceeded, ſayth vnto him: And wherefore ſyr
are you ſo out of your modeſty? or what is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

not contente to ſee his ſonne humble

that the chyld had fallen by his own will

I ſweare before God, that thou ſhalte dye in

ſuch dolour, that he began to forget his Ieloſy
and to feele ſuche a remorſe in his intrayles,
that cauſed him to deteſt his fortune, for that

Alas, ſayeth he, vnhappye Father, dareſt thou
ſhew thy ſelfe among any good men, that haſt
put to death ſuch and ſo honeſt a chylde, for the
appetyte of ſo impudent a Pallyarde: Ah my
ſonne pardon me this offence, for I aſſure thee
that I will make ſuch a ſolemne amends, that
thou ſhalte haue whereof to content thee, and
they whiche ſuruiue an occaſion to vituperate
my fury, and ſyth this my hart (ſayeth he, ſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

the pernicious venyme of falſe perſwaſyon,
whereof thou haſt felte the bitterneſſe, it ſhall
abyde the penitence, and thou my body, ſhalte

fieldes of death, and to whome I will ſacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce
my wicked, infamous, and vnhappy lyfe,

ſayd ſo, weeping ſorrowfully, he imbraceth the

ſayeth. But go to then, ſyth his ſoule is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and his deſteny hath taken him awaye,
murder him that hath executed murder, in the

Theſe wordes ended, mooued wyth a dyuiliſh
diſpayre, ſtamping lyke a Lyon, and pricked
forwarde I knowe not of what Furye, as a

hurte by ſome miſchaunce, tourning the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe

doth blynd our ſences, in following the flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

plagues and diuiliſhneſſe of whoredom, which
do bewytch and take away the ſences of men,
the end whereof is death, and puniſhment in
the infernall lake. The newes hereof were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perced

that the rybawd which had adreſt this deuiſe,
hauing heard and ſeene the whole, mooued
by her owne offence, &amp; the witneſſe which her

<pb facs="tcp:24834:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet to good for the puniſhment of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
mallice of a woman, ſo wicked as ſhee
was, which merited to haue all the paynes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gythers,
that euer were inuented by men, for

who hauing in examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chamber maid,
that was the ayder of the deſperate Palyard,
made her to confeſſe all the facte, wherefore
ſhe was ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, and her body giuen to be meat

to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carcaſes of the two louers, which agaynſt
all right both deuyne and humayne, had vyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
come to their ende, and as for the yong
man, he was buryed wyth ſuch pompe, as hys
vertue did well deſerue, &amp; was bewayled of al
eſtates, for the modeſty that did apeare in him,
by which he hath ſemed to immitate the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
and Fabions, who once liuing with ſuch
temperance, haue cauſed their glorious names
to remayne euen to this daye. So always the
death of the well lyuer is fortunate, for beſides
that he paſſeth to the lyfe, whych hath no end,
and goeth to inioy the holy and Godly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
of the bleſſed ſoules, hee doeth glorify his

Colombe, wyth the Nauye of the

of Iohn Aragon, did dicouer the
Weſt Ilandes, not before diſcouered, that can
bee founde remembered by the wryting of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Bartheny Bolognois, as he himſelf recoump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

by this countrey, for that he would haue
knowledge of the naturall things, the maner

to get ſome profyte in paſſing by Ethiope, he
areſted in an Ile, the Capytall town whereof

<pb facs="tcp:24834:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was a Lord of the ſecte of Mahomet, a man
very vertuous and gentle for a More and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fydell,
almoſt an hundered yeares olde, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſydes
that he was rych in Golde and pearles,
ſyth in that quarter there were found the moſt

&amp; the moſt deſſembling Palyard that
was in all the countrey, who ſtudyed wyth
himſelfe dyuers tymes how to become imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ouer his bretheren, after the deceaſe of his

that were of that Land, of that rich &amp; famous
Monarch of the Indyans, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cal Preſter
Iean, theſe two Indian ſlaues were ſo well

he had made them as rich, as any of his Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
and they had ſo well got the good will of

thus they going about to do good to all men, &amp;

which one would not thinke nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
towarde his father, notwithſtanding
the good intreatmente that the olde man ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed

worthy ſurely to be noted, as well as it is
ſtrange &amp; poſſible, if the memory thereof were

the pacience of God is ſuch, that he attendeth
the conuerſyon of the ſynner, but ſeeing hym
indurate in his wickedneſſe, doth puniſhe hym
ſo ſharpely, that the generations enſuing, doe
beholde the ſharpeneſſe of the puniſhmente,
and marke wherefore that good Chriſt, ſecond
to none in pacience, doth ſo dilligently ſet forth
examples, to ſhewe that there ſhalbe no ſinne
lefte vnpuniſhed in the preſence of the Lorde,
for what greater ruine can come to the houſe

But when it came to the poynt, that the fayre

although they behelde the courteſyes that the

to the end that hee ſhould not thinke ſhe

was extended onely for the ſole vertue &amp; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

cannot forget her Nobillitie, and the heauens
angry for an acte ſo infamous, and an iniurye
ſo deteſtably committed, both agaynſte God,
and agaynſte the Father and huſband of both
the offenders, ſtyrred vp a more wyly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
diſcouerer of ſecrete faults, which is Time,
who did the offyce of a good Seruaunt, after
that by the very fooliſhneſſe of the two louers,
their folly was made euydent, they gouerning
themſelues ſo vndiſcretly togythers, and with

for he ſaw ordinarilye that as ſoone as
the Marques was gone anye nighte into the

that neuer heretofore hath ſhewed any effecte
of hys mallyce, towardes anye man that
lyues, if fyrſte hee haue not gyuen hym the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſyon,
for it is no leſſe prayſe worthye in a

equytye, and clemencye, then to puniſhe
the ſedicious, and diſquyetors of the peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that ſuch pacience ſhewed to one, ſhould
not bee the common ruyne of all the whole
people. Thys is it, wherevnto he oughte to

extende all hys force, no leſſe to chaſten the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merritye
of the foolyſhe, then to recompence
the fydelitie of them, whyche hath ſerued hym
faythfully, ſhewing all the offyce of obedience
towardes their Lordes. What if the law doe
inioyne this duety in the Vaſſall and ſubiecte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
towards the naturall and liege Lorde, nature
conioyned with the lawe, doe conſtrayne and
more ſtreightly bynde the infants, which owe
to their Parents honour, obedience, piety, &amp; al
good ſuccours, not only of that whiche is exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
but alſo of the interyour it ſelfe, which is
the good will and perfect amitye, by which the
harte of the Sonne ought to be vnyted wyth
the pleaſure and wil of the Father. But O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
God, what Father would be ſo pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and merciful, that ſeing the Knyfe of hys
ſonne vpon his owne throate, and coulde ſtaye
him, would ſuffer him to depryue hym of lyfe?
But what? lyfe oughte to be equall to honour,
for the atchieuing and attayning whereof, all
the noble and gentle myndes haue once deſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and yet do deſpyſe their lyues? Alas my
friends, the complaynt which I make before
you, is againſt my ſonne &amp; wyfe, the forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of whome, is extended euen vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facyng
of myne honoure, wherin both I, and
my predeceſſors haue paſſed our age, I wyll
bring you no other wytneſſe then myne owne

<pb facs="tcp:24834:58"/>
and wicked facts that a man can think,
it is that which I cannot ſpeake, withoute an
vnmeaſurable greefe, and without hanging
my countenaunce, for the ſhame hee hath done
me. That is, the County Hugnes hath defyled
the nuptiall bed of the Marques of Ferrarya,
his Father, and the ſoueraign Lord of you all,
it is he that hath polluted the houſe, that is
counted in the raygne of the moſte noble in all

whereof, were lawfully permitted to none, but
me alone. To whome ſhall I complayne? and
who ſhall reuenge me of thys iniurye? Alas,
my harte breaketh, my ſences fayle me, and my
forces are weakned, only there remaines a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre
to do Iuſtice, not that it might be condign
to the abhomination of the faulte, but that I
might thereby take awaye this blot from my
ſtocke, and moderate a little the greefe that
prickes me, and whiche yet ſerueth for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of them that haue offended the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty
deuyne ſo greououſlye, that their doyngs
haue giuen cauſe to them that come after, to

ſaying ſo, his ſpeech fayled him, and ouercome
wyth ſorrow, and the unpacience of his cholor,

of the wickedneſſe of the two offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, which
<pb facs="tcp:24834:58"/>
they beleeued, as wel for the reuerences of him
that did wytneſſe to haue ſeene it, as for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunces
of the impudent lookes, and laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuious
toyes of the Marchiones, towardes
the Countye, that made them thinke it was
ſhe that made the pit, wherein both ſhe and the
Countye were intrapped, as ſone as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
was come to himſelf, there was no man
ſo bolde that durſt ſay any word vnto him, but
depending wholye of the wyll of their Lorde,
were of that aduyſe, that the proceſſe ſhould be
quickly diſpatched, and that Iuſtyce ſhould be
done to the two Patientes, as well for their
comfortes, as to gyue ſome contentmente to a
Father rightly duſpleaſed agaynſte his ſonne,
and as a huſband deadlye hating the Palyar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſe
of his wyfe, towardes whome he ſente
one of his Counſellers, wyth two good Father
Fryers, men well lyked of the people, both for
their lyfe and learning, the one to carrye the
heauy and ſorrowfull newes of his death, and
the others to mooue hym to repentance of his
ſynnes, and to pray to God to haue mercye on
hys ſoule. As ſoone as they were come before
the yong Prynce, who ſeeing the Counceller,
and hearing the ſentence of his death, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſay, weeping very tenderly. Ah vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye
fleſh, and fylthye deſyres, it is for thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
that I muſt dye this daye. O vnhappye
wretche that I am, not for that I dye, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:24834:59"/>
I am the procurer of his choler, &amp; cauſe
of his dule, &amp; for that I haue ſet ſuch trouble in
his houſe, as ſhall not ſo well, &amp; ſo ſone be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
as I would wyſh. Alas my Lord &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
pardon this deteſtable offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of him that
hath vſed himſelf otherwiſe toward you, then
the chyld ought towards y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> father, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe I
am the moſt myſerable, that euer was born of
a mother, &amp; the moſt deteſtable y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Sunne
ſhyneth on this daye. Alas good Lorde, ſuffer
not my ſoule to be puniſhed, ſeruing for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of that vyle ſerpent &amp; deuouring Lyon,
that doth nothing but go about to deceiue and
invyron vs, &amp; cauſe vs to fall into his lake. O
Lord haue mercy, haue mercy on me, &amp; ſuffer
not the bloud of thy ſonne to be ſhed in vayne
for me. Alas I muſt dye, not for the confeſſing
of the fayth, and glorifying of thy name before
men, but for my owne wickedneſſe, &amp; the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of my demerites, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which next after the
great wickedneſſe committed againſt thy dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne
maieſty, doth greeue me moſt, is the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
of him that doth, and will redounde to
my miſchiefe &amp; diſhonour. But O my God, I
beſeech thee to comfort him, &amp; giue me ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth

The Counſeller ſeeing the repentaunce of the
Prince, moued with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſyon, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to wepe,
&amp; departed out of the pryſon, went to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thereof to the Marques, who aunſwered

him, it is not now time to become a good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyan,

of God, by the myniſter of his humain iuſtyce,
and I beſeech God that hee will pardon hys
ſynnes, &amp; receyue him amongſt the number of
his elect: ſaying ſo, left of, not able to beare the
ſorrow which did greeue him, for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of the approching death of his ſonne,
wherfore it was ordayned that they ſhould be
quickly diſpatched, one in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of the other,
and this was done, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Marques would
here no admonition, for he heard the ſentence
was extended as well vppon the Countye, as
vpon her, that had made no ſute for her lyfe,
becauſe ſhe ſaw they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> county,
then in the end ſeing ſhe had done the faulte,
ſhe appoynteth with her ſelf to receyue death,
in as good part as ſhe could, which was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to euery of them in their tower, within a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of an houre, not without an infynite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of teares ſhead and beſprent, as well by
the Marques, which could not diſſemble hys
affection, as by al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his houſe, that vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
loued the fayre couple of infortunate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vertue of whom, this vlot except, could

as ſayeth the Apoſtle, doth eaſyly rayſe, ſeaſon
and ſower a great peece of dow: likewyſe, a

Theſe two Patients being executed, whylſt
men were preparing of rych and accuſtomable
Funerals, they were broughte into the baſe
Court of the Pallas, to the ende all the world
ſhould ſee and beholde the cauſe of their death,
that yet renewed the teares and complaynts
of men, as well for the one as for the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling
the one for hys worthyneſſe, the other
for her curteſye, and them both for their great
bewtye, and youth, wherein they were, for as
yet, the more aged of them, had not attayned
the age of two and twenty yeares.</p>
               <p>After this the Marques cauſed to bee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a rych and ſumptuous furnyture for their
funerals, and with ſuch pompe as their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
did requyre, their bodyes were broughte
to be buryed in the couent of Saynt Frances,
and there was erected a Tomb to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
bed of the bodyes of them, whoſe hartes
had bene ſurely conioyned togythers, when
they were alyue, ſo theſe two myſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
had a ſmall eaſe, for the induring of ſo
great a puniſhment, and for all the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and ſatiſfaction of their deſyres, they
had this only good, that by one kynd of death,
they both ſhould ende, and haue their bones
enioy one Sepulcure togither. Here it is good
to be aduyſed, how and wyth what counſels
men ought to forſee thinges, and their accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſes,

of ſynne, which once ingrafted in the harts of
men, ſpreadeth his rootes ſo broade, that by
