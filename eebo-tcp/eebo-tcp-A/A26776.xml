            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Word to the Reader of this Booke.</head>
            <p>IT is common among the ſonns of men, every one to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his own cauſe, whether he be in the right or wrong; For <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, Every man ſeems to be juſt in his own cauſe: And the truth is, every one will ſpeake the beſt he can in his own behalfe. But Chriſtian friend, whatever thou art that Readeth theſe enſuing Lines, I would have thee to underſtand, that I have not written theſe Lines in my own defence, or to vindicate my ſelfe of any aſperſions that any can caſt upon me in any kinde whatſoever; for though I am a man who have undergone, and at this day doe undergoe the heavy burthen of falſe aſperſions, caſt upon me by the fools of the times, who neither know me nor themſelves, yet to me they are no more then the barking of curs, the which may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright children, for my backe is broade enough to beare all the weight of theſe burthens, and am poſſeſſed with a Spirit, that maketh me eaſily paſſe by all the cenſures of men; and had the cauſe been my own, which is included in theſe Lines, I thinke they had never come to the beholding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but my Spirit is ſuch, that it leadeth me out rather to juſtifie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers then my ſelfe; for I would have thee to know, that my Sect or Profeſsion, Tenets or Religion, call it what thou wilt, is neither of that ſort of People called Quakers, neither am I Papiſt, Prelacyan, Presbyterian, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant, Anabaptiſt, Fameliſt, Browniſt, Arryan, Atheiſt, Free-willer, Free gracian, Raunter, Saduccy, or Liher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
<pb facs="tcp:97220:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp;c. then make of me what thou pleaſeth; yet ſuch a one I am as knoweth my right hand from my left, and that is enough for any man to know; and by that light in me, I am made in ſome meaſure to ſee what is of God, and what is of man, and what is of the ſpirit of darkeneſſe: I profeſſe unto thee, I am not the Enemy of any man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth any mans Forme, or Religion trouble me, but wiſh all men well in their way: yet I muſt tell thee, that I am not unacquainted with the wyles of Satan, in Formes, and out of Formes, and likewiſe of Gods working, both in Formes, and out of Formes; and what I have found by experience, I wiſh that all men had found the ſame, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And I muſt tell thee, <hi>I</hi> am led out to owne the truth of God, where ever <hi>I</hi> ſee it, in a Forme, or out of a Forme; but the pureſt truths is not manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in Formes, though Formes may have their time, and in their time is tollerable, if not Idolized. And to give thee a true Reaſon why <hi>I</hi> was led out to draw theſe Lines, it is to vindicate the truth in its appearing in ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in theſe dayes, the which is diſpoſed to the ſcandall and reproach of moſt people in theſe times, ſome by wrong impriſonment, ſome by beating, ſome by threatning, ſome by falſe accuſations and ſcandalls, ſome by Petitions, and ſome by writing lying Pamphlets, all of theſe ariſing from the very malice and inſtigation of the Devill, who would have theſe poore people deſtroyed; for he well knoweth, that if theſe goe on, his kingdome will fall. Amongſt thoſe whom the devill moveth to act and ſpeake againſt theſe people, one <hi>T. L.</hi> or <hi>Tho: Ledger,</hi> hath written a lying Pamphlet, the which <hi>I</hi> have here anſwered in ſome of his falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therein; and if time would but have permitted, <hi>I</hi> would have anſwered them more fully: but what is here
<pb facs="tcp:97220:3"/>
ſpoken, <hi>I</hi> hope may ſerve to give thee ſatisfaction of the truth in theſe people; and if thou have but any light of God in thee, thou wilt ſee, and mayeſt eaſily judge, that theſe people are no other, then ſuch as God hath marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly called to himſelfe, to make the riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe knowne in their ſoules; and what ever, either For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliſts, or other ſay againſt theſe people take thou heed thou be not as one of them, for better were it for thee to have a Mill-ſtone hung about thy necke, and throwne into the midſt of the Sea, then that thou ſhouldeſt offend one of theſe that beleeve in God, in whom Chriſt liveth, and they in him. And for thy better information in the truth, <hi>I</hi> haue drawne theſe Lines, the which <hi>I</hi> freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to thy Chriſtian conſideration; and the Lord give thee a good underſtanding, that thou mayeſt learne to have a good opinion of any People in whom the truth of God doth appeare.

            <p>THere is two great monſterous evils in the world, and they are common among the ſonns of men; and from theſe two evills, ariſeth all other ſinnes and wickedneſſe whatſoever, acted, ſpoken, or thought, either againſt God himſelfe, or againſt any appearance of God in his creature Man; and by the venome which ariſeth from theſe two evills, one man is ſet againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in bitter envyings, evill wiſhings, evill ſpeeches, evill actings, &amp;c. Now theſe two great evills, is the very ground and originall Rice of all other evill, as is before-ſaid; the one of theſe hath its proper being in one of the chiefe faculties of the ſoule, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and by the operations from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the ſonnes of men becommeth much deprived of the pure underſtanding of the truth as it is in Jeſus. And the other great evill hath its proper being in another chiefe faculty of the ſoule, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Will;</hi> from the operations of which evill, ariſeth all diſobedience and rebellion againſt the Truth, as it is in Jeſus; yet the difference between the ſinns ariſing from theſe grounds is great, though nothing that ariſeth from either be good; the evill effect proceeding from the ground, or cauſe, in the Reaſonable part, will be found inferiour to theſe which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of the <hi>Will;</hi> Yet wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Without Knowledge, the Soule is not good,</hi> Prov. 19. 2. And God complaineth by the Prophet, That <hi>his People periſhed for want of knowledge,</hi> Hoſ. 4. 6. And <hi>Solomon,</hi> who knew how wicked the ſonns of men were without knowledge (and how darke and blinde they were in the underſtanding the dictates of God, without Knowledge) how oft doth he counſell men to ſeek <hi>W. ſedome, and prize her above Gold?</hi> But who is that wiſe man that can truely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh

But the ſecond Perſecution, or Killing, is yet untaken away, but is in as full force and vigour, as ever; and that is the Perſecution of the Tongue, and Hand, both being ſet on worke by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant

zeale of the helliſh fire, that is in the heart, from which burning flame, the Tongue is made to utter ſcandelizings, and calumnious ſpeeches, againſt ſuch perſons as God doth marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly make his truth to appeare <hi>in their ſoules,</hi> becauſe ſuch ſoules is not made partakers of the truth under their good thinking rules, and faire ſeeming Formes: and from the zeale of that fire, their hands is ſet on worke to write ridiculous Pamphlets, in villifying the names, and actions, and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and manifeſtations of ſuch perſons as have had a clearer ſight of the truth, (and fuller poſſeſſion of the ſame, yea and live more in the power thereof) then any perſon who is ſo glewed and hinde-bound to any Forme, though never ſo ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy in the ſame.</p>
            <p>And I wiſh that the Author of that Pamphlet, called, the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning the Quakers,</hi> be not one of theſe good think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proſelytes, who thinketh they have God hard tyed to them in the chaines of a faire-ſeeming Forme, and through that great light he may imagine himſelfe to have, may become cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived under a judgement, whoſe gates may prove as narrow as the eye of a Needle; and then it is no marvaile to me, to ſee, or heare ſuch perſons throw durt in the face of God, or in the face of any in whom God doth more abundantly manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to, then he hath done to them.</p>
            <p>Yet however, I will underſtand the Author of that Diſcourſe in the better ſence, and will not ſay that he hath put out that Pamphlet by the power of the ground of the evill that is in his will, but rather ſay (and make it good to) that he hath put it out from or by the power of the evill in his reaſon; and theſe ſins may happily be pardoned, before theſe which ariſeth out of the evill ground in the will; for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to mercy, in as much as what he had done, he did it in ignorance. But now I proceed to what is intended.</p>
            <p>The Authour beginneth his diſcourſe with interpreting the words of ſuch Scriptures, as ſhew what great deceivers ſhall be in the laſt dayes, and doth make his applications according as his good thinking inſpireth him (in the underſtanding of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And from hence it is, that the mother of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots becommeth well decked, and bravely mounted upon her ſearlet-coloured beaſt, and drunke with the blood of the ſaints; let all Formaliſts in England (of what Forme ſoever, Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or Kirk-fellowſhip, though their Forme may be the beſt in all the world, and come to the very point of example and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Scripture in its outward requirings) take heed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though they may bleſſe themſelves in a fools Paradiſe, and think becauſe they have got at a great diſtance from the Pope, and his fictions, therefore they be ſure that they have nothing to doe with the Mother of Harlots, nor ſhe with them; yet they are but cheated, for ſhe cannot delight her ſelfe, nor be more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, then where Formes is in faſhion: For where there is not a Forme, this Harlot may be entertained, but yet not with ſuch ſuptuouſneſſe as in a faire ſeeming Forme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for where there is no Forme, ſhe is forced to goe on Foot: but in a Forme ſhe becommeth well-mounted.

God and his Truth that poſſible can be, and the greateſt deceivers in the world; and an hypocrite is not to be found any where, but in a faire ſeeming Forme.</p>
            <p>And where the Authour (of the Diſcourſe concerning the Quakers) is ſpeaking of Atheiſts and Apoſtates; it will be found that the greateſt Atheiſts in the world, is where there is a God moſt confeſſed with the Tongue, and yet the heart walks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Tongue: It is not the confeſſing (and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging) of a God with the Mouth, that frees men from Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme; no, no, the greateſt Atheiſme is in the Heart, and there it is; and it mattereth not what any talke of God, or of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (or of fantaſticke in coms of Chriſt into the ſoule) ſo long as men have not found out an Atheiſme in his owne Heart, and out of that be brought to have the true Knowledge of a God: that God which men come to know no other way but by Scripture relation, will but prove a phanta ſticke god; for the fancy of Formaliſts ſhapeth him out in ſo many ſeverall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, that oſt-times they fall out amongſt themſelves, about the faſhion of their relative god; but when they can agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the faſhion of their god found out in Scripture, then doe they buſie themſelves to patch up a faire ſeeming Forme, and therein they worſhip their God, with hand and foot, tongue and eye, and all the reſt of the members, at ſometime. But yet I would know where the Heart is, and what is the god there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I much feare that its god, is a creature, not much unlike the gods of the Heathen (in the time of the Jews) who was made of gold ſilver, wood and ſtone; Let but the Saint likeſt Formaliſt in England minde the truth of this, and I beleeve he ſhall finde, that ſuch god are the gods of his heart; let him or them, but well conſider, and ponder, but one day to mind ſeriouſly the wayes and out-goings of their heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they will finde, that a creature of ſome kinde is the god thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whatſoever they ſhall finde the heart to be led out to, take it for granted that its god: For our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Where your treaſure is, there is your heart;</hi> and no man can any way know his owne heart, but by its thoughts, inelinations, deſires, and intents, &amp;c. which be the effects thereof: And if the creature have the thoughts, cares, feares, loves, and deſires, that is its god
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97220:6"/>
for ſure; and look what god the heart confeſſeth, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth, and liveth in, that god ſhall be the help of man, or elſe his deſtroyer. It is no hard matter for men to conforme to any kinde of Kirke-fellowſhip, and in the ſame to talke of God, and <hi>walke</hi> in the literall obedience of that Forme, (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> what Scripture requireth) and yet for all that, deny the God of Truth with their heart; let but the Author of that Diſcourſe look well about him, or rather to within himſelfe, and he need not goe farre to finde Atheiſme and Atheſts to purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But where he is ſpeaking oſ Apoſtates, I would have him to know, that none can juſtly be ſo called, except they have been firſt made partakers of the Truth, and love of God, and from that have turned away, to love the world; but man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an Apoſtate, in turning from one Forme to another; neither if a man turne himſelfe out of all Formes, for it is not the falling from Formes, that make an Apoſtate, but a falling from the Truth and love of God, that maketh man an Apoſtate; and a man cannot fall from, or turne from that he never was poſſeſſed of: and if any have been made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the love of God, and yet have turned therefrom, and ſo become an Apoſtate; yet ſuch a one muſt be ſaved, or elſe that Author muſt race out many Scriptures, or elſe learne to underſtand them otherwiſe, then they be underſtood amongſt Formaliſts. For they ſay, <hi>Whom God once loveth, he loveth him to the end;</hi> and if the Author doe not befoole his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the judgements of his Fellowes, he cannot gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay it, but that Apoſtates muſt goe to Heaven. But I beleeve the Author muſt goe to ſome other then himſelfe (and to others then thoſe amongſt whom he hath his Fellowſhip) to <hi>ſeeke</hi> out Apoſtates, for I aſſure him he is none himſelfe, and I beleeve they are very ſcarce where he liveth. I much doubt, that neither himſelfe, nor his Fellow-worſhippers as yet have been true partakers of Truth, and then it is impoſſible for him or them, to fall from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or turne from the thing they never had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo I will cleare both the Author and his Fellowes of the ſinne of Apoſtacy. But what better are they that beleeve
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97220:7"/>
a Lye in ſtead of Truth, then thoſe who have known the Truth, and yet turned from it.</p>
            <p>Seeing the Author hath taken paines to quote Scriptures, and time to apply theſe Scriptures, for the aſpercing of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more ſimple then himſelfe, (or any of his Fellowſhip) I would wiſh him to have a care, that he be not like thoſe, that as yet have the Beame in their eye, whereby they be blinded in beholding of themſelves, and ſo can quickly condemne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet juſtifie themſelves. But I ſay, Happy is he that is not condemned in the things he alloweth.</p>
            <p>Its true, the Scripture ſpeaketh of ſuch Deceivers as ſhould come, and in the time of the Apoſtles (began ſuch Deceivers to ariſe) but after their death, they much more increaſed, till at laſt, the truth it ſelfe was over-ſhaddowed; and in all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations ſince that time, untill theſe dayes, the truth, as may be ſaid, hath layd under Clods of Earth; but now, when it beginneth to ſhut up it ſelfe, (and begin to ſpring) how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull madd is the Foxes, (Beares and Lyons, Wolves and Owles, Dogs and Swine) at the very appearance of it; but it mattereth not for all their madneſſe, for a Stone cut out of the Mountaine, without Hands, ſhall daſh in pieces all the faire Images of Humane Worſhip; and a North Winde with a Tempeſt ſhall ariſe, and rent aſunder the Harlots Robes, for the Lord himſelfe will bring the ſame to paſſe; For he hath ſaid, that in the laſt dayes, <hi>He will powre out his Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. And in the laſt dayes, the <hi>Mountaine of the Lord ſhall be eſtabliſhed upon the top of the Mountaines,</hi> &amp;c. When this commeth to paſſe, as ſure it will, then let all blind Prieſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and good-thinking Formaliſts look to themſelves, for the day of their viſitation is at hand.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, I come to the Authors words in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, where he ſingleth out two ſorts of People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be the objects of his applyed Scriptures, and eſpecially the one of theſe be the very ſubject of his Diſcourſe; and theſe he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: <hi>Quakers,</hi> which, ſaies he, is <hi>either counterfeit, or comes from the power of the Devill,</hi> &amp;c.

It were too tedious to rehearſe all preſidents in Scripture which is of like nature, which beareth witneſſe of the truth of <hi>quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> but this Author layeth not to heart what People the Scripture ſaith ſhould ariſe in the laſt time, <hi>ſuch as ſhould be falſe accuſers and mockers at the workings of God.</hi> But I would have this Author, and all other of his Fellow Formaliſts, to conſider the Word of the Lord ſpoken by <hi>Eſay,</hi> in the 66.

            <p>Further, this Author ſaith, That theſe People are poſſeſſed with <hi>an auſsere Devill,</hi> becauſe they take no more of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures then will ſerve neceſſity.

And when God is pleaſed to raiſe up a People of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, to forſake the folly of theſe things, and to cry out againſt the evill in theſe things, O how doth the Harlot in the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, begin to ſtir her ſelfe, and by all meanes poſſible, ſeeke to ſcandalize, or root out ſuch people, as would have her skirts turned over her Face, that her nakedneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and naughtineſſe might appeare.

               <hi>The Author in his proceeding, takes it for a ſtrange delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that theſe People</hi> live above Ordinances, and that they ſhould have a light in them equall to Scripture, and that that light ſhould be the holy Ghoſt, and that they need not Scripture to be taught by, becauſe the ſame is fulfilled in them, and what they ſpeake or write, is equall to Scripture: <hi>And then bringeth in a ſaying of Chriſts, to admoniſh People</hi> to take heed of ſuch light; <hi>the which he applyeth as truely, as</hi> quaking and trembling comes by the Devill: <hi>the which is cleerely confuted before:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>People ſhould be led to live above Ordinances;</hi> I would know of the Author what Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances he meaneth of; whether the Ordinance of God, or the Ordinances of men; and I would have him to know what an Ordinance is, and for what end Ordinances was ordained; and I would have him to know a difference between an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and that which is but the Ordinance of men; but I feare he cannot as yet ſee a difference between them, and therefore maketh a humble jumble of both together.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97220:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Ordinances. As for that which is an Ordinance of God, we have commands for the obſerving of the ſame. And one of his chiefe and greateſt Ordinances, is his Sonne <hi>Chriſt,</hi> one with himſelfe, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42. and in as much at he would have us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to that Ordinance, he hath given out his Command, <hi>To love the Lord our God with all our heart, &amp;c. and beleeve in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent.</hi> Now the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of theſe commands in being obedient to that Ordinance, it is out of the compaſſe of the power of every man; and therefore God in ſtouping to the weakeneſſe of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath given out other inferiour Ordinances, as Rules for men while they are in their weakeneſſe; and thoſe Ordinances are within the power of the creature man, to be obſerved; as Reading, Hearing, Praying, Baptizing, Breaking of Bread, &amp;c. Yet in theſe inferiour Ordinances, I would have men to be ſo wiſe, as to underſtand the ground, and intent; or the cauſe, and effect of theſe Ordinances. It will be found, that ſinne is the cauſe or ground of all Laws, or Ordinances; <hi>For the Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion,</hi> Gal. 3. 19. And <hi>the Law is made for the ungodly.</hi> 1. Tim. 1. 9. And Gods intent in giving out Laws and Ordinances, is, to be as a Line or Rule, untill the effect be brought to paſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that a man be brought into that condition (by walking by theſe Rules) of the knowledge of himſelfe, and his owne weakeneſſe, and the weakeneſſe of all thoſe Laws and Ordinances, that ſo the Soule may be made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it to cloſe with that which is the chiefe Ordinance of all; and the ſoule once being truely brought to live under obedience of the chiefe Ordinance, all thoſe inferiour Ordinances is of little uſe: For <hi>there is a time for every thing; a time to Plant, and a time to plucke up that which was Planted For the Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſions;</hi> ſo is all Ordinances: <hi>But the Law maketh nothing perfect,</hi> Heb. 7. 29. no more doth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Ordinances. But when the Promiſed Seed is come, the Law hath no more juriſdiction over man; and when that which is perfect is come, then that which is imperfect is done away; The Law and Ordinances are not perfect, but imperfect; and yet not imperfect, but perfect: But marke well what I ſay in defining my ſelfe, for the Law, or any of Gods Ordinances, hath
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97220:9"/>
a perfection in them; but their perfection tends to death, by reaſon of the ſinne that is in us; and the greateſt perfection that is in any Law or Ordinance, is but to bring man to be perfectly made ſenceable of the ſinne and ſelfeneſſe that is in him. And when man is brought thus farre, Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances is but of little uſe, for further man cannot be brought by them, and ſo their perfection is at an end; and what ſoule ſoever findeth not this to be true in obſerving of Ordinances, may take it for granted, that he hath not been faithfull in walking cloſe by the rule of the Ordinances; or otherwiſe, the Angell of darkeneſſe hath playd that ſoule a tricke of which it is little capable, and ſo raiſeth ſome certaine ſweetneſſe in the ſoule out of the walking in theſe Ordinances; and the falſe fiend maketh the ſoule to beleeve that to be in comes of Chriſt, when it is nothing elſe but a life raiſed out of that whoſe nature is alwayes to produce death; and when the falſe fiend hath got power to worke this worke, no marvaile if ſuch ſoules cry up Ordinances ſo faſt, and cry downe any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God in others who are let ſee, and led out, from ſuch deluſions: but I let ſuch paſſe with the ſaying of the Prophet, <hi>Thou haſt wearied thy ſelfe in the greatneſſe of thy wayes, yet ſaideſt thou not, there is no hope; thou haſt found the life of thine hands, and therefore thou art not grieved,</hi> Iſay 57. 10.</p>
            <p>In every ſoule (which is rightly carried on into that which is the chiefe good) it will be truely made appeare, that the perfection of Laws and Ordinances is fulfilled in bringing it into a perfect death: and the imperfection of Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances will appeare, in that they cannot reſtore the pure life to the ſoule; but that proceedeth from another Fountaine, <hi>viz.</hi> the chiefe Ordinance; and when that which is chiefe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame, is come, that which is inferiour is out of date with that ſoule, and ſo it is made to live in that which is chiefe, above that which is inferiour; for theſe inferiour Ordinances are but Childrens Tutors in their minority, untill the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the Father; though Children may ſometimes, for want of knowledge, be led out to love their tutors better then their Father; yea, and thinke both their Fathers, and all other enemies that would ſeeme to ſeperate them, and their Tutors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But you may ſay, That theſe was Ordinances Inſtituted in the time of the Law, but now we live under Goſpel-Ordinances, and therfore none may live above them. To which I ſay, The Ordinances under the Law had their time, and pointed out that which was the end, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt appearing in the Fleſh, and there they ended: and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Goſpel hath their time, and their end alſo; and that is, when Chriſt appeareth in the ſpirits of men, for he is the end of all Ordinances whatſoever, to them who live in him, and he in them.</p>
            <p>But you may ſay, That Beleevers in the Primitive time, made uſe of Goſpel-Ordinances, whoſe Example it behooveth all men to follow. To which I ſay, it was meet they ſhould doe ſo, at ſometime eſpecially, when they were in their minority in beleeving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo for all young Chriſtians: For as I ſaid before, there is a time for every thing; but even in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive time there was degrees of Chriſtians; ſome Children, ſome young-men, ſome old-men, or Fathers; and it was the wiſedome of the Apoſtle, to frame his diſcourſe and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to every ones condition, and to feed Children with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens meate, and to give to the ſtronger ſuch as was ſuteable for them.

And who dare ſay that the Apoſtle was led with a falſe light, when he ſeemed to ſlight Goſpel-Ordinances, and leave them, as low things (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but as the Alphabet of Chriſtians) and ſo reach out to higher, even to that which is the ſubſtance of all things, wherein perfection was to be attained? <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. 15. for though the Apoſtle had to doe with Children in his time; yet he had to doe with men, who was more excellent, and was not in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to weake and beggarly rudyments, nor lived upon ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, nor was fed with Childrens meate of Ordinances, or buſying themſelves with the Principles of Religion; but was men of full age, who through the great mortification and ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyall, was brought to underſtand what was good, and what was evill, and would not take things for good becauſe they ſeemed to be ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13. And amongſt ſuch, the Apoſtle could be underſtood, when he ſpoke of the myſtery of the Wiſedome of God, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 2. 6. and theſe were of like ſpirit with him, led out, and beyond, or above Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Laws, and inferiour Rules, and aymed at nothing, but the price of the high calling, and the attaining to the Reſurrection of the Dead; and to him there was but one Rule to walke by, and that was the Rule of the Croſſe of Chriſt, by which the world became Crucified to him, and he to it; and thoſe that were perfect, and aymed at perfection, was to walke by the ſame Rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15.

the reproach of all men. The Apoſtle himſelfe was not a little troubled with Profeſſors, who was the very Enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt, and with weeping Teares tould his beloved Hearers that ſad ſtory; but if he were alive in theſe dayes, he might have weeping enough, for ſuch Profeſſors, as are the enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt, whoſe God is their belly, who glory in that which ſhould be their ſhame. who minde earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 17. And I make no doubt if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and thoſe to whom he ſpake the Myſtery of the Wiſedom of God unto, were amongſt us, but that theſe Profeſſors who pretend ordinances ſo much (and yet in theſe ordinances the very Enemies of the Croſſe) would call them deluded men, and carryed away by a falſe light. But I hope the Author will know hereafter, what it is to live under ordinances, and what life that is that is led above ordinances.</p>
            <p>But I am ſomewhat affraid, that the Author is ſomewhat miſtaken about the ordinances of God; and that he taketh the ordinances of men, for the ordinances of God: but at preſent I will not ſtand upon defining every ordinance, whether it be of God or Man, but one onely, and by that let him and all other judge the reſt: I doubt he takes the Prieſts of theſe times for Gods Miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo may call them an ordinance of God; nay, and amongſt Fools, they are accounted one of the chiefe ordinances, and ſo they call themſelves; but if the Author thinks ſo, he is miſtaken, and ſo are all other that take them ſo, for they are none of the ordinances of God, for he never ſent them neither have they any Commiſſion from him; but they are an ordinance of men, and by men were they ſent out, and of men have they learned their Miniſtery, and of men they have their Commiſſion, and for gaine it is they ſeek, and for proſit it is they Preach, and runne as greedily after it, as the hungry dog doth after his prey; and if hire were but taken away from them, all the world might ſee who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them; and theſe have been the greateſt enemies of the Croſſe of Chriſt in all the world, and by them hath the eyes of men been blinded from the true beholding of the Truth; but let but the Free borne Sonns have patience a while, and they ſhall ſee that brought to paſſe, which all the Preaching,

            <p>The Author of that Diſcourſe, taketh it in high diſdaine, that theſe people ſhould ſay, <hi>they have a light in them equall to Scripture, and that that light ſhould be the holy Ghoſt, and ſo need not Scripture, becauſe the ſame is fulfilled in them,</hi> &amp;c. If this Author had but taken good notice of the Scripture, he need not have ſlighted theſe ſayings; for in ſaying ſo, they doe not vary from the truth of God declared in Scripture, nor from the promiſe of Chriſt made out to thoſe that are his followers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as may plainely appeare in theſe ſayings, <hi>When the ſpirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth,</hi> &amp;c. John 16. 13. and further, his promiſe was, that when he was departed, <hi>He would ſend the Comforter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even the ſpirit of truth, which proceeded from the Father, which ſhould teſtifie of him,</hi> John 15. 26. And moreover, our Saviour ſaith againe, <hi>When the Comforter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the holy Ghoſt is come, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſend in my name; he ſhall teach you all truth, and bring all things to your remembrance,</hi> &amp;c.

I hope the Author will not deny the truth of theſe Scriptures; and if theſe promiſes be fulfilled in any man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what need hath ſuch of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture reaching without them, when they have received the ſame ſpirit within them, by which all true Scripture was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: and how much is the words, proceeding from that ſpirit, inferiour to Scripture, except the holy Ghoſt have changed its nature, and be not what it was formerly; for it is not time and perſons that make mens words differ, or not be in equallity

to the word in Scripture, but the ſpirit from whence they flow? And doth not all ordinances point out, or leade to that very end, that God and Man ſhould be united in one ſpirit, that he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, may be one? And if any ſoule be ſo made <hi>one</hi> with God, who dare deny but all true Scripture is fulfilled in them, and that ſuch ſoules have no need of any to teach them, becauſe that anointing which they have received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is able to teach them all things, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27. But I ſay no more to that, becauſe the truth of what they ſay herein is ſo largely amplified in Scripture, except it be to poore blind iddeots, whoſe envy againſt others, have ſhut their eyes from ſeeing, and their hearts from underſtanding the Truth of Scripture.</p>
            <p>The Author of that Diſcourſe, proceedeth ſtill in queſtioning the light which is in theſe people; and amongſt the reſt of his ſcandals eaſt upon them, would make people beleeve, that theſe people deny the Scriptures, the which is a moſt falſe aſperſion; for there is not a people in England that is more conformable to the very outward requiring of Scripture, then theſe people, and that light within them doth leade them, and cauſeth them to act according to what the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in the practicall part thereof in their obedience, to which their very outward practice doth condemne all men in the Land, both religious and irreligious; for they follow the words of our Saviour, where he ſaith, <hi>Take no thought for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: And having Food and Rayment, therewith be content,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 6. 26. 27. And in mortifying their Sences and Members, they follow the command of the Apoſtle, to divers of the people he taught, which Rule he followed himſelfe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. and yet this Author ſaith, <hi>They are poſſeſſed with an auſtere Devill,</hi> and denyes Scripture for ſo doing; but let but a wiſe man judge, whether thoſe who pretend Scripture, and talke of Scripture; or thoſe that practice Scripture, deny it moſt; for every one that cryeth up Scripture with their Tongue, are not thoſe that confeſſe Scripture; but thoſe are they that truely confeſſe it, that in their practice is conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it: for every one ſhall not enter into Heaven for talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, and making diſcourſes of God out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.

nor that ſayeth Lord, Lord; but they that doe the <hi>Will of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is no marvaile to me if theſe people be ſo cryed out againſt with all people, for their very outward life is a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt all ſorts, both Formaliſts, and others; For there is no difference between the Formaliſts, and men who are not conformed, for both are alike for pride and ſenſuality, and for the love of the world, and for reputation amongſt men, all of them having hearts alike, in the worſhip of the god of the World; onely the Formaliſts differ from the other in their head, by which they are carryed beyond the other into a faire ſeeming Forme, in which they worſhip God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their good-thinking; but yet their Forme will admit their hearts to worſhip the gods of the Heathen; I may ſpeak it with ſadneſſe of heart, ſeeing the truth hereof ſo clearely, and cannot deny, but all Formaliſts and unconformed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are but hornes ſpringing out of the ſame head of the Beaſt which <hi>John</hi> ſaw in his <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, the light that is in theſe people, is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Scripture holdeth out in the Myſtery, but the ſame being truely fulfilled in them they are made able to witneſſe the truth in the Scripture, and no other way can any ſoule be a true witneſſe of the truth of Scripture, but by having the ſame truely fulfilled in them; for all other are but falſe witneſſes, and ſpeaketh but of it from what they have heard or received from others; and theſe people is made able by the light which is in them, to witneſſe the truth of the love of God made knowne to their ſoules, and of other of Gods dealing with them, and will not vary from Scripture, but owne it, and take it to witneſſe the truth of what they doe declare to others. And I am ſure, that many of the Prieſts in England can witneſſe the truth of what I ſay, <hi>if</hi> their malice would but let them; for the time hath been (and not long ſince) that ſome of the Prieſts made tryall of them, thinking to confute them, and make them appeare as erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but it proved the contrary way: for not long had they diſſourſed with them, but the Prieſts was ſtrucken dumbe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

them, and had not a word to ſay, but was forced to fly, like beaten Cockes; in ſo much that the very vulgar people, ſhouted at the beaten Prieſts; and ſome did averre, that they conceived, that no fewer then an hundred ſoules was convinced of the truth at that time: And yet theſe beaten Prieſts deviſeth all wayes poſſible, to root out theſe people; but they are but like the people, with whom <hi>Steven</hi> converſed, who was not able to reſiſt the ſpirit he ſpake from, yet they ſtoned him to death, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Author of that Diſcourſe, proceedeth about the exhalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, and ſayes, <hi>whatſoever is eſſentiall to God, the ſame is appropriated to Scripture:</hi> the which ſaying, if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is no leſſe then blaſphemy; Whether was it God, or the Scripture, that Created the World, and all other things? Or whether was it Scripture, or Chriſt, that ſuffered for the ſinne of man? or whether is it Scripture, or Chriſt, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth God to man? or whether is it Scripture, or God, that maketh the Winde blow where it liſteth, and the Raine to fall in its appointed ſeaſon? &amp;c. If that be true which he ſaith, why is not every one ſanctified, and made holy, that Heareth or Readeth Scripture? Alas, when men have no other light, but the light of reaſon, to beare witneſſe to the truth of Scripture, what ſoule miſtakes doe they light on in medling with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for as ſome being led by their wilde wandering wit, make leſſe of the Scripture then it is; ſo this Author is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by that light, to make more of the Scripture then it is; and to make good what he affirmeth, he quoteth <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. where the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of things in the dayes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was before any Scripture was Written; and becauſe the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>The Scripture foreſeei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g ſuch things;</hi> therefore it is like God, who fore-ſeeth all things. But I would have the Author, and all others, to underſtand themſelves better, and then they ſhall underſtand Scripture better. I would know of the Author, what Scripture it was that the Apoſtle meaneth of, when the Scripture which we have at this day, was not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many a yeare after the time of <hi>Abraham:</hi> but if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor cannot tell, I will declare to him what Scripture that was;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97220:13"/>
The Word Scripture is two-fold, and to be underſtood in a two-fold ſence; the one Eſſencyall, the other Declarative: Now the Scripture Declarative, is written in Paper by men, and had a time for its beginning, and ſo there is a time for it to end; but the Scripture Eſſenciall, hath its being in it ſelfe, and is Eternall, and ſhall have no end; and this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the true Eſſenciall Word of God, or his Sonne Chriſt, by whom all things were Created; and this Word was in the beginning, and this Word was God, and nothing was made or brought to paſſe, but by this Word, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. 2. and this Word was the Wiſedome of God by which he ſpoke, and acted, and fore-ſeeth things to come: and it was this Word, or Scripture that fore-ſaw, by which God fore-told <hi>Abraham</hi> things to come; and this Word, or Scripture, and God, is all one. And the Apoſtle who knew the truth hereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> divers times uſeth the Word Scripture; for the Word God, when he is ſpeaking of Gods fore-ſeeing, ſpeaking, or acting, as may plainely appeare, where he ſaith, <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all under unbeleife,</hi> Gal. 3. 22. the which act, the Scripture Declarative never could doe; but the Scripture or Word Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenciall, which is God: the truth of which is cleared by the ſame Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the ſame ſubject, where he ſaith, <hi>That God had concluded all under unbeleife,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 11. 32. And further, in ſpeaking of what the Scripture ſaid to <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, Even for this purpoſe have I rayſed thee up,</hi> &amp;c, Rom. 9. 17. which ſaying was not ſpoken to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> nor which worke was wrought upon him, by the Scripture Declarative; but by the Scripture, or Word Eſſentiall, which was God himſelfe, as may be ſeen in <hi>Exodus,</hi> 9. 16. where it was plainly held out, that it was God that ſpake theſe words, and wrought that worke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>upon <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would have that Author, and all other, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true diſtinction between the Scripture, or Word Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall, and the Scripture or word Declarative; for if they doe not, it is poſſible they will adde to the one, and diminiſh the other; and then let them take heed of the curſe that <hi>John</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, at the end of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Author goeth on in his Diſcourſe in his blindneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97220:14"/>
and all along attributeth that to the word Declarative, which is the proper worke of the word Eſſenciall; and ſo brings to prove, what he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aies the ſaying of the Apoſtle, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Word of God is quicke and powerfull, and ſharper then any two edged Sword,</hi> &amp;c. the which he falſly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Scripture Declarative, which in it ſelfe is as dead as a ſtone, except the Eſſenciall word firſt move in the heart of man; otherwiſe how is it, that all mens thoughts and intents is not diſcovered by Hearing, or Reading it? but what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh there, is the very worke of the Eſſenciall word, or God himſelfe, as the following verſe of the ſame Chapter will truely witneſſe, where the Apoſtle doth more illuſtrate and lay open the property of the Eſſenciall word, and ſaith, <hi>Neither is there any creature that is not manifeſted in his ſight, but all things are naked, and layd open before the eyes of him with whom we have to doe.</hi> And doth not God plainely declare by the Prophet, That it is <hi>he himſelfe that ſearcheth the heart, and tryeth the reines,</hi> Jer. 17. 9. 10. O what blindneſſe is amongſt men (yea amongſt Profeſſors alſo) that they cannot ſee, nor be made beleeve what is the word of God, but in their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, taketh the Scripture Declarative, for the word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which they have neither example, nor command in that Scripture they doe ſo much Idolize, but onely as they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that word by Tradition from their fore-Fathers, who was blinded in their underſtanding, and could not know any other word of God, and ſo gave that name to the Scriptures, becauſe they were not acquainted with the Eſſenciall word within them, therefore their wit carryed them to Scripture without them; and finding ſome ſaying in it which ſuited with their reaſon as ſuch ſayings as theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>They ſpake the Word of God with boldneſſe,</hi> Acts 4 31. <hi>But the Word of God grew and multiplyed,</hi> Acts 12. 24. <hi>Not handling the Word of God deceitfully,</hi> Rom. 4. 2. <hi>Take the Word of God, which is the Sword of the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 17. <hi>It is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 5. and divers other ſpeaking in Scripture to that purpoſe, which all of them is the proper effects of the Eternall Word the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> the which but few of our wiſe, learned Rabbies have knowne; and therefore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97220:14"/>
have they underſtood, that theſe ſayings which held out the property of the Eternall, with its effects, to be the property of the Scripture and its effects. But when our <hi>Saviour</hi> (who was the Word it ſelfe) had occaſion to uſe Scripture, he gave no ſuch title to Scripture, but ſaid, <hi>It is Written</hi> in ſuch a Booke; or <hi>Is it not Written in your Law,</hi> John 10. 34. And when the Apoſtles had occaſion to ſpeake out of the Scripture, did they not follow the ſame rules. And when the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> would pronounce the Scripture by another name, he calleth it, <hi>A ſure Word of Propheſie.</hi> But this epithite, the Word of God, was not at all given to it, untill the Eternall Word was hid, and man wanted the life, and power thereof, within him; and then his wit found the Word of God without him; and to theſe dayes our wiſe Rabbies underſtand it ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and makes Fooles beleeve that what they ſay is true; and under this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, they take to themſelves the name of the Miniſters of God, and that which they Preach is the Word of God; when as they know not what the word of God is, but what they gather out of the Scriptures, which is nothing elſe but a Declaration of the word of God without a man; but as for that which is the Word it ſelfe (the which ſhould live in them, and they in it, and what that word ſpake in them, to declare to others) alas, they know not what it meaneth, but buſyeth themſelves to perfecute and ſcandalize theſe, in whom the Eſſenciall word liveth, and they in it: And that Author being of the Diſciples of thefe Rabbies, doth play his part on their ſide, and in his Diſcourſe runns himſelfe ſtone blinde about advancing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Scripture, to that end, for which they were never intended; but if the blind leade the blind, they had beſt take heed of ditches. It would be too tedious, and draw out too long a Volume to anſwer that Author in every perticular of his blind Diſcourſe, therefore I will paſſe by many things, the which if time would have permitted, I would have anſwered in order; but what I have ſaid already, though in briefe, will ſatisfie the wiſe; and for the fooliſh, there is too much ſaid already, for beate him in a morter, and his folly will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him: But before I conclude, I cannot chuſe but take notice of ſomewhat more he ſayes concerning theſe People
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97220:15"/>
called <hi>Quakers;</hi> where he telling of comming to theſe People <hi>in the power and evidence of Gods Word,</hi> and tels them of <hi>admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſt, holy walking with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſubjection to Ordinances, Baptiſme, Kirkefellowſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c. and they will tell you, (or as he ſaith) that uncleane ſpirit in them, will cry out, and witneſſe againſt you, that you be but yet in the ſpirit of the world, and under the power of carnall reaſon, &amp;c. Its true, they will do ſo to ſome people, and wiſe men cannot but admire to ſee ſuch a ſpirit of diſcerning in many of theſe people, for an hypocrite can hardly beguile them, though he may come with never ſo faire pretences to try them; and let an hyhocrite arme himſelfe as ſtrongly with the Scripture (and his worſhip of God in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances) as poſſibly he can, and that light, or eternall word in them, will finde them out, and diſcover theſe to the very bottome: And I know for a truth, that no hypocrite is able to ſtand before them; and I beleeve an hypocrite that once hath had diſcourſe with them, dare not appeare before them the ſecond time; and indeed, they may the eaſilier diſcerne an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, when they themſelves are delivered from that great evill, the which no doubt but many of them had in them, while they were in their pretended cloſe walking with God, and in their admirings of a Chriſt without them, and hide-bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a faire ſeeming Forme; and the truth is, while men live in ſuch a condition, they are not able to ſee how the Harlot is decked in them.</p>
            <p>And this Author ſeemeth to take it for a ſtrange (and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive) ſaying, <hi>That the people ſhould ſay, that they pray alwayes; and that they have the Baptiſme of Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they eate the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt continually,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed I doe not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile at the Author for thinking ſo for I beleeve he little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or is acquainted with the mystery of theſe things, for I doubt he is too buſie about theſe things without him, ſo that he is but little acquainted with the myſtery of theſe things within him: But at one thing I marvaile in the Author, that he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping and idolizing the Scripture ſo much, and yet ſhould be unacquainted with what is written in it; or otherwiſe why is it, that the Scripture that he maketh no leſſe then God ſhould not reueale the truth of theſe ſayings to him; for if he doe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97220:15"/>
but remember the Scripture, it <hi>commands us to Pray alwayes;</hi> but no command in it for ſet times, and ſet Formes of Prayer. And for the Baptiſme with Fire, it was the Promiſe of Chriſt, and was fore-told by <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> Mat. 3. 11. And for eating and drinking the Body and Blood of Chriſt continually, that ſoule that doth not ſo, is in the captivity of death, and hath no life in it; and there is no abiding or living in the word of God or Chriſt, but by eating his Fleſh and drinking his Blood after that manner; for he that eateth his Fleſh, and drinketh his Blood in this manner, abideth in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him, <hi>John</hi> 6. 56. It is not the outward act of Baptiſme, or the Bread and Wine, eating and drinking, that makes a Chriſtian, or bringeth the ſoule to live in Chriſt, and Chriſt in it: no, no, theſe are typpicall things under this diſpenſation in which we live; and they hold it out in the myſtery, the dying with Chriſt, and the living with Chriſt: For as in the time of the Law, there was ſeverall Ceremonies which poynted at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in the Fleſh; ſo when he was in the Fleſh, he left types of another nature, and theſe pointed at Chriſts appearing in ſpirit; and as the types under the Law ended when Chriſt appeared in the Fleſh; ſo the types under the Goſpel end, when Chriſt appeareth in the ſpirit. But none will beleeve the great Myſtery herein, but ſuch as have found the ſame truely fulfilled in them; and yet thoſe who have attained this Myſtery, and ſpeaketh thereof to the world, or to the out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſide religious, ſhall be accounted no leſſe then Blaſphemers becauſe this croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their humane wiſedome, by which they underſtand God and his way; and many of thoſe people is able to make good the truth of this Myſtery in them, and witneſſe the ſame by Scripture to; yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome of them will witneſſe the ſame by ſignes and wonders to, if they be put to it: And yet this Author doth falſly accuſe theſe people, ſaying. <hi>That they can give no Scripture account for what they hold out;</hi> and doth falſly ſay, <hi>That they deny Scripture,</hi> when no people in the world doth anſwer the Scripture (in its requiring) more then they. Other falſe accuſations I omit, becauſe time will not give way to anſwer them; for as he ſaith, <hi>The mary abſurd, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:97220:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>practiſes of theſe Fantaſtickes</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>would be too much to relate;</hi> ſo I ſay, to anſwer all his falſe accuſations, would be too tedious.</p>
            <p>But as he goes on in his diſcourſe, he lighteth on a great hole in their Coate, as he thinketh, <hi>viz. That they will not put off their Hats to any, no not to a Magiſtrate;</hi> and where doth this Author finde in Scripture any command for ſo doing; but if he minde Scripture well, he ſhall finde ſomething to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that was a command of our Saviours; who bad his Diſciples, That they ſhould <hi>ſalute no man by the way,</hi> Luke 10. 4. and for a Magiſtrate, or other men in Authority, what are they more then other men; for if they would but well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the originall root of Authority, they ſhall finde, that they have no juſt cauſe to look for more reſpect then other men; for if ſin had not bin brought out in the world, one man had not ruled over another: And the Scripture ſaith, the Devill brought ſinne into the world, and ſinne brought out Lawes, and Lawes brought out Authority; but as for Magiſtrates, and men in Authority that are good men, theſe looke but for little honour of men, though there be an honour that is due to ſuch; but that honour conſiſteth not in putting off Hats to them, for if it had, the Scripture would have commanded ſuch honour in ſome place of it.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe that Author findeth other great defects amongſt theſe people, becauſe they will not call men <hi>Rabbies</hi> and <hi>Sirs,</hi> and becauſe they ſpeake and write men <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would know of the Author if he finde any command in Scripture for ſuch Names, or to give ſuch epithites to men; Nay, is not the command of Scripture quite contrary; For when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Call no man Father upon Earth,</hi> how can a man juſtly call another <hi>Maſter or Sir?</hi> What man, but Heathen or Fooles; dare take that name to him, ſeeing Chriſt gave in charge to his Diſciples, that they ſhould not take the name Maſter upon them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 8. And what grounds or reaſons can that Author ſhew, that men ſhould be called Yee and You, ſeing all examples in Scripture, New and Old, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth men by the name Thou and Thee; yea, if he were never
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97220:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo great a one; and if the word You or Yee be any honour, or reſpect, why will not that Author, and others, let God have that honour and reſpect alſo? Nay, are not all theſe traditionall complements crept in amongſt men in the time of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? and how is the hearts of Fooles glewed to theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions? yea, the very examples and commands in Scripture, is made voyde by vaine Traditions; and yet theſe men who leave Traditions, and follow the example and command in Scripture, how are they mocked and ſcandalized for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as this Author doth falſly accuſe them, that they walke not according to Scripture; but may not even a very Ideot be judge, whether they, or the Author and his Fellowes be the greater denyers of Scriptures: Nay, it is too plainely appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the Author and his Fellowes are the denyers of Scripture, though they pretend or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>cry <hi>Scripture, Scripture, Scripture,</hi> but they will owne no more in Scripture, then will ſute and ſerve to pleaſe their good-thinking, to patch up a Forme of Worſhip to their God, under which they may hide all their pride, and hypocriſie, and coveteous practiſes; but where the example and command in Scripture is againſt theſe things, how little doe they heed it: O how well is Scripture liked, and how ſwiftly is the worſhip carried on, when it ſutes with ſence and reaſon! but, O how harſh is Scripture, and the worſhip of ſpirit in the way of bearing the Croſſe, of ſelfe-deniall: nay, away with that Scripture and Worſhip, that will part a man and his ſelfe, for that, for ſure, ſhall have the name of madneſſe, and deluſion,</p>
            <p>The Author is judging theſe people, That <hi>they thinke the obſerving of theſe things, is a great Badge of their Profeſſion;</hi> but let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thoughts be what they will of theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I will plainely tell that Author, or any other of his Fellowes, that to be brought to the profeſſion of ſuch things, will be found an hundred times more harder worke, then to be brought into Brother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hood, or Kirke-fellowſhip, or to performe all holy duties (ſo called) in the ſame Fellowſhip; for in Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hood and Kirke-fellowſhip, and in the performing of all holy duties (ſo called) included therein, a man may keep his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97220:17"/>
honour, prayſe, pride, and reputation amongſt men; but the profeſſion of the other will kill theſe; and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile if Formes have ſo many favorites, and the other ſo few friends.</p>
            <p>Another thing I obſerve in the Authors Diſcourſe is, where he is ſaying, That <hi>ſome of theſe people, through Gods mercy, have bin reduced, and turned again into Church-Communion, who have confeſſed, while they were in that way, they had no ſence of God,</hi> &amp;c. I would have the Author, and others, to know the truth of that, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That thoſe that joyneth with theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with an hypocrites heart, cannot long continue in their way; for there they finde but little to pleaſe their pride, or ſenſuality, or their wit and reaſon; and God doth juſtly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe, in not ſhewing his countenance to an hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call heart; and when ſuch hypocrites can finde nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that will pleaſe pride, and ſenſuality, then doe they ſtart backe from them, for they know well enough where to be entertained, and get liberty for their ſences, and keepe up their pride, &amp;c. And where they may warme themſelves at the fire of their owne kindling, and walke in the light of theſe ſparkes, and have theſe to be called in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>comes of Chriſt into the ſoule, and where they may be Canonized with the name <hi>Saint,</hi> &amp;c. may not the Author hereby ſee the great blindeneſſe of himſelfe, and the reſt of his formall Fellowes, that an hypocrite falling from theſe people, ſhould amongſt them be accounted a <hi>Saint;</hi> for the truth is, Formes and Church-fellowſhip, is the very refuge of hypocrites; but amongſt the other, an hypocrite cannot long continue. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but at this day there is hypocrites amongſt them; but time will diſcover them, and they will fall off from amongſt them; but it maketh no matter, for thoſe that fall off will help to make Church-fellowſhip up well enough.</p>
            <p>That Author proceedeth on in his Diſcourſe, with an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement to his Fellowes to bleſſe God for their faire Form and holy performances; I make no doubt, but it would have pleaſed him well, if his Fellowes had met together upon his Advertiſement, for two houres, and prayſed God for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97220:17"/>
of their faire Forme, much like the people, who cryed for two houres together, <hi>Great art thou O Diana of the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi> The Author containing ſtill his ſpirit of ſcandall and rayling, calleth theſe people <hi>Owles,</hi> and ſayes, <hi>they dare not appeare where Church-fellowſhip is;</hi> the which the very Prieſts and people in their naturalls will confute; for they have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in open Congregations, and have confuted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Prieſts in Preaching untruths to the people; for which doing, it is not unknowne, that they have undergone long and tedious Impriſonments. Yea, theſe people dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and hath appeared in Publique Market Places, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt the ſinnes of the people in theſe times; for which doing, ſome of them have put their life in danger. And for other Church-fellowſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> the Congregaeed way, I I know not how one ſhould deviſe to come to have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to appeare amongſt them, they keep ſo ſecret; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man have got on the hypocrites habit, and make a friend of ſome of their Order to be admitted to appeare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe ſayes, <hi>they are bred in darke places;</hi> what theſe darke places is he meaneth of, I cannot tell, except he meaneth in ſome place of the Land which is Hills or Dales, remote from the body of the Land, where oft times the worſt of the Prieſts of <hi>Baall</hi> hath their habitations, and where Church-fellowſhip is not in faſhion; If theſe be the <hi>darke places</hi> he meaneth of, I would have him to know, it is no hard thing for God to raiſe up light in darkeneſſe, and to make more of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and truth appeare to ſome in ſuch places, then to thoſe who live in Cities, great Townes, and Corporations, where oft-times, the great, or chiefe Prieſts of <hi>Baall,</hi> have their Places, becauſe of fat Benefits, and have the good-thinking policy of making Congregations: But I would have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to remember, that when Chriſt appeared in the Fleſh, that his naturall Parents, and the moſt upright People, lived the fartheſt off the Prieſts, and the Temple, and lived not in Cities and Corporations, or in the body of the Countrey, but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97220:18"/>
in the Mountaines and Hilly part of the Countrey, and in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by-Places and Villages.</p>
            <p>The Author runns on ſtill in his cenſorious ſcandalls, and ſayes, <hi>Theſe people have been either ſlighters of Ordinances, or ſlight under them; great Duty-mungers, yet wanted the ſpirit of their Duties,</hi> &amp;c. Its true, a man may live under Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and be ſlight, and too looſe under them; but I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that ſoule for leaving the Ordinances, and ſuch ſlight du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for taking up that which is an hundred times of more weight in the performing: And for ſlighting of Ordinances, I know, when the ſpirit of judgement is come, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth man of ſinne, Righteouſneſſe and Judgement (under which man is made truely to know himſelfe) it will make that ſoule truely to know the weakeneſſe of Ordinances, and outward Formes, and what Knavery lay in his heart hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe; and of how little helpe there is for him in theſe Ordinanees and Duties; and when man is truely brought to know this, I beleeve he will but ſtay himſelfe a little upon Ordinances and Duties, for there is no other worke for him to goe about; and little will that ſoule care for the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeeches of Formaliſts.</p>
            <p>This Author is ſpeaking of <hi>wanting the ſpirit of Duty,</hi> I would he were ſo wiſe as to know what ſpirit it is that is moſt frequent in duty, and I beleeve he ſhould perceive it to be a Devill, hiding himſelfe under the habit of an Angell, who can cunningly bring Promiſes to remembrance, and hath power to rayſe falſe joy in the ſoule, out of theſe Promiſes; and he can make Fooles beleeve, theſe be the in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>comes of Chriſt into the ſoule, and the ſoules leading out to Chriſt in the Promiſes; and if any under Ordinanees and Duty once, be poſſeſſed with this ſpirit, it is hard for any to make them beleeve otherwiſe; and theſe I beleeve will not be ſloathfull in Duty, or ſlight Ordinances, becauſe of ſuch good feeding, as they imagine they get thereby; for their Urim and their Thummim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anſwers them as they would have it. I will med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle no more at preſent with anſwering the reſt of his ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97220:18"/>
but leave the thing to God, who I hope in his time will cleare his owne truth, and make it to flouriſh in deſpight of all oppoſers. Yet one thing I commend in that Author, <hi>viz.</hi> That he wiſhes his Fellowes, <hi>to worke out their ſalvation with feare and trembling;</hi> If he have underſtood the truth of that ſaying, I know he cannot but confeſſe, that he hath wiſhed all his Fellowes to become <hi>Quakers,</hi> for no People in the Land hath had that ſaying more fully fulfilled in them, then theſe People, whom all Formaliſts, and almoſt all People elſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe: But let the Author, and all others, take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they ſhall ſee the time, that they ſhall be made to <hi>tremble and quake,</hi> and that they ſhall not evade it, though at preſent they bleſſe themſelves from ſuch a thing; and then faire Formes, and fine Apparell, and holy dutie (ſo called) riches, prayſe, and reputation, ſenſuality, pleaſures, &amp;c. ſhall but little prevaile, but be daſhed in pieces, and the men who is found alive in theſe things; but happy is that ſoule that is made truely acquainted with the evill that is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and who hath taken up the Croſſe of Chriſt, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after him in the dayly denying and forſaking himſelfe; and who ever thou art that doth that, I wiſh the God, even the God of Gods, to be with thee in thy worke, that thou mayeſt be ſtrengthened both inward and outward, untill thy ſelfe be Crucified, and made dead upon that Cro ſe, ſo that thy ſoule may attaine to the perfection of the Reſurrection of the Dead.</p>
