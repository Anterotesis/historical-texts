            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader, at the end ouf my Paper called, <hi>A Voice from heaven,</hi> I do ſpeak ouf the ſpi-right knowing what the 24 letters do afford, either in the ſingle letter, or in the compacted word. It is true; for the ſpi-right hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in me, that there be many words that are not ouf truth ſpelling, or ouf truth compacting, as they are compacted. The word is <hi>ſpi-right,</hi> and not <hi>ſpirit; ſpi-right to-all,</hi> and not <hi>ſpiritual;</hi> and <hi>ouf,</hi> and not <hi>of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord the Confounder cometh ſwiftly to confound all mens talk, becauſe when they talk they do not underſtand name or nature which ouf they talk. The ſpi-right ouf truth is the confounder. Whoſoever hath the ſpi-right minde, that ſhall not be confounded. There is a great deal ouf talk ouf taking God his Name in vain: all do take his Name in vain, but the ſpi-right minde in men, which ſeeth all vanity in them.</p>
            <p>The unfallen Angels, that never did deceive, nor ever was deceived, will have the government ouf the vailed ſoul from the deceit which they are vailed with, by ſubjecting ouf the deceiver, to do according as the truth doth rule them, which is never to have any free-will to deceive or deſtroy, but to become the true power his footſtool. Then God is all in all, and the Wicked one hath the fall.</p>
            <p>God doth not ſpeak to the ſelf-minde ouf man, or in it, but doth cleanſe it away; then he ſpeaks into his own minde in man, and his own minde receiveth him. God will have all cleanſed before him, as he is clean. The body ouf man is a Figure; the ſoul in it is a ſubject or eſſence, carrying or bearing the body about. This ſubject is to be no ſubject to that that gives it any ſelf carnal minde, or ſubject to any other affliction; it is to be a ſun to life, and not ſubject to death. When the unfallen power hath raiſed it by his ſpi-right minde up into himſelf, then man is not himſelf, he is in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal nature it ſelf. There is the unfallen undeceiver, and the fallen deceiver, and the fallen deceived; theſe are diſtinct beings one from another. The undeceiver is a Miniſter ouf his ſpi-right to the ſoul that lieth under the altar or carnal minde; which ſpi-right in it being ſet up, doth ſee or ſpie all that is periſhing, and that which is everlaſting. I the Lord will have no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing to worſhip me, but my ſpi-right in the ſoul, which doth worſhip me diſcerning what it doth. The man Chriſt ſo called received the ſpi-right without meaſure into his ſoul, which did ſpi-right-to-all truth and lyes; therefore it was ſaid, <hi>The Godhead in him dwelt bodily.</hi> There is but one miniſter ouf the ſpi-right into men, which doth by its miniſtry diſcover all <hi>Babel</hi> in them to its ſelf, within its ſelf in them.</p>
            <p>Men have a great many words falſly compacted, or ſpelt, or underſtood, which they call <hi>Goſpel.</hi> The vain mind ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall know any other Goſpel but his own <hi>Babel-Goſpel,</hi> which he hath ſtoln from other mens experiences to his own advantage, to deceive, ſo far as he hath his own inclination in them to be deceived. Nothing in man can receive the ſpi right, but the ſoul, it being cleanſed ouf all that is contrary to it, it receiveth faith in God, or ſpi right of God, which is the ſingle eye, everlaſting truth. The power or father ouf the ſpiright and ſoul will purge out the carnal mind out ouf the ſoul, and let nothing inhabit in his kingdom but ſpi-right.</p>
            <p>Thus ſaith the ſpi-right that doth ſpy all truth and all lyes in men, or in that power that is in combination to deceive his own whole creation, that liveth within his own inclination; he cannot deceive the ſpy, for in it there muſt live no ly, or inclination to ly, for it doth a ly defy, ſaying, Depart from me, I know you to do wickedly; thou ſhalt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated for ever, never to live in union with God the true ſpi-right-to-all falſe no ſpi-right or ſeer ouf truth: this is the ſon ouf perdition, that would be prying into all that the ſpi-right ſaith, that he may be the neereſt likeneſs as he can be to truth, calling himſelf ſpi-right, when that he doth abominate the true ſpi-right that doth behold him in all his actions, feeing them: he is in rage and madneſs, he would not loſe his cloke. The ſpi right minde ſaith, All in the ſoul but me is a reprobate: I do ſee with my ſingle eye into thee, whoſoever thou be; this is no myſtery to the true ſpy; but it is unto the ly, that doth wonder and periſh eternally. All that ever did wonder, was and is the reprobate at his ſelf, and at the everlaſting truth. The ſpi-right ſeeth all things, and there is no new thing to it, that is in God. ſun, moon, and ſtars. Here is a great deceit in the interpretation ouf this ſaying, <hi>No new thing under the ſun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some ſay, All things ever were as they are, and that is the fool that doth expect any change in the world; one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration goeth, and another cometh, and ſo it will be forever, as it is now with men, living now as they do, in all maner ouf wickedneſs. There is a truth in that ſaying, but for this interpretation, it is not ouf the ſpi-right ouf truth; for the ſpi-right ſaith, that as darkneſs doth abound in men, ſo the light is not to be ſeen in them, or is in them. Thus ſaith the ſpi-right, Light ſhall ſo abound in men, that darkneſs ſhall not be ſeen in them, or be in them. The ſpi-right is true, all men are lyers.</p>
            <p>There are two ſowers, two ſeeds, one ground. The true ſower is the ſower ouf the ſpi-right minde into the ſoul, which ſoul is the ground in the body ouf fleſh. The falſe ſower is the cumberer ouf the ſoul or ground with a falſe conception ouf a carnal minde, having in it the falſe ſowers inclination to all maner ouf his evils. The word <hi>Woman</hi> is taken for the carnal minde, it is the bond-woman that muſt be caſt out from oppreſſing ouf the ſoul; which ſoul is to be the free-woman, when ſhe hath received the ſpi-right, without any darkneſs in her. Then the ſoul doth not groan in the ſtrange wilderneſs ouf ſin, but is ſet free into Eternity, where nothing but ſpi-right ſhall inhabit: there ſhe is caught up into the heaven ouf heavens out ouf ſin his ſight, which once with her did fight; there is God ſpi-right.</p>
            <p>And after the ſoul hath received the ſpi-right minde into it, and the carnal minde done away, then there is ſoul ſpi-right that ſeeth God, it being the life ouf faith that it liveth, which is one with God in all things, ſeeing him face to face, without any ſhame or diſgrace; all deceivers and their deceit muſt not look him in the face, but with ſhame bluſh with diſgrace. There is <hi>a ſavour ouf death unto death,</hi> which muſt now be aſhamed ouf his ſavoring or reliſhing ouf death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord will raign over them, and will diſcover all that hath been hid, on the houſe top, to all that is of the ſelf-ſame wicked nature, as well as unto the righteous nature. The wicked nature never did ſavour truth, nor never ſhall; the righteous nature never did ſavour the wicked nature, nor never will: it is a clean ſoul that God doth ſavour with his true mind, which is ſpi-right, or diſcern right, or ſee right with the ſingle eye which hath in it all light: it is God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouf life and light, which doth ſpi-right ouf all things, for there is nothing out ouf his ſight.</p>
