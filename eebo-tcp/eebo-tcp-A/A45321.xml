            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE ANTIPODES, OR REFORMATION with the heeles upward.</head>
            <p>IT cannot be forgoten, that at the first comming together of this Parliament, there were many burthens, and multitudes of oppressions and iniustices done by persons in trust and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; to the great dishonour of the King, and damage of the Kingdome; all which were in the Parliaments Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance largely explained, and laid down in divers heads or branches, viz.<list>
                  <item>1. That Proiects and Monopolies were granted, and a generall burthen brought upon the Kingdome, for the enriching of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons.</item>
                  <item>2. That persons were protected from due processe at law, by the power of great ones, the guilty acquitted, and innocent condemned.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Law was not the security, but the ruine of the People</item>
                  <item>4. That illegall and unnecessary taxes, as Ship-money, and others, (contrary to Law and the Subiects liberty) were imposed.</item>
                  <item>5. That severall free men were illegally dis-infranchised of their liberties, and imprisoned, without any indictment, or testimony of fact committed.</item>
                  <item>6. That many others were stigmatized, fined, and banished, for endeavouring the maintenance of the Lawes and liberties of the Kingdome.</item>
                  <item>7. That many were forced to sweare to answer to interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries against themselves, &amp;c.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>These and many other great grievous oppressions lay upon the pore people of England, untill such time as this Parliament (in the infancy and innocency thereof) did both declare against them, and endeavour to bring the authors to condign punishment, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof they entered into a solemne Covenant, wherein they engaged the whole Kingdome with them.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of which engagement, the Lords and Commons by severall Declarations and Ordinances improved their interest in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100945:3"/>
People often declaring unto them the urgent necessity of assisting them; and often calling the great God of Heaven and Earth to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that what they then aimed at was only the removing the King from his evill Councellours, and bringing Delinquents to tryall, &amp; securing the peace and liberty of the Subiect; and that if after all their reproaches from their enemies, and slightfull discouragements from friends, they could but obtain the desired end before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they should reioyce in their sufferings, and thinke that to be a sufficient reward of all their labours.</p>
            <p>And further, that they might the better worke upon the affection of the People, they in a Declaration Jan. 30. 1643. declared as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. VVe place not our confidence in our own strength, but in God almighty, the Lord of Hosis, who will not leave nor forsake his People: it is his own truth and cause we maintain the exaltation of the Kingdome of his Sonne, and the preservation of his Church, and of this whole Iland from utter ruine, is our aime, and the end we have before our eyes.</p>
            <p>Upon these and the like grounds, we resolve with courage and constancy unto the end to do our parts; and the Lord who hath <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this Declaration we make not from any presumption in the strength of our Armies; but from the sence of that duty which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and expected from the high places and relations wherein we stand, &amp;c. Having after long and grave consultations resolved and decreed, never to lay down Armes, till truth and Peace by the blessing of God be settled in this Kingdome upon a firm foundation, for the present and future Generations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which shall be esteemed of us a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, yea abundant reward of all that wee can do or suffer in this cause.</p>
            <p>Oh that too many members of the Houses of Parliament had not forgot themselves! Or that they would remember, that the al-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, (who knew their hearrs, and hates hipocrisie) will surely require the due performance of their solemne engagements at their hands; and that they cannot now expect the continuance of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon them, since they have neglected to pay their vowes unto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> performe their declared duty to the Kingdome, whereunto they engaged themselves, and called him as a witnes, as if their iniquity
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100945:3"/>
were not sufficient, unlesse proclaimed in the face of Jehovah. Heare oh Heavens, and tremble oh Earth; Oh England stand amazed! ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your trustees have conceived wickedness, they promised liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but behold slavery; they pretended Justice, but behold oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they pretended Reformation, but behold deformation; they pleaded law, but have lost conscience; they pretended purity, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold hypocrisy; Justice is turned backward, Treason is countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and truth discouraged, your oppressours honoured, your friends dispised; your seeming safety, is become your certaine sicknesse, and what will you doe in the end thereof? Beleeve it Country-men and fellow Souldiers, our condition is much worse then at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, for then we knew our sicknesse, and remedy, but now such are our distempers, that wee may more easily know them then cure them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tis their priviledge is our bondage, their power our pestilence, their rights our poverty, their wils our law, their smiles our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty their frownes our ruine; and though by the free Commons cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen servants, yet by their usurpations become Masters, ney Kings; commanding both King and People without controule; because they cannot make a Law theyle keepe none.</p>
            <p>Consider all your former sufferings, being compared yee will find that these Aegyptian Task-masters doe much exceed in cruelty; remember the vast expence of blood and treasure you have laid out for them to keepe them quiet, see the improvement of it, see what oppressions they have eased you off, ney rather have not doubled:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If all proiectors be proclaimed enemies, what makes Sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vane senior in the House of Commons?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be a crime destructive to the Law and liberty of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for persons to be examined from the due course of law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as the Parliament have often declared, against the King, how comes it to passe that Manchester, Clotworthy, VValler, Hollis, and Barwis, and many other accused of Treason and other misde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meanours against the State, are protected by vertue of a never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard of priviledge, and their accusers imprisoned, to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of themselves and families; Oh England, England, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thee, when thy fellow subiects exercise soveraignity, and thou like a silly sheep delights to have it so?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the working the Law like a nose of wax, and making it speake what the designed would have it, be a practice distructive to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100945:4"/>
the law and liberty of the People what are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have been the Votes Orders, and practices of their Committees, who derive a power from the Parliament, &amp; they from the Law, for all their extraiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall practices and illegall proceedings in the examinations censures and sentences passed upon their fellow Commoners, answering all pleas with their power; and silencing all disputes, with this one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, we that are the makers of a Law, are best able to iudge of the sense and and meaning of the Law; and so if they say stealing is but borrowing, drunkennesse is but good fellowship, whoring a trick of youth: treason or breach of trust, but a mistake, or mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; wee are bound to beleeve it because they say so; let igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be the mother of devotion, and then oh brave Lawes, a brave Parliament; such as is the Tree, such will be the fruit, and then far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to liberty, and welcome slavery: stoope, stoope poore England to the yoke of subiection; be a servant to thy servant, and let it be reported in future ages, that thou brokest the bonds of thy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and became a slave to thy equals.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the imposing illegall taxes in the Parliament sense, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to the law and liberty of the People, pray how comes it to passe that so many Ordinances for Tithes of all other, that Anti-christian and soule murthering edict, with many other subiect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Votes; hath within these few yeares passed for currant coyne and good law amongst us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If it be a distructive practice to imprison free men without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment or testimony of fact, committed by three witnesses, which the Law of the Kingdome requires. How comes it to passe that so many faithfull servants of God and the Kingdome, have been so long imprisoned, some a yeere, some two, some more; meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for discharge of their duties to God and the Kingdome; in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the treasons and deceitfull practices of such as endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kingdomes ruine; what makes Lilburne, Overton, Musgrave, Booth, and many more in the Tower, Fleet, Newgate, Gate-house, VVhite-Lyon, every prison having some sufferers for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes cause in it, who are high unto famishing; Oh England England, if thou suffer thy selfe thus to be enslaved by thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, thou wilt prove a bye-word to all Nations, and not deserve the pitty of any: Rouse up thy self, and rush upon thy adversaries; let them know that though thou hast been long patient, yet thou
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100945:4"/>
both darest and knowest how to call them to account for all their actions, let them know that thou art sensible of those vast summes or thy treasure they have received, and shared amongst them, and make them feare and tremble; looke back upon their Declarations, have they not covenanted, and caused you to Covenant, and lift up your hands to the most high God, to preserve the Priviledges of the Parliament, and the Liberties of the People? (not by their Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to destroy your Liberties) To preserve and defend the King in his Person and authority, and not to usurpe his power, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son his Person, to discover and discountenance evill doers, not to protect and defend them, to bring them to alegall tryall as malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not to impower them as Judges of their accusers; have they not declared that this was the ground of their undertaking, and that the Reformation of the Church, and preservation of the Law, (viz,) mercy and truth, Justice and Judgement, was the onely thing they aimed at; having resolved never to lay down armes till this was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, with many heavy imprecations, desiring the Lord no longer to continue his blessing upon them, then they designed his glory and the good of this poore Kingdome; now Country-men and fellow Souldiers see whether the Lord hath not iustly weighed them in his Ballance; see if he hath not met with them in their secret iniquity; they trusted in their wisdome, and it turned to foolishnesse; they boasted in their strength and confederacy; but the Horses of Aegypt are flesh and not spirit; their confidence shall prove a snare, and the pit they digged for others they will fall into themselves; they have ceased to doe what was pleasing to the Lord; they sought themselves and forgot the holy one of Israell.</p>
            <p>In the time of their necessity they promised faire, but having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their ends as they vainly Imagine the case is altered: See the fore-mentioned Declaration.</p>
            <p>Although every man is to hope for the principall reward of his service from God, who rewards every one according to his workes, yet wee find our selves bound in conscience and equity to declare, that besides those who have the publicke faith engaged to them for their security, such as since the beginning have done valliantly, and dealt faithfully in the cause, and such as have chosen rather to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the spoyling of their goods, then to assist the Enemy, or to take armes against their Religion and Country, and shall continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
