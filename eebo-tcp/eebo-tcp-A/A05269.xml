            <title>The copie of a letter sent out of England to Don Bernardin Mendoza ambassadour in France for the King of Spaine declaring the state of England, contrary to the opinion of Don Bernardin, and of all his partizans Spaniardes and others. This letter, although it was sent to Don Bernardin Mendoza, yet, by good hap, the copies therof aswell in English as in French, were found in the chamber of one Richard Leigh a seminarie priest, who was lately executed for high treason committed in the time that the Spanish Armada was on the seas. Whereunto are adioyned certaine late aduertisements, concerning the losses and distresses happened to the Spanish nauie, aswell in fight with the English nauie in the narrow seas of England, as also by tempests, and contrarie winds, vpon the west, and north coasts of Ireland, in their returne from the northerne isles beyond Scotland.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord Ambassadour, though at the
time of my last large writing to you of
the state of this countrey, &amp; of our long
desired expectation of succours promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
I did not thinke to haue had such a
sorrowfull occasion of any second wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as nowe I haue of a lamentable
change of matters of estate here: yet I
can not forbeare (though it be with as
many sighs as liues) to aduertise you of the truth of our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition, as now to me &amp; others of our partie the same
appeareth to be: that by comparing of all things past in hope,
with the present nowe in despaire, your L. who haue had the
principall managing hitherto of all our causes of long time
both here &amp; there in France, betwixt the King Catholique as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
with the Potentates of the holy League, &amp; all our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen
which haue professed obedience to the Church of Rome,
may now fall into some new &amp; better consideration, how our
state both for our selues at home, and our brethren abroade,
now at this present fallen (as it were) into vtter despaire, may
be reuiued &amp; restored to some new hope, with better assurance
of successe then hath happened hitherto.<note place="margin">In what termes England stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Catholiques.</note> For which purpose I
haue thought it necessary to aduertise you in what termes this
countrey now standeth, farre otherwise then of late, both we
at home, and others abroad did make accompt of.</p>
                  <p>You know how we haue depended in firme hope of a change
of the state of this countrey by the meanes of the deuout and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8852:3"/>
earnest incitations of the <hi>Popes holines,</hi> and the <hi>King Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi>
and of other <hi>Potentates</hi> of the <hi>holy League,</hi> to take vpon
them the Inuasion and conquest of this Realme: and by your
assurances, and firme promises, we were now of a long season
past perswaded, that the <hi>King Catholique</hi> had taken vpon him
the same glorious Act, and thereof from yeare to yeare we loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for the execution: being continually fed and nourished
from you to continue our hope, and sundrie times solicited by
your earnest requests, and perswasions, to encourage our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
at home not to wauer, as many were disposed, by sight of
continuall delaies, but to be ready to ioyne with the outward
forces that should come for this Inuasion. Neuerthelesse the
delayes and prolongations of times appointed for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the Kings forces, specially by Sea, haue bene so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
as vntill this last Spring, we were in despaire: at what
time you aduertised vs with great assurance that al the Kings
preparations,<note place="margin">The Spanish preparation three yeeres in making.</note> which had bene in making readie these thrée
or foure yeares together, were now in full perfection, and
without faile would this Sommer come into our Seas with
such mightie strength, as no Nauie of England, or of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
could resist or abide their force: and for more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and for auoiding of all doubts, to make the intended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
sure, the same should also haue ioyned to it, the mightie
Army which the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had made readie,<note place="margin">The Duke of Parmas army in Flaunders.</note> and kept in
readinesse in the low countries all this yeare past, wherewith
he should land, and so both by Sea and land, this Realme
should be inuaded, and a spéedie conquest made thereof, to the
which were alwaies added sundry reasons: whereupon was
gathered,<note place="margin">No forreine force coulde inuade Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, without a strong party in England.</note> that neither by sea, nor by land, there would be any
great resistance found here, but a strong party in this Realme
to ioyne with the forreine force. For otherwise then with such
helps, to be assuredly had from hence, I know, it was alwaies
doubted that no forreine force could preuaile against this<note place="margin">Hope of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Army with assistance of a partie in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land this Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note>
realme, being (as it is) enuironed by sea, and notably repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with more mightie and stronger people then any country
in Christendome. But with the hope of the landing of these
great Armies and our assistance in taking part, we here conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8852:3"/>
all this yeare past in assured hope of a full victorie, vntill
this last moneth. But alas and with a deadly sorrow, we must
all at home, and abroad, lament our sudden fall, from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable
high ioy, to an vnmeasurable déepe despaire, and
that so hastilie fallen out, as I may say, we haue séene in the
space of eight or nine dayes in this last moneth of Iuly,<note place="margin">All Spanishe hope fallen in nine daies.</note> which
was from the apparance of the Catholique great Nauie vpon
the coast of England, vntill it was forced to flie from the coast
of Flanders neare <hi>Callice,</hi> towardes the vnknowen parts of
the cold North, all our hopes, all our buildings, as it now
appeareth but vpon an imagined conquest, vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
and as it were with an earthquake, all our castles of
comfort brought to the ground, which now (it séemeth) were
builded but in the aire, or vpon waues of the sea, for they are
all perished, all vanished away from our thoughtes.</p>
                  <p>And here with I am astonished what I may best thinke of
such a worke so long time in framing, to be so suddenly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
as by no reason could procéed of man, or of any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power,<note place="margin">The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques doubt, of their cause seeing the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> but only of God. And if so it be (as no body can other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
impute this late change &amp; fall from our expected fortune,
but to God almighty) then surely our case is either dangerous
or doubtfull how to iudge thereof, whether we haue bene these
many yeares in the right or not. For I do find, and know, that
many good, and wise men, which of long time haue secretly
continued in most earnest deuotion to the Popes authoritie,<note place="margin">Many English Catholiques mislike of the Popes refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by force.</note>
begin now to stagger in their mindes, and to conceiue that this
way of reformation intended by the Popes holines is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
in the sight of God, by leauing the auncient course of
the Church by <hi>Excommunication,</hi> which was the exercise of
the spirituall sword, and in place thereof to take the temporall
sword, and put it into a Monarches hand to inuade this realme
with force and Armes, yea to destroy the Quéene thereof, and
all her people addicted to her: which are in very truth now
féene, by great proofe this yeare, to be in a sort infinite, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible,
so as some begin to say that this purpose by violence,
by blood, by slaughter, &amp; by conquest, agréeth not with Christes
doctrine, nor the doctrine of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> or <hi>S. Paule.</hi> And to tell your
<pb facs="tcp:8852:4"/>
Lordship truly, I finde presently a great number of wise and
deuout people, though they continue in their former religion,
yet do they secretely condemne this intended reformation by
blood and force. Insomuch that I heard a good diuine alledge a
textout of <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> in these words, <hi>Quid de Episcopis qui ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beribus
timeri volunt Canones dicunt benè paternitas vestra nouit,
pastores sumus no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> percussores. Noua enim est predicatio quae verbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus
exigit fidem.</hi> This sentence I obtained of him, because it
séemeth to be charitably written. But leauing this authoritie
among Doctors, I must néedes say that in very trueth no one
thing hath done at this time more hurt to the action, then the
vntimely hasty publishing abroad in this Realme before this
Armie of Spaine was readie to come foorth to the seas,<note place="margin">The vntimely publishing of the intended conquest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish nauy was redy, did great hurt.</note> of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
things written and put in Print, &amp; sent into this realme,
to notifie to the people, that all the Realme should be inuaded
and conquered, that the Quéene should be destroied, al the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
&amp; men of reputation, of honour, and wealth that did
obey her, and would defend her, or that would withstand the
Inuasion, should be with all their families rooted out, and their
places,<note place="margin">The heartes of all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enflamed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards vaunting to conquer the land.</note> their honours, their houses and landes bestowed vpon
the conquerers: things vniuersally so odiously taken, as the
harts of all sorts of people were enflamed: some with ire, some
with feare, but all sortes almost, without exception, resolued
to venture their liues for the withstanding of all maner of
conquest, wherewith euery body can say this Realme was not
threatned these fiue hundreth yeares and more.</p>
                  <p>These reports were brought to this realme with good credit,
not in secret but in publique writings &amp; printings, and tooke
déepe roote in all kind of people of this land, and in déede was of
the more credit,<note place="margin">The vntimely publication of the Popes Bull did hurt to the common cause.</note> first by reason of a new <hi>Bull</hi> lately published
at Rome by the Popes holines, which I haue séene, with
more seueritie then other of his predecessours, whereby the
Quéene here was accursed, and pronounced to be depriued of
her Crowne &amp; the Inuasion, and conquest of the Realme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the <hi>Pope,</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>King Catholique,</hi> to execute the same
with his armies both by sea and land, and to take the Crowne
to him selfe, or to limit it to such a <hi>Potentate</hi> as the <hi>Pope</hi> &amp; he
<pb facs="tcp:8852:4"/>
should name. And secondly, there followed a large explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Bull, by sending hither a number of English bookes
printed in <hi>Antwerp</hi> euen when the Nauy of Spaine was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
looked for, the originall whereof was written by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
father <hi>Cardinall Allen</hi> in Aprill last,<note place="margin">Cardinall Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens bookes haue done much hurt to the intended inuasion and conquest.</note> called in his owne
writing the <hi>Cardinall of England,</hi> which booke was so violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
sharply, and bitterly written, yea (say the Aduersaries) so
arrogantly, falsly, and slaunderously, against the person of the
Quéene, against her father King Henrie the eight, against all
her Nobilitie and Counsell, as in very truth I was heartily
sory to perceiue so many good men of our owne religion offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
therewith, in that there should be found in one accompted
a father of the Church, who was also a borne subiect of this
crowne (though by the Aduersaries reported to be very basely

of the whole people of his owne nation.</p>

of these vnordinate and vnaduised procéedings of this
Cardinall, of whose rash choise to such a place, the world spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
strangely, as though he came to it through corruption of
the Popes sister, without liking of the Colledge of Cardinals,

the desire also of the said Cardinall, might without such fatall

and conquests by the Catholique Kings noble forces, haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

                  <p>There was also to adde the more credite to these terrible
prognostications,<note place="margin">The multitude of bookes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to shewe the greatnes of the Spanishe Nauy, did also hurt</note> such kind of other bookes printed in Spaine

of the <hi>Leuant,</hi> with a masse of all kinde of prouisions, beyond
measure, for the said <hi>Armadas,</hi> sufficient in estimation, to be
able to make conquest of many kingdomes or countries. And
one great Argument is published by the Aduersaries to stirre
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8852:5"/>
vp the mindes of the Nobilitie of England against the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
which is very maliciously inuented, to shew the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the conquest, not only of England, but of the whole Isle
of Britaine: mouing all men specially to marke by the descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the <hi>Armada,</hi> that there are specially named such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Noblemen, as <hi>Princes, Marquises, Condes</hi> and <hi>Dons,</hi>
that are called <hi>Aduenturers,</hi> without any office or pay, &amp; such
another number also of men with great titles of honour, and
many of them named Captaines and <hi>Alferez,</hi> without office,
but yet in <hi>sold,</hi> and therefore called <hi>Entertenidos,</hi> as all those
being for no seruice in the <hi>Armada</hi> may be wel presumed (say
they) to haue come to haue possessed the roomes of all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
in England, and Scotland: and this fiction hath taken
more place then it is worth. And though these armies were in
déede excéeding great and mightie, yet they were so amplified
beyond all measure in these bookes, as in no preparation of
Christendome in former times against the <hi>Sarracins</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi>
could be greater.<note place="margin">The forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges of the Armadas great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes caused the Queene to put all her Realme in force beyond all former.</note> By this meanes this Queene and her realme,

deuoted to her, but throughly irritated, to stirre vp
their whole forces for their defence, against such prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
conquests, as in a very short time all her whole Realme
and euery corner were spéedily furnished with armed people
on horsebacke, and on foote, and those continually trained, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised,
and put into Bands, in warlike maner, as in no age
euer was before in this Realme. Here was no sparing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to prouide, horse, armour, weapon, powder, and all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
no not want of prouision of Pioners, carriages, and
victuals in euery Countie of the realme, without exception, to
attend vpon the Armies. And to this generall furniture euery
man voluntarily offered, very many their seruice personally
without wages, others money for armour and weapons, and
to wage souldiers, a matter strange and neuer the like heard
of in this realme or else where: And this general reason moued
all men to large contributions, that to withstand a Conquest
where all should be lost, there was no time to spare a portion.</p>

The numbers made ready in the Realme I cannot affirme
of mine owne knowledge, but I haue heard it reported, when
I was gréeued to thinke the same to be so true, that there was
through England no quarter <hi>East, West, North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Armies made readie Nauie England in euery quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the realme.</note> but
all concurred in one mynde to be in readines to serue for the

Armie of twentie thousand men fit to fight, and fiftéene
thousand of them well armed &amp; weaponed: and in some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
the number of fortie thousand able men.</p>

with their Hauens were well described vnto you in perfect
Plots, when <hi>Francis Throgmorton,</hi> first did treat with your
Lordship about the same) were so furnished of men of warre,
both of themselues, &amp; with resort of aide from their next shires,
as there was no place to be doubted for landing of any forrein
forces, but there were within eight and fortie houres to come
to the place aboue twentie thousand fighting me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on horsebacke
and on foote, with field ordinance, victuals, pioners and caria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and all those gouerned by the principal Noble men of the
Countries and reduced vnder Captaines of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>And one thing I heard of, that was very politikely ordered
and executed at this time, as of many late yeares was not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
that as the Leaders &amp; officers of the particuler Ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds were
men of experience in the warres: so to make the Bands strong
and constant,<note place="margin">All the bands were vnder the principal Knights of the realme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the most migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie men being their tenants and seruants.</note> choise was made of the principall Knights of all
Countries to bring their renantes to the field, being men of
strength, &amp; landed, &amp; of wealth: whereby all the forces of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
were of a resolute disposition to sticke to their Lords
and Chieftaines, &amp; the Chieftaines to trust to their owne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.
And to remember one stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge spéech that I heard spoken
may be marueiled at, but it was auowed to me for a truth,
that one Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Kent</hi> had a Band of one hundred &amp; fiftie
footmen,<note place="margin">A strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the wealth of a band of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> which were worth in goods aboue one hundred &amp; fiftie

fight stoutely before they would haue lost their goods, and by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8852:6"/>
likelihood at this time, many other Bands were made of such
principall men, both of wealth and strength. Of these thinges
I am sory to haue cause to write in this sort: because you may
see how heretofore you haue bene deceiued with aduertiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of many, which had no proofe to know the truth thereof, and so
I confesse my selfe in some thinges to haue erred, namely, in
imagining that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer any forreine power should be séene
ready to land in any part of this Realme, there would haue
bene found but a small number resolute to withstand the same,
or to defend the Quéene, but that the same would haue bene
very vnable for the warres, vntrained, raw, and ignorant in
all warlike actions, without sufficient armour and weapons:
and that also the Noble men and Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that were in this
Realme of our Religion, whereof, you know, we made acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt
when you were here in England of very many,<note place="margin">An error of the Catholique fu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gitives in the number of their partners in Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land.</note> although ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

so many tens, as we accompted hundreds, whom we thought
would haue shewed them selues like men of courage for our
common cause, and would haue sodenly surprised the houses,
families, and strength of the heretiques and aduersaries.</p>
                  <p>But now, such is our calamitie, that it hath pleased God, as
I thinke for our sinnes, or els for confounding of our bold opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and presumptions of our owne strength, to put in the
hearts of all persons here one like mynde, &amp; courage to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the intended Inuasion, as well in such as we accompted
Catholiques, as also in the Heretiques: so as it hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
manifestly that for all earnest procéeding for arming, and
for contributions of money, and for all other warlike actions,
there was no difference to be séene betwixt the Catholique, and
the heretique.<note place="margin">A consent and concurrencie of Papistes and Protestants to withstand the conquest.</note> But in this case to withstand the threatned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
yea to defend the person of the Quéene, there appeared
such a sympathie, concourse, and consent of all sortes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
without respect of Religion, as they all appeared to be
ready to fight against all strangers, as it were with one heart
and one body. And though some few principall Gentlemen,
of whom heretofore you haue had the names in such Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
of Catholiques as you haue bene acquainted withall,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8852:6"/>
werelately vpon the report of the comming out of the Armie
to the seas, sent to the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi> there to remaine restrained
of their former libertie during the expectation of this intended
Inuasion: yet it hath appeared, that they were not so restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for any doubt that they would with their powers haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
our Army, but onely thereby to make it knowen to all
our friends and countrimen in Spaine, and Flaunders, yea
euen to your selfe (for so I heard it spoken, as accompting you
to haue bene the most principall Author and perswader of this
action) that there should be no hope to haue any of them, or of
their fréends, to assist these great Armies. And in very truth,
I see now whosoeuer of our fréends in Spaine or in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or els where, made any such accompt of any aide against
the Quéene, or against her partie here, they should haue bene
deceaued if the Army had offered to haue landed.<note place="margin">The gentlemen Recusants in Elie offer to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture then liues against all inuasions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, without respect of Pope or other poten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tate.</note> For I my
selfe haue heard that the best of those that were sent to <hi>Elie</hi> did
make offers, yea by their letters to the Counsell here, signed
with their hands, that they would aduenture their liues in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Quéene, whom they named their vndoubted <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Lady</hi> and <hi>Queene,</hi> against all forrein forces, though the
same were sent from the Pope or by his commandement: Yea
diuers of them did offer that in this quarell of inuading of the
Realme with strangers, they would present their owne bodies
in the formost rankes with their countrie men against all
strangers. Whereupon I heard also by a secrete friende of
mine in the Court, that it was once in some towardnes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
amongst the Counsellers, that they should haue bene
returned and put to their former libertie. But the heate of the
warre being kindled with the knowledge of the Kings <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada,</hi>
being at that time come to the <hi>Groigne,</hi> and the Duke
of <hi>Parmas</hi> readines with so great an Armie and shipping in
Flaunders, daily looked for to land in England, yea to come
to London, and a generall murmur of the people against all
such <hi>Recusants</hi> of reputation, was the cause of the staying of
these Gentlemen at <hi>Elie,</hi> notwithstanding their offers of their
seruice to the Quéene: and so they doe remaine in the Bishops
pallace there, with fruition of large walkes about the same,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8852:7"/>
altogether without any imprisonment, other then that they
are not suffred to depart into the towne, or countrey: and yet
for their religion,<note place="margin">The Recusants are not put in danger of their liues for their religion, but are fined at summes of money.</note> I thinke surely they doe, and will, remaine
constant to the obedience of the Church of Rome: for the which
neuerthelesse they are not impeached to any danger of their
liues, but only charged with a penalty of money, because they
will not come to the Churches: whereby, by the law, a portion
of their Reuenue is alotted to the Quéene, and the rest left to
the maintenance of them, their wiues, and children.</p>
                  <p>By which kind of procéedings our Aduersaries here do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that both these Gentlemen, and all other of their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are fauourably vsed, that they are not pursued to death for
their religion, as they say it was vsed in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time,
and as it is daily vsed (as they say) most rigorously and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
in Spaine against the Englishmen that come thither,
onely in trade of marchandise. And yet I and others some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
priuately speaking with such our Aduersaries, as wée
thinke are not maliciously bent to haue men prosecuted to
death only for their Religion (for to say the truth, and as the
prouerbe is, not to belie the Diuel, very many of our Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are in that point not vncharitable) we doe obiect to them
the executions by cruell torments &amp; deaths of very many, both
here about London, and other parts of the Realme, whom we
accompt as Martirs, in that they do witnes by their death their
obedience to the Pope, and the Catholique Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>To which, these our Aduersaries prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding some small drops<note place="margin">The Iesuits are not executed for religion but for treasons.</note>
of charity do answere vs: that no execution hath bene of any, to
their knowledge, for their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or for profession thereof: but
for that they which haue bene executed, haue bene found to
haue wandred in the Realme secretly, &amp; in a disguised maner,<note place="margin">The Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the most part come dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised like Ruffians.</note>
which the Aduersaries scornfully terme as Ruffians, with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and all ornaments of light coloured apparell, like to the
fashion of Courtiers, and doe vse many meanes to entice all
people, with whom they dare aduenture to speake, not onely
to be reconciled to the Pope, and Church of Rome, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them by vowes and othes to renounce, their obedience to
the Quéene: to deny her to be their soueraigne: and themselues
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8852:7"/>
to be discharged of their Alleageance: and to repute all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
vnder her to be vnlawfull, and in conscience not to be
obeyed: with many moe such matters (which I neuerthelesse
count to be very vaine calumniations) tending to make the
facts of all such holy Priests as are sent with Commission to
winne mens soules to be direct treasons against the Quéene,
and the state of the Realme.</p>
                  <p>These Defenders of these iudgements and executions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
and do most earnestly maintaine, that all such Priests,
Iesuites, Seminaries and others, so perswading the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Quéene, the Lawes, the Gouernment, and state of
the Realme, and all others that are so perswaded by them, are
manifest traitors: and so they say that their enditements, and
all proces of law extended and pursued against them, doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
declare the same. Wherein, these our Aduersaries do
sometimes for maintenance of their arguments, shew the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
copies of their enditements and iugdements, wherin there
is no mention made of charging them with their religion, but
that they haue attempted to perswade the Quéenes subiects to
forsake their Allegeance, and consequently to be Rebels to
their Quéene and Soueraigne.</p>
                  <p>In this sort these men for their aduantage, doe at all times,
with these and many like earnest arguments maintaine their
procéedings against the holy Priests &amp; Iesuites, that haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
death for their conscience, as iust &amp; necessary. And though,
where I and others may reply without perill to our selues (as
surely in some small companies we may vsing modest words)
we obiect the confession of the Catholique faith by the parties
at their death, and that with great constancie, which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries
cannot denie,<note place="margin">Babington suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for his treasons volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed, not for religion: though at his death hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane religion.</note> so as it may seeme they die for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
yet is it on the other part against vs alleaged, &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that they are neither indited, condemned, nor executed
for their religion, or for offering of them selues to die for their
religion, but onely for their former treasons in conspiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Quéene, and state of the Realme: no otherwise
then of late time <hi>Babington</hi> and all his Complices, who were
condemned for their attempt to haue raised warre in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8852:8"/>
Realme, and to haue murdered the Quéene, and to haue set vp
the Quéene of Scots, all which the said <hi>Babington</hi> and all his
complices voluntarily confessed, and were codemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
onely for those their great treasons: and yet diuers of
them at the place of their execution, did in like maner (as these
Priests and Iesuites vse to doe) make confession of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
faith, with offer to die for the same: and yet (say our
Aduersaries) it ought not to be affirmed, that <hi>Babington</hi> and
his complices were put to death for religion, but for their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p>And for further maintenance of the coloured arguments,
wherewith I, and others my good, faithfull, and Catholique
brethren are often troubled how to answere them, it is allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that the great number of gentlemen, &amp; gentlewomen, yea
some of honourable calling,<note place="margin">A multitude of gentlemen su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected to be Papists, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer indangered of their liues.</note> and of other meaner degrées, are
knowne manifestly to be of a contrary religion to the lawes
of the Realme, both néere the Court and farre of, and yet they
are neuer pursued by any fourme of law to put their liues in
danger, or questioned, or imprisoned, for their opinions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
whereby to bring them in any danger. Onely such as
are presented or complained of by the parishioners where they
dwell, for neuer comming to any Church by the space of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
moneths in a whole yeare, are therof endited, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
being called to answere thereto, if they can shew no such
lawfull excuse as the law hath prouided, they are then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to pay a penaltie out of their goods and lands, if they
haue any, and not otherwise punished, nor yet by inquisition
any of them examined of their faith. But yet say these defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
if they shew them selues by their open déeds and facts to
be reconciled from their Alleageance and obedience to the
Quéene, and that they will therein persist, then they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
charged and punished according to the lawes therefore
prouided.</p>
                  <p>These arguments in their defence I doe not repeate as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but yet surely they do moue me, &amp; some others
that are wise, to thinke, that indéed the rashnes of diuers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
secretely into the Realme, &amp; professing themselues to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8852:8"/>
Priestes,<note place="margin">Many of the Priests that are sent into the realm, are yong, rash, &amp; of leude life.</note> many of them being both very young, vnlearned,
and of light behauiour, hath done great harme to the goodnesse

temperately and secretly instructed the people, and vsed more
circumspection in their owne liuing &amp; behauiour, there would
haue bene a greater increase of numbers perswaded in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

with our countrimen, that haue accesse vnto you, and

more care and choice be had of such English men as are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

that hath more boldnesse, then learning and temperance, for

                  <p>In the former part of this my declaration to you of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall

the Realme,<note place="margin">A great stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the English Nauie, by the Shippes of the port townes that did serue without wages.</note> I forgot to report vnto you the great numbers of
Ships of the subiectes of the Realme: as of London and other
port townes, and cities, that voluntarily this yeare were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
able to make a full Nauie of themselues for an armie, &amp;
all at the proper costes of the Burgesses, for certain moneths,
with men, victuall, and munition, which did ioyne with the
Quéenes owne Nauie all this Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a thing neuer in any
former age heard of, otherwise then that such ships were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
hired, waged, &amp; victualled by the Kings of the Realme,
which argued to the griefe of me and some others a most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and vnaccustomed affection &amp; deuotion in the Cities and
port townes, such, as they shewed them selues therein ready
to fight, as it had bene, <hi>pro aris &amp; focis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the number and strength of the Quéenes owne ships of
warre, I thinke you haue bene sufficiently enfourmed many
times heretofore. But yet I will make you a true report of
the state of them this present Sommer, what I haue credibly
heard thereof: because I haue bene very sory to heare how
you &amp; others haue bene therein abused: and that not onely in
this matter of the Quéenes ships, but in some other things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8852:9"/>
of late, whereof some part hath bene here by very many,
maliciously, and in common spéeches, imputed to your owne
inuention and publication: whereof in a few wordes I will
make some digression before I shall shewe the estate of the
Quéenes Nauie.</p>
                  <p>In this Sommer past there was Printed in <hi>Paris,</hi> by your
direction (as it was reported) a notable vntruth,<note place="margin">Two notable lies printed in Paris, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Don Bernardin Mendoza.</note> which I did
sée, &amp; reade: that the King of Scots had besieged <hi>Barwicke,</hi> and
had won it by assault, and possessed it quietly: whereof no part
was true, nor any cause to imagine the same, though I wish it
had so bene: but not for any good will that I now beare to that
King, but for the trouble to this Quéene. For in truth there is
no good for vs to be hoped for from the King of Scots, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Scottish Bishops in <hi>France</hi> haue sought to make you
beléeue otherwise, who is so rooted in the <hi>Caluinists</hi> Religion,
as there is neuer hope that he can be recouered to the church of
Rome: and so I thinke you are of late duely enfourmed, and by
his violent actions against diuers Catholiques, &amp; against all
that fauour the Spaniards, may certainly appeare.</p>
                  <p>And likewise another great vntruth was lately Printed
(as your enemies say) by your direction also in <hi>Paris,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest lie printed in Paris, of a Spanish victory when it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together an English victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> that

into the bottome of the Seas, and that all the rest were driuen
to flie with the Uice admirall <hi>Frances Drake.</hi> Upon these two

facts reported vntruly, and bringeth the Authours to discredit

haue procéeded from you in France, that hath caused a great
misliking of you in Scotland: which is, that you should in open
assembly, and in a brauery say, that the young King of Scots
(whom you called in your language a boy) had deceiued the
King your master: but if the Kings Nauy might prosper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
England, the King of Scots should loose his Crowne:
and of this the King of Scots hath bene aduertised out of
France, and vseth very euill language of you, which I will
not report.</p>
                  <p>But now to leaue this digression, and to returne to let you
know the truth of the state of the Quéens Nauy this Sommer.<note place="margin">The state of the Nauie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land this Sommer.</note>
The same was in the beginning of the yeare, when the brute
was brought of the readines of the Kings <hi>Armada</hi> in <hi>Lisbone,</hi>
and of the Army by land vpon the Sea coasts in <hi>Flanders</hi> with
their shipping, deuided into thrée companies: the greatest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the charge of <hi>Charles L. Haward</hi> high Admirall of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,<note place="margin">L. Haward, L, Admirall.</note>
whose father, grandfather, vncles, great vncles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of his house, being of the noble house of the Dukes of
<hi>Norfolke,</hi> had also bene high Admirals afore him, wherof both
France and Scotland haue had proofe.</p>
                  <p>An other company were appointed to remaine with the L.
<hi>Henry Seymour</hi> second son to the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> that was
Protector in King Edwards time,<note place="margin">L. Henry Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</note> &amp; brother to the now Earle
of <hi>Hartfort:</hi> and these companies for a time continued in the
Narrow seas betwixt England and Flanders, vnder the
charge of the said high Admirall, to attend on the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
Actions.</p>
                  <p>A third company were armed in the West part of England
towards Spaine,<note place="margin">Sir Francis Drake.</note> vnder the conduct of Sir <hi>Francis Drake:</hi> a
man by name and fame knowne too too well to all Spaine, and
to the Kings Indias, and of great reputation in England: and
this was compounded, partly of some of the Quéenes owne
ships, and partly of the ships of the West parts.</p>
                  <p>But after that it was certainely vnderstood, that the great
Nauy of Spaine was ready to come out from <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8852:10"/>
that the fame therof was blowne abroad in Christendome to
be inuincible, and so published by bookes in print, the Quéene
and all her Counsel I am sure (whatsoeuer good countenance
they made) were not a little perplexed, as looking certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for a daungerous fight vpon the Seas, and after that for a
landing and Inuasion. Whereupon the Lord Admirall was
commaunded to saile with the greatest ships, to the West of
England towardes Spaine to ioyne with <hi>Drake,</hi> whom he
made Viceadmiral, &amp; to continue in the seas betwixt France
and England to stop the landing of the Nauy of Spaine. And
with the Lord Admirall went in certaine of the Quéens ships,
the Lord <hi>Thomas Haward</hi> second sonne to the last Duke of
<hi>Norfolke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L. Tho. Haward L. Sheffeld.</note> and the Lord <hi>Sheffeld,</hi> sonne to the Admirals sister,
who is wife to the Quéenes Ambassadour in France, with a
great number of Knights of great liuelode: And at that time
the Lord <hi>Henry Seymour</hi> was left with a good number of
ships in the narrow Seas, vpon the coast of Flaunders to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
on the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilest these two Nauies were thus diuided, I confesse to
you that I and others of our part, secretely made full accompt
that none of all these English ships durst abide the sight of the
<hi>Armada</hi> of <hi>Spaine:</hi> or if they would abide any fight, yet they
should all be sonke at the first encounter. For such constant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
we had conceiued by the reports of the world, that the
greatnes &amp; number of the ships, and the Army of Spaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chosen vessels of all the Kings Dominions, was so ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue
monstrous, beyond all the Nauies that euer had bene
seene in Christendome (not excepting the <hi>Armada</hi> at <hi>Lepanto</hi>)
that no power could abide in their way. But how farre decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
we were therein, a very short time, euen the first day, did
manifestly, to the great dishonour of Spaine, discouer. For
when the Catholique Armie came to the coast of England,
which in déede the English confesse did séeme farre greater
then they looked for, and that they were astonied with the sight
of them:<note place="margin">The fight of the English Nauie with the Spanish.</note> yet the Lord <hi>Admiral</hi> &amp; <hi>Drake,</hi> hauing but onely fifty
of the English ships out of the Hauen of <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> where
the rest remained for a new reuictualling, without tarying for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8852:10"/>
the rest of the Nauie that was in <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> they did offer
present fight, &amp; furiously pursued the whole Nauie of Spaine,
being aboue 160. ships: so as the same, with the furious and
continuall shot of the English one whole day, fled without
any returning.<note place="margin">The flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Nauie.</note> And after, the English Nauy being encreased
to an hundred great and smal, renued their fight with terrible
great shot all the whole day, gaining alwayes the wind of the
Spanish Nauy. And as I am sory to remember the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
which the English haue largely written to their owne
prayse: so to speake all in one word, for nine dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they still forced them to flie, and destroyed, sonke, and
tooke in thrée dayes fight, diuers of the greatest shippes: out of
which, specially out of the principall great ship of <hi>Andaluzia,</hi>
and out of the <hi>Admiranta</hi> of <hi>Guipusque,</hi> and thirdly out of the
principall great <hi>Galliasse</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> great numbers were
brought (beside many moe killed and drowned) to London,
and to sundry other portes of the Realme, to the great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Spaine: amongst which prisoners were a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Captaines both for land and sea. And besides that, which
déepely blemisheth the honour of Spaine, and vexeth me at my
heart, to consider the inequalitie of fortune, it is vaunted by
our Aduersaries, that in all the time of these fightes so many
dayes,<note place="margin">The Spaniards prisoners say, that Christ shewed himself a Lutheran in this Sommer voiage of the Spanish Nauie.</note> the Spaniards did neuer take, or sink, any English ship
or boate, or breake any mast, or tooke any one man prisoner. A
matter that in déede these Spaniards which are taken do mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile
at greatly, and chafe thereat: so as some of them in their
anguish of minde let not to say, that in all these fightes Christ
shewed himselfe a <hi>Lutheran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though such spéeches be vnaduised, and not to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
yet surely it is most manifest, that in all this voiage from
the comming of the Nauie out of <hi>Lisbon</hi> euen to this houre,<note place="margin">God shewed no sauour to the Spanishe Nauy from the beginning to the ending.</note>
God did shew no fauour to ours any one day, as he did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to these <hi>Lutherans:</hi> which, percase, may be done for our
good, to correct vs as putting our trust wholy in our worldly
strength, &amp; to the confusion hereafter of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> by puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
them vp, being his enemies, with prosperitie for a time, to
be afterwardes the cause of their ruine. And amongest other
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8852:11"/>
things reported to the dishonour of the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> who,
it is said, was lodged in the bottome of his ship for his safetie,
and to a great touch to the Commanders of the Spanish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
that they neuer would turne their ships, nor stay them, to
defend any of their owne shippes that were forced to tary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
but suffred diuers to perish, as are good witnesses thereof
the thrée great vessels.<note place="margin">Don Pedro de Valdez, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Generall of the Armada of Andaluzia. Hugo de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cada, Generall of the Gallias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Naples.</note> One wherein <hi>Don Pedro de Valdez</hi>
was taken: an other <hi>Galleon</hi> of <hi>Guipusque</hi> that was spoiled
with fire: and the noble <hi>Galliasse</hi> wherein <hi>Hugo de Moncada</hi>
was slaine: of which lacke of care by the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi>
these Spaniards that are taken giue very euill report. The
like is said in <hi>Zeland</hi> by the Spaniards there, that were saued
with <hi>Diego de Pimentelli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diego de Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentelli Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Galleon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</note> though the <hi>Galleon</hi> wherin he was,
being beaten with the English shot, and not succoured by the

and so also did another likewise perish for lacke of succour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Ostend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I must néedes thinke that you are stricken with
some griefe of mind, or rather with some anger towards me, to
heare from me so much of those aduerse things, although they
are too true: and therfore I also imagine you may be disirous,
for your better contentation, to vnderstand what opinions we
that are here haue, being thus frustrate of our expected deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie,
by the defeat of this enterprise: whether we do comfort
our selues with a conceit that this Action may be, by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie,
once againe renued this next yeare, for the recouerie
of our lost hope this yeare, famously spoken of by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of
88. and so verified to the losse of al Catholiuqes.<note place="margin">A considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what may be done the next yeare to renew this Action.</note> Wherin sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for our owne parts, as by secret conference I find with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
with whom I haue secretely of late upon this vnfortunate
accident conferred, we can not iudge of any likelihood of good
successe for any long time: and if there should any be hoped
for, surely the Sea-forces of the King Catholique, must of
necessitie be more increased, and better also gouerned then
they were this yeare. For this we here doe consider that this
enterprise of Inuasion and Conquest, was alwaies principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
grounded vpon many probable opinions of the euill state
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8852:11"/>
of the Realme.</p>
                  <p>First of the weaknes of the English Nauie: for so you know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
you were diuers waies this last yeare aduertised from hence,<note place="margin">The 3. hopes conceiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, are nowe all frustrated.</note>
and so also many of vs here did conceiue the same: wherein we
see by all this yeares seruice with these ships, we did all nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
erre.</p>
                  <p>Next, of a supposed euill contentment of a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in this land to serue the Queene, and her Gouernment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her enemies.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, and most principally, of a great strong partie that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
would be found here in the fauour of vs for the Catholique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that should take armes against the Queene vpon the
first sight of the Catholique Nauie on the coasts of England.
Of all which opinions, setled in good mens minds in maner of
iudgements, we know that none in the world did more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
assure the King thereof then you: which, as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
haue euil succeeded, may, I feare, bring you in danger of
his indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although I know you meant very wel therin.</p>
                  <p>And as these three opinions haue all failed this yeare, so I
assure you, though some of ours on that side y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seas may persist
in their former opinions against the experience lately seen (as
it is likely they may be forced to do, to maintaine them selues
in credit, for continuing their necessary relief from the Pope,
and the King, hauing no other means to keepe them from ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
or begging) yet because I would not haue you further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by them, who haue not bene present in the Realme to
see such contrary proofs against all their conceits, as I and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue done: I will shew you a great number of manifest
Arguments, though I am sory at my heart to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber them,
whereby you in your wisedome (if you be not blinded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
shall see it most certaine, that these former opinions, for
comfort to be had from hence, will proue the next yeare as
strong against vs, and in some part more strong then they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
this yeare, if any accompt should be made thereof.</p>
                  <p>First, for the Nauy of England, which hath this yere to the
sight of the world proued to be of great force &amp; value, for those
Seas, and able to ouermatch in their maner of fight, double to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8852:12"/>
their number, of the great <hi>Gallions, Carikes, Galliasses,</hi> or <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
it is certaine that it will be greatly increased this next
yeare. For I know, that within these few dayes, bargaines
are already made, &amp; Imprest of money deliuered, and certaine
sent into the <hi>Estlands,</hi> for great store of all maritime prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
And as for the increase of the number of good shippes for the<note place="margin">The Englishe Nauie will be stronger the next yeare.</note>
Quéenes proper vse there is already a great quantitie of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ready, and order giuen to fell more in Nouember, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
next, in the Countries neare both to the Sea, and to
<hi>Thames,</hi> to build a number of ships of warre, equall to these
whose seruice was séene this yeare to haue ouermatched the
great <hi>Armadas</hi> &amp; Castles of <hi>Spaine</hi> &amp; <hi>Italy.</hi> And furthermore,
to ioyne with the Nauie of England this yeare following, not
onely the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zelanders,</hi> but also shippes of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi>
&amp; other partes of <hi>Estland,</hi> will certainly be had in great
numbers, whereof there was none at all required this yeare
past to ioyne with the Nauie of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Onely certaine <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
&amp; <hi>Zelanders</hi> offred their seruice (according as they are
bound) in the end of this Sommer,<note place="margin">Offer of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers and Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, to ioine with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nauie.</note> since the conflict neare <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi>
to ioyne with some of the English Nauie in the narrow
seas, to defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> issuing of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> out of the ports
of Fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders: &amp; in that seruice at this time there are aboue fortie
and sixe good ships of warre,<note place="margin">Iustinian Nas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sau Admiral of Holland with sixe and fortie ships of warre ioyned to the English Nauie, against the D. of Parma.</note> with the Uiceadmirall <hi>Iustinian</hi> of
<hi>Nassau:</hi> a man that agréeth too well with the English Nation,
and is a sworne enemie to all Spaniardes, and Catholiques: &amp;
as it is reported for certaine, there are thréescore more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
out of <hi>North-Holland</hi> to the Seas, for the same purpose:
so as it is to be doubted, that this Realme, this next yeare,
will be double as strong as it was this last yeare.</p>
                  <p>As to the second branch of our hope depending vpon opinion
of some great miscontentment of sundry persons against the
Quéene the proofe of the contrary so appeared this yeare,<note place="margin">Argumentes to proue no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment of the people towards the Queene.</note> both
of her actions to maintaine the liking of all her people, &amp; of the
generall earnest deuotion shewed to her by all estates, Noble
and meane rich &amp; poore, as I thinke no Prince Christened euer
had greater cause of comfort in her people: which I may iudge
to bréede a pride in her. And to recompence the same she did
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8852:12"/>
most notably shew her selfe in this time, euen when most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was threatened, in all her actions towards her people, as
carefull for their weale, and for the safetie of her Realme,
without any speciall or particular prouision, or regard to her
owne person,<note place="margin">The prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Queene to make her Realme strong.</note> as euer any Prince could do. First, to let her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vnderstand what care she had to make her Realme strong
against Inuasion, she politikely, yea most carefully, by her
owne frequent directions, caused her whole Realme to be put
in armes, she tooke accompt thereof her selfe by monethly Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificat
from such as were made her Lieutenauntes in euerie
Shire of her Realme, she caused Armour, Powder, Weapon,
to be sent to all Countries, and Ordinance to all Maritime
Countries: There were also sundry Armies described, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
euery coast of the Sea: and as I heard it reported by
some that did know the secrets of the Court, was importunate
with her Counsell to leaue no day vnoccupied, to bring these
seruices to effect, and yet she did still continue her Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
in the Low Countries to treat of peace, which surely she
desired to haue obtained, so that she might haue had the same
with certaine conditions. So as to content her people, shee
did both treat and desire peace, and did not in the meane time
neglect to make her Realme strong for defence, if peace could
not be gotten. But in the end, when her demaunds were who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refused (whereof we and all Catholiques were most glad)
and that she vnderstood very certainely, that the Armie of
the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> should come first to destroy the Citie of
London, she reuoked her Commissioners, approched London
in person, and did lie, as it were, in the Suburbs of the same:
whereby they of the Citie tooke great comfort, hauing daily in
shew and muster of their owne ten thousand men armed and
trained of very able men of the Citie, and in readines thirtie
thousand more, able to fight.</p>
                  <p>She caused also an Armie to be brought to incampe néere
the Sea side,<note place="margin">The Queenes being in the Army in Essex, when moste daunger was threatned by the enemies landing.</note> vpon the Riuer of <hi>Thames,</hi> betwixt the Sea and
the City, twenty miles beneath the City: and after the Army
was come thither, she would not by any aduise be staied, but
for comfort of her people, and to shew her owne magnanimity
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8852:13"/>
of heart (as she said, she would so do though she was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
she went to that Armie lying betwixt the City and the
Sea, vnder the charge of the Earle of Leicester, placing her
selfe betwixt the enemy and her City, and there viewed her
Armie, and passed through it diuers times, lodged in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of it, returned againe, and dined in the Armie: And first,
saw the people as they were, by their Countries, lodged and
quartered in their seuerall campes, which she viewed from
place to place. Afterward, when they were all reduced into
battailes, ready, as it were, to fight with any enemy, she
rode round about them, and did view them curiously, being
accompanied onely but with the Generall, and thrée or foure
others attending on her: But yet to shew her state, I well
marked it, she had the sword carried before her by she Earle of
<hi>Ormond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There she was generally saluted with cries, with shoutes,
with all tokens of loue, of obedience, of readinesse and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse
to fight for her,<note place="margin">The notable Applause of the people to the Queene for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the Campe.</note> as seldom hath bene seene in a Campe
and army, considering she was a Quéene: and all tended to
shew a maruellous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord, in a mutual loue, betwixt a Quéene
and her subiects: and of reuerence, and obedience of Subiects
to a Soueraigne: all which she acquited with very Princely
thanks, and good spéeches. I could enlarge this description
with many moe particularities of mine owne sight, for thither
I went, as many others did: and all that day, wandering from
place to place, I neuer heard any word spoken of her, but in
praising her for her stately person, and Princely behauiour:
and in praying for her life and safety, and cursing of all her
enemies, both Traitours, and all Papists, with earnest desire
to venter their liues for her safety.</p>
                  <p>And besides such particular Acclamations the whole Army
in euery quarter,<note place="margin">The singing of Psalmes by the English Army in the Campe.</note> did deuoutly at certaine times sing in her
hearing, in very tunable maner, diuers <hi>Psalmes</hi> put into
forme of <hi>Praiers</hi> in praise of almighty God, no waies to be
misliked, which she greatly commended, &amp; with very earnest
spéech thanked God with them. This that I write, you may be
sure, I do not with any comfort, but to giue you these mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8852:13"/>
Argumentes, that neither this Quéene doth discontent her
people, nor her people do shewe any discontentation in any
thing that they be commaunded to do for her seruice, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
hath bene imagined.<note place="margin">An Army pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for the Queene, beside the Army, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the landing of the enemie.</note> She had also an Armie of about
fortie thousand footmen, and of sixe thousand horsemen, vnder
the charge of the <hi>Lord Hunsdon</hi> Lord Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berlein, as Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of that Army, made ready from the Inland partes of the
Realme, to be about her owne person, without disarming the
maritime Counties: so as many marched out of sondry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
towards her, at the very time that she was in the Camp:
some came to the Suburbes &amp; Townes neare London, whom
she remaunded to their Countries, because their Haruest was
at hand, and many of them would not be countermaunded,
but still approched onward on their owne charges (as they
sayd) to sée her person, &amp; to fight with them that boasted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere
the Realme. But though the greatest nomber of the said
souldiours were compelled to returne, yet the Captaines, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the principall Knightes and Gentlemen came to the
Court to offer their seruice: &amp; those were gratiously accepted of
her with many thankes, and are now for the more part retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a full determination, and firme promise to continue
their Bands in such redines, as vpon a few houres warning
they will assuredly returne with them in good array.</p>
                  <p>Beside these foresaid Argumentes to disproue the opinion
of discontentment of the people, which heretofore hath bene
thought a great furtherance to this honorable action, I will
also remember you some other more notable Actions, to proue
both contentation, and readines, in all the Nobilitie of the
Realme at this time, that were not tyed to abide in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
by reason of their offices, as Lieutenantes and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
there for Martiall seruices. For assoone as it was heard
that the Quéene was come nere London, and that the Armies
were in gathering to come out of the countries,<note place="margin">Great power of Horsemen brought by the Nobilitie to attend on the Queenes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> for defence of
all Inuasions, and reportes brought from the sea coasts of the
apparance of the Spanish Nauie: all the Noble men in the
Realme, from East and West, from North and South, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
onely such great Lordes as had speciall Gouernementes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8852:14"/>
in Countries, that might not lawfully be absent from their
charge, and some few that were not able to make forces accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their desire, came to the Quéene, bringing with them
according to their degrées, and to the vttermost of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
goodly Bands of horsemen, both Launces, light horsemen,
and such other as are termed <hi>Carabins</hi> or <hi>Argeletiers,</hi> lodging
their Bands round about London, and maintaining them in
pay at their owne charges all the time, vntill the Nauie of
Spaine was certainly knowen to be passed beyond Scotland.
And of these Noble men many shewed their Bands of their
horsemen, before the Quéene euen in the fields afore her own
gate, to the great marucile of men of good iudgement (as I
heard reported) for that the number of them was so great, and
so well armed, and horsed, as knowing that they were no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of the numbers of horsemen limited in euery Countrie,
and put into Bands with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Armies described, it was thought
before they were séene, that there had not bene so many spare
horses of such valour in the whole realme, excepting the North
part of England towards Scotland, whose forces consist chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of horsemen.</p>
                  <p>The first that shewed his Bands to the Quéene, was that
Noble,<note place="margin">The Viscount Mountagues shewe of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men was the first.</note> vertuous, honorable man, the <hi>Viscount Mountague,</hi>
who, howsoeuer men do iudge of him for opinion in Religion,
yet to tell you the truth, he is reported alwaes to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
as now also at this time he did professe and protest so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely,
both to the Quéene, and to all her Court, in open As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
that he now came, though he was very sickly, and in
age, with a full resolution to liue and die in defence of the
Quéene, and of his countrie, against all Inuaders, whether it
were Pope, King or Potentate whatsoeuer, and in that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
he would hazard his life, his children, his lands and goods.
And to shew his minde agréeably thereto, he came personally
himself before the Quéene, with his Band of horsemen being
almost two hundred: the same being led by his owne sonnes,
and with them a yong child, very comely seated on horseback,
being the heire of his house, that is, the eldest sonne to his son
&amp; heire: a matter much noted of many, whom I heard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8852:14"/>
the same: to sée a grandfather, father, and sonne, at one
time on horsebacke afore a Quéene for her seruice, though in
truth I was sory to sée our Aduersaries so greatly pleased
therewith. But I cannot conceale it from your Lordships
knowledge, because I thinke this Noble man is knowen vnto
you, hauing bene vsed as an Ambassadour to the King Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
many yeares past by this Quéene (as I haue heard) to
require confirmation of the treaties of amitie, betwixt both
their Fathers. And of this Noble mans conditions, I thinke
there be some others, of whom there is no accompt to be made
that they will giue sauour to any attempt against the Quéene
or to any Inuasion of the Realme.</p>
                  <p>There were also many at the same time that made shewes
of great numbers of seruiceable horses,<note place="margin">A number of great Lordes shewed their horsemen.</note> whereof though it be
no comfort to you to heare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet is it good that you be not abused

shewed afore the Quéene aboue thrée hundred horses of al

                  <p>This shew excéeded in number any other particular Band,
and the Earle himselfe with a great number of Launces, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

the Earle of <hi>Cumberland</hi> (as they cal it) the <hi>Course of the field</hi>
which I had neuer séene before:<note place="margin">Course of the field.</note> and did also him selfe, and his

also his <hi>Carabines,</hi> and his footemen to make many skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
there, to the great liking of the Quéene, and of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of people, which were many thousands. Amongst whom
I heard many vehement spéeches against all English Papists,
calling them all Traitors, wishing also that the Spaniards,
had bene there in that field with treble the number, to make
proofe of the value of English men: all which I heard to my
great griefe, with many curses against all their countrimen,
saying, that they as arrant Traitors to their natiue countrie,
had villanously sold, as farre as in them did lie, the libertie of
their country to Spaniards, and other Papists. It behoued me
not there to haue contraried any of them, for surely if I had,
their rancour was so stirred vp, by the comfort of these faire
shewes of horsemen, as they would there in the field in their
rage haue killed me, and cut me in a thousand péeces.</p>
                  <p>Besides these Lords aboue named, there were brought to
the towne, other faire Bandes by the Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi>

about London at that time, aboue fiue thousand horses readie
to serue the Quéene, besides all the horsemen that were rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

And besides these, I heard in a very good place, where I
was silent, that there was by accompt twise as many in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,
with the Noble men that were absent, attending on

when the Earle continued longer in <hi>Flanders</hi> then they liked,
and doubting of his returne, for that they supposed that the
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> would stay him, and the other Commissioners
there, the people of his Countrie in a generalitie did amongst
themselues determine, that the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> the Erles sonne,
and all the manhood of <hi>Lancashire</hi> and <hi>Cheshire</hi> would goe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Seas and fetch the Earle home. A matter for no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to be spoken of, but to note the force of the loue which the
people doe beare to the Earle, who with his sonne is firmely
bent against the Pope.</p>

knowledge of the Quéene, put themselues into the Quéens

<hi>William Heruie,</hi> to me not knowen, but now here about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

ship boate, to scale the great <hi>Galliasse</hi> wherein <hi>Moncada</hi> was,

                  <p>And yet to make it more manifest, how earnest all sorts of

this particuler recital not vnméet for your knowledge, it is to
be noted what disposition the Nobilitie of the Realme had at
this time to haue withstood all Inuasion. And if percase you
shall peruse your ordinary Catalogue of the grrat Lordes of
the Realme, you shal find that these are the substance of all the
great Lords,<note place="margin">Earle of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> sauing thrée young Earles within age,<note place="margin">Earle of South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton.</note> 
                     <hi>Rutland,</hi>

                     <hi>Southhampton,</hi> and <hi>Bedford:</hi> all thrée brought vp in peruerse
religion. And so remaineth to be spoken of, the Earle of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi>
who is in the Tower for attempting to haue fled out of the
Realme, by prouocation of him that now is <hi>Cardinall Allen:</hi>
who, howsoeuer he may be affected to the Catholique religion:
yet I heare most certainly that he offereth his life in defence of
the Quéene against all the world.</p>
                  <p>And where accompt was made to haue a partie in this
Realme, which by these former relations appeare could
not be possible, the whole Nobilitie being assured to the
Quéene, and the force of the people not violently bent that
way: In this very time was offered to the Quéene as great
a partie for her, to come to her seruice, and defence of the
Realme, as out of all Christendome, she could not haue to all
respects a stronger. Which was the King of Scots, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8852:17"/>
of the intended Inuasion of the Realme,<note place="margin">Offer of the K. of Scots to the Queen of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> sent a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to the Quéene, with his letter, as I credibly heard, to offer
her all the power that he had to defend her &amp; her Realme: and
if she so would, he would come in his owne person, and hazard
his owne life, to defend this Realme against all Inuaders for
Religion, or any other pretence whatsoeuer. So by this you
may sée, what accompt may be made of any vayne promises,
made in the name of this King. And because you shall perceiue
that I haue good meanes to haue intelligence of any other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Realme for defence thereof,<note place="margin">Bands of horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erected by the Bishops.</note> it is most certaine as I
heare, and I haue séene a List or Rol of a great number both of
horsemen and footmen, which the Bishops of the Realme haue
of their owne charges, with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribution of the Clergy, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vp in Bandes of horsemen and footmen, which are to be led
by Noble Gentlemen at the Quéenes nomination: and these
Bandes must be vaynely termed <hi>Milites Sacri.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the last point of the thrée foundations of the principal
hope conceiued,<note place="margin">The third and last hope which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques had of a partie in the realme was all frustrate.</note> whereupon the Inuasion was chiefly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and taken in hand, which was most certainly and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
beléeued, that there should be found here in the Realme a
strong partie of Catholiques, against the Quéene to ioyne and
assist the Inuaders, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the appearing of the Spanish Nauie:
by my former relations of the generall great &amp; feruent loue
of the people towardes the Quéene, and of the great offers of
seruice now made by the whole Nobilitie of the Realme, this
their foundation may appeare to haue bene wrong laied, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by imaginations, as it were vpon a quick sand or rather as
flying in the aire. And yet it appeareth very truely that no
small accompt was made hereof by the King of Spaine, and
by his principall Ministers: for there is nothing at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
more vniuersally, with one lamentable voyce spoken of,
by all the multitude of the Spaniardes,<note place="margin">The Spanishe prisoners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the K. purpose, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abused, by the exiled Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Spaniards call traitors to their countrey.</note> now here prisoners,
yea by the chiefest of them, then that they now euidently sée,
that the King their Maister was with such informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abused, yea rather betrayed, For they say there was no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of value in all this Army, but he heard it constantly affirmed,
and so deliuered for comfort of all that serued therein, before
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8852:17"/>
they were shipped, that they should not be afrayed of any resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to land in England, for that there was good assurance
geuen to the King, that they should finde a strong Armie of
Catholiques ready in their fauour, assoone as euer their Nauie
should be séene vpon the Sea coast,<note place="margin">No possibilitie to Inuade and conquere a realme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fauour of a partie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> &amp; so they all here say they
were incouraged to come to this iourney: otherwise, many of
them sweare they would neuer haue come on shipbord: so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
they say, it was and against all reason, to Inuade a
Realme, with opinion to conquere it, without both some
title of right, and a partie also: but specially without a good
sure partie.</p>
                  <p>And therefore now finding this report very false, many of
these prisoners do by name curse you,<note place="margin">The Spanishe prisoners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise and course of Don Bernardin of Mendoza.</note> as being the Kinges
Ambassadour: as him, they say, who vpon the opinion of the
knowledge which you had gotten in England, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
more credited then any other, and had these many yeares
together tempted the King their Maister, vpon hope, and other
such like perswasions, to attempt such a matter as this was:
being vtterly in all wisedome to haue bene condemned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some certaintie of this latter part, specially to haue had a
strong partie here. They also curse all such Englishmen, as
haue fled out of this Countrie, whom they spare not to call ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Traitors, for offring the sale of their Countrie to the
Pope and the King of Spaine. And these prisoners adde also,
that they were borne in hand, that this Countrie was so
open to march in, and so weake to withstand any force, and
the people so miserable, as they thought the Conquest thereof
had bene of no more difficulty then the ouercomming of a
nomber of naked <hi>Indians</hi> was at the beginning of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
thereof by <hi>King Ferdinand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now for strength of this countrie and people: many of
these prisoners hauing bene brought from the Sea coastes he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to London, whereby they haue obserued the countrie and
the people, doe speake marueilously thereof, counting the same
inuincible, otherwise then by treason of some great partie
within the Realme. But whether all these spéeches which are
commonly reported of them procéede from their hartes, or that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8852:18"/>
they speake thus to please the English, because they are well
vsed by them, who also are easily deceiued with flattery, I
know not: but sure I am they do thus speake dayly, with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
shewe of great passions against such as haue bene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaders
to the King for this iourney. Diuers of them also
which are of good iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; haue heard of such of the English

credit to cary any numbers of men but by the Quéenes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
when they were at their best: as the prisoners wonder
how the king could be so deceiued to giue them pentions other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then for charitie, because of their religion. But they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
they haue often heard in Spaine, how the King was once
notably deceiued,<note place="margin">Thomas Stuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes abusing of the King of Spaine and the Pope, newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred by the Spaniardes.</note> when one <hi>Thomas Stukeley</hi> a priuat Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman,
who fled out of Ireland for debt &amp; other lewd Actions
into Spaine, not being worth one peny, his debts being paied,
&amp; but the second sonne of a meane Gentleman, pretended, and
was beléeued in Spaine (by so intitling of him selfe) to be a
<hi>Duke,</hi> a <hi>Marquis,</hi> and an <hi>Earle</hi> of Ireland, and so was a long
time enterteined, as a man that could do great seruice against
the Quéene of England: vntill at length the King vnderstood
his falshood, and banished him out of Spaine. And after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
to Rome, was by the Pope also mainteined for a
time, vntill he was discouered euen by some good Catholiques,
that could not endure the Popes holines to be so grossely moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
of whom some of the prisoners vsing mery spéeches, how
both the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> and afterward this King, and the
Pope, were so notably deceiued by this <hi>Stukeley,</hi> do conclude
merely, that they thinke some of these English that haue thus
abused the King, haue followed <hi>Stukeleys</hi> steppes. And in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
truth, I and many others haue bene very often ashamed to
heare so brode spéeches, of the King, and of the Pope, yea of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8852:18"/>
the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> whom such a companion as <hi>Stukeley</hi>
was, could so notably deceiue: and it was the more to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled,
how he could deceiue the King Catholique, considering
he was knowen to many of his Counsell, at the Kings being
in England, to haue bene but a vaunting beggar, and a Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian,
and afterwards, a Pirat against the Spaniards.</p>

there might not be some dispensation from the Popes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
for some fewe yeares, to tollerate their comming to the
Church, without changing of their faith: considering a great
number do stand therein, not for any thing (as they say) vsed
in this Church, that is directly contrary to Gods law, but for
that the Rites and praiers (though they are collected out of the
body of the Scripture) are not allowed by the Catholique
Church, and the head thereof, which is the Popes holines: and
for that cause iustly, al true Catholiques, accompt this Church
to be schismaticall. By which remedie of tolleration, a great
number of such as will be perpetually Catholiques, might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
their liuings and libertie: and in proces of time, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique
religion (by Gods goodnesse) might with more sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
be increased, to the honour of God, then euer it can be by
any force whatsoeuer. For so did all Christian religion at the
first begin, and spread it selfe ouer the world: not by force, but
only by teaching, and example of holines in the teachers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all humane forces. And so I will end my long Letters,
with the sentence which King Dauid vsed foure times in one
of his Psalmes. <hi>Et clamauerunt ad Dominum in tribulatione eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

                  <p>AFter that I had made an end of this my letter, which I
found by perusall thereof to haue bene at more length,
then I looked for, although the matters therein conteined did
draw me therto, and that I had made choice of a friend of mine
who had more knowledge in the French tong, then I, to turne
the same into French: my mishap was, that when he had done
some part thereof, he fell sicke of a burning feuer, whereby my
letter remained with him vpon hope of recouery for tenne or
twelue daies: and séeing no hope thereof, I entreated another
very trustie &amp; a sound Catholique hauing perfect knowledge
in the French tong, who tooke vpon him to put it into French,
wherein was also longer time spent: so as my letter being
written in the midst of August, I am forced to end it in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.
And thereupon I thought good, whiles my former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was in translating, to adde some things happened in the
meanetime méet for your knowledge.</p>
                  <p>About the seuenth of August, the <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> returned
with the Nauie, hauing followed the Spanish Nauie (as they
reported) as farre as the 55. degrée Northwards: the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Nauie taking a course either to the furthest partes of
<hi>Norwey,</hi> or to the <hi>Orcades</hi> beyond Scotland: which if they did,
then it was here iudged that they would goe about Scotland
and Ireland: but if they should go to <hi>Norwey,</hi> then it might
be, that if they could recouer prouisions of mastes, whereof
the English Nauy had made great spoile, they might returne.
But I for my part wished them a prosperous winde to passe
home about Ireland, considering I despaired of their returne
for many respects, both of their wants, which could not be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in <hi>Norwey,</hi> and of the lacke of the Duke of <hi>Parmas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
to bring his Armie on the Sea, for want of Mariners.
Neuertheles, vpon knowledge from Scotland that they were
beyond the <hi>Orcades,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Order taken by the K. of Scots in fauour of the English.</note> and that the King of Scots had giuen

to euening, with great admiration to sée such generall deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which I and others did iudge to procéede more of feare

and the Spanish Nauie defeated, and intelligence brought of

had any desire to heare of any good successe to

who was so impudent, or at the least, so blindly rash, as to
disperse in print, both in French, Italian, and Spanish, most false
reports of a victorie had by the Spaniards, euen when the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
was notable on the part of England, and the Spanish vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
yet whilest I was occupied in the printing hereof, a good
time after the letters were sent into Fraunce, there came to this
Citie certaine knowledge, to all our great comfort, of sundrie
happie Accidents, to the diminution of our mortall enemies in
their famous Fleete, that was driuen out of our seas about the
stla of Iuly, towards the farthermost North partes of Scotland.
Wherfore I haue thought it not amisse to ioine the same to this
Lettre of <hi>Don Bernardin,</hi> that he may beware, not to be so hastie
of himselfe, nor yet to permit one <hi>Capella,</hi> who is his common
sower of reports, to write these false things for truthes.</p>
                  <p>The particularities wherof are these. The Fleete was by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
driuen beyond the Isles of Orknay, about the first of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,
which is now more then sixe weekes past, the place being
aboue three score degrees from the North Pole: an vnaccusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
place for the yong Gallants of Spaine, that neuer had felt
stormes on the sea, or cold weather in August. And about those
North Islands their mariners and souldiers died daily by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utdes:
as by their bodies cast on land, did appeare. And after
twentie dayes or more, hauing spent their time in miseries, they
being desirous to returne home to Spaine, sayled very farre
Southwestward into the Ocean to recouer Spaine. But the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie

people which put their confidence in him, and bringeth downe
his enemies that exalt themselues with pride to the heauens, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb facs="tcp:8852:21"/>
the winds, to be so violently contrarious to this proud
Nauie, as it was with force disseuered, on the high seas West
vpon Ireland: and so a great number of them, driuen into sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
dangerous bayes, and vpon rockes, all along the West, and
North parts of Ireland, in sundrie places distant aboue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
miles asunder, &amp; there cast away: some sonke, some broken,
some runne on sands, some burned by the Spaniards themselues.</p>
                  <p>As in the North part of Ireland towardes Scotland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the two riuers of <hi>Loughfoile</hi> and <hi>Lough Svvilley,</hi> nine were
driuen to land, and many of them broken, and the Spaniardes
forced to come to land for succour amongst the wilde Irish.</p>
                  <p>In another place, twentie miles Southwest from thence, in a
Bay called <hi>Calbeggy,</hi> three other ships driuen also vpon rockes.
In another place Southward, being a Bay, called the <hi>Borreys,</hi>
twentie miles North from <hi>Gallowey,</hi> belonging to the Erle of
<hi>Ormond,</hi> one speciall great ship of a thousand tonne, with fiftie
brasse peeces, and foure Canons was sonke, and all the people
drowned sauing sixteene: who by their apparell, as it is aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
out of Ireland, seeme to be persons of great estimation.</p>
                  <p>Then to come more to the Sowthward, thirty miles vppon
the coasts of <hi>Thomond,</hi> North from the riuer of <hi>Shennan,</hi> two
or three mo perished, whereof one was burned by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
them selues, and so driuen to the shore: an other was of <hi>S.
Sebastians,</hi> wherein were three hundred men, who were also all
drowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sauing three score. A third ship with all her lading
was cast away at a place called <hi>Breckan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In another place afore <hi>Sir Tirlogh Obrynes</hi> house, there was
also another great ship lost, supposed to be a Galliasse. These
losses aboue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, were betwixt the fift and tenth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,
as was aduertised from sundrie places out of Ireland: so
as by accompt, from the one and twentieth of Iuly, when this
Nauie was first beaten with the Nauie of England, vntill the
tenth of September, being the space of seuen weekes, and more,
it is most likely that the sayde Nauie had neuer good day, nor
night.</p>
                  <p>Of the rest of the Nauie, report is also made that many of
them haue bene seene, lying of and on, vpon the coast of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

I thought good to adde to the printed Copies of the letters of

and twentie saile, as it was said, came to an Iland as he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of the North part of Scotland, where they stayed not, nor
had reliefe, but at this place the General called all the ships to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
giuing them in charge that they should with the best
they could hast them to the first place they could get to of the
coast of Spaine or Portingal: for that they were in such great
distresse, through their great wants of victuals and otherwise.
He saith they came foorth the worse furnished thereof, for that
they expected to be reléeued of those things more amply by the
Duke of <hi>Parma:</hi> he saith that out of this ship there died foure
or fiue euery day of hunger and thirst, and yet this ship was
one that was best furnished for victuals, which he knoweth, for
out of some of the other ships some people were sent to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued
in this ship.</p>

together, holding their course the best they could towardes
Spaine.</p>
               <p>He saith that at the same time, which is now about twentie
daies or more past, they were seuered by a great storme which
held from foure of the clocke in the after noone of one day, to
tenne of the clocke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning the next day, in which storme
the Admirall came away with seuen and twentie saile which
this examinat did tell, and that one of them was a Galliasse

of eight and twenty owers on a side, what is become of the rest
of the Nauy he can not tell.</p>
               <p>He saith also that about ten dayes past, they had one other
great storme with a mist, by which storme they were againe
seuered, so as of those seuen &amp; twenty saile there came into the
coast by <hi>Dingle Cushe,</hi> but the Admirall, one other ship of
foure hundred tonnes and a barke of about forty tonnes, and
what is become of the rest of the seuen and twenty saile he can

was so spoiled as she cast towards the shore about twenty
leagues from <hi>Dingle Cushe,</hi> he knoweth not who was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

there be fiue &amp; twenty <hi>Biskers</hi> &amp; fourty <hi>Portingals</hi> which are

in the Admirall very sicke, and do lie downe and die
daily, and the rest he saith be all very weake, and the Captaine
very sad and weake, he saith this Admirall hath in her fiftie
foure brasse peeces, and about foure score kintals of pouder.</p>
               <p>He saith they were so néere the coast before they found it,
that by meanes of the strong Westerly winde they were not
able to double out from it.</p>
               <p>There is in the Admirall left but fiue and twenty Pipes of
wine, and very little bread, and no water, but what they
brought out of Spaine, which stinketh maruellously, and their
flesh meate they can not eate their drought is so great.</p>
               <p>He saith no part of the Nauy to his knowledge euer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any land vntil such time as they came to this coast at
<hi>Dingle Cushe,</hi> nor hath had any water, victuall, or other relief
from any coast or place sithence the English Fléete left them.</p>
               <p>He saith, that when they lay before <hi>Callice</hi> there came a
Pinnace to their fléete from the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> who told them
the Duke could not be ready for them vntill the Friday fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
but by reason of this fight of the English Fléete with
them, they were not able to tarry there so long.</p>
               <p>He saith, that the Admirals purpose is vpon the first winde
<pb facs="tcp:8852:25"/>
that serueth, to passe away for Spaine.</p>
               <p>He saith also, that it is a common brute amongst the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
if they may once get home againe, they will not meddle
againe with the English.</p>
               <p>He saith, there be of principall men in the Admirals ship,
<hi>Don Iohn de Lina</hi> a Spaniard, who is chiefe Captaine of the
souldiers of that ship, <hi>Don Gomes</hi> a Spaniard, an other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
<hi>Don Sebastian</hi> a Portingall gentleman an Aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:
and a Marquesse an Italian, who is also an Aduenturer,
and one other Portingall Gentleman whom he knoweth not,
but that they are principal men that haue crosses on their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
other meane Gentlemen there be also in the same ship:
He saith, al the souldiers in this ship were Spaniards, he saith
there are in the small Barke that is with them about fiue and
twenty persons, how many are in the Hulke that is there, he
knoweth not.</p>
               <p>He saith, he thinketh that the Duke is past towards Spaine,
for that he was some twelue leagues more Westerly, then the
Admirall was in the first storme.</p>
               <p>He saith, that the great Gallion which came from the Duke
of <hi>Florence,</hi> was neuer séene sithence they were in the sight at
<hi>Callice:</hi> He saith, the people of the Galliasses were most spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

               <p>HE saith his father and him selfe with others came into
<hi>Lisbone</hi> in a ship of <hi>Genua,</hi> about a yeare sithence where
they were embarqued by the King of Spaine, that ship was of
about foure hundred tonne.</p>
               <p>He saith his father after this was appointed Pilote in the
ship called <hi>our Lady of the Rosarie,</hi> of the burden of a thousand
tonne being the Kings: he saith the Prince of <hi>Ascule y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> Kinges
base sonne came in the companie of the Duke in the Dukes
ship called the <hi>Gallion of S. Martine</hi> of a thousand tonne, but
at <hi>Callice</hi> when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> English Nauy came neare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this Prince
went to the shore, &amp; before his returne the Duke was driuen
to cut his Ankers, and to depart: whereby the Prince could
not recouer that ship, but came into the said shippe called <hi>our
Lady of the Rosarie,</hi> and with him there came in also one <hi>Don
Pedro, Don Francisco,</hi> and seuen other Gentlemen of accompt
that accompanied the Prince. He saith the Captaine of this
ship was <hi>Villa Franca</hi> of <hi>S. Sebastians,</hi> and <hi>Matuta</hi> was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of the <hi>Infanterie</hi> of that ship. There was also in her Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Suwares</hi> a Portingall, and one <hi>Garrionero</hi> a Castillian

Castillian: and <hi>Michael d'Oquendo</hi> who was Generall of this
ship. There was also in her one Irish Captaine called <hi>Iohn
Rise,</hi> of about thirtie yeares of age, and one other Irish man,
called <hi>Francis Roche.</hi> The Prince was of about eight &amp; twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
yeares of age. He saith there were other Gentlemen Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturers
in the ship, but not of that reckoning as the former
were. He saith there were in all seuen hundreth men in this
ship at their comming foorth: he saith, there were about fiue
hundred in this shippe at such time as she sonke: the rest peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by fight and by sicknesse. He saith, this ship was shot tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
foure times, and one of the shot was betwéene the wind
and the water, whereof they thought she would haue sonke,
and the most of her tackle was spoyled with shot, this shippe
stroke against the rockes in the sound of the <hi>Bleskyes,</hi> a league
and a halfe from the land vpon Tuesday last at noone, and all
in the ship perished sauing this examinat, who saued himselfe
vpon two or thrée plankes that were loose, the Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to saue themselues by the bote, it was so fast tied as they
could not get her lose, whereby they perished: he saith as soone,
as the ship stroke against the rocke, one of the Captaines slue
this examinates father, saying he did it by treason. He saith,
there came in their company a Portingall ship of about foure
hundreth, who comming into the same sound, cast anker neare
where they found the Admirall of the Fléet at Anker, called <hi>S.
Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in which <hi>Don Martine de Ricalde</hi> the Admirall was, he
saith that about two and twentie dayes past the Duke depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from them, and about fiue and twentie ships in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and about fortie ships were with the Admirall, but this
ship was not able to follow the Admirall, by reason her sayles
were broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and for the rest of the Nauie that remained, they
were so dispersed, as he cannot tel what is become of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He
saith the Duke being better watered then the others were,
held more Westerly into the seas, and willed the Admirall
with his company being in worse estate for water to sée if he
could touch with any coast to get fresh water, sithence which
they haue bene seuered by the nights and by tempest: he saith,
<pb facs="tcp:8852:27"/>
this ship nor any other of the shippes touched vpon any land,
nor had any reliefe of water or victuall at any place sithence
they parted, but from two Scottes, which they tooke vpon the
coast of Scotland, whose fish and victuall the Duke tooke, but
paied them for it.</p>
               <p>He saith, their ships were so beaten, and the winde so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and the sholles vpon the coast of Flanders, so daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
as the Pilot that was in the Dukes ship, directed them
this course Northward as their safest way. He saith, that in
one of the dayes in which the fight was betwéene both the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies,
the Duke séeing the English Fléete so hardly to pursue
them willed his Fléete, seing no other remedy, to addresse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

what is become of the rest he knoweth not, they serued the

               <p>HE saith, the Prince of <hi>Ascule</hi> was a slender made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and
of a reasonable stature, of xxviii. yeares of age, his haire
<pb facs="tcp:8852:28"/>
of an aborne colour stroked vpward, of a high forehead, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
little beard marquesotted, whitely faced with some little
red on the chéeks, he was drowned in apparrell of white satten
for his doublet and bréeches after the Spanish fashion cut, with
russet silke stockings. When this Prince came into their ship
at <hi>Callice,</hi> he was apparelled in blacke rased veluet laid on
with broade gold lace. He saith, that this Princes men, for the
most part were in the shippe that this examinat was in, from
their comming out of Spaine: and when they were at <hi>Callice</hi>
the Prince passed in a litte <hi>Phelocke</hi> with six others from ship
to ship to giue order to them, and some said he went to the shore
at that time.</p>
               <p>He saith, it was thought to be about lx. leagues West from
the Northwest part of Ireland, that the Duke departed from
the rest of the companie. Hee saith, they parted by a tempest
growing in the night, &amp; that about sixe daies after, a <hi>Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall

that there were xxv. ships of the whole Nauie passed away

and foure in another: and thus dispearsedly passed on
the seas. But how many ships remained after their departure
from the coast of Scotland, of the whole Nauy, this examinat

about lxxviij. saile in all: when they were farthest of in the

<pb facs="tcp:8852:28"/>
foure score leagues and somewhat more from any land,

from them South and by West, and this was about foure or
fiue dayes, before the said great tempest, and from that time
vntill the same tempest, they had the winde most West, and
West Southwest, and sometimes West Northwest, but that
not very long, he saith that it was knowne to very few of the

vntill they came to <hi>Callice,</hi> where this Prince about the
time of the fight, was said to take him selfe into a little boate
vpon the coast of <hi>Callice,</hi> but before that, he kept him selfe as
priuate in the Dukes owne ship, as it was said, and not noted
or spoken of in the Nauy vntill then. But he saith there was
a great Prince an Italian, that was a chiefe man in a great
<hi>Argosie</hi> very wel furnished, who before their comming to the
English coast did very often banket the Duke and the other
great men of the Nauy. This <hi>Argosie</hi> was called the <hi>Ratte:</hi>

the day before the said tempest or not, but he saith this being a
famous ship, it was often demanded, if she were in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,

of the treasure that serued for the pay, was as he heard in the
