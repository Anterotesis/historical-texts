         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as knowing that though

It is the onely cordiall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive

(as one well obſerves) is but a

a world of happineſſe. Yet

never went to conclude a peace

I feare to ſpeake farther of it,

Law, which made it death for

Warre may bee as ſo many

Peace, and therefore I will
hold my peace.</p>

A Drunkard.</head>
               <p>IS a meere beaſt in the ſhape
of a man. A living pipe or
conduite, through which the
liquour paſſeth. A great aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of <hi>Copernicus</hi> his opinion,
for he holds that all things go
ronnd. He might make a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Souldier, but that he ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
ſo often. Drukenneſſe
is uſed in High <hi>Germany</hi> for the
<hi>Index,</hi> or Touch-ſtone of a
mans nature, for the parents
will ſee men drunk before they
marry their daughters unto
<pb facs="tcp:120018:45"/>
them, becauſe they will know
what kinde of drunkenneſſe
they are ſubject to; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the good or ill (if a
Drunkard can have good) qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
they judge him conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
or not for their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages:
And indeed there is no
paſſion that a Drunkard is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to, but Wine will make
him turn traytor to himſelfe
and diſcover. It is not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that the word in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall
ſignifies Naked, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe
breakes the veile of
ſecrecie, and renders a man
naked to his very enemies,
when he is like <hi>Gryllus</hi> (in <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>)
who was ſo transformed
by one of <hi>Circes</hi> charmes, that
<pb facs="tcp:120018:46"/>
he could not by all <hi>Uliſſes</hi> clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
be induced to depoſe
his hoggiſh nature, and reſume
the perſon of a man. He is
not then his own Maſter or
his own man, whoſe ſenſes are
fettered with Drunkenneſſe,
and yet how he boaſts in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himſelfe a hogſhead, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to take off his liquour till
he be taken of it, and become
its captive, and inſtead of
quenching his thirſt drownes
his ſoule. And being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved
of his ſenſes, he jumps
not an inch from a mad-man.
For as there are ſeverall ſorts
of mad-men, ſo are there alſo
of Drunkards, and every one
in his ſeverall humour: ſome
<pb facs="tcp:120018:46"/>
are mad, ſome merry, ſome
raging Drunkards. How many
brute beaſts will riſe up in
judgement againſt the Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
who make the ſufficing
of Nature their Standard in
eating and drinking, which
they will not exceed no more
then the Drunkard exceeds
them in his drink? For there
are but two things whereby a
man is differenc'd from a beaſt,
<hi>Ratio &amp; Oratio,</hi> Reaſon and
Speech, and the Drunkard
wants them both. He wants
reaſon like him that ſtuft a
porrage pot with ſtraw to make
it the eaſier pillow. He wants
ſpeech alſo, for as the Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
were diſtinguiſhed from
<pb facs="tcp:120018:47"/>
the reſt of the Iſraelites, by
liſping, they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

                  </gap>. Thus
Drunkards (ſayth one wittily)
are diſtinguiſhed from the
Kings ſober ſubjects by clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the coyne of the tongue.
But lamentable it is when hee
dares to quote Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
for proofe of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
looking only at the evill
of ſin, but not at the evill of
puniſhmeut that follows thoſe
ſins; let him ſhew me the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of a Saint that ſinn'd,
and had not alſo his affliction
for it. As the Comoedian,
who when one objected to him
his bringing a deboiſt fellow
upon the ſtage, thereby giving
<pb facs="tcp:120018:47"/>
an evill example to youth: He
anſwerd, 'tis true, I brought
ſuch an one upon the Stage,
but I hang'd him before he
went off, and ſo I gave
them a good
example.

A grave Divine.</head>
               <p>IS a faithfull watchman, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before his flock, holding
forth the ſhining lampe of his
Doctrine in the lanthorne of a
good converſation. Hee is a
good ſteward, that hath ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before hand to lay in ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
proviſion for that great
charge he hath undertaken. He
leapt not from the Grammar
Schoole to the Pulpit, but was
long in the Tyring-houſe of
the Univerſity, before he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
on the publike Theater,
<pb facs="tcp:120018:52"/>
where he courted not the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſe
Divinity firſt, but made
his way to her the eaſier, by
firſt winning the Arts, her
hand-maids. Neither was he
haſty to launch forth of that
Port, till hee was ſufficiently
ballaſted with learning. Being
lawfully called to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
he firſt throughly learned
the weight thereof, that hee
may the better fit his ſhoulders
to beare it, and ſurely he that
is moſt carefull to know, will
be moſt carefull to performe
his duty. His endeavour is to
fit his matter to the capacity
of his hearers, as deſiring rather
their profit then his applauſe.
In any controverſie he more
<pb facs="tcp:120018:52"/>
delights to ſhew the ſtrength
of truth, then his adverſaries
weakneſſe: uſing ſoft words,
(as one well) but hard Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
He is very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
in ordering his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
as knowing that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant

(if not more) by their eyes then
their eares; ſo that his whole

wherein his pariſhioners
may legibly read their duty.

as the only aſſurance,
