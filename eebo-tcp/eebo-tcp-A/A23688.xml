            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE desire of happiness is so
coessential with our nature,
so interwoven and incorporate
with it; that nothing but
the dissolution of the whole frame can
extinguish it. This runs thro the
whole race of mankind, and amidst
the infinit variety of other inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
preserves its self entire. The
most various contradictory tempers do
<pb facs="tcp:106844:3"/>
yet conspire in this, and men of the
most unequal fortunes, are yet equal
in their wishes of being happy.</p>
            <p>But this concurrence as to the end
is not more universal then the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
about the way. Every man
would have happiness, but wherein
that consists, or how it is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
has bin very diversly opin'd.
Indeed the ultimate supreme happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as it is originally inherent in
God, so it is wrapt up in those clouds
and darkness, which, as the Psalmist
saies, are <hi>round about him</hi> Psal. 18.
11. And we can see nothing of it, but
in those gleams and raies he is
pleas'd to dart out upon us; so that
all our estimates as to our final feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
must be mesur'd by those revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he has made of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106844:3"/>
But one would think our temporal
happiness were as much a mystery as
our eternal, to see what variety of
blind pursuits are made after it. One
man thinks tis seated on the top pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of honor, and climbs till per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he falls head-long. Another
thinks it a mineral, that must be
dig'd out of the earth, and toils to <hi>lade
himself with thick clay,</hi> Hab. 2. 6.
and at last finds a grave, where he
sought his tresure. A third supposes
it consists in the variety of pleasures,
and wearies himself in that pursuit,
which only cloies, and disappoints.
Yet every one of these can read you
lectures of the gross mistake and folly
of the other, whilst himself is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deluded.</p>
            <p>Thus do men chase an imaginary
<pb facs="tcp:106844:4"/>
good, till they meet with real evils;
herein exposing themselves to the same
cheat <hi>Laban</hi> put upon <hi>Jacob,</hi> they
serve for <hi>Rachel,</hi> and are rewarded
with <hi>Leah,</hi> court fancied beauty, and
marry loath'd deformity. Such delusive
felicities as these are the largesses of
the Prince of the Air, who once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temted
to have enveigled <hi>even Christ
himself,</hi> Mat. 4.</p>
            <p>But Gods proposals are more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere:
he knows how sandy, how false
a foundation all these external things
must make, and therefore warns us not
to build so much as our present satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon them, but shews us a more
certain, a more compendious way to
acquire what we gasp after, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us that as Godliness in respect
of the next, so <hi>contentment</hi> for this
<pb facs="tcp:106844:4"/>
world <hi>is great gain</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 6. It
is indeed the <hi>unum necessarium,</hi> the
one point in which all the lines of
wordly happiness are concentred, and
to complete its excellence, tis to be had
at home: nay indeed only there. We
need not ramble in wild pursuits after
it, we may form it within our own
breasts: no man wants materials for
it, that knows but how to put them
together.</p>
            <p>And the directing to that skill
is the only design of the ensuing Tract,
which coming upon so kind an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
may at least hope for an unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd
reception. Contentment is a
thing we all profess to aspire to, and
therefore it cannot be thought an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly
office to endeavor to conduct
men to it. How far the ensuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
<pb facs="tcp:106844:5"/>
may tend to that end, I
must leave to the judgment, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the Reader, only desiring
him that he will weigh them with
that seriousness which befits a thing
wherein both his happiness and duty
are concern'd: for in this (as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other instances) God has so twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them together, that we cannot be
innocently miserable. The present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities,
have an appendant guilt,
which will consign us to a more irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versible
state of dissatisfaction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

in himself, can receive
no accession to his felicity
by the poor contributions
of men. He cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be suppos'd to have made them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
intuition of increasing, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
his happiness. And this his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106844:6"/>
design is very visible in all the parts
of his Economy towards them. When
lapsed man had counterplotted against
himself, defeated the purpose of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
goodness, and plunged his whole
nature into the opposite state of endless mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
he yet reinforc'd his first design, and
an expedient as full of wonder as mercy,
the death of his Son, recovers him to
his former capacity of bliss. And that it
might not only be a bare capacity, he
has added all other methods proper to
work upon a rational creature. He has
shewed him his danger, set before him in
perspective that eternal Tophet, which
he is advis'd to shun. On the other side
he has no less lively describ'd the heavenly
Jerusalem, the Celestial country to which
he is to aspire: nay farther has levell'd
his road to it, leads him not as he did
the Israelites thro the wilderness, thro
intricate mazes to puzle his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
thro <hi>a land of drought wherein were
fiery Serpents and Scorpions,</hi> Deut. 8. 15.
to discourage and affright him: but has in
the Gospel chalkt out a plain, a safe, nay
a plesant path; as much superior both in
the ease of the way, and in the end to
which it leads, as heaven is to Canaan.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106844:6"/>
2. BY doing this he has not only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
our grand and ultimate happiness,
but provided for our intermedial also.
Those Christian duties which are to carry
us to heaven, are our refreshments, our
viaticum in our journy: his yoke is not
to gall and fret us, but an engine by which
we may with ease (and almost insensibly)
draw all the clogs and incumbrances of
humane life. For whether we take Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in its whole complex, or in its
several and distinct branches, tis certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the most excellent, the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
art of happy living: its very
tasks are rewards, and its precepts are
nothing but a divine sort of Alchymy, to
sublime at once our nature and our ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
               <p>3. THIS may be evidenc'd in every
particular of the Evangelical law: but
having formerly made some attemt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it in another<note n="*" place="margin">Decay of Christian Piety.</note> tract, I shall
not here reassume the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
I shall only single out one
particular precept, wherein happiness is
not (as in the others) only implied, and
must be catcht at the rebound by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and event; but is literally exprest,
and is the very matter of the duty; I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106844:7"/>
mean the precept of acquiescence and
<hi>Contentment.</hi> Happiness and this true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Contentment, being terms so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible,
that to bid us be content, is but
another phrase for bidding us be happy.</p>
               <p>4. TEMPORAL enjoiments, such as
are plesure, wealth, honor, and the rest,
tho they make specious pretences to be
the mesure of human happiness, are all of
them justly discarded by the Philosopher
in his Ethics, upon this one considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that coming from abroad they may be
with-held or taken from us: and our tenure
being precarious, we even for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
are unhappy in our most desirable pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
because we still are liable to be
so. And therefore he concludes, that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
must be placed in the mind and soul,
which stands without the reach of fortune;
and in the practice of vertue, which in
its own nature, and not in its contingent
use is truly good, and therefore certainly
renders the possessors such.</p>
               <p>5. BUT this practice being diffused
thro the whole extent of Moral duty, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus
thought he had deserved well of
human nature, when he drew it up in two
short words, to <hi>sustain</hi> and <hi>abstain:</hi> that
is to bear with constancy adverse events,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106844:7"/>
and with moderation enjoy those that are
prosperous. Which complexure of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
is yet more fully, as well as more
compendiously exprest in the single no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Contentment:</hi> which involves the
patient bearing of all misadventures, and
generous contemt of sensual illectives.
This state of mind the Greeks express
by calling it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or self-sufficiency,
which, we know properly speaking, is one
of the incommunicable attributes of the
divine nature: and the Stoics expresly
pretend, that by it mortal men are enabled
to rival their Gods; in Seneca's phrase,
to make a controversy with Jupiter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
But abating the insolent blasphemy
of an independent felicity, Christianity
acknowledges a material truth in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion:
and St. Paul declares of himself,
that having <hi>learnt how to want and how
to abound, and in whatever state he happens
to be in, therewith to be content: he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to do all things thro Christ that strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
him,</hi> Phil. 4. 11. 12, 13. <hi>and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
to possess all things.</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 10.</p>
               <p>6. WHICH great event comes about,
not only because all good things are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
in the divine nature, and he who by
Vertue and Religion possesses Him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106844:8"/>
by, in a full equivalence has every thing;
but also upon human mesures, and the
principles of Philosophy: the compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
address to wealth, as Plato rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
being not to encrease possessions,
but lessen desires. And if so, twill follow
that the contented man must be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provided for, being so entirely satisfied
with what he has, as to have no desires at
all. Indeed tis truly said of covetous men,
and is equally verified of all who have any
desire to gratify, that they want no less
what they have, then what they have not:
but the reverse of that Paradox is really
made good by <hi>Contentment,</hi> which bestowes
on men the enjoiment of whatever they
have, and also whatever they have not;
and by teaching to want nothing, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
secures not to want happiness.</p>
               <p>7. ON the other side this one grace
being absent, it is not in the power of any
success or affluence to make life a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thing. Let all the materials of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happiness be amast together and flung
upon one man, they will without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
be but like the fatal prize of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia's
treason, who was prest to death with
the weight of her booty. He that has the
elements of felicity, and yet cannot form
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106844:8"/>
them into a satisfaction, is more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
miserable then he that wants them:
for he who wants them has yet something
to hope for, and thinks if he had them
he might be happy; but he who insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly
possesses them, has no reserve,
has not so much as the Flattery of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation:
for he has nothing left to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and yet can be as little said to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>
               <p>8. HE therefore that would have the
extract, the quintessence of happiness, must
seek it in Content. All outward accessions
are but the dross and earthy part: this alone
is the spirit, which when tis once separated,
depends not upon the fate of the other;
but preserves its vigor when that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroi'd.
St. Paul whom I before mention'd,
is a ready instance of it, who professes to
be <hi>content in what ever state.</hi> Contentment
being not so inseparately link'd to external
things, but that they may subsist apart.
That those are often without it we are
too sure, and that it may be without them
is as certainly true; tho by our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
we have not so many examples of
it. A heart that rightly computes the
difference between temporals and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
may resolve with the Prophet, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106844:9"/>
the figtree shall not blossom, neither
shall fruit be in the vines, the labor of the
olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no
meat; the flocks shall be cut off from the
fold, and there shall be no herds in the stall;
yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in
the God of my Salvation.</hi> Hab. 3. 17. 18.
He that has God need not much deplore
the want of any thing else: nor can he that
considers the plenty and glory of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
state, be much dejected with the
want or the abjectness of his present.</p>
               <p>9. YET so indulgent is God to our
infirmities, that knowing how unapt our
impatient natures are to <hi>walk</hi> only <hi>by
faith, and not at all by sight</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 7. he
is pleas'd to give us fair antepasts of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
here, dispenses his temporal
blessings tho not equally, yet so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,
that he that has least, has enough to
oblige not only his acquiescence, but his
thankfulness. Tho every man has not all
he wishes, yet he has that which is more
valuable then that he complains to want;
nay which he himself could worse spare
were it put to his option.</p>
               <p>10. AND now from such a disposure of
things who would not expect that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
should be the cheerfullest part of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106844:9"/>
creation: that the <hi>sun should</hi> not more
<hi>rejoice to run his course</hi> Psal. 19. 5. then
man should to finish his: that a journy
which has so blessed an end, and such
good accommodation by the way, should
be past with all imaginable alacrity, and
that we should live here practicers and
learners, of that state of unmix'd inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
joies to which we aspire. But
alas if we look upon the universality of
men, we shall find it nothing so; but
while all other creatures gladsomly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the order of their creation, take ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in those things God has assign'd for
them, we with a fullen perversness quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
at what we should enjoy, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing make it our business, not to fit
it for our use, but to find out some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celed
quality which may render it unfit.
We look insidiously upon our blessings,
like men that design'd only to pick a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and start a pretence for mutining.
From hence it is that man who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
the Lord of the world, to whose
satisfaction all inferior beings were to
contribute, is now the unhappiest of the
creatures: nay as if the whole order of
the universe were inverted, he becomes
slave to his own vassals, courts all these
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106844:10"/>
little sublunary things with such passion,
that if they prove coy and fly his embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he is mad and desperate: if they fling
themselves into his Arms, he is then glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and satiated; like Amnon <hi>he hates
more then he loved</hi> 2 Sam. 13. 15. and is sicker
of his possession, then he was of his desire.</p>
               <p>10. AND thus will it ever be till we
can keep our desires more at home, and
not suffer them to ramble after things
without our reach. That honest Roman
who from his extraordinary industry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his little spot of ground received such
an increase as brought him under suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of witchcraft, is a good example
for us. God has placed none of us in so
barren a soil, in so forlorn a state, but
there is somthing in it which may afford
us comfort; let us husband that to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
and tis scarce imaginable what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements,
even he that appears the most
miserable may make of his condition.
But if in a sullen humor we will not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
our own field, because we have
perhaps more mind to our neighbors, we
may thank our selves if we starve. The
despising of what God has already given
us, is sure but a cold invitation to farther
bounty. Men are indeed forced somtimes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106844:10"/>
to reward the mutinous: but God is not
to be so attaqued, nor is it that sort of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
which can ever force heaven. The
Heathen could say that Jupiter sent his
plagues among the poorer sort of men,
because they were alwaies repining: and
indeed there is so much of truth in the
observation, that our impatience and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
at our present condition, is the
greatest provocation to God to make it
worse.</p>
               <p>11. IT must therefore be resolv'd to be
very contrary to our interest, and surely
tis no less too our duty. It is so if we do
but own our selves men, for in that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd
a subordination and submission to that
power which made us so; and to dispute
his managery of the world, to make other
distributions of it then he has don, is to
renounce our subjection, and set up for
dominion. But this is yet more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as we are Christians, it being a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
part of the Evangelical discipline,
cherefully to conform to any condition: to
<hi>know how to be abased, and how to abound,
to be full and to be hungry,</hi> Phil. 4. 12. <hi>to be
careful for nothing</hi> ver. 6. Nay so little do's
Christ give countenance to our peevish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
our wanton out-cries when we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106844:11"/>
are not hurt, that he requires more then a
contentment, an exultancy and transport
of joy even under the heaviest pressures,
under reproches and persecutions. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
ye in that day, and leap for joy</hi> Lu. 6.
23. And sure nothing can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this, then to be alwaies whining
and complaining, crying in the Prophets
phrase, <hi>my leanness my leanness, wo is me.</hi>
Isa. 24. 16. When perhaps Moses's simile
do's better fit our state, <hi>Iesurun waxed fat
and kicked.</hi> Deut. 32. 15.</p>
               <p>12. AND as this querulous humor is
against our interest and duty, so is it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
against our ease. Tis a sickness of
the mind, a perpetual gnawing and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the appetite without any possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of satisfaction: and indeed is the same
in the heart which the <hi>Caninus appetitus</hi>
is in the stomach, to which we may aptly
enough apply that description we find in
the Prophet, <hi>he shall snatch on the right
hand and be hungry, and he shall eat on the
left and not be satisfied,</hi> Esay. 9. 20. Where
this sharp, this fretting humor abounds,
nothing converts into nurishment: every
new accession do's but excite some new
desire; and as tis observ'd of a trencher-fed
dog, that he tasts not one bit for the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106844:11"/>
expectation of the next; so a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
mind is so intent upon his pursuits,
that he has no relish of his acquests. So
that what the Prophet speaks of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
is equally appliable to all other
sorts of Male-contents: <hi>he enlarges his
desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot
be satisfied,</hi> Hab. 2. 5. And sure if the
<hi>desire accomplished</hi> be as Solomon saies
<hi>sweet to the soul,</hi> Prov. 13. 19. it must
be exceedingly bitter, to be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to endless unaccomplishable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
and yet this is the torture which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
repining uncontented spirit provides
for it self.</p>
               <p>13. WHAT a madness is it then for
men to be so desperatly bent against their
interest and duty, as to renounce even
their ease too for company? One would
think this age were sensual enough to be
at defiance with the least shadow of unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
It is so I am sure where it ought
not, every thing is laborious when tis in
compliance with their duty, a few minutes
spent in praier <hi>Oh what a weariness is it!</hi>
Mal. 213. If they chance but to miss a
meal, they are ready to cry out, their <hi>knees
are weak thro fasting.</hi> Psa. 109. 23. yet
they can without regret, or any self-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106844:12"/>
macerate and cruciate themselves
with anxious cares and vexations, and
as the Apostle speaks 1 Tim. 6. 10. <hi>pierce
themselves thro with many sorrows.</hi> That
proposal therefore which was very rashly
made by St. Peter to our Saviour, <hi>Master
pity thy self,</hi> Mat. 16. 22. which we render
<hi>be it far from thee,</hi> would here be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
motion to the generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
who are commonly made unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
not by any thing without them, but
by those restless impatiencies that are
within them.</p>
               <p>14. IT may therefore be a seasonable
office to endevor the appeasing those
storms, by recalling them to those sober
rational considerations, which may shew
as well the folly, as uneasiness of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
unsatisfiable humor. Tis certain
that in true reasoning, we can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
whereon to found it, but a great
deal to enforce the contrary. Indeed tis
so much against the dictate of reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
nature to affect damage, sin, and
torment, that were there nothing else to
be said but what I have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
it might competently discover the
great unreasonableness of this sin.</p>
               <p>15. BUT we need not confine our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106844:12"/>
to reason, as it is only a judg of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
and advantage; but enlarge it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
notion, as it is judg of equity and
right: in which respect also it gives as
cleer and peremtory a sentence against
all murmuring and impatience. To evince
this I shall insist upon these particulars.
1. that God is debtor to no man, and
therefore what ever he affords to any, it
is upon bounty not of right, a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
not a due. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. that this bounty is
not streight or narrow, confin'd to some
few particular persons, and wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skipping
the rest, but more or less univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
diffused to all. So that he who has
the least, cannot justly say but he has bin li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally
dealt with. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> that if we compare
our blessings with our allaies, our good
things with our evil, we shall find our
good far surmounting. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> that we shall
find them yet more so, if we compare
them with the good we have don, as on
the contrary we shall find our afflictions
scarce discernible if balanced with our
sins. 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> that as God is Rector of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
so it appertains to him to make such
allotments, such distributions, as may best
preserve the state of the whole. 6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> that
God notwithstanding that universal care,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106844:13"/>
has also a peculiar aspect on every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Person, and disposes to him what
he discerns best for him in special. 7<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> if
we compare our adversities, with those
of other men, we shall alwaies find som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that equals if not exceeds our own.
All these are certain irrefragable truths,
and there is none of them single but may,
if well prest upon the mind, charm it
into a calmness and resignation; but
when there is such a conspiration of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
it must be a very obstinate pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that can resist them: or should they
fail to enforce a full conviction; will yet
introduce those subsidiary proofs which
I have to alledg, so advantagiously, as
will being put altogether, amount unto
perfect and uncontroulable Evidence.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="section">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:106844:13"/>
               <head>SECT. II.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Gods Absolute Soveraignty.</head>
               <p>1. THE first proposition that God is
debtor to no man, is too clear and
apparent to require much of illustration:
for as he is a free agent and may act as
he pleases, so he is the sole proprietary
and can wrongfully detain from none,
because all original right is in himself.
This has bin so much acknowledged by
the blindest Heathens, that none of them
durst make insolent addresses to their
Gods, challenge any thing of them as of
debt, but by sacrifices and praiers own'd
their dependance and wants, and implor'd
supplies. And sure Christianity teaches
us not to be more sawcy. If those Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
who ow'd their very being to their
votaries, were yet acknowledged to be the
spring and source of all, we can with no
pretence deny it to that supreme power
in <hi>whom we live, move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
Acts. 17. 28. For if it were merely an
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106844:14"/>
act of his choice to give us a being, all
his subsequent bounties can have no other
original then his own good plesure. We
could put no obligation upon God before
we were: and when we began to be, we
were his creatures, and so by the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable
right owe our selves to him,
but can have no antecedent title on which
to clame any thing from him: so that the
Apostle might well make the challenge
which he doth on Gods behalf, <hi>who hath
given any thing unto him, and it shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd
to him again?</hi> Rom. 11. 35.</p>
               <p>2. Now ordinary discretion teaches us
not to be too bold in our expectations from
one to whom we can plead no right. It has
as little of prudence as modesty, to press
impudently upon the bounty of a Patron,
and do's but give him temtation (at least
pretence) to deny. And if it be thus with
men, who possibly may somtimes have an
interest, sometimes a vanity to oblige us; it
must be much more so towards God, who
cannot be in want of us, and therefore need
not buy us: <hi>our good,</hi> as the Psalmist speaks,
<hi>extends not to him.</hi> Psal. 16. 2. He has a
fundamental right in that little we are,
which will stand good tho it should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be corroborated by greater benefits.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106844:14"/>
With what an humble bashfulness should
we then sue for any thing, who have no
argument to invite the least donation?
being already so preingag'd, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
mortgage so much as our selves in
consideration of any new favor: and surely
extravagant hopes do very ill befit people
in this condition. We see the modesty
of good Mephibosheth, who tho he was
by a slanderous accusation outed of half
the estate David had given him, yet upon
a reflexion that he deriv'd it all from his
good plesure, disputed not the sentence,
but cherefully resign'd the whole to the
same disposure, from which he received
it, saying, <hi>Yea, let him take all.</hi> 2 Sam. 19,
30. A rare example and fit for imitation,
as being adapted to the present case, not
only in that one circumstance of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
receiv'd all from the King, but also
in that of the attainder of his blood, which
he confesses in the former part of the verse,
for <hi>all of my fathers house were but dead men
before my Lord.</hi> And alas may we not say
the very same? was not our whole race
tainted in our first Parent? So that if God
had not the primary title of vassalage,
he would in our fall have acquir'd that
of confiscation and escheat. And can we
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106844:15"/>
think our selves then in terms to capitulate
and make our own conditions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
God should humor us in all our wild
demands?</p>
               <p>3. THIS is indeed to keep up that old
rebellion of our Progenitor, for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in a discontent with that portion
God had assign'd him, and coveting what
he had restrein'd him. Nay indeed it
comes up to the height of the Devils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
the attemting <hi>to be as God.</hi> Gen.
3. 5. For tis an endevor to wrest the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery
out of his hands, to supersede his
Autority of dispensing to us, and to carve
for our selves. This is so mad an insolence,
that were it possible to state a case exactly
parallel between man and man, it would
raise the indignation of any that but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to ingenuity. Yet this is, without
Hyperbole, the true meaning of every mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring
repining thought we entertain.</p>
               <p>4. BUT as bad as it is, who is there
of us, that can in this particular say <hi>we
have made our heart clean?</hi> Prov. 20. 9. Tis
true we make some formal ackowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
sometimes that we receive all from
Gods gift, custom teaches us from our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
after every meal we eat to give him
thanks (tho even that is now thought too
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106844:15"/>
much respect, and begins to be discarded
as unfashionable.) Yet sure he cannot be
thought to do that in earnest, that has all
the time of his eating bin grumbling that
his table abounds not with such delicacies
as his neighbors. And yet at this rate
God knows are most of our thanksgivings.
Indeed we have not so much ordinary ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
to God, as we have to men. The
common proverb teaches us not too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to pry into the blemishes of what
is given us: but on Gods gifts we sit as
Censors, nicely examine every thing
which is any way disagreable to our
fancies, and as if we dealt with him under
the notion of chapmen, disparage it, as
Solomon saies buiers use to do, <hi>it is
naught, it is naught, saith the buier</hi> Prov.
20. 14. Nay we seem yet more absurdly
to change the scene, and as if God were
to make oblations to us, we as critically
observe the defects of his benefactions,
as the Levitical priests were to do those
of the sacrifice, and (like angry Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
scornfully reject, what ever do's not
perfectly answer our wanton appetites.</p>
               <p>5. AND now should God take us at
our words, withdraw all those blessings
which we so fastidiously despise, what a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106844:16"/>
condition were we in? Tis sure we have
nothing to plead in reverse of that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
There is nothing in it against ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
for he takes but his own. This he
intimates to Israel Hos. 2. 9. I will <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
and take away my corn in the time
thereof, and my wine in the season thereof,
and will recover my wool and my flax:</hi> in
which he asserts his own propriety, my
corn, my wine &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and recalls them to the
remembrance that they were but usufru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries:
and tis as evident that our
tenure is but the same. Nay this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
would not be repugnant even to
mercy, for even that is not obliged
still to prostitute its self to our contemt.
I am sure such a tolerance is beyond all
the mesures of humane lenity. Should
any of us offer an alms to an indigent
wretch, and he when he sees tis Silver,
should murmur and exclame that it is
not Gold, would we not draw back our
hand, and reserve our charity for a more
worthy object? Tis true indeed Gods
thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor
our narrow bowels equal mesures for the
divine compassions, and we experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
find that his long-suffering infinitly
exceeds ours, yet we know he do's in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106844:16"/>
parable of the Lord and the servant Mat.
18. declare that he will proportion his
mercy by ours, in that instance; and we
have no promise that he will not do it
in this: nay we have all reason to expect
he should; for since his wisdom promts
him to do nothing in vain, and all his
bounty to us is design'd to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
when he sees that end utterly fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by our discontents, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
should he continue that to us which
we will be never the better for?</p>
               <p>6. BESIDES tho he be exceedingly
patient, yet he is not negligent or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,
he takes particular notice, not
only with what diligence we employ,
but with what affections we resent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his blessings. And as ingratitude is
a vice odious to men, so it is extremely
provoking to God: so that in this sense
also, the words of our Savior are most
true, from <hi>him that hath not (i.e.)</hi> that
hath not a grateful sense and value, <hi>shall
be taken away even that he hath</hi> Mat. 25.
29. But we may find a threatning of this
kind yet more express to Israel, <hi>because
thou servedst not the Lord thy God with
gladness and with joifulness of heart for
the abundance of all things, therefore shalt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106844:17"/>
thou serve thine enemies, whom the Lord
God will send among thee, in hunger and in
thirst and in nakedness and in want of all
things</hi> Deut 28. 27. 28. a sad and dismal
inversion, yet founded wholly in the want
of that cheerful recognition which God
expected from them. And if Israel the
lot of his own inheritance, that people
whom he had singled out from all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the world, could thus forfeit his
favor by unthankfulness, sure none of us
can suppose we have any surer entail of
it. In a word as God loves a cheerful
giver, so he also loves a cheerful receiver.
One that complies with his end in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing,
by taking a just complacence in
his gifts. But the querulous and unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
reproch his bounty: accuse him of
illiberality and narrowness of mind. So
that he seems even in his honor engag'd
to bring them to a righter apprehension
of him, and by a deprivation teach them
the value of those good things, which
they could not learn by the enjoiment.</p>
               <p>7. IF therefore ingenuity and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
cannot, yet at least let prudence
and self-love engage us against this sin
of <hi>Murmuring,</hi> which we see do's abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
justify the character the Wise man
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106844:17"/>
gives when he tells us <hi>tis unprofitable</hi> Wis.
1. 11. he might have said pernicious also, for
so it evidenly is in its effects. Let us then
arm our selves against it, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
impress deeply upon our minds the
present consideration, that God ows us
nothing, and that what ever we receive is
an alms, and not a tribute. Diogenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked what wine drank the most ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
answered, that which is drunk at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
cost. And this circumstance we
can never miss of to recommend our good
things to us: for be they little or much,
they come gratis. When therefore in
a pettish mood we find our selves apt to
charge God foolishly, and to think him
strait-handed towards us, let us ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
we hear God expostulating with
us, as the housholder in the parable, <hi>Friend
I do thee no wrong: is it not lawful for me
to do what I will with mine own?</hi> Mat. 20.
15. If God have not the right of dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
let us find out those that have, and
see how much better we shall speed, but
if he hath, let us take heed of disputing
with him: we that subsist merely by his
favor, had need court and cherish it by
all the arts of humble observance. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man is ready to say how ill beggary
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106844:18"/>
and pride do agree. The first qualification
we cannot put off; O let us not provide
it of the other so inconvenient so odious
an adjunct. Let us leave off prescribing
to God (which no ingenuous man would
do to an earthly benefactor) and let us
betake our selves to a more holy and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful
policy, the acknowledgment of
past mercies, and our own unworthiness.
This was Jacobs method, <hi>I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the least of all the mercies, and of all
the truth which thou hast shew'd unto thy
servant: for with my staff I passed over this
Iordan, and now I am become two bands,</hi>
and with this humble preface he introduces
his petition for rescue in his present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
<hi>Deliver me I pray thee from the hand
of my brother,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. 32. 10. 11. An
excellent pattern of Divine Rhetoric,
which the success demonstrates to have
bin very prevalent. And we cannot tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
a better copy, to render our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
as succesful. Indeed we are so ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
destitute of all arguments from our
selves, that we can make no reasonable
form of address, if we found it not in
somthing of God: and there is nothing
even in him adapted to our purpose, but
his mercy; nor can that be so advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageously
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106844:18"/>
urged by any thing, as by the
former instances, it has given of it self:
for as God only is fit to be a precedent to
himself, so he loves to be so. Thus we
find, not only Moses, but God often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
his miraculous favors towards
Israel, as an argument to do more: let us
therefore accost him in his own way, and
by a frequent and grateful recounting of
his former mercies, engage him to future.
Nor need we be at a loss for matter of
such recollection, if we will but seriously
consider what we have already received,
which is the subject of the next Section.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">

               <head type="sub">Of Gods Vnlimited Bounty.</head>
               <p>1. IT is the known character of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
nature, to write injuries in
Marble, and benefits in dust: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
some (as Seneca well observes) may
acquit themselves of this imputation as
to man, yet scarce any do so in relation
to God. Tis true indeed the charge must
be a little varied; for God neither will
nor can do us injury: yet we receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing that is adverse with such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
as if it were, and engrave that
in our memories with indelible chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
whilst his great and reall benefits
are either not at all observ'd, or with so
transient an advertence, that the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of dust is beyond our pitch, and we may
be more properly said to write them in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Nay so far are we from keeping re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
and registers of his favors, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
those standing and fixt ones which
sense can promt us to (without the aid of
our memories) cannot obtain our notice.</p>
               <p>2. WERE it not thus, it were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for men to be so perpetually in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106844:19"/>
complaining Key, as if their voices were
capable of no other sound. One wants
this, and another that, and a third som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beyond them both, and so on <hi>ad
infinitum;</hi> when all this while every one
of them enjoies a multitude of good things
without any remark. That very breath
wherewith they utter their complaints, is
a blessing, and a fundamental one too: for
if God should withdraw that, they were
incapable of whatsoever else they either
have, or desire. Tis true that some mens
impatiencies have risen so high, as to cast
away life, because it was not clothed with
all circumstances they wisht. Yet these
are rare instances, and do only shew such
mens depraved judgment of things. A
rich Jewel is not the less valuable, because
a mad man in his raving fit flings it into
the fire: but as to the generality of men,
the devil (tho a liar) gave a true account
of their sense, when he said, <hi>Skin for skin,
and all that a man hath will he give for his
life.</hi> Job. 2. 4. And tho perhaps in an
angry fit many men have with Jonas Chap.
4. 3. <hi>wisht to die,</hi> yet ten to one should
death then come, they would be as willing
to divert it, as was the man in the Apologue,
who wearied with his burden of sticks, flung
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106844:20"/>
it down and call'd for death, but when
he came, own'd no other occasion for him,
but to be helpt up again with his bundle.
I dare in this appeal to the experience of
those, who have seemed very weary of life,
whether when any suddain danger has sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
them, it has not as suddenly altered
their mind, and made them more desire
life, then before they abhor'd it. Tis the
common saying, As long as there is life
there is hope: there is so as to secular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
for what strange revolutions do we
often see in the age of a man? from what
despicable beginnings have many arriv'd
to the most splendid conditions? Of which
we have divers modern as well as ancient
instances. And indeed tis admirable to see
what time and industry will (with Gods
blessing) effect. <hi>But there is no work, nor
device, nor knowledg, nor wisdom in the
grave.</hi> Ecc. 9. 10. we can improve no more
when we are once transplanted thither.</p>
               <p>3. BUT this is yet much more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
in respect of our spiritual state.
Our life is the <hi>day wherein we are to work.</hi>
Joh. 9. 4. (yea to work out our Salvation:)
but <hi>when the night comes</hi> (when death o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertakes)
<hi>no man can work.</hi> Now alas
when tis consider'd how much of this day
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106844:20"/>
the most of us have loiter'd away, how
many of us have stood idle till the sixt
or ninth hour, it will be our concern
not to have our day close before the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh.
Nay alas tis yet worse with us:
we have not only bin idle, but very often
ill busied; so that we have a great part
of our time to unravel, and that is not
to be don in a moment. For tho our works
may fitly enough be represented by the
Prophets comparison of a <hi>spiders web,</hi> Isay.
59. 5. yet they want the best pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
even of that; they cannot be so soon
undon. Vices that are radicated by time
and custom, lie too deep to be lightly
swept away. Tis no easy thing to perswade
our selves to the will of parting with
them. Many violences we must offer to
our selves, a long and strict course of
mortification must be gon thro, ere we
can find in our hearts to bid them be gon:
and yet when we do so, they are not so
tractable as the Centurions servants. They
will indeed come when-ever we bid them,
but they will scarce go so: they must be
expell'd by force and by slow degrees; we
must fight for every inch of ground we
gain from them: and as God could not
assist the Israelites to subdue the Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106844:21"/>
at once Deut. 7. 22. so neither ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
do's he us to master perfectly our
corruptions. Now a process of this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is not to be dispatcht on a sudden. And
yet this is not all our task, for we have not
only ill habits to extirpate, but we have
also good ones to acquire: tis not a mere
negative vertue will serve our turns, nor
will emty lamps enter us into the marriage
chamber, Mat. 25. 10. <hi>We must add to our
faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge, and to
knowledge temperance,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 1. 5. No
link must be wanting of that sacred chain,
but we must (as the same Apostle advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
<hi>be holy in all manner of conversation.</hi>
1 Pet. 1. 15.</p>
               <p>4. AND now I would desire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
seriously to consider, whether he can
upon good grounds tell himself that this
so difficult (and yet so necessary) a work
is effectually wrought in him. If it be,
he is a happy man, and can with no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
complain of any external want:
(he that is fed with Manna, must be strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perverse if he murmur for a belly-full of
<hi>leeks and onions.</hi> Num. 11. 5.) But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
he owes infinite thanks to God, that
has spared him time for this important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and did not put a period to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106844:21"/>
life, before he had begun a spiritual.
For I fear there are among the best of us
few of so entire an innocence, but they
may remember some, either habits or acts
of sin, in which it would have bin dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for them to have bin snatcht away.
And then how comprehensive, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
a mercy has life bin to them, when
it has carried eternity in its womb, and
their continuance on earth has qualified
them for heaven? Neither are such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
only to look on it as a blessing in
the retrospect, as it relates to the past,
but also in the present and future: which
if they continue to employ well, do's not
only confirm, but advance their reward.
Besides God may please by them to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
himself, make them instrumental to
his service; which as it is the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
so it is also the greatest satisfaction
to a good heart. He shews himself too
mercenary that so longs for his reward, as
to grow impatient of his attendances: he
that loves God, thinks himself blest in the
opportunity of doing work, as well as
in receiving wages. Thus we see how
life is under all these aspects a mercy to
a pious man, and such as not only obliges
him to contentment, but gratitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106844:22"/>
5. BUT supposing a man cannot give
this comfortable account of his life, but
is conscious that he has spent it to a very
different purpose, yet do's not that at all
lessen his obligations to God, who meant
he should have emploi'd it better, and
that he has not don so is merely his own
fault. Nay indeed the worse his state
is, the greater mercy it is, that God has
not yet made it irreversible, that he has
not cut him off at once from the earth and
the possibility of heaven too, but affords
him yet a longer <hi>day, if</hi> yet <hi>he will hear his
voice</hi> Psal. 95. 7. This long-suffering is one
of the most transcendent acts of divine
goodness, &amp; therefore the Apostle rightly
stiles it <hi>the riches of his goodness and long-suffering
and forbearance</hi> Rom. 2. 4. and so
at last we commonly acknowledg it, when
we have worn it out, and can no longer
receive advantage by it. What a value
do's a gasping despairing soul put upon a
small parcel of that time, which before
he knew not how fast enough to squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
Oh that men would set the same e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimate
on it before, and then certainly, as
it would make them better husbands of
it, so it would also render them more
thankful for it, <hi>Accounting that the long-suffering
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106844:22"/>
of our Lord is Salvation.</hi> 2 Pet.
3. 15.</p>
               <p>6. INDEED did men but rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the benefit of life upon this score,
all secular encumbrances and uneasinesses
of it would be overwhelmed, and stand
only as Cyphers in the account. What
a shame is it then that we should spend
our breath in sighs and out-cries? which
if we would employ to those nobler ends
for which twas given, would supersede
our complaints, and make us confess we
were well dealt with, that <hi>our life</hi> (tho
bare and stript of all outward accessaries)
<hi>is given us for a prey.</hi> Jer. 45. 5. And indeed
he that has yet the great work of life to
do, can very ill spare time or sorrow to
bestow upon the regretting any temporal
distress, since his whole stock is little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to bewail and repair his neglects
of his eternal concerns. Were our lives
therefore destitute of all outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
nay were they nothing but a scene
of perpetual disasters, yet this one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of life would infinitly outweigh
them all, and render our murmurings very
inexcusable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:106844:23"/>
7. BUT God has not put this to the
utmost trial, has never plac'd any man
in such a state of unmixt calamity, but
that he still affords many and great allaies:
he finds it fit somtimes to defalk some of
our outward comforts, and perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter
others, but he never takes all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
This must be acknowledged, if
we do but consider how many things
there are in which the whole race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
do in common partake. The four
Elements, fire and water, air and earth, do
not more make up every mans composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then they supply his needs: the whole
host of heaven, the Sun, Moon, and Stars,
<hi>Moses</hi> will tell us, are by <hi>God divided to
all nations under the whole Heaven,</hi> Deut.
4. 19. Those resplendent bodies, equally
afford their light and influence to all.
The sun shines as bright on the poor Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
as on the most magnificent Palace;
and the stars have their benign Aspects, as
well for him, that <hi>is behind the Mill,</hi> as for
<hi>him that sitteth on the Throne.</hi> Ex. 11. 5. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
(the great incendiary below) breeds
no confusion in those celestial Orbs, but
they are every mans tresure, yet no mans
peculiar (as if they meant to teach us, that
our love of appropriation <hi>descends not from
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106844:23"/>
above</hi> Jam. 3. 15. is no heavenly quality.)</p>
               <p>8. AND as they make no distinction
of the ranks and degrees of men, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do they of their vertues. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior,
tells us God causes <hi>his Sun to rise on
the good and on the evil, and sendeth rain
on the just and on the unjust,</hi> Mat. 5. 45. If
now we descend lower to the sublunary
creatures, they equally pay their homage
to man, do not disdain the dominion of
the poor, and submit to that of the rich,
but shew us that that their instinct extends
to the whole nature. An horse draws the
poor mans plough, as tamely as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
chariot, and the beggars hungry cur
follows him with as much obsequiousness
and affection as the pamper'd lap-dogs of
the nicest Ladies. The sheep obey a poor
mercenary shepherd as well as they did the
Daughters of the wealthy <hi>Laban</hi> Gen. 29.
9. or of <hi>Iethro</hi> a Prince Exod. 2. 16. and as
willingly yield their fleece to clothe <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi>
as to make purple for <hi>Dives.</hi> And
as animals, so vegetables are as communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of their qualities to one man as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The corn nurishes, the fruits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,
the flowers delight, the simples
cure the poor man as well as the rich.</p>
               <p>9. BUT I foresee it will be objected,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106844:24"/>
that these natural privileges are insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
because they are evacuated by
those positive laws which bound proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that therefore tho one man could
use the creatures as well as another, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man has them not to use. I answer,
that for some of the things I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
they are still in their native latitude,
cannot be inclosed or monopoliz'd. The
most ravenous oppressor could never yet
lock up the sun in his chest: <hi>he that laies
house to house and land to land, till there be
no place</hi> Esay. 5. 8. cannot inclose the
common air: and the like may be said of
divers of the rest, so that there are some
(and those no mean) blessings, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
still the indefeisible right of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in general.</p>
               <p>10. As for those other things which
are liable to the restrictive terms of <hi>meum</hi>
and <hi>tuum,</hi> tis not to be deni'd but there
is vast difference in the dispensing them;
as great as <hi>Nathans</hi> parable describes, when
he speaks of the numerous flocks of the
rich man, and the <hi>single ewe lamb of the
poor,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 2. yet there is scarce any
so deplorably indigent, but that by one
means or other, he has or may have the
necessary supports of life. Perhaps they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106844:24"/>
fall not into his lap by birth-right and
inheritance, yet they are acquirable by
labor and industry, which is perhaps the
better tenure. They cannot it may be
arrive to <hi>Sodoms fulness of bread:</hi> yet if
they have not her <hi>abundance of Idleness,</hi>
Ez. 16. 49. they commonly need not want
that, which was the height of <hi>Agurs</hi> wish,
<hi>food convenient,</hi> Pro. 30. 8. Tis true indeed,
if they will fold their hands in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
if with <hi>Solomons Sluggard, they will not
plough by reason of the cold,</hi> they must take
his fate in the summer, as they have his ease
in the winter, <hi>they may beg in harvest, and
have nothing,</hi> Prov. 20. 4. But then tis
visible they are the Authors of their own
necessities. And indeed to men of such
lazy careless natures, tis hard to say, what
degree of Gods bounty can keep them from
want, since we often see the fairest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
dissipated as well by the supine neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
as the riotous prodigality of the
owners. And therefore if men will be
idle, they are not to accuse God, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
if they be indigent.</p>
               <p>11. BUT then there is one case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
men seem more inevitably expos'd, and
that is when by age, sickness, or decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitness,
they are disabled from work;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106844:25"/>
or when their family is too numerous for
their work to maintain. And this indeed
seems the most forlorn state of poverty:
yet God has provided for them also, by
assigning such persons to the care of the
rich; nay he has put an extraordinary mark
of favor on them, given them the honor of
being his proxies and representatives, made
them letters of Attorny (as it were) to
demand relief in his name, and upon his
account. And tho tis too true, that even
that Autority will not prevail with many
of the rich to open their purses, yet even
in this Age of frozen charity, there are
still some who remember upon what terms
they received their wealth, and employ
it accordingly. And tho the number of
them is not so great as were to be wisht,
yet there are in all parts some scattered
here and there like <hi>Cities of refuge</hi> in the
Land, Deut. 19. 2. to which these poor
distressed creatures way flee for succour.
And I think I may say, that between
the legal provisions that are made in this
case and voluntary contributions, there
are not very many that want the things
that are of absolute necessity: and we
know St. <hi>Paul</hi> comprizes those in a small
compass, <hi>food and raiment,</hi> and proposes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106844:25"/>
them as sufficient materials of Content.
1 Tim. 6. 8. I say not this to contract
any mans bowels, or lessen his compassions
to such poor wretches. For how much
soever they lend, I wish as <hi>Ioab</hi> did in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
case to <hi>David,</hi> the Lord <hi>increase
it a hundred-fold,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 3. I only
urge it as an evidence of the assertion I
am to prove, that no man is so preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by God or his disposal of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
but that even he that seems the most
abandon'd has a share in his providence,
and consequently cannot justly murmur,
since even this state which is the highest
instance of human indigence, is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its receits from God.</p>
               <p>12. BUT the number in this form are
but few, compar'd to those in a higher,
for between this and the highest affluence,
how many intermedial degrees are there,
in which men partake not only of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries,
but comforts of life; that have
not only food and raiment, but their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of holy-day and working-day
fare and apparel? He that is but one step
advanced from beggery has so much, he
that has got to a second has more then is
necessary, and so every degree rises in
plenty till it comes to vanity and excess,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106844:26"/>
and even there too there are gradual ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
some having so much fewel for
luxury, that they are at as great a losse for
invention, as others can be for materials,
and complain that there are no farther ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots
left for them to essay. How many
are there who have so cloi'd and glutted
their senses, that they want some other
inlets for plesure, and with the rich man
in the Gospel, are in distress where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
their abundance?</p>
               <p>13. AND sure such as these cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that they have reciev'd good things,
yet generally there are none less conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which is a clear demonstration that
our repinings proceed not from any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of bounty in God, but from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
temper of our own hearts. And as
it is an easier thing to satisfy the cravings
of an hungry, then to cure the nauseous
recoilings of a surfeited stomach; so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the discontents of the poor, are
much easier allai'd then those of the rich;
the indigence of the one has contracted
his desires, and has taught him not to look
farther then a little beyond bare necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
so that a moderate Alms satisfies, and
a liberal transports him: but he who by a
perpetual repletion has his desires stretcht
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106844:26"/>
and extended, is capable of no such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction:
when his enjoiments fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall
all particular pursuits, and he knows
not upon what to fasten his next wish;
yet even then he has some confus'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
appetites, and thinks himself mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
because he cannot tell what would
make him more happy. And yet this is
that envi'd state which men with so much
greediness aspire to, every man looks on
it as the top of felicity to have nothing
more to wish in the world. And yet alas
even that when attain'd, would be their
torment. Let men never think then that
contentment is to be caught by long and
forreign chaces; he is likliest to find it
who sits at home, and duly contemplates
those blessings which God has brought
within his reach, of which every man has
a fair proportion, if he will advert to it.</p>
               <p>14. FOR besides these external acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
(of which the meanest have some,
the middle sort a great deale, and the
uppermost rather too much) man is a
principality within himself, and has in
his composure so many excellent impresses
of his Makers power and goodness, that
he need not ask leave of any exterior thing
to be happy, if he know but aright how
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106844:27"/>
to value himself: the very meanest part
of him, his body is a piece of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
workman-ship, of a most incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
contrivance, as the Psalmist
saies, he is fearfully and wonderfully made;
and tis astonishing to think of what a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
of parts this beautiful fabric is made
up. Nor are they only for shew, but use:
every member, every limb is endowed
with a particular faculty to render it ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the whole; and that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
contexture of veins and arteries, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
and muscles, nerves and tendons,
none are superfluous, but some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contributes to vegetation, sense, or
motion, nay the most noble and most
useful parts are all of them double, not
only as a reserve in case of misadventure
of one part; but also as an instance of the
bounty of the Donor. And indeed it is
observable of <hi>Galen</hi> in his writings, that
after he had taken great care to exemt
himself and all of his Profession from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of the Deity, by saying that
to discourse concerning the Gods, was
the task of speculative Philosophers; yet
coming to write <hi>de usu partium,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the frame of humane bodies,
and therein discovering the wonderful
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106844:27"/>
contrivance of every part in reference to
its self, and also to the whole; their
strength, agility, and various movement,
infinitly surpassing the powers of all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic
engines; he seems to have had the
fate we read of <hi>Saul</hi> in holy Scripture, and
against his genius and purpose, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Prophet; breaking frequently out
into Hymns and sacred raptures; saying,
these Mysteries are more divine then the
<hi>Samothracian</hi> or <hi>Elusinian;</hi> and confessing
they both strictly require, and infinitly
excell the low returnes of human praise.
But beyond the fabric of parts as organic,
what an extract of wonder are our senses,
those <hi>five operations of the Lord</hi> as the son
of <hi>Syrach</hi> rightly (and by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence)
stiles them, Ecclus. 17. 5? By these
we draw all outward objects to our selves;
what were the beauties of the universe to
us, if we had not sight to behold them, or
the most melodious sounds, if we had not
hearing? and so of the rest. And yet these
are not only generally given, but also
preserv'd to the greater part of men, and
perhaps would be to more, did not our
base undervaluing of common mercies,
force God somtimes to instruct us in their
worth, by making us feel what it is to
want them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:106844:28"/>
15. MULTITUDE of refreshments
also God has provided for our bodies,
particularly that of sleep, of which he
has bin so considerate, as in his distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of time, to make a solemn allotment
for it: yet who almost when he lies down
considers the mercy, or when he rises re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresht,
rises thankful also? But if our rest
at any time be interrupted by the cares
of our mind, or pains of our bodies, then,
(and not till then) we consider, that tis
<hi>God who gives his belov'd sleep</hi> Psal. 127. 2.
and think it a blessing worth our esteem.
Thus it is with health, strength, and every
thing else, we despise it whilst we have
it, and impatiently desire it whilest we
have it not; but in the interim sure we
cannot complain, that Gods hand is short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
towards us, when in the ordinary
course of his providence we commonly
enjoy these mercies many years, which
we find so much miss of, if they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
but for a few houres. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there is not a greater instance of
human pravity then our senseless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temt
of blessings, merely because they
are customary; which in true reason is an
argument why we should prize them the
more. When we deal with men, we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106844:28"/>
discern it well enough, he that gives me
once a 100. pounds, I account not so much
my benefactor, as if he made it my
annual revenue; yet God must lose his
thanks, by multiplying his favors; and
his benefits grow more invisible by their
being alwaies before us.</p>
               <p>16. BUT the body (with its enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
is but the lowest instance of Gods
bounty, tis but a decent case for that
inestimable Jewel he has put in it: the
soul, like the Ark, is the thing for which
this whole tabernacle was framed, and
that is a spark of Divinity in which alone
it is that God accomplished his design of
<hi>making man in his own image</hi> Gen. 1. 26.
Twould be too long to attemt an exact
survey of its particular excellencies, the
mere intellectual powers wherewith it is
indued, have exercised the curiosity and
raised the admiration of the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templators
of nature in all ages, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, of so subtile composure is the soul,
that it is inscrutable even to it self: and
tho the simplest man knows he has the
faculties of Imagination, Apprehension,
Memory, Reflecting; yet the learnedst
cannot assign where they are seated, or by
what means they operate. Tis enough
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106844:29"/>
to us that we have them, and many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
uses for them; one whereof (and
a most necessary one) is a thankful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
on the goodness of God who gave
them. He might have made us in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lowest form of creatures, insensible
stocks or stones; or if he had advanc'd
us a step-higher, he might have fixt us
among mere animals, made us perhaps of
the noxious, at best of the tamer sort of
beasts; but he has plac'd us in the highest
rank of visible creatures, and not only
given <hi>Dominion over the works of his
hands</hi> Psal. 8. 6. but has given us reason
wherewith to manage that soveraignty,
without which we had only bin the more
masterful sort of brutes.</p>
               <p>17. YET still the soul is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in a higher notion, that of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
and capacity of endless bliss:
and here indeed it owns its extraction,
and is an image of the first being, whose
felicity is coexistent with himself; this
as it is the most transcendent accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our nature, so it is most univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal.
Whatever disparity there may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
man and man in other respects,
yet in this all are equal, the poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at the gate has a soul as capacious of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106844:29"/>
eternal happiness, as he whose <hi>crumbs</hi> he
begs for (nay somtimes better prepar'd
for it, as that parable shews Luke 16. 21.)
And tho the dignities of earth are the
prize of the rich and noble, the subtle and
designing; yet heaven is as easily mounted
from the dung-hill as the throne, and an
honest simplicity will sooner bring us thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then all the Machiavelian policy.
Nay God has not only design'd us to so
glorious an end, but has don all on his
part to secure us of it, sent his Son to lead
us the way, his spirit to quicken us in
it. We need not dispute how universal
this is; tis sure it concerns all to whom
I am now speaking, those that are within
the pale of the church: and if it should
prove confin'd only to them, the more
peculiar is their obligation, that are thus
singled out from the rest of the world,
and the greater ought to be their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
The heathen Philosopher made
it matter of his solemn acknowledgment
to fortune, that he was born a Grecian and
not a Barbarian: and sure the advantages
of our Christianity are of a much higher
strein, and ought to be infinitly more
celebrated. The Apostle we find often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding
this glorious privilege, as that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106844:30"/>
which makes <hi>fellow citizens with the
Saints, and of the houshold of God,</hi> Ephes. 3.
19. nay which elevates us to a higher state,
<hi>the adoption of sons,</hi> Gal. 4. 5. nor only
Sons, but <hi>Heirs also of God, and joint Heirs
with Christ,</hi> Rom. 8. 17. And what ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is there so greedy which this will
not satisfy? yet this is our common state,
the birth-right of our regeneration, if
we do not degrade our selves, and with
<hi>Esau</hi> basely sell our title.</p>
               <p>18. AND now methinks every man
may interrogate himself in the same form,
wherein <hi>Ionadab</hi> did <hi>Amnon</hi> 2 Sam 13. 4.
<hi>why art thou, being the Kings son, thus lean
from day to day?</hi> Why should a Person who
is adopted by the King of Kings, thus
languish and pine? What is there below
the sun worthy his notice, much less his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
that hath a Kingdom above it? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
did we but know how to estimate
our selves upon this account, twere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for us with such sordid condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centions
to court every petty wordly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and so impatiently vex our selves
when we cannot attain it. Alas how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
do we bear the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
when that which carried the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
of our Faith thro the most fiery tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106844:30"/>
cannot support us under the disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any extravagant desire? They had
such <hi>respect to the recompence of the reward,</hi>
Heb. 11. 26. as made them cheerfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their Fame to ignominy, their Goods
to rapine, their Bodies to the most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
tortures, and their Lives to death. Yet
the same hopes cannot work us to any
tolerable degree of patience, when we
suffer but the smallest diminution in any
of these. What shall we say? Is Heaven
grown less valuable, or Earth more then
it was then? No surely, but we are more
infatuated in our estimates: we have so
long abetted the rivalry of the hand-maid,
that the Mistress, like <hi>Sarah,</hi> appears
despicable. Like <hi>Ionah</hi> we sit down sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon the withering of a gourd, never
considering that God has provided us a
better shelter, <hi>a building of God eternal in
the Heavens.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1. Indeed there
can be no temporal destitution so great,
which such an expectation cannot make
supportable. Were we in <hi>Iobs</hi> condition
sitting upon a dunghil, and scraping our
selves with a potsheard, yet as long as we
can say with him <hi>our Redeemer liveth.</hi> Job.
19. 25. we have all reason to say with
him also, <hi>blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:106844:31"/>
Chap. 1. 21. What a madness is it then
for us to expose our selves to be pierc'd
and wounded by every temporal adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who have so impenetrable an armour?
nay what an ungrateful contumely is it
to that goodness of God, to shew that we
cannot make him a counterpoise to the
most trivial secular satisfaction? on which
account sure he may again take up that
exprobrating complaint we find in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>A goodly price that I was valued at by
them.</hi> Zac. 11. 13.</p>
               <p>19. BUT how mean soever he is in our
eies, tho <hi>Christ</hi> seem the same to us in his
glory which he did in his abjection, to
have no beauty that we should desire him;
yet he puts another rate upon himself,
and tell us that he <hi>that loves Father or
Mother, Son or Daughter more then me,
is not worthy of me.</hi> Mat. 10. 37. Now our
love and our joy are passions coincident,
and therefore whatever we joy more in
then we do in him, we may be presum'd
to love better; and if he cannot endure
the competition of those more ingenuous
objects of our love he there mentions, how
will he suffer that of our vanities, our
childish wanton appetites? And yet those
are the things after which we so impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106844:31"/>
rave. For I believe I may truly
affirm, that if there were a scrutiny made
into all the discontents of mankind, for
one that were fastned upon any great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
calamity, there are many that
are founded only in the irregularity of
our own desires.</p>
               <p>20. BY what has bin said we may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude in the Prophets phrase, <hi>God
hath not bin to us a wilderness, a land of
darkness,</hi> Jer. 2. 31. but has graciously
dispen'st to us in all our interests. Yet the
instances here given are only common,
such as relate to all, or at least the far
greater part of mankind: but what vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums
might be made, should every man
set down his own particular experiences
of mercy? In that case twould be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Hyperbole we find Joh. 22. 25.
<hi>That even the world it self could not contain
the books which should be written.</hi> God
knows our memories are very frail, and our
observations slight in this point: yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
from all the forgotten or negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
favors, what vast catalogues may every
man make to himself, if he would but yet
recollect, what effects he has had of Gods
bounty in giving, of his providence in
protecting, of his grace in restraining,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106844:32"/>
and exciting, of his patience in forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
And certainly all these productions
of the divine goodness were never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to die in the birth. The Psalmist
will tell us, <hi>the Lord hath so don his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
works, that they ought to be had in
remembrance.</hi> Ps. III. 4. Let every man then
make it his daily care to recount to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the wonders God hath don, as for the
children of men in general, so for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in particular. When the Israelites
murmured under their bondage, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
imputes it to their idleness, and
prescribes them more work, as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
cure: a piece indeed of inhuman
Tyranny in him, but may with equity
and success be practiced by us upon our
selves. When we find our appetites mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous,
complaining of our present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
let us set our selves to work, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it as a task upon our selves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect
the many instances of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
And surely if we do it sincerely,
and with intention, we cannot have past
thro half our stages, before our sullen
murmurs will be beat out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and retire with shame, when they
are confronted with such a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
such signal testimonies of Gods
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106844:32"/>
goodness to us: for when we have mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd
up all our little grievances, most
critically examin'd all our wants, we shall
find them very unproportionable to our
comforts, and to our receits; in which
comparative notion, the next Section is
to consider them.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:106844:33"/>
               <head>SECT. IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Surplusage of our Enjoiments
above our Sufferings.</head>
               <p>1. TO regulate our estimate of those
things which we either enjoy or
suffer, there are three precedent queries to
be made: the first of their number or plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the second of their weight, the third
of their constancy and continuance; for
according as they partake more of these
properties, every good is more good, and
every evil is more evil. It will therefore
be our best method of trial in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case, to compare our blessings and our
calamities in these three respects.</p>
               <p>2. AND first in that of plenty, the
mercies of God are the source of all our
good, are set out to us in holy scripture
in the most <hi>superlative</hi> strein, They are <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,</hi>
Psal. 102. 20. <hi>Plenteous redemtion,</hi>
Psal. 130. 7. <hi>as high as the heaven,</hi> Psal.
103. 11. <hi>He fills all things living with
plenteousness,</hi> Psal. 145. 16. His mercies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106844:33"/>
are such as come not within the
compass of number, but stretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to infinity, and are best represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by such a calculation as God made to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> when he shew'd him the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merousness
of his posterity by the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merableness
of the stars, Gen. 15. 5. Were
there but a single mercy apportion'd to
each minute of our lives, the sum would
arise very high: but how is our Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
confounded, when every minute has
more then we can distinctly number?
for besides the original stock mention'd
in the last section, and the accession of
new bounty, the giving us somewhat
which we had not before; what an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative
mercy is it, the preserving what
we have? We are made up of so many
pieces, have such varieties of interests,
spiritual, temporal, public, and private; for
our selves, for our friends, and dependants;
that it is not a confused general regard that
will keep all these in security one moment.
We are like a vast building, which costs
as much to maintain, as to erect. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
considering the corruptibleness of
our materials, our preservation is no less
a work of omnipotence, then our first
forming: nay perhaps tis rather a greater.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106844:34"/>
Our original clay tho it had no aptness,
yet it had no aversions to the receiving
a human form; but was in the hand of the
potter to make it what he pleased: but we
now have principles of decay within us,
which vehemently tend to dissolution;
we want the supplies of several things
without us, the failing whereof returns us
again to our dust. Nay we do not only
need the aid, but we fear the hostility of
outward things. That very air which som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
refreshes us, may at another starve
and freeze us: that which warms and
comforts us, has also a power of consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
us. Yea that very meat which nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
may choak and stifle us. In a
word, there is no creature so despicable, so
inconsiderable, which may not somtimes
serve us, and which may not at any time
(if God permit) ruine us. Now whence
is it that we so constantly, so frequently
find the good, the benign efficacy of these
things, and so seldom, so rarely the evil?
whence I say is it, but from the active
unwearied providence, which draws forth
the better properties of the creatures for
our use, and restrains the worser for our
security? which with a particular adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
watches not only over every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106844:34"/>
but over every several concern of
that person. And how astonishing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
is this? If the mere ebbing and
flowing of the sea, put the Philosopher
into such an extasy, that he flung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into it, because he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the inscrutable cause of it; in
what perpetuall raptures of admiration
may we be, who have every minute within
us, and about us, more and greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and those too in our favor, when we
deserve rather the divine power should
exert it self in our destruction?</p>
               <p>3. BUT alas our danger from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
creatures, is little compar'd with
those from the spirits of darkness. <hi>We wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
not only with flesh and blood, but with
Principalities and Powers, with spiritual
wickedness,</hi> &amp;c. Eph. 6. 12. So inveterate
is the enmity between the Serpent and the
seed of the Woman in general, that he
watches all advantages against us, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our souls, but even our bodies, our
goods, and in every part of our concerns.
Thus we see he not only assaulted <hi>Iobs</hi>
soul by the wicked insinuations of his
Wife, but (with more effect) his body
with boiles and sores, his possessions by
teh <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106844:35"/>
of himself, his dearest Children, by
a wind from the wilderness. Job. 1. And
can we think his malice is now worn out?
no surely he still wishes as ill to mankind
as ever, and we should soon see the woful
effects of it, did not the same power which
let him loose for <hi>Iobs</hi> trial, restrain him
for our safety. Nay had he but power
to affright, tho not to hurt us, even that
would make our lives very uncomfortable.
We cannot hear the relation of Sprights
or apparitions, but our blood chills upon
it, and a horror runs thro our veins: what
should we then do if he should make his
night-walks thro our chambers, and with
his illusory terrors disturb our rest? Yet
all this and much more he would do, if
God did not chain up this <hi>old Dragon,</hi>
Rev. 20. Nay if he were not at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of a guard about us, and those no
less then Angels. I shall not dispute whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
every person hath not his peculiar
Guardian: for tho many have not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
asserted it, we have ground enough
of acquiescence in the general affirmation
of the Apostle, <hi>that they are all ministring
Spirits, sent forth to minister for them, who
shall be heires of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1. 14.
And now if the Reader please to sum
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106844:35"/>
up how many are his concerns, and how
many are the dangers which await him in
them all, he cannot sure render the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of those mercies which preserve
the one, and divert the other, in any other
phrase then that of the Psalmist. <hi>They are
more then I am able to express.</hi> Psa. 40. 7.</p>
               <p>4. WE may now challenge the most
miserable, or the most querulous man
living, to produce causes of complaint,
proportionable to those of thanks-giving.
He that has the greatest stock of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
can never vye with the heaps of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;
the disproportion is greater then
that of the Armies of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad.</hi>
1 Kings. 20. 27. whereof the one
was like <hi>two little flocks of Kids, the other
filled the country.</hi> God has told us that
he <hi>afflicts not willingly, nor grieves the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of men.</hi> Lam. 3. 33. whereas on the
contrary, he <hi>delighteth in mercy.</hi> Mich. 7.
18. We may judge by our selves which
he is likeliest often to repete, those acts
which he doth with regret and reluctancy,
or those which he do's with plesure and
delight. But we need no inferences where
we have the attestation of experience.
Let every man therefore make this his
judge in this case, let him every night
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106844:36"/>
recollect, how many things within and
about him he is concern'd in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how many of those have bin preserv'd
intire to him, still accounting every thing
so continued as a new donation. If he
begin with his Spiritual state, tis too pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
he may somtimes find he has lost his
innocence, committed some, perhaps
many sins: but even in these he will find
cause to justify God, if he do but recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
with what inward checks and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,
and outward restraints, God has
endevored to bridle him. If he will break
thro those fences, that do's not at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from the mercy of God which so
guarded him, but it rather illustrates his
goodness, that after so many quenchings
of his Spirit, do's yet continue its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
So that even he that has the most
deplorably violated his integrity, is yet to
confess that Gods purpose was to have
preserv'd it intire: and he might really so
have kept it, had he compli'd with those
aids which were afforded him. But in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
concerns we are not so apt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our selves, and therefore shall much
more rarely find we have suffer'd detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in them, then in our spiritual; but
are there ordinarily like to meet with a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106844:36"/>
better account. Let a man therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what is lacking to him of all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
good things he had in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and tell me whither for the most
part he may not give such an account,
as the <hi>Israelitish</hi> officers did of their men
after the slaughter of the <hi>Midianites, that
he hath not lost one.</hi> Num. 31. 39. Or if
somtimes he do suffer a diminution, yet
at the worst he will find that many more
good things have bin preserv'd to him,
then have bin taken from him. A man
may perhaps meet with some dammage in
his estate, yet tis manifold odds that that
dammage is but partial, and that he has
still more left then is lost. Or if it be
more intire; yet if he have his health, his
limbs, his senses, his friends, and all things
beside his estate left him, so that for one
thing he has lost, he still retains a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
he may say of it as the Disciples of
the few Loaves, <hi>what is this among so many?</hi>
Mat. 14. 17. <hi>Aristippus</hi> being bemoan'd for
the losse of a Farm, repli'd with some shapr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
upon hsi Condoler, you have but one
field, and I have yet three left, why should
I not rather grieve for you? intimating
that a man is not so much to estimate what
he has lost, as what he has left. A piece
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106844:37"/>
of wisdom which if we would transcribe,
we might quickly convince our selves, that
even in our most adverse estate there are as
<hi>Elijah</hi> speaks, <hi>more with us then against us,</hi>
2 King. 6. 16. that our enjoiments are more
then our sufferings, and Gods acts of grace,
do far out-number those of his severity.</p>
               <p>5. AND as they do out-number, so also
do they out-weigh them. The mercies
we receive from God are (as the last Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
has shew'd) of the greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
the most substantial solid goods, and
the greatest of all, I mean those which
concern our eternal state, are so firmly fixt
on us, that unless we will voluntarily quit
our clame, tis not in the power of men
or devils to defeat us. Light bodies are
easily blown away by every gust of wind,
but this <hi>weight of glory,</hi> as the Apostle calls
it, 2 Cor. 4. 17. continues firm and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is proof against all storms, like the
<hi>shadow of a great rock in a weary Land.</hi>
Isai. 32. 2. Those dark adumbrations we
have of it, might have served to refresh and
deceive the tediousness of our pilgrimage,
and therefore the most formidable cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of this life are below all mesures of
comparison with this hope of our calling,
this <hi>riches of the glory of our inheritance.</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:106844:37"/>
Eph. 3. 16. The heaviest and most pressing
of our afflictions are to that, <hi>but like the
small dust of the balance:</hi> Esa. 40. 15. so
that if we should here stop our inquisition,
we have a sufficient resolution of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
question, and must conclude, that
God has given us an abundant counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poise
of all, we either do or can suffer
here.</p>
               <p>6. IF therefore there be any so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
as to temporals, that he can fetch
thence no evidence of Gods fatherly care
of him, yet this one consideration may
solve his doubts, and convince him that
he is not abdicated by him. We read of
no <hi>gifts Abraham</hi> gave <hi>Isaac,</hi> yet to the
sons of the concubins tis said he did Gen.
25. 6. It had bin a very fallacious infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
if <hi>Isaac</hi> should have concluded
himself neglected, because his far greater
portion was but in reversions. And it
will be the same in any of us, if we argue
an unkindness from any temporal wants
who have the entail of an eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
But surely <hi>God do's not leave himself
without witness,</hi> Act. 14. 17. even in secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
things; there is no man breathing but
has some blessings of his left hand, as well
as his right, as I have already mention'd:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106844:38"/>
and unless it be some few prodigies of
Calamity in whose punishment or pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
God designs signally to glorify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
there are none who enjoy not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
comforts of life then those they want,
I mean such as are really greater, tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
to their prejudicate fancies they do
not appear so. Thus in point of health,
if a man be disaffected in one part, yet
all the rest of his body may be (and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
is) well; or if he have a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and have more then one disease,
yet there is no man that has all, or half
so many as are incident to human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
so that he is comparatively more
healthy then sick. So again it is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
common for a man to loose a limb, or
sense, the generality of men keep them
to their last; and they who do, have in
that an overbalance to most outward
adversities; and even they who are so
unhappy to loose one, yet commonly
keep the rest; at least the Major part: or if
at any time any man is left a mere breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
trunk, yet it is by such stupifying
diseases as dead the sense, or such mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ones as soon take them away; and so
the remedy overtakes the Malady. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it pleases God very often, to make
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106844:38"/>
compensation for the want of one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or faculty by improving the use of
another. We have seen feet supply all
the necessary uses of hands to those who
have had none; and it is a thing of daily
observation that men that are blind, have
the greater internal light: have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects
more vigorous and active, by their
abstractions from visible objects.</p>
               <p>7. THUS also it is in the matter of
wealth, he that is forced to get his bread
by the swet of his browes, tis true he
cannot have those delicacies wherewith
rich men abound; yet his labor helps him
to a more poignant, more savory sauce
then a whole College of Epicures can
compound. His hunger gives a higher
gust to his dry crust, then the surfeited
stomach can find in the most costly, most
elaborate mixtures: so verifying the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Solomon, the full soul loatheth
the hony comb, but to the hungry soul e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
bitter thing is sweet,</hi> Prov. 27. 7. He
cannot <hi>indeed stretch himself upon his bed of
Ivory,</hi> Am. 6. 4. yet his sleeps are soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then those that can. The wiseman
tells us, and experience dos so too, that
<hi>the sleep of a laboring man is sweet.</hi> Eccles.
5. 12. He is not clothed Gorgeously,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106844:39"/>
has not the splendor of glittering appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
so neither has he the care of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
it, the fears of being forestal'd
in a new invention, or any of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
solicitudes which attend that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
He has the proper genuine use of
clothing; the preventing shame and cold,
and is happily determin'd to that which
the wiser men of the world have volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
chosen. To conclude, he has one
advantage beyond all these; his necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
rescue him from idleness, and all its
consequent temtations; which is so great
a benefit, that if rich men be not their
own taskmasters as his wants are his, if
they do not provide themselves of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
that one want of theirs is infinitly
more deplorable then all his: and he
is not only happy comparatively with
himself, in having better things then he
wants, but with them also.</p>
               <p>8. IF we come now to reputation
and fame, the account will be much the
same, he that is eminent in the world for
some great atchievement, is set up as an
object of every mans remark; when as his
excellencies on the one hand are visible,
so his faults and blemishes are on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And as human frailty makes it too
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106844:39"/>
probable these later will be really more, so
human envy makes it sure that they shall
be more precisely, more curiously obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and more loudly blazon'd. So that
upon the whole, a good quiet security,
tho it be not the road to glory, yet is the
likliest fence against infamy. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he that can keep up the repute of
a sober integrity within his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
sphere, need not envy the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
sallies of others, which often meet
with a fatall turn at the later end of the
day. But twill be said that even that
more moderate sort of reputation is not
every mans portion, but that many lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
great ignominy and scandals. I shall
here ask whither those be just or unjust:
If they be just they belong not to our
present subject, which relates only to
those inflictions which are the effects of
Gods immediate providence, not of our
own crimes; for I never doubted but that
by those we may divest our selves of any,
nay of all the good things God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
us. But if the obloquy be unjust,
tis probable that tis taken up only by ill
men, and that the good pass a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable
sentence; and then surely the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
of a few such, is able to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106844:40"/>
a multitude of the others. And in
this case a man may not only find pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
but plesure in reproches. Socrates
lookt with trouble and jealousy on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
when ill men commended him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what ill have I don? and sure a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
has a farther reason to be pleas'd
with their revilings, they being his secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
againsts the <hi>woe</hi> pronounc'd to those
<hi>whom all men speak well of,</hi> Luke 6. 26.
But somtimes it happens, that even good
men are seduc'd, and either by the artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the wicked, or their own too hasty
credulity, give credit to unjust reports. And
this I confess is a sharp trial to the injur'd
person, yet even this cannot often be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
there can scarce be any innocence
so forlorn but that there may be opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of cleering it to some or other, and
by them propagating it to more, and if the
cloud ever come to be dispers'd, their fame
will appear with the brighter luster. But
if none of this happen, they have yet a
certain and more blessed retreat, even an
appeal to the unerring judg, who never
beholds us with more approbation, then
when we are under the unjust condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men. Indeed we have then a
double tie upon him, not only his justice
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106844:40"/>
but his pity is concern'd in our cause.
God particularly owns himself as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
of the oppressed, and there is scarce
a sharper and more sensible oppression then
this of Calumny: yet even this proves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
whil'st it procures Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
patronage, makes us the objects of
his more peculiar care and compassion, who
can <hi>make our righteousness as cleer as the
light,</hi> Psa. 37. 6. if he see it fit; but if in
his wisdom he chuse not that for us, tis
comfort enough for us that we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
it to him. Twas <hi>Elkanahs</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
to <hi>Hannah</hi> in her disconsolation,
<hi>Am not I better to thee then ten Sons?</hi> I
Sam. 1. 8. And sure we may say the like
of Gods approbation, that tis better to us
I say not then ten, but ten thousand Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
of men. The very Echo of it in
the testimony of a good conscience is an
unspeakable comfort, and this voice sounds
more audibly, more sweetly, among the
loudest, the harshest accusations of men.
So that we see even this assault too is not
without its guard, and these <hi>waters of
Marah.</hi> Exod. 15. 23. may be render'd not
only wholsome but pleasant.</p>
               <p>9. I have now instanced in the three
most general concerns of human life, the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106844:41"/>
Body, Goods, and Fame, to which heads
may be reduced most of the afflictions
incident to our out-ward state, as far as
immediately concerns our selves. But
there is no man stands so single in the
world, but he has some relations or friends
in which he thinks himself interessed, and
many times those oblique strokes which
wound us thro them, are as painful as
the more direct: yet here also God is
ordinarily pleas'd to provide some allaies,
if we would but take notice of them. He
who has had one friend die, has ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
divers others surviving; or if he have
not that, usually God raises him up others.
Tis true we cannot have a succession of
Fathers and Mothers, yet we often have
of other friends that are no less helpful
to us: and indeed there are scarce in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing more remarkable evidences of
Providence, then in this particular. <hi>He
that is able out of stones to raise up chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to Abraham,</hi> Mat. 3 9. do's many
times by as unexpected a production sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
friends to the desolate. But we do som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
loose our friends while they are liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they withdraw their kindness which
is the soul of friendship: and if this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by our own demerit, we can accuse
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106844:41"/>
neither God nor them for it: nor can we
rationally expect that God shall provide
supplies, when we wilfully despoile our
selves. But when they are unkind with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
provocation, then is the season for
his interposition, who uses to take up <hi>those
whom Father and Mother forsake,</hi> Psa. 27. 10.
and we frequently see signal proofs of his
care in exciting the compassions of other
friends and relatives, or perhaps of mere
strangers. Nay somtimes God makes the
inhumanity of a mans relations, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of his advantage. Thus the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
malice of <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren was the
first step to his Dominion over Egypt.
And it is a common observation in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
that the most discountenanc'd child
oft makes better proof, then the dearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>10. WE are yet liable to a third affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by the calamity of our friends,
which by the Sympathy of Kindness pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
us no less (perhaps more) sensibly
then our own: but then tis to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
that theirs are capable of the same
allaying circumstances that ours are, and
God has the same arts of alleviating their
burdens; so that we have the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for acquiescence in their sufferings
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106844:42"/>
that we have in our own, and shall do a
more friendly office in impressing those
upon them, then in the most passionate
adopting their sorrows.</p>
               <p>11. THE last and greatest discomfort
from friends, is that of their sin: and if
ever we may be allow'd that disconsolate
strein of the Prophet, Esa. 22. 4. <hi>Turn
away from me, I will weep bitterly, labor
not to comfort me;</hi> this seems to be the
time: yet even this <hi>vally of Achor is not
without a door of hope,</hi> Hos. 2. 15. A vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
person may be recalled, multitudes
have bin; so that as long as God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
life, we ought no more to deposite
our hope, then to quit our endevor. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
there are few that make this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
that have not somthing to balance,
or at least to lighten it. I shall instance
in that relation which is the nearest and
most tender, that of a Parent. He that
has one bad child may have divers good.
If he have but one virtuous tis a very great
mercy, and tis another that he may be
the better taught to value it by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the contrary. But if any be
so unhappy as to have many children, and
<hi>all to consume his eies and grieve his heart,</hi>
1 Sam. 2. 33. it may be a seasonable reflexion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106844:42"/>
for him to examin how far he has contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to it either by <hi>Elies</hi> fond indulgence,
or by a remiss and careless education: or
which is worst of all, by his most impious
example. If any, or all of these be found
the cause, he is not so much to seek for
allaies to his grief, as for pardon of his sin:
and when he has penitently retracted his
own faults, he may then have better ground
of hope that God may reform those of
his children. In the mean time he may
look on his own affliction in them as Gods
discipline on him, and gather at least this
comfort from it, that his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has more care of him, then he had
of his; and do's not leave him uncorre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>12. THUS we see in all the concerns
(which are the most common and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
of human life, and wherein the
justest of our complaints are usually found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
there is such a temperature and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the good do's more then equal
the ill, and that not only in the grosser
bulk, when our whole state is weighed
together, but in every single branch of
it. God having herein dealt with this
little world Man, as he has don with the
greater, wherein he is observ'd to have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106844:43"/>
furnished every country with Specific re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
for their peculiar diseases. I have
only given these short hints by way of
essay and pattern for the Readers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
which when he shall have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to all those more minute particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
wherein he is especially concern'd,
more curiously compar'd his sufferings
with his allaies and comforts; I cannot
doubt but he will own himself an instance
of the truth of the present Thesis, and
confess, that he has much more cause of
thankfulness then complaint.</p>
               <p>13. THIS I say supposing his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be of those more solid and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
sorts I have before mention'd. But
how many are there who have few or none
of such, who seem to be seated in the land
of <hi>Goshen,</hi> in a place exemt from all the
plagues that infest their Neighbors? And
those one would think should give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
suffrage to this conclusion, as having
no temtation to oppugn it; yet I doubt
tis far otherwise, and that such men are
of all the most unsatisfied. For tho they
have no crosses of Gods imposing, they
usually create a multitude to themselves.
And here we may say with <hi>David, it is
better to fall into the hand of God, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106844:43"/>
the hand of man,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 14 tis easier
to bear the afflictions God sends, then
those we make to our selves. His are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
both for quantity and quality, but
our own are as boundless as those extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
desires from which they spring.</p>
               <p>14. AND this is the true cause why
contentment is so much a stranger to those
who have all the outward causes of it,
they have no definite mesure of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires;
tis not the supply of all their real
wants will serve their turn, their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
are precarious and depend upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies.
They hunger not because
they are emty, but because others are full.
Many a man could have liked his own
portion well enough, had he not seen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
have somthing he liked better. Nay
even the most inconsiderable things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a value by being anothers, when
we despise much greater of our own. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
might well have satisfied himself with
the Kingdom of Israel, had not <hi>Naboths</hi>
poor plot lain in his eie: but so raving
were his desires after it, that he disrelishes
all the pomps of a Crown, yea the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
refreshments of Nature, <hi>can eat no
bread</hi> till he have that to furnish him with
Sallads. 1 King. 21. 2. And how many
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106844:44"/>
are there now adaies whose cloths sit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy
if they see another have had but the
luck to be a little more ingenuously vain;
whose meat is unsavory if they have seen
but a greater rarity, a newer cookery at
anothers Table: in a word who make
other peoples excesses the standard of their
own felicities.</p>
               <p>15. NOR are our appetites only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
thus by our outward objects, but
precipitated and hurried on by our inward
lusts. The proud man so longs for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and adoration, that nothing can
please him if that be wanting. <hi>Haman</hi>
can find no gust in all the sensualities of
the Persian Court, because a poor despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Jew denies his abaisance, Est. 5. 13.
The lustful so impatiently pursues his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
designs, that any difficulty he meets
in them, makes him pine and languish
like <hi>Amnon,</hi> who could no way recover
his own health but by violating his sisters
honor. 2 Sam. 13. 14. The revengeful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
under an Hydropic thirst till he have
the blood of his enemy: all the liquor of
<hi>Absaloms</hi> sheep-sheering could not quench
his, without the slaughter of his brother,
2 Sam. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 29. And thus every one of our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
keeps us upon the rack till they have
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106844:44"/>
obtained their designs. Nay when they
have, the very emtiness of those acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
is a new torment, and puts us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fresh pursuits. Thus between the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuousness
of our desires, and the emti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our enjoiments, we still <hi>disquiet
our selves in vain,</hi> Psa. 39. 7. And whil'st
we have such cruel task-masters, tis not
strange to find us groaning under our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
If we will indulge to all our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
or foolish appetites, think our lives
bound up with them, and solicite the
satisfaction of them with as impatient a
vehemence, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did for children,
Gen. 30. 1. <hi>give me them or I die:</hi> no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that we are alwaies complaining of
disappointments, since in these the very
success is a defeat, and is but the exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pain of a craving ravenous sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
for that of a cloi'd and nauseated.
Indeed men of this temper condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a perpetual restlessness, they are
like phantastic mutineers, who when their
superiors send them blanks to write their
own conditions, know not what will please
them: and even Omnipotence it self
cannot satisfy these till it have new
moulded them, and reduced their desires
to a certainty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:106844:45"/>
16. BUT in the mean time how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
do they accuse God of illiberality,
because every thing answers not their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor?
He has made them reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and has provided them satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
proportionable to their nature; but if
they will have wild irrational expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
neither his wisdom, nor his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is concern'd to satisfy those. His
supplies are real and solid, and therefore
have no correspondence to imaginary
wants. If we will create such to our selves,
why do we not create an imaginary satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to them? Twere the merrier fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
of the two, to be like the mad <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
that thought all the ships that came
into the harbor his own: and twere bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Ixion</hi> like to have our Arms fil'd with
a cloud, then to have them perpetually
beating our own breasts, and be still tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
our selves with unsatisfiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
Yet this is the state to which men
voluntarily subject themselves, and then
quarrel at God because they will not let
themselves be happy. But sure their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
complaints justify God, and argue that
he has dealt very kindly with them, and
afforded them all the necessary accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of life: for did they want them,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106844:45"/>
they would not be so sensible of the want
of the other. He that is at perfect ease may
feel with some vexation the biting of a
flea or gnat, which would not be at all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
if he were upon the rack. And
should God change the scene, and make
these nice people feel the destitution of
necessaries; all these regrets about super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities
would be overwhelmed. In the
mean time how deplorable a thing is it,
that we are still the poorer for Gods boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that those to whom he has opened his
hand widest, should open their mouth so
too, in outcries and murmurs? For I
think I may say that generally, those that
are the farthest remov'd from want, are
so from content too; they take no notice
of all the real substantial blessings they
enjoy, leave these (like the ninty nine
sheep in the wilderness) forgotten and
neglected, to go in quest after some fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive
satisfaction, which like a shadow
flies still faster in proportion to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit.</p>
               <p>17. AND now would God they could
be recalled from this unprofitable chace,
and insteed of the Horsleeches note, <hi>Give
give,</hi> Prov. 30. 15. take up that of the
Psalmist, <hi>what shall I render to the Lord
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106844:46"/>
for all the benefits he hath don unto me?</hi> Psa.
116. 12. Let them count how many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
or rather inestimable things, they
have received from his mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then
confront them with those corrections they
have found from his justice; and if they
do this impartially, I doubt not they will
find wherewithal to check their highest
mutinies; and will join with me in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing,
that their good things abundantly
outweigh their ill.</p>
               <p>18. IF now we carry on the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to the last circumstance, and consider
the constancy, we shall find as wide a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
Let us take the Psalmists testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and there will appear a very distant
date of his mercies and punishments. <hi>His
mercies endure for ever</hi> Psal. 136. whereas
his wrath <hi>endures but the twinkling of an eie</hi>
Psal. 30. 5. And accordingly God owns
his acts of severity as his <hi>strange work</hi>
Isa. 28. 21. that which he resorts to only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
special emergencies; but his mercies
<hi>are renewed every morning,</hi> Lam. 3. 25.
and doubtless we may all upon trial affirm
the same. There are many of the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
comforts of life which do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
somtimes visit us as guests, but dwell
with us as inmates and domestics. How
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106844:46"/>
many are there who have lived in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
affluence from their cradles to
their graves, have never known what it
is to want? And tho the goods of fortune
are perhaps less constant to some, yet the
refreshments of nature are usually so to
us all. We eat and drink, we sleep, we
recreate, we converse in a continued cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and go our round almost as constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as the sun do's his. Or if God do's
somtimes a little interrupt us in it, put
some short restraint upon our refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
yet that comparatively to the
time we enjoy them, is but proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the stop he has somtimes made of
the Sun, Jos. 10. 13. 2 Kings 20. 8. or of
the sea, Exod. 14. 21. which as they were
no subversions of the course of nature,
so neither are those short pauses he som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
makes, a repeal of those fixt and
customary benefits his providence usually
allots us. But who is there can say that any
one of his afflictions has bin of equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
or has prest him with so few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissions?
Perhaps he may have mist
some few nights sleep: but what is that to
a twelve-months, or perhaps a whole lives
enjoying it? Tis possible his stomach and
his meat have not alwaies bin ready to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106844:47"/>
but how much oftner have they
met to his delight? and generally those
things that are most useful, are but rarely
interrupted. Nay to a great many even
the delicacies of life are no less constant,
and their luxuries are as quotidian as their
bread: whereas unless their vices or their
fancies create uneasinesses to them, those
that come immediately from Gods hand,
make long intermissions and short staies.
Yet for all this they that should mesure
by the uncessantness of mens complaints,
would judge that the scene was quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verst,
and that our good things are as
<hi>Iob</hi> speaks, <hi>swifter then a wavers shuttle,</hi>
Job. 7. 6. whilest our ill, like <hi>Gehazies
Leprosy, cleave inseparably to us.</hi> 2. King
5. 10.</p>
               <p>19. THE truth is we will not let our
selves enjoy those intervals God allowes
us, but when a calamity do's retire we
will still keep it in fiction and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
revolve it in our minds, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
tis possible it may return, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as not gon. Like Aguish patients
we count our selves sick on our well-day,
because we expect a fit the next. A strange
stupid folly thus to court vexation, and
be miserable in Chimera. Do's any man
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106844:47"/>
or indeed any beast desire to keep a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastful
relish still in his mouth, to chew
the cud upon gall and wormwood? yet
certainly there are a multitude of people
whose lives are imbitter'd to them merely
by these fantastic imaginary sufferings.
Nor do we only fright our selves with i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
and Ideas of past calamities, but
we dress up new bugbears and mormoes,
are Poetic and aerial in our inventions,
and lay Romantic scenes of distresses.
This is a thing very incident to jealous
natures, who are alwaies raising alarms
to themselves. A suspicious man looks
on every body with dread. One man he
fears has designs upon his fortune, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
on his reputation, perhaps a third
upon his life: whilst in the mean time,
the only ill design against him is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by himself; his own causeless fears
and jealousies which put him in a state
of hostility with all the world; and do
often betray him to the very things he
groundlesly suspected. For it is not sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
seen that men have incurr'd reall
mischiefs by a fond sollicitude of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
imaginary ones. I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
but this is a state calamitous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and shall acknowledg it very
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106844:48"/>
likely that such persons shall have little
or no truce from their troubles, who
have such an unexhausted spring within
themselves; yet we may say to them as
the Prophet did to the house of <hi>Iacob,
Is the spirit of the Lord straitned? are
these his doings?</hi> Mich. 2. 7. Such men
must not cry out that Gods hand lies
heavy upon them, but their own; and
so can be no impeachment to the truth
of our observation, that Gods blessings
are of a longer duration, keep a more
fixt steddy course then his punishments.
The result of all is, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of mankind have good things (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as to temporals) which do in the three
respects fore-mention'd exceed the ill.
I mean the true and real ills which God
sends, tho not those fanciful ones they
raise to themselves.</p>
               <p>20. AND now why should it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
a reasonable proposition that men
should entertain themselves with the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santer
parts of Gods dispensations to
them, and not alwaies pore upon the
harsher: especially since the former are
so much a fairer object, and perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their eie, why should we look on
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106844:48"/>
the more sadening spectacles of human
frailty or misfortune, thro all the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
optics our fancies can supply,
and perversly turn away our eies from
the cheerfuller? Yet this God knows is
too much the case with most of us. How
nicely and critically do we observe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little adverse accident of our lives?
what tragical stories of them do our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
present us with? When alas a
whole current of prosperity glides by
without our notice. Like little children
our fingers are never off the sore place,
till we have pickt every light scratch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Ulcer. Nay like the leuder sort
of beggers, we make artificial sores to
give us a pretence of complaint. And
can we then expect God should concern
himself in the cure? Indeed in the course
of his ordinary providence there is no
cure for such people, unless it be by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion,
the making them feel the smart
of some very great and pressing afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They therefore put themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an unhappy dilemma, either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
their own tormentors, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the severest course of Gods disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
Tis true the last is the more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106844:49"/>
eligible, but I am sure the best way is
to prevent both, by a just and grateful
sense of Gods mercies, which will be
yet farther illustrated if we compare them
with our own demerits.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of our Demerit towards God.</head>
               <p>1. IT is the common fault of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that we are very apt to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to our selves; and to square our expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations
more by what we wish, then by
what we deserve. Somthing of this is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
in our dealings with men. We oft <hi>look
to reap where we have not sowed,</hi> Mat. 25.
25. expect benefits where we do none: yet
in civil transactions there are still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such footsteps of natural justice, that
we are not universally to unreasonable:
all traffic and commerce subsisting upon
the principle of equal retribution, giving
one good thing for another equivalent;
so that no man expects to buy corn with
chaff, or Gold with dross. But in our
dealings with God, we put off even this
common equity; are vast in our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but penurious and base in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns;
and as if God were our steward not
our Lord, we require of him with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
proper only to those who ask their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106844:50"/>
own: whilst in the interim, what we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to him is with such a disdainful slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as if we meant it rather an alms then
an homage.</p>
               <p>2. GOD indeed is so munificent, that he
<hi>prevents us with his blessings,</hi> Psal. 21. 3. gives
us many things before we ask: had he not
don so, we could not have bin so much as
in a capacity of asking. But tho the first &amp;
fundamental mercies are absolute and free,
yet the subsequent are conditional: and
accordingly we find in scripture, that God
makes no promise either concerning this
life or a better, but on condition of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
The jews who had much larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals
of temporal happiness then Christians
have, yet never had them upon other terms.
God expressly articled for the preformance
of his commands, and made all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiments
forfeitable upon the failure, as
we may see at large in the book of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy.
And under the Gospel St.
<hi>Paul</hi> appropriates the <hi>promises as well of
this life as of that to come unto godliness,</hi>
1 Tim. 4. 8. It will therefore be a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
inquiry for every man, whether he
have kept his title entire, and have not
by breach of the condition forfeited his
clame, even to the most common ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106844:50"/>
blessings; for if he have, common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will tell him he can challenge none:
and that the utmost he can hope for, must
be only upon a new score of unmerited
favor.</p>
               <p>3. And here certainly <hi>every mouth must
be stopped, and all the world become guilty
before God,</hi> Rom. 3. 19. For alas who is
there that can say his obedience has bin
in any degree proportionable to his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?
Tis manifest we have all received
abundantly from Gods hand, but what
has he had from ours? I may challenge the
best man, to cast up the account of his
best day, and tell me whether his receits
have not infinitly exceeded his disburs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
whether for any one good thing
he has don, he has not received many.
Nor is the disparity only in number, but
much more in value. Gods works are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
all he do's for us like the first 6 daies
productions, <hi>are all very good,</hi> Gen. 1. but
alass our very <hi>righteousness is as filthy rags,</hi>
Esai. 64. 6. we offer <hi>him the blind and the
lame,</hi> Mal. 1. 9. a few yewning drowsy prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
perhaps, wherein he has the lest share:
the fuller current of our thoughts running
towards our secular or sinful concerns.
We drop it may be a scanty Alms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106844:51"/>
tis odds our vain-glory scrambles for
a share with him, if it do not wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross
it. We sit an hour at a sermon,
but tis rather to hear the wit or eloquence
of the preacher, then the word of God.
Like the duller sort of animals, we like
well to have our itching ears scratcht,
but grow sturdy and restive when we
should do what we are there taught. In
a word all our services at the best are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
maim'd, and imperfect; and too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
corrupt and unsound. So that God
may well upbraid us as he did <hi>Israel, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it now to thy governor, will he be pleas'd
with it?</hi> Mal. 1. 8. These very iniquities of
our holy things, are enough to defeat all
our pretences to any good from Gods
hand; yet God knows this is much the best
side of us: tis not every one that can
make so fair an appearance as this amounts
to. With many, there is no place to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the blemishes of their sacrifices,
for they offer none; of whom we may say
in the words of the Psalmist, <hi>God is not in
all their thoughts,</hi> Psal. 10. 4. I fear there
want not those who drive away the day,
the week, nay the year, without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
in whose <hi>hand their time is,</hi> Psal.
31. 18. or paying him any solemn tribute
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106844:51"/>
of it; who enjoy the services of all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
creatures, without considering that
theirs are more due to the supreme Lord:
in a word, who live as if they were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly
independent; had their existence
purely from themselves, and had no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to whom they owed their being, or
any consequent duty. And sure men who
thus discard themselves from Gods fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
have very little reason to expect the
provisions of it: yet even such as these
have the impudence to complain, if any
thing be wanting to their needs (shall I
say) or to their lusts; can ravingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Gods name in their impatiencies,
which they know not how to use in their
praiers: as if the Deity were considerable
in no other notion, then that of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
or steward.</p>
               <p>4. IF now we seriously reflect, what
can be more admirable then that infinit
patience of God; who notwithstanding
the miserable infirmities of the pious, and
the leud contemt of the impious, still goes
on resolutly in his bounty, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
to all mankind some, and to some
all his temporal blessings? He has no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
of justice to do so, for it is no
part of his compact; he has none of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106844:52"/>
for he is perpetually affronted and
disobliged. Surely we may well say with
<hi>David, Is this after the manner of men,
O Lord?</hi> 1 Chro. 17. 17. Can the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
human indulgence bear any proportion
with this divine Clemency? no certainly,
no finite patience but would be exhausted
with the thousandth part of our provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
               <p>5. BUT is not our dealing too as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after the manner of men? I mean of
reasonable creatures: for us who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
our right to all, and yet by mere
favor are still kept in the possession of
many great blessings: for us to grow mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous,
because there is perhaps somthing
more trifling which is deni'd us, is such
a stupid ingratitude, as one would think
impossible to human nature. Should a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with us have at once forfeited his
lease and maliciously affronted his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
he would sure think himself very
gently dealt with, if he were suffer'd to
enjoy but a part of his first estate; but
we should think him not only insolent,
but mad, who when the whole were left
him, should quarrel and clamor if he might
not have his Cottage adorn'd with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
floors, and gilded roofs. Yet at this wild
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106844:52"/>
rate we behave our selves to our great
Landlord, grow pettish and angry if we
have not every thing we can fancy, tho
we enjoy many more useful, merely by
his indulgence. And can there be any
thing imagin'd more unreasonable? Let us
therefore if not for piety, yet at least to
justify our clame to rationality, be more
ingenuous; let us not consult only with
our fond appetites, and be thus perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
solliciting their satisfaction; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reflect on what tenure we hold
what we already have, even that of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant
mercy; and fear, least like
insolent beggers by the impudence of our
demands we divert even that charity
which was design'd us. In short let every
man when he computes what he wants
of his desires, reckon as exactly how much
he is short of his duty; and when he has
duly ponder'd both, he will think it a
very gentle composition to have the one
unsupplied, so he may have the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
and will see cause contentedly to
sit down and say with honest <hi>Mephibosheth,
What right have I to cry any more unto the
King?</hi> 2 Sam. 19. 28. But if it be thus with us
upon the mere score of our imperfectionsor
omissions, what an obnoxious state do our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106844:53"/>
innumerable actual sins put us in? If the
spots of our sacrifices are provoking, what
are our sacrileges and bold profanations? If
those who neglect or forget God are listed
among his enemies, what are those who
avowedly defy him? Indeed he that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
considers the world, and sees how
daringly the divine Majesty is daily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted,
cannot but wonder that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
of our manners, those prodigies
in morality, should not be answer'd with
as great prodigies in calamity too; that
we should ever have other ruin then that
of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or the earth serve us for any
other purpose then to be, as it was to <hi>Korah,</hi>
Num. 16. our living sepulcher.</p>
               <p>6. NOR is this longanimity of God
observable only towards the mass and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
body of mankind, but to every
man in particular. Who is there that if
he ransack his conscience, shall not find
guilts enow to justify God in the utmost
severities towards him? so that how much
soever his punishments are short of that,
so much he evidently owes to the lenity
and compassion of God. And who is
there that suffers in this world the utmost
that God can inflict? We have a great
many suffering capacities, and if those
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106844:53"/>
were all fill'd up to the height, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
would scarce differ from that of
the damned in any thing but duration.
But God is more merciful, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
at that rate on us here. Every mans
experience can tell him, that God dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
not his whole quiver at once upon him,
but exemts him in many more particulars
then he afflicts him; and yet the same
experience will probably tell most of us,
that we are not so modest in our assaults
upon God; we attacque him in all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
(as far as our feeble malice can
reach) in his Sovereignty, in his honor,
in his relatives, nay somtimes in his very
essence and being. And as they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
in respect of him, so also in regard
of our selves: we engage all our powers
in this war, do not only <hi>yield</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaks) <hi>our members instruments of
unrighteousness,</hi> Rom. 6. 18. but we press
them upon the service of sensual and vile
lusts, even beyond our native propensions.
Nor are only the members of our body,
but the faculties of our souls also thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied;
our understandings are busied first
in contriving sins, and then excuses and
disguises for them; our wills are yet more
sturdy rebels, and when the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106844:54"/>
is beat out of all its out-works, yet
sullenly keep their hold in spight of all
conviction; and our affections madly rush
on <hi>like the horse into the battel,</hi> Jer. 8. 6.
deterred by nothing of danger, so there be
but sin enough in the attemt.</p>
               <p>7. AND now with what face can peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that thus pursue an hostility, expect
that it should not be return'd to them?
do's any man denounce war, and yet
expect from his adversary all the caresses,
the obligements of friendship? self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
will promt even the meekest nature
to despoile his enemy at least of those
things which he uses to his annoiance;
aud if God should give way even to that
lowest degree of anger, where or what
were we? for since we imploy our whole
selves against him, nothing but destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
can avert our injuries. But tis hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
for us we have to do with one who
cannot fear us, who knows the impotence
of our wild attemts, and so allai's his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
of our insolence, with his pity
of our follies. Were it not for this, we
should not be left in a possiblity so oft to
iterate our provocations; every wicked
imagination and black design, would be
at once defeated and punisht by infatuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106844:54"/>
and frenzy: every blasphemous Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical
speech would wither the tongue,
like that <hi>arm of Ieroboam</hi> which he stretcht
against the Prophet, 2 King. 13. 4. and
every impious act would like the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
retrospect of <hi>Lots</hi> Wife, fix us perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
monuments of divine vengeance.</p>
               <p>8. AND then how much do we owe
to the mercy and commiseration of our
God, that <hi>he suffers not his whole disple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to arise,</hi> Psa. 78. 39. that he abates
any thing of that just severity he might
use toward us? He that is condemned to
the Gallowes, would think it a mercy to
scape with any inferior penalty: why have
we then such mean thoughts of Gods Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
when he descends to such low
compositions with us? corrects us so light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as if twere only matter of ceremony and
punctilioe, the regard of his honor, rather
then the execution of his wrath. For alas
let him among us that is the most innocent,
and undeservedly afflicted, muster up his
sins and sufferings, and he will see a vast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality:
and (had he not other grounds
of assurance) would be almost temted to
think those were not the provoking cause,
they are so unproportionably answered.
He sins in innumerable instances, and is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106844:55"/>
punisht in few; he sins habitually and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually,
and suffers rarely and seldom;
nay perhaps he has somtimes sin'd with
greediness, and yet God has punisht with
regret and reluctancy, <hi>How shall I give
thee up O Ephraim?</hi> Hos. 11. 8. And when
all these disparities are consider'd, we must
certainly join heartily in <hi>Ezras</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Thou O God has punisht us less then our
iniquities deserve,</hi> Ezra. 9. 13.</p>
               <p>9. NAY besides all our antecedent, we
have after guilts no less provoking, I
mean our ungracious repinings at the
light chastisements of our former sins,
our out-cries upon every little uneasiness,
which may justly cause God to turn our
whips into scorpions; and according as
he threatned <hi>Israel</hi> Lev. 26. 18. <hi>to punish
us yet seven times more.</hi> And yet even
this do's not immediately exasperate him.
The Jews were an instance how long he
could bear with a murmuring generation;
but certainly we of this nation are a
greater, <hi>yet let us not be high-minded but
fear,</hi> Rom. 11. 20. for we see at last the
doom fell heavy tho it was protracted,
a succession of miraculous judgments pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
those murmurers, so that not one
of them enter'd Canaan. And tis very
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106844:55"/>
observable that whereas to other sins Gods
denunciations are in scripture conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and reversible; this was absolute and
bound with an oath, <hi>He sware in his wrath
that they should not enter into his rest,</hi> Psa.
95. 11. And yet if we compare the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
of the Israelites in the wilderness,
with most of our sufferings, we shall be
forced to confess our mutinies have less
temtation, and consequently less excuse;
from whence tis very reasonable to infer,
as the greatness of our danger if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
so the greatness of Gods long suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards us, who yet allows us space
to reform: and sure new complaints sound
very ill from us, who are liable to so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
an account for our old ones. I fear
the most resign'd persons of us will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
recollection find, they have upon
one occasion or other out-vied the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Israelites murmurs, therefore
unless we will emulate them in their
plagues, let us fear to add one more, lest
that make up the fatal sum, and render
our destruction irrevocable.</p>
               <p>10. UPON all these considerations it
appears how little reason any of us have
to repine at our heaviest pressures; but there
is yet a farther circumstance to be advert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106844:56"/>
to, and is too applicable to many of
us, that is, that our sins are not only the
constant meritorious cause of our suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but they are also very often the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
cause also; and produce them
not only by way of retaliation from God,
but by a natural efficacy. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us
he that <hi>loves plesure, shall be a poor man,</hi>
and that <hi>a whorish woman will bring a
man to a piece of bread</hi> Prov. 6. 26. <hi>that
he that sits long at the wine shall have red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of eies,</hi> Chap. 23. 29. 30. <hi>that the
slothful soul shall suffer hunger,</hi> 19. 15. and
all these not by immediate supernatural
infliction from God, but as the proper
genuine effects of those respective vices.
Indeed God in his original establishment
of things, has made so close a connexion
between sin and punishment, that he is
not often put to exert his power in any
extraordinary way, but may trust us to
be our own Lictors, our own <hi>backslidings
reprove us</hi> Jer. 2. 19. <hi>and our iniquities are</hi>
of themselves enough to <hi>become our ruine,</hi>
Exod. 18. 38.</p>
               <p>11. It may therefore be a seasonable
question for every man to put to himself,
whether the troubles he labors under; be
not of this sort; whether the poverty he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106844:56"/>
complains of, be not the effect of his riot
and profusion, his sloth and negligence?
whether when he cries out that <hi>his comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is turn'd into corruption,</hi> Dan. 10. 8. he
may not answer himself, that they are
his visits to the harlots houses which have
thus made <hi>rottenness enter into his bones,</hi>
Hab. 3. 16. whether when he is beset with
contentions, and has wounds without
cause, <hi>he have not tarried long at the wine;</hi>
when he has lost his friend, whether he
have not by some <hi>trecherous wound</hi> Eccle.
22. 22. forced him to depart: or when
he lies under infamy, whether it be not
only the Echo of his own scandalous
crimes. If he find it thus with him, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
his mouth is stopt, and he cannot
without the most disingenuous impudence
complain of any but himself. He could
not be ignorant that such effects did natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
attend such causes, and therefore if
he would take the one, he must take the
other also. No man sure can be so mad,
as to think God should work miracles
(disunite those things which nature hath
conjoin'd) only that he may sin at ease,
have all the bestial plesures he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and none of the consequent smart.
We read in deed God divided the sea, but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106844:57"/>
it was to make <hi>the way for the Ransomed
of the Lord to pass over</hi> Isa. 51. 10. those
who were his own people, and went in at
his command; but when they were secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we find the waters immediatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to their chanel, and overwhelmed
the Egyptians, who ventured without
the same warrant. And sure the case is
alike here, when any man can produce
Gods mandate for him to run into all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of riot, to desecrate the temple of the
holy Ghost, <hi>and make his body the member of
an harlot,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 15. In a word when God
bids him do any of those things, which
God and good men abhor, then and not
before he may hope he may sever such
acts from their native penal effects; for
till then (how profuse soever some Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary
stories represent him) he will
certainly never so bestow his miracles.</p>
               <p>12. But I fear upon scrutiny there will
appear a yet farther circumstance upon
which to arraign our mutinies, for tho it
be unreasonable enough to charge God
with the ill effects of our own leudness,
yet tis a higher step to murmur because
we have not materials to be wicked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
And this I fear is the case with
too many of us, who tho they are not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106844:57"/>
so dispoil'd by their sins, but that they
can keep up their round of vicious ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
yet are discontented because they
think some others have them more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
think their vices are not Gentile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
unless they be very expensive, and
are covetous only that they may be more
Luxurious. These are such as St <hi>Iames</hi>
speaks of, <hi>who ask amiss, that they may
consume it upon their lusts.</hi> Jam. 4. 3. and
sure to be mutinous on this account is one
of the highest pieces of frenzy. Would
any man in his wits tell another he will
cut his throat, and then expect he should
furnish him with a knife for it? And yet to
this amount our murmurs against God, for
his not giving us those things wherewith
we only design to wage war with him.
For surely if the discontents of mankind
were closely inspected, I doubt a great
many would be found of this kind. It
concerns the Reader therefore to make
the inquisition in his own breast, both in
this and all the former particulars, and
I doubt not, if he do it with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
and uprightness, he will be
abundantly convinced that for his few
mites of obedience he paies to God, he
receives talents of mercies (even tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral)
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106844:58"/>
from him: and that on the other
side, that God as much underpaies his
sins, as he overpaies his services: by which
God do's sufficiently attest how little he
delights in our affliction, how gladly he
takes any light occasion of caressing and
cherishing, and over-skips those of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
us. Which sure ought to make us
convert all our displesures against our sins,
which extort those acts of severity from
him, to which his nature is most averse.
And here indeed our resentments cannot
be too sharp, but towards God our fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
address will be in the penitential form
of the prophet Daniel, <hi>O Lord, to us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
confusion of face, but to the Lord
our God belong mercies and forgiveness,
tho we have rebelled against him,</hi> Dan. 9.
8. 9. And as his justice is to be revered
in his inflictions, so is his wisdom also,
in so disposing of events to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as may best consist with the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Oeconomy and managery of the world,
the consideration whereof is the design of
the next Section.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106844:58"/>
               <head>SECT. VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of Gods general Providence.</head>
               <p>1. WHEN God made the universe,
he intended not only to glorify
himself in one transient act of his power,
and then leave this great and wonderful
production of his, as the <hi>Ostrich her eggs</hi>
in the wilderness, Lam. 4. 3. but having
drawn it out of its first Chaos, he secur'd
it from returning thither again, by esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
as a due symmetry of parts, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
a regular order of motion: hence it is
that the heavens have their constant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
the earth its succession of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
seasons, animals their alternate
course of generation and corruption: and
by this wise Oeconomy, the world after so
many thousand years, seems still in its
spring and first beauty. But it had bin
in vain to have thus secured the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the creatures, if man for whose
sake they were made had bin excluded
from this care. His faculty of reason would
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106844:59"/>
have made him but the more fatal instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of confusion, and taught him the
more compendious waies of disturbing the
world. <hi>Iob</hi> compares him <hi>to the wild asses
colt.</hi> Job 11. 12. which takes its range
without adverting to any thing of the
common good. God has therefore dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
hedged in this unruly creature, made
a fence of laws about him (both natural
and positive) and besides has taken him
into the common circle of his providence,
so that he, as well as the rest of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
has his particular station assign'd
him; and that not only in reference to
other creatures, but himself; has put a
difference between one man and another,
ordained several ranks and Classes of men,
and endowed them with special and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
qualifications for those stations
wherein he has set them.</p>
               <p>2. THIS, as it is a work of infinit wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in God, so it is of unspeakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to men. Without this regular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure,
the world would have bin in the
same confusion which we read of in the
host of the Midianites, <hi>every mans sword
against his fellow,</hi> Jud. 7. 22. Nothing but
force could determine who should do, or
enjoy any thing; and even that decision
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106844:59"/>
also would have bin repelable by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
force: so that we have all reason to
confess the utility of that order God has
set among men: and even he that bears
the lowest and most despicable place in it,
is certainly infinitly more happy by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
to that general Harmony, then
he could be in any state of discord.</p>
               <p>3. WERE this now well consider'd,
methinks it should silence all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and men should not be so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
concern'd in what part of the stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
it pleases the great Architect to put
them: for every man is to look on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
only as a small parcel of those mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
which God is to put into form. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
stone is not fit for the corner, nor
every little rafter for the main beam: the
wisdom of the Master builder is alone to
determin that. And sure there cannot
be a more vile contemt of the divine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
then to dispute his choice. Had God
wisdom enough to contrive this vast and
beautiful fabric, and may he not be trusted
with one of us poor worms? Did he by his
<hi>wisdom make the heavens, and by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandimg
stretch out the clouds,</hi> Pro. 3.
19. and shall he not know where to place
a little lump of figur'd earth? this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106844:60"/>
the most absurd distrust imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and yet this is really the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our repining at the condition he has
placed us in.</p>
               <p>4. THE truth is, we are so full of our
selves, that we can see nothing beyond
it: every man expects God should place
him where he has a mind to be, tho by it
he discompose the whole scheme of his
providence. But tho we are so senselessly
partial, yet God is not so: he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
at once the whole concern of
mankind, applies himself to the accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating
those, not the humoring any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
person. <hi>He has made the great and
the small and careth for all alike,</hi> Wisd.
6. 7. He is the common Father of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and disposes things for the public
advantage of this great family, and tis not
all the impatient cravings of a froward
child that shall make him recede from his
designed method. We are apt enough,
I am sure, to tax it not only as a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but injustice too in a Prince, when
he indulges any thing to a private favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
to the public disadvantage; yet so
unequal are we, that we murmur at God
for not doing that, which we murmur at
men for doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:106844:60"/>
5. BESIDES a man is to consider,
that other men have the same appetites
with himself. If he dislike an inferior state,
why should he not think others do so too?
and then as the wise man speaks, <hi>whose
voice shall the Lord hear?</hi> Ecclus. 34. 24.
Tis sure great insolence in me to expect
that God should be more concern'd to
humor me, then those multitudes of others
who have the same desires. And the more
impatient my longings are, the less in
reason should be my hopes; for mutiny
is no such endearing quality as to render
any man a dearling to God. But if all men
should have equal satisfactions, we should
puzle even Omnipotence it self. Every
man would be above and superior, yet
those are comparative terms, and if no
man were below, no man could be above.
So in wealth, most men desire more, but
every man do's at least desire to keep what
he has; how then shall one part of the
world be supplied without the diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the other, unless there should be
as miraculous a multiplication of tresure
for mens avarice, as there was of Loaves
for their hunger, Mat. 16. 9. It was a good
answer which the Ambassadors of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
Province made to <hi>Antony,</hi> If O
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106844:61"/>
Emperor, thou wilt have double taxes from
us, thou must help us to double Springs
and Harvests. And sure God must be at
the expence of a new Creation, make us
a double world, if he should oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to satisfy all the unreasonable appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
of men: and if he satisfy not all, why
should any particular person look that his
alone should be indulged to?</p>
               <p>6. YET as unreasonable as it is, the
most of us do betray such a perswasion.
No man is discontented that there are
lower, as well as higher degrees in the
world, that there are poor as well as rich,
but all sensible men assent to the fitness
of it: yet if themselves happen to be set
in the lower form, they exclame as if the
whole order of the world were subverted;
which is a palpable indication that they
think that Providence which governs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
should serve them, and distribute
to them not what it, but themselves think
good. This immoderate self-love is the
spring and root of most of our complaints,
makes us such unequal judges in our own
concerns, and promts us to put in Caveats
and exceptions on our own behalf, as
<hi>David</hi> did on his sons, <hi>See that thou hurt
not the young man Absolom?</hi> 2 Sam. 18. 15.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106844:61"/>
as if God were to manage the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the world with a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to our liking, and were like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
at <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. 19. 22. to <hi>do nothing
till we had got into Zoar,</hi> had all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
secured to us.</p>
               <p>7. IT would indeed astonish a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
man to see, that altho the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of men are all disposed by an unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wisdom, and acknowledged by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be so, yet that scarce any man
is pleased. The truth is, we have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in us the worser part of the Levelers
principle, and tho we can very content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
behold multitudes below us, yet are
impatient to see any above us; not only
the <hi>foot</hi> (to use the Apostles simile) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
that it is not the hand, but the eare
because it is not the eie,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 15. 16.
Not only the lowermost, but the higher
ranks of men are uneasy, if there be any
one step above them. Nay so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
is this aspiring humor, that we see
men are forced to feed it tho but with
aire and shadows. He that cannot make
any real advance in his quality, will yet
do it in effigie, in all little gaieties and
pageantries of it. Every degree in these
respects not only emulates, but imitates its
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106844:62"/>
superior, till at last by that impatience of
their proper distance they make it greater,
and sink even below their first state by their
ridiculous profusion. Indeed the world
seems to be so over-run with this vanity,
that there is little visible distinction of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and one had need go to the Heralds
office to know mens qualities, for neither
their habit nor equipage do now adaies
inform us with any certainty.</p>
               <p>1. BUT by all these it appears that
men look on themselves only as single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
without reference to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
whereof they are members. For did
they consider that, they would endevor
rather to become the places wherein they
were set, by doing the duties belonging
to them, then be perpetually projecting
for a change. A tree that is every year
transplanted will never bear fruit, and a
mind that is alwaies hurried from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
station, will scarce ever do good in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
This is excellently exprest to us by
<hi>Solomon, As a bird that wandereth from
his nest, so is a man that wandereth from
his place.</hi> Pro. 27. 8. Tis easy to divine
the fate of those young ones from whom
the damn wanders, and tis as easy to guess
how the duties of that place will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106844:62"/>
whose owner is alwaies upon the
wing and making towards another. I wish
we had not too costly experiments both
in Church and State of the truth of this
observation. Alas we forget that we are
all servants to the same Master, and that
he is to appoint in what office we shall
serve him. How should we like it in any
of our own families, to have an inferior
officer leave his work undon, because he
has more mind to be Major-Domo? Yet
this insolence we every day repete towards
God, sullenly dispute his orders, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we may chuse our own imploiments,
will do nothing.</p>
               <p>9. TIS evident this perverse temper
of mankind breeds a great deal of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
and disturbance in the world, but
would breed arrant confusion and subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
if it were suffered to have its full
range. If God permit but one ambitious
spirit to break loose in an age as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of his wrath, what destruction
do's it often times make? How do's it
<hi>cause the whole earth to tremble, and shake
Kingdoms</hi> as is said of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
Isa. 14. 16. and may be said of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of those whole-sale robbers who have
dignified the trade? But if every aspir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106844:63"/>
humor should be as prosperous, where
would it find fuel to maintain the flame?
No doubt every age produces men of as
unbounded desires as <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Cesar,</hi>
but God gives them not the same opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
to trouble the world. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the more petty ambitions of private
men he often orders it so, that those soar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
minds can find no benign gale to help
their mounting. He that sets bounds to
the sea, saying, <hi>hitherto shalt thou come
and no farther, and tho the waves thereof
toss themselves yet can they not prevaile, tho
they roar yet can they not pass over,</hi> Jer. 5.
22. do's also depress the swelling pride of
men, hangs clogs and weights upon them
that they cannot rise to their affected
height. For tho we are all willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
it, yet God remembers that he is the
Rector of the Universe, and will assert his
Dominion. The subtilest contrivance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
circumvent him, the most dareing
pretender cannot wrest any thing out of
his hand, the <hi>Lord will still be King, be
the people never so impatient,</hi> Psa. 99. 1.
Twill therefore sure be as well our pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as our duty to <hi>be still and know that
he is God,</hi> Psal. 46. 10. with an humble
dereliction of our own wills acquiesce in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106844:63"/>
his, and not by ineffective struglings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke,
whom we are sure never to subdue.
We may like unmanaged horses fome
and fret, but still God has the bridle in
our jawes, and we cannot advance a step
farther then he permits us. Why should
we then create torment to our selves by
our repinings, which only sets us farther
from our aims. Tis Gods declared me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to exalt the lowly, and tis observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the first two Kings of Israel who
were of Gods immediate election, that
he surprized them with that dignity when
they were about mean and humble im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiments,
the one searching his fathers
Asses, the other keeping his fathers sheep:
and would men honestly and diligently
exercise themselves in the business of their
proper calling, they might perhaps find
it a more direct road to advancement,
then all the sinister arts by which ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
men endeavor to climb. <hi>Solomon</hi> sets
it down as an Aphorism, <hi>seest thou a man
diligent in his business he shall stand before
Kings, he shall not stand before mean men</hi>
Pro. 22. 29. But whether it happen to have
that effect or no, it will have a better,
for it will sweeten his present condition,
divert his mind from mutinous reflections
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106844:64"/>
on other mens height, and his own low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for tis commonly men who mind
not their work that are at so much lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to gaze. He that carefully plies his
own business will have his thoughts more
concentred: and doubtless tis no small
happiness to have them so, for tis their
gadding too much abroad, looking on
other mens conditions that sends them
back (like <hi>Dianah</hi> deflowred) to put
all in uproar at home. The son of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi>
speaks with transportation of the
state even of him that labors and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and calls <hi>it a sweet life,</hi> Ecclus. 40. 18.
And certainly tis infinitly more so then
that of the greatest Prince whose mind
swels beyond his territories.</p>
               <p>10. UPON all these considerations it
cannot but appear very reasonable that we
should leave God to govern the world,
not be puting in like the sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi>
for the highest seats; but contentedly rest
our selves where he has placed us, till his
providence (not our own designs) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
us. We can no where be so obscure
as to be hid from his eies, who as he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
the widows mite above the great
oblations of the rich; so he will no less
graciously accept the humble endevors
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106844:64"/>
of the mean, then the more eminent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
of the mighty; himself having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that he accepts <hi>according to what
a man hath, and not according to what he
hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. 12. so that in what
rank soever a man is set, he has still the
opportunity of approving himself to God,
and tho in the eie of the world he be a
vessel of dishonor, yet in the day when
God comes to <hi>make up</hi> his <hi>Iewels</hi> Mal.
3. 17. there will be another estimate made
of him who regularly moves in his own
sphere. And sure he that sits down in this
acquiescence is a happier man, then he that
enjoies the greatest worldly splendor: but
infinitly more so then he who impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
covets but cannot attain them; for
such a man puts himself upon a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
rack, keeps his appetites up at the
utmost stretch, and yet has nothing
wherewith to satisfy them. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our ease if not our duty promt us to
acquiescence, and a ready submission to
Gods disposals, to which we have yet a
farther inducement from that distinct care
he hath over every mans peculiar, by which
he proportions to him, what is really best
for him; of which we are farther to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
in the next Section.</p>

               <p>1. IT is the imperfection of our finite
nature that we cannot at once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to divers things, but the more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
our intention is upon one, the
greater is our neglect of the rest. But
Gods infinity cannot be so bounded; his
eies at once see, and his providence at
once orders all the most distant and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
things in the world. He is not
such an Epicurean Deity, as to sequester
himself wholy to the enjoiment of his own
felicity, and to despise the concerns of
poor mortals; but tho he have his <hi>dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
so high, yet he humbleth himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the things in heaven and earth,</hi> Psal.
113. 5. Nor do's his providence confine
it self to the more splendid and greater
parts of managery, the conduct of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
and states, but it descends to the
lowest parts of his creation, to the <hi>foules</hi>
of the air, to the <hi>lilies</hi> of the field, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106844:65"/>
then sure our Saviors inference as to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is irrefragable, <hi>are ye not much better
then they?</hi> Mat. 6. 26. If a sparrow (as
he elsewhere tells his disciples) cannot
fall to the ground without Gods particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
notice, surely no human creature is
less considerable to him; nay if our very
haires are numbred, we cannot think the
excrescence is of more value then the
stock, but must conclude that God with
a particular advertence watches over the
concerns of every man.</p>
               <p>2. NOW God being infinitly good,
cannot thus attend us upon any insidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
design of doing us mischief, he wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
over us as a guardian not as a spy;
and directs his observation to the more
seasonable adapting his benefits: and as
he is thus gracious in designing our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
so is he no less wise in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it. All things saies the <hi>wiseman are
not profitable for all men</hi> Ecclus. 37. 28.
Indeed nothing is absolutly good but
God, all created things are good or ill
in reference to that to which they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
Meat is good, but to a surfeited
stomach tis not only nauseous but dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
Fire is good, but if put in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms,
not only burns our cloths but flesh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:106844:66"/>
And as humane wisdom directs the right
application of these and the like, so the
supreme and divine orders events accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the disposition of the person con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
<hi>he knows our frame</hi> Psal. 103. 14.
and discerns what operation such or such
things will have upon us, while we who
know neither our selves nor them can make
but random guesses, and worse choices.
And sure he that do's but thus in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
acknowledge Gods providence, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and wisdom (which he is, no Christian
who do's not) has a sufficient amulet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all his solicitudes, much more his
repinings. He cannot think he suffers
unawares to him who sees all things. He
cannot think his sufferings are design'd
for ill to him because they are dispos'd
by him who intends and projects his good.
Nor can he fear those intentions can mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
which are guided by an infinit and
unerring wisdom, and backt by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable
power. And sure this is as
the Apostle speaks Heb. 6. 18. <hi>strong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation</hi>
if we would but duely apply it.</p>
               <p>3. YET because general notions do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
make but light impressions on us,
it may not be amiss to make a little
more inspection, and to observe how ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106844:66"/>
they are to the several kinds of
our discontents. Now those may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to two, for either we are troubled
at the want of somthing we desire, or at
the suffering of somthing we would avert;
so that the two notions of privative and
positive, divide between them all our
affliction.</p>
               <p>4. THE first of these is usually the most
comprehensive, for there are few who have
not more torment from the apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of somwhat they want, then from the
smart of any thing they feel. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
whilst our desires are so vagrant and
exorbitant, they will be sure to furnish
matter enough for our discontents. But
certainly there is not in the world such
a charm for them, as the consideration
that God is more wise to discern, and
more careful to provide what is really
good for us then we our selves. We poor
purblind creatures look only on the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of things, and if we see a beautiful
appearance, somwhat that invites our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
we court it with the utmost earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but God penetrates deeper, he sees to
the bottom both of us and those things we
desire, and finds often that tho they may
please our appetite, they will hurt our
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106844:67"/>
health: and will no more give them to us,
then a careful father will to his child
those gilded poisons he cries for. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
this man is taken with the enchanting
music of fame, likes not his own obscure
station, but would fain present himself
upon a more public Theater, come into
the eie and croud of the world; but how
little do's he know how he shall act his
part there: whither he shall come off with
a plaudite or a hiss? he may render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
but the more public spectacle of scorn;
or if he do not that, he may by a better
success feed up his vaine glory to such a
bulk as may render him too great a weight
for that tottering pinacle whereon he
stands: and so after he has made a tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
circle, he may fall back with more
ignominy to his first point. Another it
may be no less eagerly desires wealth,
thinks (as once <hi>Cresus</hi> did) that he that
abounds in tresure cannot be emty of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity;
but alas how knows he how he shall
imploy it? There are two contrary temta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that attend riches; riots, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness:
and he is sure a little too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
that dares promise himself that
when there is such odds against him, he
shall certainly chuse the one just mean,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106844:67"/>
and if he do not, he do's only inflame his
account at the great Audit: Besides the
more wealth he has, the fairer booty he
is to the avarice of others; and it has bin
often seen, that many a man had not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so poor, if he had lived less rich. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perhaps thinks not himself so much
to want wealth as children to heir it,
and complains <hi>with Abraham, Lord what
wilt thou give me seeing I go childless?</hi> Gen.
15. 2. yet how knows he whether that
child he so much desires <hi>shall be a wise man
or a fool,</hi> Eccle. 2. 19. a comfort or a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation
to himself if he live to see his proof?
and if he do not, he do's but project for
an access to his dying cares in what hands
to leave him. <hi>Rachel</hi> sollicited this satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
with the greatest impatience, <hi>give
me children or I die,</hi> Gen. 30. 1. and tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
that the grant of her wish proved
the loss of her life.</p>
               <p>5. THUS in these and innumerable
other instances we drive on blindfold, and
very often impetuously pursue that which
would ruin us: and were God as short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted
as we, into what precipices should
we minutely hurry our selves? or were
he so unkind as to consider our impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
more then our interest, we should
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106844:68"/>
quickly sink under the weight of our own
wishes; and as <hi>Iuvenal</hi> in his tenth Satyr
excellently observes, perish by the sucess
and grant of our Praiers. I suppose there
is no man that soberly recollects the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
of his life, but can experimentally
say, he has somtimes desired things which
would have bin to his mischief if he had
had them, and that himself has after lookt
on the denial as a mercy: as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side when he has prosper'd in his aims,
and had what his soul lusted after, it has
bin but like the quailes to the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
a conviction and punishment, rather then
a satisfaction. And now surely God may
complaine of us as he did of <hi>Israel, How
loug will it be ere you believe me?</hi> Num.
14. 11. After all the attestations he has
given of his care and Providence over us,
after all the experiments we have had of
the folly of our own elections, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
yet be brought either to distrust our
selves, or rely upon him. We will still
be chusing and look on him as no farther
concern'd, then as the executioner of our
designs.</p>
               <p>6. THIS is certainly a strange perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and such as no sensible man would
be guilty of in any other instance. In all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106844:68"/>
our secular affaires we trust those whom
we have cause to think understand them
better then our selves, and rely upon men
in their own faculty. We put our estates
in the Lawiers hand, our bodies into the
Physicians, and submit to their advice tho
it be against our humor, merely because
we account them more competent judges.
Yet this deference we cannot be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pay to God, but will still be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
to him, and are very angry if
his dispensations do not exactly answer
our fancies. And can we offer him a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
affront then thus to distrust him? What
is it but interpretatively to deny either
his wisdom, or his goodness, or both?
and so derogate from him in two of his
essential attributes. For there can be no
rational account given by any who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
those, why they should not remit
their whole concerns to him. So that
the short account is, that in our distrusts
we either deny him to be God, or our
selves to be men, by resisting the most
evident dictates of that reason which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes
us from brutes. For certainly
there is not in human discourse a more
irrefragable Maxim, then that we ought
for our own sakes, to resign our selves
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106844:69"/>
to him, who we are infallibly sure, can,
and will, chuse better for us, then we for
our selves.</p>
               <p>7. THIS was so apparent by mere na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
light, that <hi>Socrates</hi> advised men to
pray only for blessings in general, and
leave the particular kinds of them to Gods
election, who best knows what is good
for us. And sure this is such a piece of
divinity, as extremely reproches us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
who cannot match a Heathen in
his implicit faith in God. Nay indeed
tis the vilest defamation upon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that we who pretend to know him
more, should trust him less. So that we
see our repinings do not terminate in their
own proper guilt, but do in their conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
swell higher, and our discontents
propagate themselves into Blasphemy. For
while we impatiently complain of our
wants, we do tacitly tax God to want
either that wisdom, power, or love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he should supply us. And sure he must
be very Atheistical to whom this will not
give a competent prejudice against this
sin.</p>
               <p>8. AND this very consideration will
equally prejudge the other branch of our
discontents, I mean those which repine
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106844:69"/>
at the ills we suffer. And not only our
privative, but our positive afflictions may
by it have their bitterness taken off: for
the same goodness and wisdom which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
those things we like, because they
are hurtful for us, do's upon the very same
reason give us those distastful things
which he sees profitable. A wise Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
do's not only diet, but if occasion
be purge his patient also. And surely
there is not such a purifier, such a cleanser
of the soul as are afflictions, if we do not
(like disorderly patients) frustrate their
efficacy by the irregular managery of our
selves under them.</p>

               <head>SECT. VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of the Advantage of Afflictions.</head>
               <p>1. IT were the work of a volume to give
an exact and minute account of the
benefit of afflictions. I shall only point
at some of the more general and obvious.
And first it is one of the most awakening
calls to repentance; and to this end it is
that God most usually designs it. We see
the whole scene of it, Hos. 5. 15. <hi>I will go and
return to my place, till they acknowledg their
offence, and seek my face: in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they will seek me early:</hi> and in the very
next verse we find this voice of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choed
forth by a penitential note, <hi>Come
and let us return unto the Lord, for he hath
torn, and he will heal us, he hath smitten,
and he will bind us up.</hi> Thus we find the
Brethren of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> tho there had a long
interval passed betwixt their barbarous u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of him, and his feigned rigor to them,
yet when they saw themselves distrest by
the one, then they begin to recollect the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106844:70"/>
other, saying, <hi>We are verily guilty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our brother,</hi> Gen. 42. 21. Prosperity
is an intoxicating thing, and there are
few brains strong enough to bear it; it
laies us a sleep, and amuses us with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
dreams, whil'st in the mean time <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
rifles our tresures, and spoiles us, by
the deceitful charms of sin, of our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and real happiness. And can there
be a more friendly office don for a man
in this condition, then to rouze him, and
bring him to apprehend the designs that
are laid against him? And this is the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
on which afflictions are sent: so that
we have reason to look on them as our
friends and confederates that intend our
rescue, and to take the alarm they give
us, and diligently seek out those intestine
enemies of which they warn us. And he
that instead of this, quarrels at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposing,
thinks them his <hi>enemies because
they tell him the truth,</hi> Gal. 4. 16. do's
miserably pervert <hi>the counsel of God against
himself,</hi> Luk. 7. 30. and may at last ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify
his own jealousies; and by so provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an ingratitude, convert those into
the wounds of an enemy, which were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
meant as the corrections of a
Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:106844:71"/>
2. AND as afflictions do thus in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
admonish us of sins, so it pleases God
most frequently so to model and frame
them, that they bear the very image and
impress of those particular guilts they are
to chastise, and are the dark shadows that
attend our gay delights, or flagrant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies.
The wise man observes that
the turning the Egyptian waters into
blood, was a manifest reproof of that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
commandment for the murdering of
the Hebrew infants, Wisd. 12. 5. And
surely we might in most if not all our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
see some such corresponding cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;
as may lead us to the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
provoking cause of it. God who
do's all things in number, weight, and
mesure, do's in punishments also observe
a symmetry and proportion, and adapts
them not only to the heinousness, but
even the very specific kind of our crimes.
The only fixt immutable rule he has given
for his Vice-gerents on earth to punish by,
is that in the case of murder, which is
we see grounded on this rule of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>He that sheddeth mans blood, by man
shall his blood be shed,</hi> Gen. 9. 6. And
tho he have now rescinded the inferior
retaliations of the <hi>eie for the eie, the tooth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106844:71"/>
for the tooth,</hi> Exod. 21. 24. (probably
for the hardness of our hearts, because he
saw our revengeful natures would be too
much pleased with it) yet he has not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
himself from acting by those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
but we see it do's very often signally
make men feel the smart of those violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
or injustices they have used to others.
Of this the Sacred story affords several ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
(as <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> Jud. 1. 6. and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi>
1 King. 21. 19.) and profane many
more, and daily experience and observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
most of all. And tho this method
of retaliation is not alwaies so evident and
apparent to the world, because mens sins
are not alwaies so, yet I believe if men
would duly recollect, it would be for
the most part discernable to their own
consciences, and they would apparently
see, that their calamities did but trace the
footsteps of their sins.</p>
               <p>3. NOW if we rightly weigh this, we
cannot but think it a very advantageous
circumstance. We are naturally blind when
we look inward, and if we have not some
adventitious light to clear the object, will
be very apt to overlook it. Therefore
since the end of all our afflictions is our
repentance, it is a wise and gracious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106844:72"/>
that they do thus point to us those
particular sins of which we are to repent.
The body of sin will not be destroied in
the whole entire bulk, but must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
pull'd to pieces limb by limb.
He that attaques it otherwise, will be like
<hi>Sertorius</hi>'s soldier, who ineffectively tugg'd
at the horses tail to get it off at once,
when he that pull'd it hair by hair, quickly
did it. Therefore as it is a great part of our
spiritual Wisdom to know in what espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
parts the <hi>Sampson</hi>-like strength of our
corruptions lie, so is it a great instance of
Gods care of us, thus by his corrections
to discipline and instruct us in it.</p>
               <p>4. In all our afflictions therefore it is
our concern, nicely and critically to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them. I mean not to enhance our
murmurs and complaints, but to learn by
them what is Gods peculiar controversy
against us. This is indeed <hi>to hear the rod,
and who hath appointed it,</hi> Mic. 6. 9. Let
him therefore that suffers in any of his
concerns, examin whether he have not
some corresponding guilt which answers
to it, <hi>as face answers face,</hi> Prov. 27. 19.
He that is impoverished in his estate, let
him consider first how he acquired it,
whether there were not somthing of fraud
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106844:72"/>
or injustice, which like a cancrous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
mixt in its very elements and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
and eat out its bowels: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
some sacrilegious prize, some coal
from the altar have not fired his nest. Or
if nothing can be charged upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
let him consider how he has used
it; whether he have not made it the fuel
of his lusts, in riot and excesses, or the
object of his adoration in an inordinate
value of it. In like manner he who is
afflicted in his body, groans under the
torment of some grievous disease, may very
seasonably interrogate himself, whether
it have not bin contracted by his vice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>his bones be not</hi> (in a more literal sense
then <hi>Iob</hi> meant it) <hi>full of the sins of his
youth,</hi> Job. 20. 11. and his furfeting and
drunkeness be not the cause, <hi>that his
soul,</hi> as the Psalmist speaks, <hi>abhors all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of meat, and is even hard at deaths door,</hi>
Psal. 107. 18. or at least whether the not
imploying his health and strength to those
purposes for which twas given, is not the
reason of its being withdrawn. He also
that is invaded in his reputation, that lies
under some great infamy, is to consider
whether it be not deserved; whether some
part if not the whole guilt of which he
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106844:73"/>
is accused, stick not to him: or if he be
clear in that particular instance, whether
some conceled sin of his would not if it
were known, incur as great scandal: for
in that case he has in right forfeited
his reputation, and God may make the
feizure as well by an unjust, as a just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation.
Or if his heart accuse him not
here, yet let him farther reflect, whether
his vain-glorious pursuits of praise and
high conceits of himself, have not made
this an apt and necessary humiliation for
him. Or lastly let him recollect how
he has behaved himself towards others in
this kind: whether he have had a just ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of his neighbors fame, or have
not rather exposed and prostituted it. In
these and many other instances such a
particular scrutiny, would (in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility)
discover the affinity and cogna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between our guilts and our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and by marking out the spring
and fountain head, direct us how to stop
or divert the current. And he that
would diligently imploy himself in this
inquisition, would find little leisure and
less cause to condole his afflictions, but
would divert all his complaints upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>accept of the punishment of his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:106844:73"/>
and thank the Lord for thus giving him
warning,</hi> Psal. 16. 8.</p>
               <p>5. A second benefit which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
us in our afflictions is the weaning
us from the world, to disentangle us from
its fetters and charms, and draw us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
We read in the story of the <hi>Deluge,</hi>
that so long as the earth was covered
with waters, the very <hi>Raven</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to take shelter in the Ark, but
when all was fair and dry, even the <hi>Dove</hi>
finally forsook it, Gen. 8. 12. And tis
much so with us, the worst of men will
commonly in distresses have recourse to
God (the very heathen mariners in a
storm could rebuke <hi>Ionah</hi> for not calling
upon his God, Jon. 1. 6.) when yet the
very best of us, are apt to forget him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
the blandishments and insinuations
of prosperity. The kind aspects of the
world are very enchanting, apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle
and besot us, and therefore it is
Gods care over us, to let us sometimes see
her more averting countenance in her
frowns and storms; that, as children
frighted by some ugly appearance, we
may run into the arms of our father. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
were all things exactly fitted to our
humors here, when should we think of a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106844:74"/>
remove? and had not death some har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers
to prepare us or him, what a
surprising guest would he be to us? Tis
storied of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that seing a soldier
in his camp of so dareing a courage that
he alwaies courted the most hazardous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temts,
and observing him also of a very
infirm sickly habit, he took a particular
care of him, and by medicines and good
attendance recovered him; which no
sooner he had don, but the man grew
more cautious, and would no longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himself as formerly; and gave this
reason for it, that now he was healthy his
life was of some value to him, and not
to be hazarded at the same rate, as when
it was only a burden; and should God
cure all our complaints, render us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
at ease, I fear too many of us would
be of the soldiers mind, think our lives too
good to resign to him, much more to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
for him, as our Christianity in many
cases obliges us. The son of <hi>Syrach</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
how <hi>dreadful death is to a man that is
at rest in his possessions, that hath abundance
of all things, and hath nothing to vex him,</hi>
nay he descends much lower; and puts in
him <hi>who is yet able to receive meat,</hi> Ecclus.
14. 1. The truth is we do so passionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106844:74"/>
dote upon the world, that like besotted
lovers, we can bear a great deal of ill usage,
before we quit our pursuit. Any little
slight favor atones us after multiplied af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts,
and we must be disciplined by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted
disappointments, ere we can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
our confidence. But how fatally
secure should we be, if God should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this Siren alwaies to entertain us
with her music, and should not by some
discordant grating notes, interrupt our
raptures, and recal us to sober thoughts?</p>
               <p>6. INDEED tis one of the highest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of Gods love, and of his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
also, thus to project our reducement.
We were all in our Baptism affianced to
him, with a particular abrenunciation of
the world, so that we cannot without the
greatest disloialty cast our selves into its
embraces; and yet when we have thus
<hi>broken the covenant of our God,</hi> Prov. 2. 17.
he do's not pursue us with a jealous rage,
with the severity which an abused rival'd
kindness would suggest, doth not give us
a bill of divorce and disclame his relation;
but contrives how he may reclame and
bring us back to himself. The transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of this lenity God excellently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
by the prophet in the case of Israel
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106844:75"/>
                  <hi>They say if a man put away his wife, and
she become another mans shall he return
unto her again? but thou hast plaied the
harlot with many lovers, yet return unto me
saith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 3. 1. And this tho
a great height of indulgence, is no more
then he daily repetes to us. After we
have basely adulterated with the world,
converted our affections from God to it,
he do's not give us over, abandon us to
our leud course, and consequent ruin;
but still invites our return, and lest that
may not serve, he do's with a great deal
of holy artifice essay to break that accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
League into which we are enter'd,
pulls off the disguise in which the world
courted us, and makes us see it as it is it
self, a scene of <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit,</hi>
Eccles. 1. 14.</p>
               <p>6. AND as he do's this in general, so
also with a particular application to those
temporal satisfactions wherewith we were
most transported; the things to which we
are more indifferent do not so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
us, tis those upon which we have
more vehemently set our hearts which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our snares, and awake his jealousy;
and accordingly we frequently see that
tis in those he chuses to cross us. How
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106844:75"/>
often do's it happen that those which
are enamoured of themselves, dote upon
their own features, do meet with some
disease or accident which blasts their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
withers that faire flower, and makes
their winter overtake their spring? So
in our friends and relations tis usually
seen, we soonest loose those for whom
we have the greatest, the most immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
passion. If there be one fondling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our children, tis odds but that is
taken away, or made as much the object
of our grief and sorrow, as ever it was of
our joy and love. When God sees our
hearts so excessively cleave to any tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory
thing, he knows tis necessary to
sever them, for whilst we have such clogs
upon us, <hi>our souls will cleave to the dust.</hi>
Psa. 119. 1. will not be able to soare up
to the higher region for which they are
design'd.</p>
               <p>7. IN a word God so loves us, that he
removes what ever he sees will obstruct
that intimate union which he desires with
us, and sure this is so obliging, that tho
he should bid us to our loss, tho he could
not recompence us for what he takes from
us, yet we must be very ill natur'd if we
can be angry at so much kindness. But
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106844:76"/>
when to this is added that all this is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
nay solely design'd for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that God takes from us all these
emty delusory contentments merely that
he may instate us in solid and durable
joies; we betray as much ignorance of
our interest, as insensibleness of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation,
if we repine that God makes us so
much his care. Tis true indeed, the things
to which we have so inordinatly adhered,
do stick so close, that they cannot be pull'd
away without some pain: yet for our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
security we can endure the sundring
of parts that do not only cleave, but grow
to us. He that has a gangrend member
suffers it to be cut off to save his whole
body, and do's not revile, but thank and
reward the Chirurgion. Yet where our
souls are concern'd, and where the things
have no native union with us, but are only
cemented by our passions, we are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of the method, and think God deals
very hardly with us, not to let us perish
with what we love. The sum of all is
this, God tho he be abundantly conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending,
yet he will never stoop so low as
to share his interest in us with the world:
if we will devote our selves to it, tis not
all our emty forms of service will satisfy
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106844:76"/>
him, if he cannot divorce our hearts from
it, he will divorce himself eternally from
us. And the case being thus, we are sure
very ill advised if we do not contentedly
resign our selves to his methods, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
endure them how sharp soever. The
only expedient we have for our own ease,
is to shorten the cure by giving our assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and not by struglings to render
it more difficult and painful, let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
surrender our wills to him, and when
we have don that, we may without much
pain let him take any thing else. But
the more difficult we find it to be disen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
from the world, the greater should
our caution be against all future engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to it. If our escape hath bin as
the Apostle saies, <hi>so as by fire,</hi> Jud. 23.
with much smart and hazard, let us at least
have so much wit, as the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
allows children, and not again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our selves: let us never glue our hearts
to any external thing, but let all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of the world hang loose about us:
by that means we shall be able to put them
off insensibly when ever God calls for
them, or perhaps we shall prevent his call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for them at all, it being for the most
part, our too close adhesion to them which
promts him to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:106844:77"/>
8. A third advantage of afflictions is,
that it is a mark and signature of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option,
a witness of our legitimation.
<hi>What son is he</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>whom
the Father chastiseth not? but if ye be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
chastisement whereof all are partakers,
then are ye bastards and not sons,</hi> Heb, 12.
7. 8. <hi>Iacob</hi> clad his dearling <hi>Ioseph</hi> in a
party-coloured Coat, and Gods favorites
do here wear a Livery inter-woven with
a mixture of dark and gloomy colours;
their <hi>long white robes</hi> are laid up for them
against they come to the <hi>marriage of the
Lamb,</hi> Rev. 19 7. Indeed we much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
the design of Christianity, if we think
it calls us to a condition of ease and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
It might suit well enough with
the votaries of the Golden Calf, to <hi>sit
down to eat and drink and rise up to play,</hi>
Exod. 32. 6. but the disciples of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Savior are trained to another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
our profession enters us into a state
of warfare, and accordingly our very Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
engagement runs all in military
terms, and we are not only servants of
Christs family, but soldiers of his camp.
Now we know in a war men must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to pass their time in ease and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but besides all the dangers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106844:77"/>
of the combat, have many other
hardships to endure; hunger and thirst,
heat and cold, hard lodgings and weary
marches: and he that is too nice for those,
will not long stick to his colors. And
it is the same in our spiritual warfare, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pressures and sufferings are annexed to
it, and our passive valor is no less tried
then our active. In respect of this it is
that our Savior admonishes his Profelytes
to compute first the difficulties incident
to their profession, and that he may not
ensnare us by proposing too easy terms,
he bids us reckon upon the worst, and
tells us, that he <hi>that forsakes not all that
he hath, shall not be his disciple,</hi> Luk. 14. 26.
<hi>and that we must thro much tribulatiou enter
into the kingdom of God,</hi> Act. 14. 22. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
twere very absurd for us to expect
easier conditions, when these are the same
to which our Leader has submitted, the
<hi>Captain of our Salvation was perfected by
sufferings.</hi> Heb. 2. 10. <hi>and if it behooved
Christ to suffer before he enter'd into his glory,</hi>
Luk 24. 46. it were insolent madness for
us to look to be carried thither upon our
beds of Ivory, of from the noise of our
harps and viols, be immmediatly rapt into
the Choire of Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:106844:78"/>
8. THIS has bin so much consider'd
by pious men, that they have lookt upon
their secular prosperities with fear and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy,
and many have solemnly petition'd
for crosses, as thinking them the necessary
attestation of their son-ship, and means of
assimulation to their elder brother. Why
then should that which was so desirable
to them, appear so formidable to us? or
why should we so vehemently deprecate,
what they so earnestly invited? If we
indeed think it a privilege to be the sons
of God and fellow-heirs with Christ, why
do we grudg at the condition? The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Captain tells St. <hi>Paul</hi> that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the immunities of a Roman <hi>with
a great sum,</hi> Act. 22. 28. and shall we
expect so much a nobler and more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
adoption perfectly <hi>gratis?</hi> look
that God should change his whole Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
for our ease, give us an eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
discharged of those temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances
himself has annexed to it This
were sure as unjust a hope as it would be
a vain one. When <hi>David</hi> had that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snaring
proposal made him of being the
Kings son in law, 1 Sam. 18. 21. he set
such a value upon the dignity, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
the difficulty of the condition: and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106844:78"/>
sure we must have very low abject souls,
if when so infinitly a higher advancement
is sincerely offer'd us, we can suffer any
apprehension of hardship to divert us. In a
word let us remember that of the Apostle,
<hi>if we suffer, we shall also reign with him,</hi>
2 Tim. 2. 12. And tho our afflictions be
in themselves not joious but grievous, yet
when they are consider'd as the earnest of
our future inheritance, they put on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
face, and may rather enamour then
fright us.</p>
               <p>9. A fourth advantage of afflictions is,
that they excite our compassions towards
others: there is nothing qualifies us so
rightly to estimate the suffering of others,
as the having our selves felt them: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this our apprehensions of them are as
dull and confused, as a blind mans of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
or a deaf man of sounds. They <hi>that
stretch themselves upon their couches, that
eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves
out of the midst of the stall: that chaunt to the
sound of the viol, drink wine in bowls, and
anoint themselves with the chief ointments,
will not much be grieved with the afflictions
of Ioseph.</hi> Am. 6. 4. Nay so necessary is
our experience towards our commiserati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that we see twas thought a requisite
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106844:79"/>
accomplishment of our high Priest (that
highest example of unboundnded com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion)
and therefore saith the Apostle,
<hi>It behooved him in all things to be made
like his brethren, that he might be a merciful
and faithful high priest in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, to make reconciliation for the
sins of the people, for in that he himself hath
suffer'd being temted, he is able also to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them that are temted,</hi> Heb. 2. 17, 18.
But if he whose mere sense of our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
brought him down to us, chose this
expedient to advance his pity, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
is it to our petrified bowels? And
since God has assign'd our mercies to our
brethren, as the standard by which he
will proportion his to us, tis more ours
then their advantage to have them inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
so that when by making us tast of their
cup, acquainting us with the bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of their sufferings, he prepares us to
a Christian sympathy with them, tis but
a remoter way of obliging and qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us for a more ample portion of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Nay besides the profit there is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
accrues to us by it; compassion is one
of the best properties of our nature, and
we unman our selves when we put it off;
nay more tis an attribute of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106844:79"/>
and the more we advance in it, the
closer approches we make to him. And
therefore we have all reason to bless him
for that discipline by which he promotes
us in so excellent, so necessary a grace.</p>
               <p>10. A fifth benefit of afflictions is that
it is an improvement of devotion, sets
us with more heartiness to our praiers.
Whilst prosperity flows in upon us we bath
our selves in its streams, but are very apt
to forget its source; so that God is fain
to stop the current, leave us dry and
parched that our needs may make us do
what our gratitude would not, trace our
blessings up to the original spring, and
both acknowledg and invoke him as the
Author of all our good. This effect of
afflictions is observ'd by the prophet,
<hi>Lord in trouble have they visited thee, they
poured out a praier when thy chastning was
upon them,</hi> Isa. 26. 16. And I believe I
may appeal to every mans experience whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his praiers be not more frequent
and more hearty too, when he is under
some distress. Then how importunate are
we in our petitions? how profuse in our
vowes and promises? saying with Israel
<hi>deliver us only we pray thee this day: and they
put away the strange Gods from among them,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106844:80"/>
and served the Lord.</hi> Jud. 10. 15. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
tis no good indication of our temper
that we need thus to be put in the press
ere we will yield any thing? yet since we
are so disingenuous, tis a mercy in God to
adapt his methods to us; to extort when
we will not give, and if he can have no
free will offerings, yet at least to exact his
tribute. Nor do's he design the effect of
this should cease with the calamity that
rais'd it, but expects our compel'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
should bring us into the way of
voluntary ones, and happily ensnare us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
piety. And indeed herein are we worse
then brutish if it do not. We think it a
barbarous rudeness to engage a man in
our affaires, and as soon as we have served
our own turns, never take farther notice
of him. Nay indeed the very beasts may
lecture us in this piece of Morality, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them paying a signal gratitude
where they have received benefits, and
shall we not come up at least to their pitch?
shall not the endearment of our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
bring our deliverer into some repute
and consideration with us, and make us
desire to keep up an acquaintance and
entercourse with him? Yet if ingenuity
work not with us, let interest at least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106844:80"/>
and the remembrance how soon
we may need him again, admonish us not
to make our selves strangers to him. God
complains of Israel <hi>wherefore say my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
we are Lords? we will come no more at
thee,</hi> Jer. 2. 31. A very insolent folly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that dependance by which alone
they subsisted, and no less will it be in
any of us if we stop our recourse to him
because we have had advantage by it. We
have no assurance that the same occasion
shall not recur, but with what face
can we then resume that entercourse
which in the interval we despised? So that
if we have but any ordinary providence
we shall still so celebrate past rescues
as to continue in a capacity of begging
more, and then we cannot but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the benefit of those first calamities
which inspirited our devotion, and taught
us to pray in earnest, and will be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that our thanks should be utter'd in a
fainter accent then our petitions; or our
daily spiritual concerns should be more
coldly sollicited then our temporal acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
ones.</p>
               <p>11. NOR is it only our devotion that is
thus improved by our distresses, but many
other Graces; our faith, our hope, our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106844:81"/>
our Christian sufferance &amp; fortitude.
It is no triumph of faith to trust God for
those good things which he gives us in
hand, this is rather to walk by sense then
faith, but to rely on him in the greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
<hi>and against hope to believe in hope,</hi>
this is the faith of a true child of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and will <hi>be imputed</hi> to us (as it was to him)
<hi>for righteousness</hi> Rom. 4. 23. So also our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
owes all its opportunities of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
to our afflictions, and consequently
owes also a great part of its being to them,
for we know desuetude will loose habits.
What imaginable use is there of patience,
where there is nothing to suffer? In our
prosperous state, we may indeed imploy
our temperance, our humility, our cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but patience seems then a useless
vertue: nay indeed for ought we know
may be counterfeit, till adversity bring it
to the test. And yet this is the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
accomplishment of a Christian, that
which most eminently conforms him to
the Image of his Savior, whose whole life
was a perpetual exercise of this grace; and
therefore we love our ease too well if we
are unwilling to buy this pearl at any
price.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:106844:81"/>
12. LASTLY our thankfulness is
(at least ought to be) increa'st by our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses.
Tis very natural for us to reflect
with value and esteem upon those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
we have lost, and we too often do
it to aggravate our discontent: but sure
the more rational use of it is to raise our
thankfulness for the time wherein we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied
them. Nay not only our former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiments,
but even our present depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
deserves our gratitude, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the happy advantages we may reap
from them. If we will perversly cast
them away, that unworthy contemt paies
no scores, for we still stand answerable
in Gods account for the good he design'd
and we might have had by it, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
liable to a new charge for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
in thus <hi>despising the chastisement
of the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 5.</p>
               <p>13. AND now if all these benefits of
afflictions (which are yet but imperfectly
recited) may be thought worth consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
it cannot but reconcile us to
the sharpest of Gods methods; unless we
will own our selves such mere animals,
as to have no other apprehensions then
what our bodily senses convey to us; for
sure he that has reason enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106844:82"/>
that he has an immortal soul, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but assent that its interests should be
served, tho with the displacency of his
flesh. Yet even in regard of that, our
murmurings are oft very unjust, for we
do many times ignorantly prejudg Gods
designs towards us even in temporals,
who frequently makes a little transient
uneasiness the passage to secular felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<hi>Moses</hi> when he fled out of Egypt,
probably little thought that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
thither a <hi>God unto Pharoah,</hi> Exod.
4. 16. and as little did <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he
was brought thither a slave, that he was to
be a ruler there: yet as distant as those states
were, the divine providence had so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
them, that the one depends upon
the other. And certainly we may often
observe the like over-ruling hand in our
own distresses, that those events which
we have entertained with the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
have in the consequences bin very
beneficial to us.</p>
               <p>14. To conclude, we have certainly
both from speculation &amp; experience abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
matter to clam all our disquiets, to
satisfy our distrusts, and to fix in us an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
resignation to Gods disposals, who has
designs which we cannot penetrate, but
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106844:82"/>
none which we need fear, unless we our
selves pervert them. We have our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viors
word for it, that <hi>he will not give us
a stone when we ask bread, nor a scorpion
when we ask a fish,</hi> Mat. 7. 9. Nay his
love secures us yet farther from the errors
of our own wild choice, and do's not give
us those stones and scorpions which we
importune for. Let us then leave our
concerns to him who best knows them,
and make it our sole care to entertain his
dispensations with as much submission and
duty, as he dispences them with love and
wisdom. And if we can but do so, we
may dare all the power of earth and hell
too, to make us miserable: for be our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
what they can, we are sure they
are but what we in some respect or other
need; be they privative or positive, the
want of what we wish, or the suffering of
what we wish not, they are the disposals
of him who cannot err, and we shall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
have cause to say with the Psalmist,
<hi>It is good for me that I have bin afflicted,</hi>
Psal. 119. 71.</p>

mens: &amp; he that do's that, will certainly
see so little cause to think himself singular,
that he will not find himself superlative in
calamity; for there is no man living that

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106844:83"/>
estimate of other mens afflictions,
may divert us from all loud out-cries of
our own. <hi>Solon</hi> seeing a friend much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
with grief, carried him up to a town
that over-lookt the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> and
shewing him all the buildings, said to him,
consider how many sorrows have, do, and
shall in future ages inhabit under all those
roofs, and doe not vex thy self with those
inconveniencies which are common to
mortality, as if they were only yours. And
sure twas good advice: for suffering is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as inseparable an adjunct of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as dying is: yet we do not see men
very apt to imbitter their whole lives by
the fore-sight that they must die, but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it a thing as universal as inevitable,
they are more forward to take up the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures
resolution, <hi>Let us eat and drink,
for to morrow we die,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 32. And
why should we not look upon afflictions
also as the common lot of humanity, and
as we take the advantages, so be content
to bear the incumbrances of that state?</p>
               <p>2. BUT besides that implicite allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
that is thus to be made for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
calamities of others, if we survey
but those that lie open and visible to us,
the most of us shall find enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106844:84"/>
our complaints. Who is
there that when he has most studiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
his miseries, may not find some
or other that apparently equals, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
him? He that stomacs his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contemn'd and slighted, may see an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
persecuted and opprest. He that
groans under some sharp pain, may see
another afflicted with sharper: and even
he that has the most acute torments in his
body, may see another more sadly cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
by the agonies of his mind. So that
if we would but look about us, we should
see so many forreign occasions of our pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that we should be asham'd to confine
it wholly to our selves.</p>
               <p>3. IT will perhaps be said that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be universally true, for that there must
in comparative degrees be some lowest
state of misery: I grant it, but still that
state consists not in such an indivisible
point, that any one person can have the
inclosure; or if it do, twill be so hard for
any to discern who that one person is; that
I need desire no fairer a composition, then
to have every man suspend his repinings,
till he can evince his title. But alas there
are but few that can make any approches
to such a pretenec: for tho if we advert to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106844:84"/>
mens complaints, we should think all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of comparison were confounded,
and every man were equally the greatest
sufferer; yet certainly in the truth of
things tis nothing so: for (not to repete
what was before mention'd, that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
no man is miserable in any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the utmost degree of possibility)
the remarkably unhappy are very far the
lesse number. And how passionatly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
men exaggerate their calamities, yet
perhaps in their sober mood, they will
scarce change states with those whom they
profess to think more happy then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
It was the saying of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that
if there were a common bank made of all
mens troubles, most men would rather
chuse to take those they brought, then
to venter upon a new dividend. And
indeed he had reason for his supposition;
for considering how great a part of many
mens afflictions are of their own making,
fictitious and imaginary, they may justly
fear least they should exchange feathers
for lead, their own emty shadows for the
real and pressing calamities of others, and
cannot but think it best to sit down with
their own, which serves their declamations
as well, and their ease much better. We
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106844:85"/>
oft see men at a little mis-shaping of a
garment, a scarce discernable error in
their cook, or their shortest interruption
in their sports, in such transports of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as if they were the most unfortunate
men in the world; yet for all that you
shall hardly perswade them to change with
him whose course clothings supersedes all
care of the fashion, whose appetite was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
disappointed for want of sawce, and
whose perpetual toil makes him insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
what the defeat of sport signifies.</p>
               <p>4. NAY even where the exchange seems
more equal, where the afflictions are on
both sides solid and substantial, yet a
prudent man would scarce venture upon
the barter. Tis no small advantage to
know what we have to contest with, to
have experimented the worst of its atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
by which we become better able to
guard our selves: but a new evil comes
with the force of a surprise, and finds us
open and disarmed. It is indeed almost a
miraculous power that custom has in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
us to things otherwise displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
all our senses are taught to remit
of their aversion by familiarity with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
objects: that ugly form which
at first makes us start, by use devests its
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106844:85"/>
terror, and we reconcile our selves to
harsh-sounds &amp; ill relishes by long custom.
And sure it has the very same effect upon
our minds, the most fierce calamities do
by acquaintance grow more tractable; so
that he that exchanges an old one for a
new, do's but bring a wild Lion into his
house instead of a tame: it may for ought
he knows immediatly tear him in pieces,
but at least must cost him a great deal of
pains to render it gentle and familiar,
and certainly no wise man would wish to
make such a bargain.</p>
               <p>5. BY all this it appears that how extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly
soever we aggravate our own
calamities and extenuate other mens, we
dare not upon recollection stand to our
own estimate, and what can be said more
in prejudice of our discontents? Tis a grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
maxim that every man must have affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<hi>man that is born of a woman, saies
Iob, is of few years, and full of trouble</hi> Job.
14. 4. and we must reverse Gods funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
law, before we can hope for a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
exemption. All that any man can aspire
to, is to have but an equal share with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and the generality of men have
so, at least none can prove he has not so;
and till he can, his murmurs will sure be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106844:86"/>
very unjustifiable, especially when they
have this convincing circumstance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, that he dares not upon sober
thoughts change his afflictions with most
of his neighbors. He is an ill member of
a community, who in public assesments
would shuffle off all paiments: and he is
no better who in this common tax God
has laid upon our nature, is not content
to bear his share.</p>
               <p>6. AND truly would we but consider
that in all our sufferings nothing befals us
but what is common to our kind, nay
which is extremely exceeded by many
within the verge of our own observation,
we must be senselessily partial to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.
The Apostle thought it a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
consolation for the first Christians
that <hi>there had no temtation befallen them
but what was common to men,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.
13. and we betray very extravagant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of our selves if it be not so to us.
Indeed twas scarce possible for us to be
so unsatisfied, as the greatest part of us
are, did we in the comparing our selves
with others, proceed with any tolerable
ingenuity.</p>
               <p>7. BUT alas we are very fallacious and
deceitful in the point, we do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106844:86"/>
the good of others with our good,
not their evil with our evil; but with an
envious curiosity we amass together all
the desireable circumstances of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
condition, and with as prying dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
we ransack all our grievances,
and confront to them. This is so insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
a way of proceeding, as the most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
understanding can detect. If I
should wager that my arm were longer
then another mans, and for tryall mesure
my arm with his finger, he must be stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly
silly, that should award for me;
and yet this were not a grosser cheat, then
that which we put upon our selves, in our
comparisons with others. And tis a little
strange to observe unto what various pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
we can apply this one thin piece of
Sophistry, for when we compare our
neighbors and our selves in point of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
we do but reverse the fallacy, and
presently make his vices as much exceed
ours, as our calamities did his in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
instance. They are indeed both great
violences to reason and justice, yet the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is sure the pleasanter kind of deceit.
A man has some joy in thinking himself
less wicked then his neighbor, but what
imaginable comfort can he take in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106844:87"/>
himself more miserable? certainly he
that would submit to a cousenage, had
much better shift the scene, and think
his sufferings less then they are, rather
then more; for since opinion is the thing
that usually sets an edg upon our cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
it might be a profitable deceit
that could steal that from us.</p>
               <p>8. BUT we need not blindfold our
selves if we would but use our eies aright,
and see things in their true shapes; and if
we did thus, what a strange turn would
there be in the common estimates of the
world? How many of the gilded troubles
of greatness, which men at a distance
look on with so much admiration and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
would then be as much contemned
as now they are courted? A competency
would then get the better of abundance,
and the now envied pomp of princes,
when balanced with the cares and hazards
annext, would be so far from a bait, that
men like <hi>Saul</hi> 1 Sam 10. 22. would <hi>hide
themselves</hi> from the preferment; and he
that understood the weight, would rather
choose to weild a Flayle then a Scepter:
yet so childishly are we besotted with the
glittering appearance of things, that we
conclude felicity must needs dwell where
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106844:87"/>
there is a magnificent Portico, and being
possest with this fancy we over-look her
in our own humbler Cottages, where she
would more constantly reside, if she could
but find us at home: but we are commonly
engag'd in a rambling pursuit of her where
she is seldomest to be found, and in the
interim misse of her at our own doors.</p>
               <p>9. INDEED there is scarce a greater
folly or unhappiness incident to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then this fond admiration of other
mens enjoiments, and contemt of our own.
And whilst we have that humour, it will
supplant not only our present, but all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities
of our future content: for tho
we could draw to our selves all those
things for which we envy others, we should
have no sooner made them our own, then
they will grow despicable and nauseous
to us. This is a speculation which has
bin attested by innumerable experiments,
there being nothing more frequent, then
to see men with impatient eagerness, nay
often with extreme hazards pursue those
acquests, which when they have them,
they are immediatly sick of. There is
scarce any man that may not give himself
instances of this in his own particular: and
yet so fatally stupid are we, that no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106844:88"/>
will discipline us, or take us off from
these false estimates of other mens hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesses.
And truly while we state our
comparisons so unequally, they are as mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
as the common proverb speaks
them odious: but if we would begin at
the right end, and look with as much
compassion on the adversities of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
as we do with envy on their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
every man would find cause to sit
down contentedly with his own burden,
and confess that he bears but the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
share of his common nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
perhaps it be where some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
demerits of his own have added to
the weight; and in that case he has more
reason to admire his afflictions are so few,
then so many. And certainly every man
knows so many more ills by himself, then
it is possible for him to do by another, that
he that really sees himself exceed others
in his sufferings, will find cause enough to
think he do's in sins also.</p>
               <p>10. BUT if we stretch the comparison
beyond our contemporaries, and look back
to the generations of old, we shall have
yet farther cause to acknowledge Gods
great indulgence to us. <hi>Abraham</hi> tho the
friend of God was not exemted from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106844:88"/>
trials; he was first made to wander
from his Country, and betake himself
to a kind of vagrant life, was a long time
suspended from the blessing of his desired
off-spring, and when at last his beloved
<hi>Isaac</hi> was obtained, it caused a domestic
jarre, which he was fain to compose by
the expulsion of <hi>Ishmael</hi> tho his son also.
But what a contest may we think there
was in his own bowels when that rigorous
task was imposed on him of sacrificing his
<hi>Isaac?</hi> and tho his faith gloriously triumpht
over it, yet sure there could not be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
pressure upon human nature. <hi>David</hi>
the man after Gods own heart is no less
signal for his afflictions then for his piety,
he was for a great while an exile from his
Countrey, and (which he most bewailed)
from the Sanctuary by the persecutions
of <hi>Saul:</hi> and after he was setled in that
throne to which Gods immediate assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had intitled him, what a succession
of calamities had he in his own family?
the incestuous rape of his Daughter, the
retaliation of that by the as unnatural mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>Amnon,</hi> and that seconded by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
no less barbarous conspiracy of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solom</hi>
against himself, his expulsion from
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the base revilings of <hi>Shimei,</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:106844:89"/>
and finally the losse of that dearling son
in the act of his sin. A cluster of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
in comparison whereof the most
of ours are but like the <hi>gleanings</hi> (as the
Prophet speaks) <hi>after the vintage is don.</hi>
It were indeed endless to instance in
all the several Fore-fathers of our Faith
before <hi>Christs</hi> incarnation, the Apostle
gives us a brief, but very comprehensive
compendium of their sufferings, <hi>They had
trial of cruel mockings and scourgings; yea
moreover, of bonds and imprisonments: they
were stoned, were sawn asunder, were temt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were slain with the sword: they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins,
being destitute, afflicted, tormented: they
wandred in deserts, and in mountains, and
in dens, and caves of the earth,</hi> Heb. 11.
36. 37. 38. And if we look on the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians, we shall see them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
the counrerpart to them, their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
consisted not in any immunities
from calamities; for their whole lives were
scenes of sufferings. St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us an
account of his own, <hi>in labors more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
in stripes above mesure, in prisons more
frequent, in deaths oft: of the Iews five
times received I fourty stripes save one.
Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106844:89"/>
stoned, thrice I suffer'd shipwrack, a night
and a day have I bin in the deep, in journy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 11. 23. and if his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
hardships rose thus high, what may
we think the whole sum of all his fellow-laborers
amounted to together, with that
noble Army of martyrs who sealed their
faith with their blood; of whose suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<hi>Ecclesiastic</hi> history gives us such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing
relations?</p>
               <p>11. AND now <hi>being compassed about
with so great a cloud of witnesses,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
inference is very irrefragable, <hi>let us
run with patience the race which is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us,</hi> Heb. 12. 1, 2. But yet it is more
so, if we proceed on to that consideration
he adjoins, <hi>Looking unto Iesus the Author
and finisher of our faith, who for the joy
that was set before him, endur'd the cross,
despising the shame,</hi> verse 3. Indeed if we
contemplate him in the whole course of
his life, we shall find him rightly stiled
by the Prophet <hi>a man of sorrows,</hi> Isai. 51.
And as if he had charged himself with
all our griefs as well as our sins, there is
scarce any human calamity which we may
not find exemplified in him. Do's any
complain of the lowness and poverty of
his condition? Alas his whole life was a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:106844:90"/>
state of indigence: he was forc'd to be an
inmate with the beasts, be laid in a stable
at his birth, and after himself professes
that he <hi>had not where to lay his head,</hi> Luk.
9. 58. Is any opprest with infamy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch?
he may see his Savior accus'd as
a <hi>glutton and a wine-bibber,</hi> Luke 7. 34.
<hi>a Blasphemer,</hi> Joh. 10. 33. <hi>a sorcerer,</hi> Mat.
12. 24. <hi>a perverter of the nation,</hi> Luk. 23.
2. yea to such a sordid lowness had they
sunk his repute, that a seditious thief and
murderer was thought the more eligible
person, <hi>not this man but Barabbas,</hi> Joh.
18. 40. And finally all this scene of indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
clos'd with the spightful pageantry
of <hi>mockery</hi> acted by the soldiers, Mat. 27.
28. and the yet more barbarous insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Priests and Scribes, verse 41. Is any
man despised or deserted by his friends? he
was contemned by his country-men,
thought frantic by his friends, betraied by
one of his disciples, abandon'd by all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
that one who followed him longest,
to renounce him the most shamefully by
a threefold abjuration. Nay what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
more then all this, he seem'd desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God also, as is witnessed by that
doleful exclamation, <hi>My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Mar. 27. 64. Is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106844:90"/>
dissatisfied with the hard-ships or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boriousness
of his life? let him remember
his Saviors was not a life of delicacy or
ease, he was never enter'd in those Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies
of luxury, where men are <hi>gorgeously
apparel'd and live delicately,</hi> Luk. 7. 25.
but he was brought under the mean roof
of a Carpenter, and consequently subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to all the lowness of such an educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
His initiation to his Prophetic of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was with the miraculous severity of
a 40. daies fast, and in his discharge of
it, we find him in perpetual labors, <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about doing good,</hi> Act. 10. 38. and that
not in triumph (like a prince bestowing
his largesses) but in weary peregrinations,
never riding but once, and that only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a borrow'd beast, <hi>and to fulfil a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi>
Mat. 24. Do's any man groan
under sharp and acute pains? let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what his redeemer endur'd, how in
his infancy at his circumcision he offer'd
the first fruits, as an earnest of that bloody
vintage when <hi>he trod the wine-press alone</hi>
Isai. 63. 3. Let him attend him through
all the stages of his direful passion, and
behold his arms pinion'd with rough cords,
his head smote with a reed, and torn with
his crown of thorns, his back ploughed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106844:91"/>
with those <hi>long furrows</hi> (Psal. 120. 3.)
the scourges had made, his macerated
feeble body opprest with the weight of
his cross, and at last rackt and extended
on it; his hands and feet, those nervous
and consequently most sensible parts trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt
with nailes, his whole body fastned to
that accursed tree, and exposed naked to
the air in a cold season; his throat par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with thirst and yet more afflicted
with that vinegar and gall wherewith
they pretended to relieve him; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his life expiring amidst the full sense
of these accurate torments. Lastly do's
any man labor under the bitterest of all
sorrows, importunate temtations to, or
a wounded spirit for sin? even here also he
may find that he has an <hi>high Priest who
hath bin touched with the sense of his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi>
Heb. 4. 15. He was violently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
with a succession of temtations,
Mat. 4. and we cannot doubt but Satan
would on him imploy the utmost of his
skill. Nor was he less opprest with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of sin, (ours I mean tho not his own.)
What may we think were his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in the Garden, when he so earnestly
deprecated that which was his whole er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
into the world? What a dreadful
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106844:91"/>
pressure was that which wrung from him
that bloody sweat? and cast him into that
inexplicable agony, the horror whereof
was beyond the comprehensions of any,
but his who felt it? and finally how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
was the sense of divine wrath,
which extorted that stupendious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
that <hi>strong cry</hi> on the cross, Heb. 5.
7. the sharp accent whereof, if it do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
sound in our hearts, must certainly
quite overwhelm our loudest groans? And
now certainly I may say with Pilate, <hi>Ecce
homo</hi> behold the man, or rather with a
more divine Author, Behold <hi>if ever there
were sorrows like unto his sorrows,</hi> Lam. 1. 12.</p>
               <p>12. AND sure it were but a reasonable
inference, that which we find made by
Christ himself, <hi>if these things be don in a
green tree, what shall be don in the dry?</hi> Luk.
23. 31. If an imputative guilt could nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
so scorching a flame, pull down so
severe a wrath, what can we expect who
are merely made up of combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
whose proper personal sins cry for
vengeance? Sure were we to judg by
human mesures, we should reckon to have
more then a double portion of our Saviors
sufferings entail'd upon us: yet such is the
efficacy of his, that they have commuted
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106844:92"/>
for ours, and have left us only such a share,
as may evidence our relation to our cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Lord: such as may serve only for
badges and cognizances to whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
For alas, let the most afflicted of us
weigh our sorrows with his, how absurdly
unequal will the comparison appear? And
therefore as the best expedient to baffle
our mutinies, to shame us out of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinings,
let us often draw this uneven pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel,
confront our petty uneasinesses with
his unspeakable torments; and sure tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but our admiration and gratitude
must supplant our impatiencies.</p>
               <p>13. THIS is indeed the method to
which the Apostle directs us, <hi>Consider him
that endured such contradiction of sinners
against himself, lest ye be weary and faint in
your minds: ye have not yet resisted unto blood,</hi>
Heb. 12. 34. Was he contradicted, and
shall we expect to be humor'd and compli'd
with? Did he resist to blood, and shall
we think those pressures intolerable, which
force only a few tears from us? This is such
an unmanly niceness, as utterly makes us
unfit to follow the Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What a soldier is he like to make,
that will take no share of the hazards and
hardships of His General? Honest <hi>Uriah</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:106844:92"/>
would not take the lawful solaces of his
own house upon the consideration that
his <hi>Lord Ioab</hi> (tho but his fellow subject)
<hi>lay incamped in the open fields,</hi> 2 Sam. 11.
11. yea tho he was sent by him from the
Camp. And shall we basely forsake ours
in pursuit of our ease? He is of a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
spirit, whom the example of his
superior will not animate. <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us
that <hi>Cato</hi> marching thro the desarts, was
so distrest for water, that a small quantity
was brought to him in a helmet as a great
prize, which he refusing because he could
not help his soldiers to the like, they were
so transported with that generosity, that
it extinguisht the sense of their thirst, and
they were ashamed to complain of what
their Leader voluntarily endured for their
sakes. And surely we extremely discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
our institution, if we cannot equal
their ingenuity, and follow ours with as
great alacrity thro all the difficulties he has
traced before us, and for us.</p>
               <p>14. NOR let us think to excuse our
selves upon the impotency of our flesh,
which wants the assistance which his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
gave him: for that plea is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seded
by the fore-mention'd examples of
the Saints, men of like passions with us,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106844:93"/>
who not only patiently, but joifully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd
all tribulations, by which it appears
it is not impossible to our nature, with
those aids of grace which are common to
us with them: for certainly the difference
between them and us, is not so much in
the degrees of the aids, as in the diligence
of imploying them. Let us therefore, as
the Apostle advises, <hi>lift up the hands which
hang down, and the feeble knees,</hi> Heb. 12. 12.
and with a noble emulation follow those
heroic patterns they have set us: and since
we see that even those Favorites of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
have smarted so severely, let us never
dream of an immunity, but whenever we
find our selves inclining to any such flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
hope, let every one of us upbraid
our selves in those terms the Jews did our
Savior, <hi>Art thou greater then Abraham, and
the Prophets, whom makest thou thy self?</hi> Joh.
8. 52. Nay we may descend lower and
take in not only all the inferior Saints of
former times, but all those our contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries
in sufferings, which are most
within our view, and may ask the Apostles
question, <hi>what then are we better then they?</hi>
Rom. 3. 9. If we think we are, tis certain
we are so much worse by that insolence;
and if we confess we are not, upon what
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:106844:93"/>
score can we pretend to be better treated?
To conclude, let us not pore only upon
our peculiar evils, but attentively look
about us, and consider what others endure:
and since in frolics we can sport our selves
with many uneasinesses for company sake,
let us not be more pusillanimous in our
soberer moods, but every man cheerfully
take his turn in bearing the common bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of mortality, till we put off both it and
its appendages together, when this mortal
shall put on immortality, 1 Cor. 15. 54.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of particular Aids for the gaining
of Contentment.</head>
               <p>1. WE have now past thro all those
considerations we at first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and may trust the considering Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to make his own collections: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
impatience is the vice that has bin
all this while arraign'd, I am to fore-see
it possible, that those who have the greatest
degree of that, may be the least willing
to attend the whole process, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I think it may not be amiss, for their
ease to suit and reduce all into some short
directions and rules for the acquiring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
               <p>2. THE first and most fundamental is,
the mortifying our pride, which as it is
the seminary of most sins, so especially
this of repining. Men that are highly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion'd
of themselves are commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfiable:
for how well soever they are
treated, they still think it short of their
merits. Princes have often experimented
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106844:94"/>
this in those who have don them signal
services; but God finds it in those who
have don him none, and we expect he
shall dispence to us according to those
false estimates we put upon our selves.
Therefore he that aspires to Content, must
first take truer mesures of himself, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that as he was nothing till God gave
him a being, so all that he can produce
from that being, is Gods by original right,
and therefore can pretend to nothing of
reward; so that whatever he receives, is still
upon the account of new bounty; and to
complain that he has no more, is like the
murmurs of an unthankful debtor, who
would still increase those scores which he
knows he can never pay.</p>
               <p>3. IN the second place, let every man
consider how many blessings (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his no clame to any) he daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joies:
and whether those he so impatiently
raves after be not much inferior to them.
Nay let him ask his own heart, whether
he would quit all those he has, for them
he wants, and if he would not (as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
no man in his wits would, those wits
being part of the barter) let him then judg
how unreasonable his repinings are, when
himself confesses he has the better part of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106844:95"/>
worldly happiness, and never any man
living had all.</p>
               <p>4. IN the third place therefore let him
secure his duty of thankfulness for those
good things he hath, and that will insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
undermine his impatiencies for the
rest, it being impossible to be at once
thankful and murmuring. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it were very well, if he would keep
a solemn catalogue of all the bounties,
protections, and deliverances he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
from Gods hand, and every night
examin what accessions that day has
brought to the sum: and he that did this,
would undoubtedly find so many incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to gratitude, that all those to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
would be stifled in the croud.
And since acknowledgment of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
is all the tribute he exacts for them,
we must certainly look on that as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable
duty: and therefore he that
finds that God shortens his hand, stops
the efflux of his bounty towards him,
should reflect on himself, whether he be
not behind in that homage by which he
holds, and have not by his unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>turn'd away good things from him,</hi> Esa.
59. 8. And if he find it so (as who alas
is there that may not) he cannot sure for
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106844:95"/>
shame complain, but must in prudence
reinforce his gratitude for what is left, as
the best means to recover what he has
lost.</p>
               <p>5. BUT his murmurs will yet be more
amazingly silenc'd, if in the fourth place
he compares the good things he enjoies
with the ill he has don. Certainly this is a
most infallible cure for our impatiencies,
the holiest man living being able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himself of such sins, as would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to all human mesures of equity
forfeit all blessings, and pull down a greater
weight of judgment then the most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
groan under. Therefore as before
I advised to keep a catalogue of benefits
receive'd, so here it would be of use to draw
up one of sins committed. And doubtless
he that confronts the one with the other
cannot but be astonished to find them
both so numerous, equally wondring at
Gods mercy in continuing his blessings,
in despight of all his provocations, and
at his own baseness in continuing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,
in despight of all those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.
Indeed tis nothing but our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
ignorance of our own demerits, that
makes it possible for us to repine under
the severest of Gods dispensations. Would
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106844:96"/>
we but ransack our hearts, and see all the
abominations that lie there, nay would
the most of us but recollect those bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
crimes which even the world can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against us, we should find more then
enough to balance the heaviest of our pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
When therefore by our impatient
struglings we fret and gall our selves under
our burdens, let us interrogate our souls
in the words of the Prophet, <hi>Why doth
a living man complain, a man for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of his sin?</hi> Let us not spend our
breath in murmurs and out-cries, which
will only serve to provoke more stripes:
but <hi>let us search and try our waies, and
turn again to the Lord,</hi> Lam. 3. 39. dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
seek out <hi>that accursed thing</hi> which
has caused our discomfeiture, Jos, 6. 18. and
by the removal of that, prepare the way
for the access of mercy. But alas how
preposterous a method do we take in our
afflictions? We accuse every thing but
what we ought, furiously fly at all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
causes of our calamity, nay too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
at the first by impious disputes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and in the mean time, as <hi>Iob</hi>
speaks, <hi>the root of the matter is found in us,</hi>
Job. 19. 28. We shelter and protect in
our bosoms the real Author of our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106844:96"/>
The true way then to allay the sense
of our sufferings, is to sharpen that of our
sins. The prodigal thought the meanest
condition in his fathers family a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Make me one of thy hired servants,</hi>
Luk. 15. 19. And if we have his penitence,
we shall have his submission also, and calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attend Gods disposals of us.</p>
               <p>6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. As every man in his affliction is
to look inward on his own heart, so also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and consider by whose providence
all events are order'd. <hi>Is there any evil
(i. e.</hi> of punishment) <hi>in the city, and the
Lord hath not don it?</hi> Am. 3. 6. and what
are we worms that we should dispute with
him? Shall a man contend with his Maker?
Let the <hi>potsherd strive with the potsherds
of the earth,</hi> Isa. 45. 9. And as his power is
not to be control'd, so neither is his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to be impeach'd. <hi>Shall not the judg of
all the earth do right?</hi> Gen. 18. 25. And
where we can neither resist nor appeal,
what have we to do but humbly to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit?
Nor are we only compell'd to it by
necessity, but induced and invited by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
since his dispensations are directed
not barely to assert his dominion, but to
evidence his paternal care over us. He
discerns our needs, and accordingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106844:97"/>
to us. The benignity of his nature
permits him not to take delight in our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,
<hi>he doth not afflict willingly, nor
grieve the children of men,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. and
therefore when ever he administers to us
a bitter cup, we may be sure the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
are medicinal, and such as our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
require. He dares not trust our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
appetites with unmixt prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
the lushiousness whereof tho it
may please our palats, yet like St. Johns
book Rev. 10. 9. that <hi>hony in the mouth
may prove gall in the bowels,</hi> ingender the
most fatal diseases. Let us therefore in
our calamities <hi>not consult with flesh and
blood,</hi> Gal. 1. 16. (which the more it is
bemoan'd, the more it complains) but
look to the hand that strikes; and assure
our selves, that the stripes are not more
severe, then he sees necessary in order to
our good: and since they are so, they
ought in reason to be our choices as well
as his; and not only religion, but self love
will promt us to say, with old <hi>Ely, it is the
Lord, let him do what seemeth him good,</hi>
1 Sam. 3. 11. But alas we do not understand
what is our interest, because we do not
rightly understand what we are ourselves.
We consider our selves merely in our ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106844:97"/>
being, our bodies and those sensitive
faculties vested in them, and when we are
invaded there, we think we are undon,
tho that breach be made only, to relieve
that diviner part within us, besieged and
opprest with the flesh about it (for so God
knows it too often is;) or if we do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it in that notion of an enemy, yet
at the utmost estimate, the body is to the
soul but as the garment to the body, a
decent case or cover: now what man (not
stark frantic) would not rather have his
clothes cut then his flesh? and then by the
rate of proportion, we may well question
our own sobriety, when we repine that
our souls are secur'd at the cost of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and that is certainly the worst, the
unkindest design, that God has upon us;
and our impatient resistances serve only to
frustrate the kind, the medicinal part of
afflictions, but will not at all rescue us
from the severe. Our murmurings may
ruine our souls, but will never avert any
of our outward calamities.</p>
               <p>7. A seventh help to contentment is to
have a right estimate of the world, and the
common state of humanity: to consider
the world but as a stage and our selves but
as actors, and to resolve that it is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106844:98"/>
material what part we play so we do
it well. A Comedian may get as much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
by acting the slave as the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and he that acts the one to day, may to
morrow reverse the part, and personate the
other. So great are the vicissitudes of the
world, that there is no building any firm
hopes upon it. All the certainty we have
of it, is, that in every condition it has its
uneasinesses: so that when we court a
change, we rather seek to vary then end
our miseries. And certainly he that has
well imprest upon his mind the vanity and
vexation of the world, cannot be much
surprised at any thing that befalls him in
it. We expect no more of any thing
but to do its kind, and we may as well be
angry that we cannot bring the lions to
our cribes, or fix the wind to a certain
point, as that we cannot secure our selves
from dangers and disappointments in this
rough and mutable world. We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to lay it as an infallible maxim, that
in this vale of tears every man must meet
with sorrows and disasters: and then sure
we may take our peculiar with evenness
of temper, as being but the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of our being men. And tho pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
we may every one think himself to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:106844:98"/>
have double portion, yet that is usually
from the deceitful comparisons we make
of our selves with others. We take the
magnifying glasses of discontent and envy
when we view our own miseries and others
felicities, but look on our enjoiments
and their sufferings thro the contracting
optics of ingratitude and incompassion:
and whilst we do thus, tis impossible but
we must foment our own dissatisfactions.
He that will compare to good purpose
must do it honestly and sincerely, and
view his neighbors calamities with the
same attention he do's his own, and his
own comforts with the same he do's his
neighbors; and then many of the great
seeming inequalities would come pretty
neer a level.</p>
               <p>8. BUT even where they do not, it in
the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place deserves however to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
how ill natur'd a thing it is, for
any man to think himself more miserable
because another is happy: and yet this is
the very thing, by which alone many men
have made themselves wretched: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have created wants, merely from the
envious contemplation of other mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.
And indeed there is nothing
more disingenuous, or (to go higher) more
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:106844:99"/>
Diabolical. <hi>Lucifer</hi> was happy enough
in his original state, yet could not think
himself so because he was <hi>not like the most
high</hi> Isa. 14. 14. And when by that inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ambition he had forfeited bliss, it has
ever since bin an aggravation of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that mankind is assumed to a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of it; and accordingly he makes it
the design of his envious industry to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
him. Now how perfectly are the two
first parts of this copy transcrib'd, by those
who first cannot be satisfied with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
degree of prosperity, and then whet
their impatiencies with other mens enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of what they cannot attain? And tis
much to be doubted, that they who go thus
far may compleat the parallel, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
when they have opportunity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
that happiness they envy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since Satan is so apt to impress his
whole image, where he has drawn any of
his lineaments, it concerns us warily to
guard our selves, and by a Christian sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
with our brethren, <hi>rejoice with them
that do rejoice,</hi> Rom. 12. 15. make the
comforts of others, an allay not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of our own miseries. Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
has a strange magnetic power, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
the concerns of our brethren to us,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:106844:99"/>
and he that has that in his breast can never
want refreshment, whilst any about him
are happy, for by adopting their interest,
he shares in their joies. <hi>Iethro</hi> tho an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien
<hi>rejoiced for all the good God had don to
Israel,</hi> Exod. 18. 9. and why should not
we have as sensible a concurrence with
our fellow Christians? And he that has so,
will still find somthing to balance his own
sufferings.</p>
               <p>9. Let him that aspires to content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
set bounds to his desire. Tis our
common fault in this affaire, we usually
begin at the wrong end, we <hi>enlarge our
desires as hell, and cannot be satisfied,</hi> Hab.
2. 5. and then think God uses us ill, if he
do not fill our insatiable appetites: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if we would confine our expectations to
those things which we need, or he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
there are few of us who would not
find them abundantly answer'd. Alas how
few things are there which our nature (if
not stimulated by fancy and luxury) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires?
And how rare is it to find them
who want those? Nay who have not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
additionals for delight and pleasure? And
yet Gods promise under the Gospel extends
only to those necessaries, for where <hi>Christ</hi>
assures his disciples that <hi>these things shall
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:106844:100"/>
be added unto them</hi> Mat. 6. 33. the context
apparently restrains <hi>these things</hi> to meat
and drink and clothing. Therefore take
<hi>no thought for the life what you shall eat,
or what you shall drink, nor yet for the body
what you shall put on,</hi> verse 25. now what
pretence have we to clame more then our
Charter gives us? God never articled with
the ambitious to give him honors, with
the covetous to fill his bags, or with the
voluptuous to feed his luxuries. Let us
therefore, if we expect to be satisfied,
modestly confine our desires within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
he has set us: and then every acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which he superadds will appear (what
it is) a largess and bounty. But whilst our
appetites are boundless, and rather stretcht
then filled with our acquest's, what possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
is there of their satisfaction? And
when we importune God for it, we do
but assign him such a task the Poets made
a representation of their Hell, the filling
a sieve with water, or the rolling a stone
up a precipice.</p>
               <p>10<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. A great expedient for content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is to confine our thoughts to the
present, and not to let them loose to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
events. Would we but do this, we
might shake off a great part of our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:106844:100"/>
for we often heap fantastic loads
upon our selves by anxious presages of
things which perhaps will never happen,
and yet sink more under them, then under
the real weight that is actually upon us.
And this is certainly one of the greatest
follies imaginable: for either the evil will
come or it will not, if it will, tis sure no
such desirable guest that we should go out
to meet it, we shall feel it time enough
when it falls on us, we need not project
to anticipate our sense of it: but if it will
not, what extreme madness is it for a man
to torment himself with that which will
never be, to create engines of tortures,
and by such aerial afflictions, make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as miserable as the most real ones could
do? And truly this is all that we usually get
by our fore-sights. Prevision is one of Gods
attributes, and he mocks at all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to it, by a frequent defeating of
all our fore-casts. He do's it often in our
hopes: some little crosse circumstance ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times demolishes those goodly machins
we raise to our selves: and he do's it no
less in our fears, those ills we solemnly
expected often baulk us, and others from
an unexpected coast suddenly invade us.
And since we are so blind, so short-sighted,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106844:101"/>
let us never take upon us to be scouts, to
discover danger at a distance (for tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
odds we shall only bring home false a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms)
but let us rest our selves upon that
most admirable Aphorism of our blessed
Lord, <hi>Sufficient unto the day is the evil there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi>
Mat. 6. 34. apply our selves with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
courage to bear the present, and
leave God either to augment or diminish,
as he sees fit for the future. Or if we will
needs be looking forward, let it be in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
not contradiction to our duty:
let us entertain our selves with those fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turities
which we are sure are not Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's,
death and judgment, heaven and hell.
The nearer we draw these things to our
view, the more insensible will all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medial
objects be; they will deceive our
sense of present, and much more fore-stal
the apprehension of future evils: for tis
our neglect of things eternal, that leaves us
thus at leisure for the transitory</p>
               <p>11. IN the last place let us in all our
distresses supersede our anxieties and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitudes
by that most effectual remedy
the Apostle prescribes, <hi>Is any man afflicted
let him pray,</hi> Jam. 5. 14. And this sure
is a most rational prescription: for alas
what else can we do towards the redress
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106844:101"/>
of our griefs. We who are so impotent, that
we have not power over the most despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
excrescence of our own body, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make <hi>one hair white or black,</hi> Mat. 5. 36.
what can we do towards the new mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our condition, or modelling things
without us? Our sollicitudes serve only
to bind our burdens faster upon us, but
this expedient of Praier will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
us. <hi>Call upon me,</hi> saies God, <hi>in the
time of trouble, and I will hear thee, and
thou shalt praise me,</hi> Psal. 50. 15. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
therefore we are sinking in the
floods of affliction, let us thus support our
selves by representing our wants unto our
gracious Lord, cry unto him as St. <hi>Peter</hi>
did, Mat. 14. 30. and he will <hi>take us by
the hand, and be the winds</hi> never so <hi>boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
or contrary,</hi> preserve from sinking: the
waves or billows of this troublesom world,
will serve but to toss us closer into his
arms, who can with a word appease the
roughest tempest, or rescue from it. O
let us not then be so unkind to our selves,
as to neglect this infallible means of our
deliverance! but with the Psalmist take
our refuge under the <hi>shadow of the divine
wings till the calamity be over-past</hi> Psa.
57. 1. And as this is a sure expedient in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:106844:102"/>
all our real important afflictions, so is it
a good test by which to try what are so.
We are often peevish and disquieted at
trifles, nay we take up the quarrels of our
lusts and vices, and are discontented when
they want their wisht supplies. Now in
either of these cases, no man that at all
considers who he praies to, will dare to
insert these in his praiers, it being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temt
of God to invoke him in things so
slight as the one, or impious as the other.
It will therefore be good for every man
when he goes to address for relief, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what of his pressures they are, that
are worthy of that solemn deprecation:
and when he has singled those out, let
him reflect, and he will find he has in
that prejudg'd all his other discontents
as frivolous or wicked. And then sure
he cannot think fit to harbour them,
but must for shame dismiss them, since
they are such, as he dares not avow to
him, from whom alone he can expect
relief. God alwaies pities our real mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
but our imaginary ones dare
not demand it. Let us not then create
such diseases to our selves, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
declare to our Physitian: and when
those are precluded, for all the rest St.

               <head type="sub">Of Resignation.</head>
               <p>1. AND now amidst such variety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
twill be hard to instance any
one sort of calamity which can escape their
efficacy, if they be but duly appli'd. But
indeed we have generally a compendious
way of frustrating all remedies by never
making use of them: like fantastic pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
we are well enough content to have
our disease discourst, and medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd,
but when the Physic comes, have
still some pretence or other to protract
the taking it. But I shall beseech the
Reader to consider, that counsels are not
charms, to work without any cooperation
of the concern'd person: they must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to, they must be ponder'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
and finally they must be practic'd,
or else the utmost good they can do us,
is to give us a few hours divertisment in
the reading: but they do us a mischief
that infinitly out-weighs it, for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106844:103"/>
our guilts by the ineffective tender
they make of rescuing us from them, and
leave us accountable not only for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
crimes, but for our obstinate adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to them in spight of admonition.</p>
               <p>2. I say this because it is a little too
notorious, that many take up books only
as they do cards or dice, as an instrument
of diversion. Tis a good entertainment
of their curiosity to see what can be said
upon any subject, and be it well or ill
handled, they can please themselves e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with the ingenuity or ridiculous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the composure, and when they
have don this, they have don all they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd.
This indeed may be tolerable in
Romances and Play-books, but sure it ill
befits Divinity. And yet I fear it oftnest
happens there: for in the former some do
project for some trivial improvements, as
the embellishing of their stile, the inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
of their fancies; and some men
would scarce be able to drive their pedling
trade of wit, did they not thus sweep the
stage: but alas how many books of piety
are read, of which one cannot discern the
least tincture in mens conversations,
which sure do's in a great mesure proceed
from the want of a determinate design in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106844:104"/>
their reading, mens practice being not
apt to be less rovers then their specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He that takes a practical subject
in hand, must do it with a design to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
his practice to what he shall there
be convinc'd to be his duty, and he that
comes not with this probity of mind,
is not like to be much benefited by his
reading.</p>
               <p>3. BUT one would think this should
be an unnecessary caution at this time,
for since the intent of this tract, is only
to shew men the way to contentment, tis
to be suppos'd the Readers will be as much
in earnest as the writer can be, it being
every mans proper and most important
interest, the instating him in the highest
and most supreme felicity that this world
can admit: yet for all this fair probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I doubt many will in this instance
have the same indifference they have in
their other spiritual concerns.</p>
               <p>4. TIS true indeed that a querulous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining
humor, is one of the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious,
the most ugly habits incident to
mankind, but yet as deformed people are
oft the most in love with themselves, so
this crooked piece of our temper, is of all
others the most indulgent to it self. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106844:104"/>
is the most stubborn and untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
of all humors; and discontent being
the offspring of that, partakes of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility:
and accordingly we see how
impregnable it often is, against all assaults
of reason and religion too. <hi>Ionah</hi> in a
sullen mood would justify his discontent
even to God himself, and in spight of that
calm reproof, <hi>dost thou well to be angry?</hi>
Jon. 4. 9. aver <hi>he did well to be angry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the death.</hi> And do we not frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see men upon an impatience of some
disappointment, grow angry even at their
comforts? Their friends, their children,
their meat, their drink, every thing grows
nauseous to them, and in a frantic discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
they often fling away those things
which they most value. Besides this peevish
impatience is of so aerial a diet, that tis
scarce possible to starve it. Twill nurish it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with Phantasms and Chimeras, suborn
a thousand surmises &amp; imaginary distresses
to abet its pretences: and tho every one of
us can remonstrate to another, the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness
of this discontent; yet scarce
any of us will draw the argument home, or
suffer our selves to be convinc'd by what
we urge as irrefragable to others. Nay
farther this humor is impatient of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106844:105"/>
loves to converse only with it self.
In bodily pains, men that despair of cure
are yet glad of allaies and mitigations,
and strive by all arts, to divert and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the sense of their anguish; but in
this disease of the mind, men cherish and
improve their torment, roll and chew the
bitter pill in their mouths, that they may
be sure to have its utmost flavor; and by
devoting all their thoughts to the subject
of their grief, keep up an uninterrupted
sense of it: as if they had the same Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
for themselves which <hi>Caligula</hi> had
for others, and loved to feel themselves
die. Indeed there is not a more absurd
contradiction in the world, then to hear
men cry out of the weight, the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of their burden, and yet grasp it
as fast as if their life were bound up in it;
will not deposite it, no not for the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
breathing time. A strange fascinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sure, and yet so frequent, that it
ought to be the fundamental care of him
that would cure men of their discontents,
to bring them to a hearty willingness of
being cured.</p>
               <p>5. IT may be this will look like pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox,
and every man will be apt to say he
wishes nothing more in earnest, then to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:106844:105"/>
be cured of his present discontent. He that
is poor would be cured by wealth, he that
is low and obscure by honor and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
but so an Hydropic person may say
he desires to have his thirst cur'd by a
perpetual supply of drink: yet all sober
people know, that that is the way only
to increase it: but let the whole habit
of the body be rectified, and then the
thirst will cease of it self. And certainly
tis the very same in the present case, no
outward accessions will ever satisfy our
cravings, our appetites must be tam'd
and reduc'd, and then they will never be
able to raise tumults, or put us into mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
and discontent: and he (and none
but he) that submits to this method, can
truly be said to desire a cure.</p>
               <p>6. BUT he that thus attests the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his desires, and seeks contentment
in its proper sphere, may surely arrive to
some considerable degrees of it. We find
in all ages men, that only by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of natural light have calmed their
disquiets, and reason'd themselves into
contentment even under great and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pressures; men who amidst the acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
torments, have still preserv'd a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity
of mind, and have frustrated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temts
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:106844:106"/>
and reproches by disregarding them:
and sure we give a very ill account of our
Christianity, if we cannot do as much with
it as they did without it.</p>
               <p>7. I do not here propose such a Stoical
insensibility as makes no distinction of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
which, tho it has bin vainly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to by many, yet sure was never attain'd
by any upon the strength of discourse.
Some natural dulnesse or casual stupefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
must concur to that, and perhaps
by doing so, has had the luck to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniz'd
for vertue. I mean only such a
superiority of mind as raises us above our
sufferings, tho it exemt us not from the
sense of them. We cannot propose to
our selves a higher patern in any vertue
then our blessed Lord: yet we see he not
only felt that load under which he lay,
but had the most pungent and quick
sense of it, such as promted those earnest
deprecations, <hi>father if it be possible let
this cup pass:</hi> yet all those displacencies
of his flesh were surmounted by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
of his spirit, <hi>nevertheless not what
I will, but what thou wilt,</hi> Luk. 22. And
certainly he that in imitation of this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,
do's in spight of all the reluctancies
of his sense, thus entirely submit his will,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106844:106"/>
however he may be sad, yet he is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient;
nor is he like to be sad long, for
to him that is thus resign'd, <hi>light will
spring up,</hi> Psal. 97. 11. some good Angel
will be sent like that to our Savior to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
his disconsolation. God will send
either some outward allaies, or give such
interior comforts and supports, as shall
counterpoise those afflictions he takes not
off.</p>
               <p>8. INDEED the grand design of God
in correcting us is (the same with that
of a prudent parent towards his child) to
break our wills. That stubborn faculty will
scarce bend with easy touches, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do's require some force: and when
by that rougher handling, he has brought
it to a pliantness, the work is don. Tis
therefore our interest to cooperate with
this design, to assist as much as we are able
towards the subjugating this unruly part
of our selves. This is that <hi>Sheba</hi> 2 Sam. 20.
the surrendring of whom is Gods expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in all the close sieges he laies to us.
Let us then be so wise, as by an early re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
it to divert his farther hostilities,
and buy our peace with him.</p>
               <p>9. AND truly this is the way not only
to gain peace with him, but our selves
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106844:107"/>
too: tis the usurpation of our will over
our reason which breeds all the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and tumults within our own breasts,
and there is no possibility of curbing its
insolence, but by putting it into safe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody,
committing it to him who (as our
Church teaches us) alone can order the
unruly wills of sinful men. Indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but experience can fully inform us
of the serenity and calm of that soul, who
has resign'd his will to God. All care of
chusing for himself is happily supersed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he is temted to no anxious forecasts for
future events, for he knows nothing can
happen in contradiction of that supreme
will, in which he hath sanctuary: which
will certainly chuse for him with that
tenderness and regard, that a faithful-Guardian
would for his pupil, an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
father for his child that casts its self
into his arms. Certainly there is not in
the world such a holy sort of artifice, so
Divine a charm to tie our God to us, as this
of resigning our selves to him. We find the
Gibeonites by yielding themselves vassals
to the Israelites, had their whole army at
their beck to rescue them in their danger
Jos. 10. 6. and can we think God is less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
of his homagers and dependents?
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:106844:107"/>
No certainly, his honor as well as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
is concern'd in the relief of those
who have surrendred themselves to him.</p>
               <p>10. FARTHER yet, when by resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
we have united our wills to God,
we have quite changed the scene, and
we who when our wills stood single were
liable to perpetual defeats, in this blessed
combination can never be crost. When
our will is twisted and involved with
Gods, the same omnipotenee which backs
his will, do's also attend ours. Gods will, we
are sure, admits of no controle, can never
be resisted, and we have the same securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for ours, so long as it concurs with it.
By this means all calamities are unsting'd,
and even those things which are most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to our sensitive natures, are yet
very agreable to our spirits, when we
consider they are implicitly our own
choice, since they are certainly his, whom
we have deputed to elect for us. Indeed
there can be no face of adversity so aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and formidable, which set in this
light will not look amiable. We see daily
how many uneasinessess and prejudices
men will contentedly suffer in pursuit of
their wills: and if we have really espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Gods, made his will ours, we shall
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:106844:108"/>
with as great (nay far greater) alacrity
embrace its distributions, how uneasy
soever to our sense; our souls will more
acquiesce in the accomplishment of the
Divine will, then our flesh can reluct to
any severe effects of it.</p>
               <p>11. HERE then is that footing
of firm ground, on which whosoever
can stand, may indeed do that which
<hi>Archimedes</hi> boasted, move the whole
world. He may as to himself subvert the
whole course of sublunary things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venem
all those calamities which are to
others the gall of Asps; and in a farther
sense verify that Evangelical prophecy,
of <hi>beating swords into plough-shares, and
spears into pruning hooks,</hi> Esay. 2. 4. the
most hostile weapons, the most adverse
events, shall be by him converted into
instruments of fertility, shall only advance
his spiritual growth.</p>
               <p>12. AND now who can chuse but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
this a much more eligible state, then
to be alwaies harrassed with solicitudes
and cares, perpetually either fearing fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
defeats, or bewailing the past. And
then what can we call it less then mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or enchantment, for men to act so
contrary to their own dictates, yea to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:106844:108"/>
their very sense and experience, too see
and acknowledge the inexplicable felicity
of a resigned will, and yet perversely to
hold out theirs, tho they can get nothing
by it, but the sullen pleasure of opposing
God, and tormenting themselves? Let
us therefore if not for our duty or ease,
yet at least for our reputation, the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
our selves men of sobriety and
common sense, do that which upon all
these interests we are obliged; let us but
give up our wills, and with them we shall
certainly divest our selves of all our fruitless
anxieties, and cast our burdens upon him
who invites us to do so. He who bears
all our sins, will bear all our sorrows,
our griefs too: if we will but be content
to deposite them, he will relieve us from
all those oppressing weights, which make
<hi>our souls cleave to the dust,</hi> Psal. 119. 25.
and will in exchange give us only his <hi>light,
his pleasant burden,</hi> Mat. 11. 33. In a
word there will be no care left for us, but
that of keeping our selves in a capacity
of his: let us but secure our love to him,
and we are ascertain'd that <hi>all things shall
work together for our good,</hi> Rom. 8. 28.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Resignation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
are vertues not only of a near
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106844:109"/>
cognation and resemblance, but they are
linked as the Cause and the Effect. Let
us but make sure of Resignation, and
Content will flow into us without our
farther industry: as on the contrary whilst
our wills are at defiance with Gods, we
shall alwaies find things at as great defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with ours. All our subtiletes or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustries
will never mould them to our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions,
till we have moulded our selves
into that pliant temper that we can cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially
say, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what
seemeth him good.</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 18.</p>

               <head>The Close.</head>
               <p>1. THIS short institution of the <hi>Art
of Contentment,</hi> cannot more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
or more desirably draw to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
then in the resort we have given
it, in the bosome of divine <hi>Providence.</hi>
The Roman conquerors as the last pitch
of all their triumphs, went to the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol,
and laid their Garlands in the lap of
<hi>Iupiter:</hi> but the Christian has an easier
way to Triumph, to put his crown of
thornes (for that is the trophy of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories)
within the arms of his gracious
God; there lodg his fears, his wants,
his sorrows, and himself too, as in the
best repository.</p>
               <p>2. THE Gospel command of <hi>not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for the morrow,</hi> Mat. 6. 34, and being
<hi>careful for nothing,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. nakedly
propos'd, might seem the abandoning of
us to all the calamities of life: but when
we are directed to <hi>cast all our care</hi> upon
a gracious and all-powerful Parent, and
are assur'd that <hi>he cares for us,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7.
that <hi>tho a woman may forget her sucking
child, that she should not have compassion
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:106844:110"/>
of the son of her womb, yet will he not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi>
his children, Isa. 49. 15. this will
abundantly supersede all cavil and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Whilst worldly men trust in an
arm of flesh, lay up <hi>tresure on earth,</hi> a prey
for <hi>rust and moth,</hi> Mat. 6. 19. and <hi>a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to themselves, Jam. 5. 3. the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
has Omnipotence for his support,
and a <hi>tresure in heaven, where no thief
approches, nor moth corrupts,</hi> Mat. 6. 20.
Whil'st bold inquirers call in question
Gods secret will, oblige him to their sub
or supralapsarian schemes, their absolute
or conditional decrees, their grace fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
or predetermin'd; the pious man with
aweful acquiescence submits to that which
is revel'd: resolves for ever to obey, but
never to dispute; as knowing that the
belov'd Disciple lean'd on his Masters bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
but tis the thiefs and traitors part
to go about to rifle it.</p>
               <p>3. TIS surely a modest demand in the
behalf of God Almighty, that we should
allow him as much privilege in his World,
as every Pesant clames in his Cottage; to
be Master there, and dispose of his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
as he thinks best: to <hi>say to this man,
Go, and he goeth: and to another, Come,
and he cometh: and to his servant, Do this,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106844:110"/>
and he doth it,</hi> Mat. 8. 9. And if we would
afford him this liberty, there would be
an immediate end put to all clamor and
complaint.</p>
               <p>4. WE make it our daily praier that
the <hi>will</hi> of God <hi>may be don in earth as it
is in heaven,</hi> with a ready, swift, and
uninterrupted constancy. As tis Giant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
rebellion to set up our will against
his, so is it mad perverseness to set it up
against our own; be displeas'd that our
requests are granted, and repine that his,
and therewith our will is don. It were
indeed not only good manners, but good
policy, to observe the direction of the
Heathen, and <hi>follow God:</hi> not prejudg
his determinations by ours; but in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
suspension of our thoughts, <hi>hearken
what the Lord God will say concerning us,
for he will speak peace unto his people, and
to his Saints that they turn not again,</hi>
Psa. 85. 8.</p>
               <p>5. OR however upon surprise we may
indulge to a passionate affection, and dote
upon our illegitimate off-spring, our dearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guilts or follies, as <hi>David</hi> did upon
that Child, who was the price of Murder
and adultery: yet when the brat is taken
from us, when the <hi>Child is dead,</hi> it will
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106844:111"/>
become us to do as he did, rise from our
sullen posture on the earth, and <hi>worship
in the house of the Lord,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 20.
It will behove us, as he saies in another
place, to <hi>lay our hand upon our mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was his doing,</hi> Psal. 30. 10. and
with holy <hi>Iob</hi> Chap. 40. 4. when charg'd
with his murmurings, <hi>Behold I am vile,
what shall I answer? Once have I spoken,
but I will not answer: yea twice, but I will
proceed no farther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>Socrates</hi> rightly said of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
opposing it to the riches of fortune
and opinion, that tis the wealth of nature;
for it gives every thing that we have
learnt to want, and really need: but
Resignation is the riches of Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
all things that a Christian not
only needs, but can desire, even Almighty
God himself. He indeed, as the Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
teach, is the objective happiness of
the Creature; He who is the fountain of
being, must be also of blessedness: and
tho this be only communicable to us,
when we have put off that <hi>flesh which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter into the kingdom of God,</hi> and laid
aside that <hi>corruption</hi> which cannot <hi>inherit
incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. yet even in this
life, we may make approches to that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:106844:111"/>
state, by acts of Resignation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
of our selves. It was the generous
saying of <hi>Socrates</hi> being about to die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his friend; O <hi>Crito,</hi> since it is the will
of God, so let it be: <hi>Anytus</hi> and <hi>Melitus</hi>
may kill me, but cannot hurt me. But
such a resignation as tis infinitly a greater
duty to a Christian, so it is also a more
firm security. In that case tis not the
<hi>Martyr,</hi> but <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> who is
thus persecuted, and he who attaques him
will find <hi>it hard to kick against the pricks,</hi>
Act. 9. 5.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>THERE could not be a greater
instance of the profligate sensuality of the</hi>
Israelites, <hi>then that they murmured for
want of</hi> leeks and onions, <hi>Num. 11. 5.
when they ate Angels food, and had
bread rain'd down from heaven. Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for the soul that is sensible of
God Almighties favor, to repine at any
earthly pressure.</hi> The Lord is my shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
<hi>saith</hi> David, therefore can I lack
nothing, <hi>Psa. 23. 1. And,</hi> thou hast put
gladness into my heart, more then when their
corn, and wine, aud oil encreased, <hi>Psa. 4. 7.
and in passionate rapture he cries out,
Psa.</hi> 73. 25. Whom have I in heaven but
thee: and there is none upon earth that I

desire in comparison of thee? my flesh and
my heart faileth: but God is the strength
of my heart, and my portion for ever. <hi>And
likewise Psal.</hi> 46. 1. God is our hope and
strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will we not fear, tho the earth be
moved: and tho the hills be carried into the
midst of the sea. Tho the waters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
rage and swell, and tho the mountains
shake at the tempest of the same. <hi>If</hi> God <hi>be</hi>
in the midst of us, we shall not be removed,
he will help us, and that right early. <hi>Let
us therefore possess our selves of this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and as the Prophet advises Isa.</hi> 8. 12.
neither fear, nor be afraid, <hi>in any exigence
how great soever; but</hi> be still and quiet,
and sanctify the Lord of hosts himself, and
let him be our fear, and let him be our
dread.</p>
