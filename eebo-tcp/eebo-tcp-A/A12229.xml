            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HEre now haue you (most deare, and most worthy to be most deare Lady) this idle worke of mine: which I fear (like the Spiders webbe) will be thought fitter to be swept away, then worn to any other purpose. For my part, in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trueth (as the cruell fathers among the Greekes, were woont to doo to the babes they would not foster) I could well find in my harte, to cast out in some desert of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes this child, which I am loath to<pb facs="tcp:11334:3"/> father. But you desired me to doo it, and your desire, to my hart is an absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Now, it is done onelie for you, onely to you: if you keepe it to your selfe, or to such friendes, who will weigh errors in the ballaunce of good will, I hope, for the fathers sake, it will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, perchance made much of, though in it selfe it haue deformities. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, for seuerer eyes it is not, being but a trifle, and that triflinglie handled. Your deare selfe can best witnes the maner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done in loose sheetes of paper, most of it in your presence, the rest, by sheetes, sent vnto you, as fast as they were done. In summe, a young head, not so well stayed as I would it were, (and shall be when God will) hauing many many fancies begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it, if it had not ben in some way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, would haue growen a monster, &amp; more sorie might I be that they came in,<pb facs="tcp:11334:3"/> then that they gat out. But his chiefe safetie, shalbe the not walking abroad; &amp; his chiefe protection, the bearing the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of your name; which (if much much goodwill do not deceaue me) is worthy to be a sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuary for a greater offender. This say I, because I knowe the vertue so; and this say I, because it may be euer so; or to say better, because it will be euer so. Read it then at your idle tymes, and the follyes your good iudgement wil finde in it, blame not, but laugh at. And so, looking for no better stuffe, then, as in an Haberdashers shoppe, glasses, or feathers, you will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to loue the writer, who doth exceding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie loue you; and most most hartelie praies you may long liue, to be a principall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the familie of the <hi>Sidneis.</hi>

I pray you when wee were amid our flocke, and that of other shepeheardes some were running after their sheep strayed beyond their bounds, some delighting their eyes with seeing them nibble vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the short and sweete grasse, some medicining their sicke ewes, some setting a bell for an enfigne of a sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish squadron, some with more leasure inuenting new games of exercising their bodies &amp; sporting their wits: did Remembrance graunt vs any holiday, eyther for pastime or deuotion, nay either for necessary foode or naturall rest? but that still it forced our thoughts to worke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place, where we last (alas that the word last should so long last) did gaze our eyes vpon her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer florishing beautie: did it not still crie within vs? Ah you base minded wretches, are your thoughts so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bemired in the trade of ordinary worldlings, as for respect of gaine some paultry wooll may yeeld you, to let so much time passe without knowing perfectly her estate, especially in so troublesome a season? to leaue that shore vnsaluted, from whence you may see to the Island where she dwelleth? to leaue those steps vnkis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed wherein <hi>Vrania</hi> printed the farewell of all beautie? Wel then, Remembraunce commaunded, we obeyed, and here we finde, that as our remembrance came euer<pb n="2" facs="tcp:11334:6"/> cloathed vnto vs in the forme of this place, so this place giues newe heate to the feauer of our languishing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. Yonder my <hi>Claius, Vrania</hi> lighted, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie horse (me thought) bewayled to be so disburdned: and as for thee, poore <hi>Claius,</hi> when thou wentst to help her downe, I saw reuerence and desire so deuide thee, that thou didst at one instant both blushe and quake, and in stead of bearing her, weart ready to fall downe thy selfe. There shee sate, vouchsafing my cloake (then most gorgeous) vnder her: at yonder rising of the ground she turned her selfe, looking backe toward her woonted abode, and because of her parting bearing much sorrow in hir eyes, the lightsomnes whereof had yet so naturall a cherefulnesse, as it made euen sorrow seeme to smile; at that turning she spake vnto vs all, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cherrie of hir lips, &amp; Lord how greedily mine eares did feed vpon the sweete words she vttered? And here she laide her hand ouer thine eyes, when shee saw the teares springing in them, as if she would conceale them from other, and yet her selfe feele some of thy sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: But woe is me, yonder, yonder, did she put her foote into the boate, at that instant as it were deuiding her heauenly beautie, betweene the Earth and the Sea. But when she was imbarked, did you not marke how the windes whistled, &amp; the seas daunst for ioy, how the failes did swel with pride, and all because they had <hi>Vra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia?</hi> O <hi>Vrania,</hi> blessed be thou <hi>Vrania,</hi> the sweetest fairenesse and fairest sweetnesse: with that worde his voice brake so with sobbing, that he could say no further; and <hi>Claius</hi> thus answered. Alas my <hi>Strephon</hi> (said he) what needes this skore to recken vp onely our losses? What doubt is there, but that the light of this place doth call<pb facs="tcp:11334:7"/> our thoughtes to appeare at the court of affection, held by that racking steward, Remembrance? Aswell may sheepe forget to feare when they spie woolues, as wee can misse such fancies, when wee see any place made happie by her treading. Who can choose that saw her but thinke where she stayed, where she walkt, where she turned, where she spoke? But what is all this? truely no more, but as this place serued vs to thinke of those thinges, so those thinges serue as places to call to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie more excellent matters. No, no, let vs thinke with consideration, and consider with acknowledging, and acknowledge with admiration, and admire with loue, and loue with joy in the midst of all woes: let vs in such sorte thinke, I say, that our poore eyes were so inriched as to behold, and our low hearts so exalted as to loue, a maide, who is such, that as the greatest thing the world can shewe, is her beautie, so the least thing that may be praysed in her, is her beautie. Certainely as her eye-lids are more pleasant to behold, then two white kiddes climing vp a faire tree, and browsing on his tendrest brauches, and yet are nothing, compared to the day-shining starres contayned in them; and as her breath is more sweete then a gentle South-west wind, which comes creeping ouer flowrie fieldes and shaddowed waters in the extreeme heate of summer, and yet is nothing, compared to the hony flowing speach that breath doth carrie: no more all that our eyes can see of her (though when they haue seene her, what else they shall euer see is but drie stuble after clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers grasse) is to bee matched with the flocke of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable vertues laid vp delightfully in that best builded folde. But in deede as wee can better consider the<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11334:7"/> sunnes beautie, by marking how he guildes these wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and mountaines them by looking vpon his owne face, too glorious for our weake eyes: so it may be our conceits (not able to beare her sun-stayning excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) will better way it by her workes vpon some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner subiect employed. And alas, who can better wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that then we, whose experience is grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on feeling? hath not the onely loue of her made vs (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing silly ignorant shepheards) raise vp our thoughts aboue the ordinary leuell of the worlde, so as great clearkes do not disdaine our conference? hath not the desire to seeme worthie in her eyes made vs when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were sleeping, to sit vewing the course of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens? when others were running at base, to runne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer learned writings? when other marke their sheepe, we to marke our selues? hath not shee throwne reason vpon our desires, and, as it were giuen eyes vnto <hi>Cupid?</hi> hath in any, but in her, loue-fellowship maintained friendship betweene riuals, and beautie taught the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders chastitie? He was going on with his praises, but <hi>Strephon</hi> bad him stay, &amp; looke: &amp; so they both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued a thing which floted drawing nearer and nearer to the banke; but rather by the fauourable working of the Sea, then by any selfe industrie. They doubted a while what it should be; till it was cast vp euen hard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: at which time they fully saw that it was a man: Wherupon running for pitie sake vnto him, they found his hands (as it should appeare, constanter frends to his life then his memorie) fast griping vpon the edge of a square small coffer, which lay all vnder his breast: els in him selfe no shew of life, so as the boord seemed to bee but a beere to carry him a land to his Sepulchre. So<pb facs="tcp:11334:8"/> drew they vp a young man of so goodly shape, and well pleasing fauour, that one would think death had in him a louely countenance; and, that though he were naked, nakednes was to him an apparrell. That sight increased their compassion, and their compassion called vp their care; so that lifting his feete aboue his head, making a great deale of salt water to come out of his mouth, they layd him vpon some of their garments, and fell to rub and chase him, till they brought him to recouer both breath the seruant, &amp; warmth the companion of liuing. At length, opening his eyes, he gaue a great groane, (a dolefull note but a pleasaunt dittie) for by that, they found not onely life, but strength of life in him. They therefore continued on their charitable office, vntil (his spirits being well returned,) hee (without so much as thanking them for their paines) gate vp, and looking round about to the vttermost lymittes of his sight, and crying vpon the name of <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> nor seeing nor hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cause of comfort: what (said he) and shall <hi>Musidorus</hi> liue after <hi>Pyrocles?</hi>

I pray you (said he) honest men, what such right haue you in me, as not to suffer me to doe with my self what I list? and what pollicie haue you to bestow a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite where it is counted an iniury? They hearing him speake in Greek (which was their naturall language) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the more tender hearted towards him; and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11334:8"/> by his calling and looking, that the losse ofsome deare friend was great cause of his sorow; told him they were poore men that were bound by course of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to preuent so great a mischiefe; and that they wisht him, if opinion of some bodies perishing bred such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate anguish in him, that he should be comforted by his owne proofe, who had lately escaped as apparant danger as any might be. No, no (said hee) it is not for me to attend so high a blissefulnesse: but since you take care of mee, I pray you finde meanes that some Barke may be prouided, that will goe out of the hauen, that if it be possible we may finde the body farre farre too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a foode for fishes: and for the hire (said he) I haue within this casket, of value sufficient to content them. <hi>Claius</hi> presently went to a Fisherman, &amp; hauing agreed with him, and prouided some apparrell for the naked stranger, he imbarked, and the Shepheards with him: and were no sooner gone beyond the mouth of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but that some way into the sea they might discerne (as it were) a stayne of the waters colour, and by times some sparkes and smoke mounting thereout. But the young man no sooner saw it, but that beating his brest, he cried, that there was the beginning of his ruine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them to bend their course as neere vnto it as they could: telling, how that smoake was but a small relique of a great fire, which had driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both him &amp; his friend rather to committee themselues to the cold mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the sea, then to abide the hote crueltie of the fire: and that therefore, though they both had abandoned the ship, that he was (if any where) in that course to be met withall. They steared therefore as neere thether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as they could: but when they came so neere as<pb facs="tcp:11334:9"/> their eies were ful masters of the object, they saw a sight full of piteous strangenes: a ship, or rather the carkas of the shippe, or rather some few bones of the carkas, hul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling there, part broken, part burned, part drowned: death hauing vsed more then one dart to that destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. About it floted great store of very rich thinges, and many chestes which might promise no lesse. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst the precious things were a number of dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which likewise did not onely testifie both eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts violence, but that the chiefe violence was growen of humane inhumanitie: for their bodies were ful of grisly wounds, &amp; their bloud had (as it were) filled the wrine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of the seas visage: which it seemed the sea woulde not wash away, that it might witnes it is not alwaies his fault, when we condemne his crueltie: in summe, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate, where the conquered kept both field and spoile: a shipwrack without storme or ill footing: and a wast of fire in the midst of water.</p>

His haire (which the young men of Greece vsed to weare very long) was stirred vp &amp; down with the wind, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue a sport to play with it, as the sea had to kisse his feet; himselfe full of admirable beautie, set foorth by the strangenes both of his seate &amp; gesture: for, holding<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11334:9"/> his head vp full of vnmoued maiestie, he held a sworde alost with his faire arme, which often he waued about his crowne as though he would threaten the world in that extremitie. But the fishermen, when they came so neere him, that it was time to throwe out a rope, by which hold they might draw him, their simplicity bred such amasement, &amp; their amasement such a superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that (assuredly thinking it was some God begotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Neptune</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> that had made all this terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble slaughter) as they went vnder sayle by him, held vp their hands, and made their prayers.

Therefore praying for him, and casting a long look that way he saw the Galley leaue the pursuite of them, &amp; turne to take vp the spoiles of the other wrack: and lastly he might well see them list vp the yong man; and alas (said he to himselfe) deere <hi>Pyrocles</hi> shall that bodie of thine be enchayned? shall those victorious handes of thine be commaunded to base offices? shall vertue become a slaue to those that be slaues to vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes? Alas, better had it bene thou hadst ended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thy noble daies: what death is so euill as vnworthy seruitude? But that opinion soone ceased when he saw the gallie setting vpon an other ship, which held long and strong fight with her: for then he began a fresh to feare the life of his friende, and to wish well to the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates whome before he hated, least in their ruyne hee might perish. But the fishermen made such speed into the hauen, that they absented his eyes from beholding the issue: where being entred, he could procure nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them nor any other as then to put themselues into the sea: so that beyng as full of sorrow for being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to doe anything, as voide of counsell how to doe anything, besides, that sicknesse grew something vpon him, the honest shepheards <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Claius</hi> (who being themselues true friends, did the more perfectly iudge the iustnesse of his sorrowe) aduise him, that he should mitigate somwhat of his woe, since he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an amendment in fortune, being come from assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11334:10"/> persuasion of his death, to haue no cause to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of his life: as one that had lamented the death of his sheepe, should after know they were but strayed, would receiue pleasure though readily hee knew not where to finde them.</p>

               <p>In the middest of all the place, was a faire ponde,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>1</label> whose shaking christall was a perfect mirrour to all the other beauties, so that it bare shewe of two gardens; one in deede, the other in shaddowes: and in one of the thickets was a fine fountaine made thus.

At her brest she had her babe <hi>AEneas,</hi> who seemed (hauing begun to sucke) to leaue that, to looke vpon her sayre eyes, which smiled at the babes follie, the meane while the breast running. Hard by was a house of pleasure builte for a Sommer retiring place, whether <hi>Kalander</hi> leading him, he found a square roome full of delightfull pictures, made by the most excellent workeman of Greece. There was <hi>Diana</hi> when <hi>Actaeon</hi> sawe her bathing, in whose cheekes the painter had set such a colour, as was mixt betweene shame &amp; disdaine: &amp; one of her foolish Nymphes, who weeping, and withal lowring, one might see the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man meant to set forth teares of anger. In another table was <hi>Atalanta;</hi> the posture of whose lims was so liuelie expressed, that if the eyes were the only iudges, as they be the onely seers, one would haue sworne the very pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture had runne. Besides many mo, as of <hi>Helena, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phale, Iole:</hi> but in none of them all beautie seemed to speake so much as in a large table, which contained a comely old man, with a lady of midle age, but of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beautie; &amp; more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t would haue bene deemed, but that there stood betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a yong maid, whose<pb facs="tcp:11334:15"/> wonderfulnesse tooke away all beautie from her, but that, which it might seeme shee gaue her backe againe by her very shadow. And such differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce being knowne that it did in deed counterfeit a person liuing, was there betweene her and al the other, though Goddesses, that it seemd the skill of the painter bestowed on the other new beautie, but that the beautie of her bestowed new skill of the painter. Though he thought inquisitiuenes an vncomely guest, he could not choose but aske who she was, that bearing shew of one being in deed, could with natural gifts go beyond the reach of inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> answered, that it was made by <hi>Philoclea,</hi> the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger daughter of his prince, who also with his wife were conteined in that Table: the painter meaning to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the present condition of the young Ladie, who stood watched by an ouer-curious eye of her parents: &amp; that he would also haue drawne her eldest sister, este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her match for beautie, in her shepheardish attire; but that the rude clown her gardia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would not suffer it: nether durst he aske leaue of the Prince for feare of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Palladius</hi> perceaued that the matter was wrapt vp in some secrefie, and therefore would for modestie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund no further: but yet his countenance could not but with dumme Eloquence desire it: Which <hi>Kalander</hi> perceauing, well said he, my deere guest, I know your minde, and I will satisfie it: neyther will I doo it like a niggardly answerer, going no further then the boundes of the question, but I will discouer vnto you, aswell that wherein my knowledge is common with others, as that which by extraordinarie means is deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me:knowing so much in you, though not long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, that I shall find your eares faithfull treasurers.<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11334:15"/> So then sitting downe in two chaires, and sometimes casting his eye to the picture, he thus spake.</p>

               <p>Here dwelleth, and raigneth this Prince (whose pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture <label type="milestone">

But to be plaine with you, he excels in nothing so much, as in the zealous loue of his people, wherein he doth not only passe al his owne fore-goers, but as I thinke al the princes liuing. Wherof the cause is, that though he exceed not in the vertues which get admiration; as depth of wisdome, height of<pb facs="tcp:11334:16"/> courage and largenesse of magnificence, yet is hee notable in those whiche stirre affection, as trueth of worde, meekenesse, courtefie, mercifulnesse, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> Of these two are brought to the worlde two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, so beyonde measure excellent in all the gifts allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to reasonable creatures, that wee may thinke they were borne to shewe, that Nature is no stepmother to that sex, how much so euer some men (sharpe witted onely in euill speaking) haue sought to disgrace them. The elder is named <hi>Pamela;</hi> by many men not dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med inferiour to her sister: for my part, when I marked them both, me thought there was (if at least such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections may receyue the worde of more) more sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in <hi>Philoclea,</hi> but more maiestie in <hi>Pamela:</hi> mee thought loue plaide in <hi>Philocleas</hi> eyes, and threatned in <hi>Pamelas:</hi> me thought <hi>Philocleas</hi> beautie onely perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but so perswaded as all harts must yeelde: <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> beautie vsed violence, and such violence as no hart could resist: and it seemes that such proportion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their mindes; <hi>Philoclea</hi> so bashfull as though her excellences had stolne into her before shee was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware: so humble, that she will put all pride out of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: in summe, such proceeding as will stirre hope,<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11334:16"/> but teach hope good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners. <hi>Pamela</hi> of high thoughts, who auoides not pride with not knowing her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, but by making that one of her excellencies to be voide of pride; her mothers wisdome, greatnesse, nobilitie, but (if I can ghesse aright) knit with a more constant temper. Now then, our <hi>Basilius</hi> being so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly happie as to be a Prince, and so happie in that happinesse as to be a beloued Prince, and so in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate blessed as to haue so excellent a wife, and so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent children, hath of late taken a course which yet makes him more spoken of then all these blessings. For, hauing made a iourney to Delphos, and safely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, within short space hee brake vp his court, and retired himselfe, his wife, and children into a certaine Forrest hereby, which hee calleth his desert, where in (besides a house appointed for stables and lodgings for certaine persons of meane calling, who do all house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold seruices,) hee hath builded two fine lodges. In the one of them him selfe remaines with his younger daughter <hi>Philoclea,</hi> which was the cause they three were matched together in this picture, without hauing any other creature liuing in that lodge with him.</p>
               <p>Which though it bee straunge, yet not so straunge,<label type="milestone">

This loutish clowne is such, that<pb facs="tcp:11334:17"/> you neuer saw so ill fauourd a visar; his behaviour such, that he is beyond the degree of ridiculous; and for his apparrel, euen as I would wish him: <hi>Miso</hi> his wife, so handsome a beldame, that onely her face and her splay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soote haue made her accused for a witch; onely one good point she hath, that she obserues <hi>decoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> hauing a froward mind in a wretched body. Betweene these two personages (who neuer agreed in any humor, butin dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing) is issued forth mistresse <hi>Mopsa,</hi> a fitte woman to participate of both their perfections: but because a pleasant fellow of my acquaintance set forth her praises in verse, I will only repeate them, and spare mine owne tongue, since she goes for a woman. These verses are these, which I haue so often caused to be song, that I haue them without booke.</p>

               <p>Now truely hauing made these descriptions vnto you, me thinkes you should imagine that I rather faine some pleasant deuise, then recount a truth, that a Prince (not banished from his own wits) could possibly make so vnworthie a choise. But truely (deare guest) so it is, that Princes (whose doings haue beene often soothed with good successe) thinke nothing so absurde, which they cannot make honourable. The beginning of his credite was by the Princes straying out of the way, one time he hunted, where meeting this fellow, and asking him the way; &amp; so falling into other questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he found some of his aunswers (as a dog sure if he could speake, had wit enough to describe his kennell) not vnsensible, &amp; all vttered with such rudenes, which he enterpreted plainnesse (though there be great difference betweene them) that <hi>Basilius</hi> conceauing a sodaine delight, tooke him to his Court, with apparant shew of his good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: where the flattering courtier had no sooner take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Princes minde, but that there were straight reasons to confirme the Princes doing, &amp; shadowes of vertues found for <hi>Dametas.</hi> His silence grew wit, his bluntnesse integritie, his beastly ignorance vertuous simplicitie: &amp; the Prince (according to the nature of great persons, in loue with that he had done himselfe) fancied, that his weaknesse with his presence would much be mended. And so like a creature of his owne making, he liked him more and more, and thus hauing first giuen him the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of principall heardman, lastly, since he tooke this strange determination, he hath in a manner put the life of himselfe and his children into his hands. Which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie (like too great a sayle for so small a boate) doth so ouer-sway poore <hi>Dametas,</hi> that if before he were a<pb facs="tcp:11334:18"/> good foole in a chamber, he might be allowed it now in a comedie: So as I doubt me (I feare mee in deede) my master will in the end (with his cost) finde, that his office is not to make men, but to vse men as men are; no more then a horse will be taught to hunt, or an asse to mannage. But in sooth I am afraide I haue geuen your eares too great a sursette, with the grosse discourses of that heauie peece of flesh.

My selfe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture, &amp; in deed more then coniecture, by this accident that I will tell you: I haue an onely sonne, by name <hi>Clitophon,</hi> who is now absent, preparing for his owne mariage, which I meane shortly shalbe here celebrated. This sonne of mine (while the Prince kept his Court) was of his bed-chamber; now since the breaking vp thereof, returned home, and shewed me (among other things he had gathered) the<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11334:18"/> coppy which he had taken of a letter: which when the prince had read, he had laid in a window, presuming no body durst looke in his writings: but my sonne not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tooke a time to read it, but to copie it.

Now here is the letter, that I euer since for my good liking, haue caried about me: which before I read vnto you, I must tell you from whom it came. It is a noble-man of this countrie, named <hi>Philanax,</hi> appointed by the Prince, Regent in this time of his retiring, and most worthie so to be: for, there liues no man, whose excellent witte more simplie imbraseth integritie, besides his vnfained loue to his master, wherein neuer yet any could make question, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, whether he loued <hi>Basilius</hi> or the Prince better: a rare temper, while most men either seruile-ly yeeld to al appetites, or with an obstinate austeritie looking to that they fansie good, in effect neglect the Princes person. This then being the man, whom of all other (and most worthie) the Prince cheefly loues, it should seeme (for more then the letter I haue not to ghesse by) that the Prince vpon his returne from Delphos, (<hi>Philanax</hi> then lying sick) had written vnto him his determination, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (as euidently appeares) vpon some Oracle he had there receaued: whereunto he wrote this answere.

But since it is weakenes too much to remember what should haue beene done, and that your commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t stretcheth to know what is to be done, I do (most deare Lord) with humble boldnes say, that the maner of your determination dooth in no sort better please me, then the cause of your going. These thirtie yeares you haue so gouerned this Region, that neither your Subiectes haue wanted iustice in you, nor you obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in them; &amp; your neighbors haue found you so hurtlesly strong, that they thought it better to rest in your friendshippe, then make newe triall of your enmitie. If this then haue proceeded out of the good constitution of your state, and out of a wise prouidence, generally to preuent<pb n="15" facs="tcp:11334:19"/> all those things, which might enco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber your happines: why should you now seeke newe courses, since your owne ensample comforts you to continue, and that it is to me most certaine (though it please you not to tell me the very words of the Oracle) that yet no destinie, nor influence whatsoeuer, can bring mans witte to a higher point then wisdome and goodnes? Why should you depriue your selfe of gouernment, for feare of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your gouernment? like one that should kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for feare of death? nay rather, if this Oracle be to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted of, arme vp your courage the more against it: for who wil stick to him that abandones himselfe? Let your subiects haue you in their eyes; let them see the benefites of your iustice dayly more and more; and so must they needes rather like of present sureties, then vncertaine changes. Lastly, whether your time call you to liue or die, doo both like a prince. Now for your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond resolution; which is, to suffer no worthie prince to be a suiter to either of your daughters, but while you liue to keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both vnmaried; &amp; as it were, to kill the ioy of posteritie, which in your time you may enioy: moued perchance by a mis-understoode Oracle. What shall I say? if the affection of a father to his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, cannot plead sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly against such fancies: once certaine it is, the God, which is God of nature, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer teach vnnaturalnes: and euen the same minde hold I touching your banishing them from companie, least, I know not what strange loues should follow. Certainly Sir, in my ladies, your daughters, nature promiseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but goodnes, and their education by your father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care, hath beene hetherto such, as hath beene most fit to restraine all euill: geuing their mindes vertuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,<pb facs="tcp:11334:20"/> and not grecuing them for want of wel-ruled li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Now to fall to a sodain straightning them, what can it doo but argue suspition, a thing no more vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, then vnsure, for the preseruing of vertue? Leaue womens minds, the most vntamed that way of any: see whetherany cage can please a bird? or whether a dogge growe not fierce with tying? what dooth ielousie, but stirre vp the mind to thinke, what it is from which they are restrayned? for they are treasures, or things of great delight, which men vse to hide, for the aptnesse they haue to catch mens fancies: and the thoughtes once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked to that, harder sure it is to keepe those thoughts from accomplishment, then it had been before to haue kept the minde (which being the chiefe part, by this meanes is defiled) from thinking. Lastly, for the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending so principall a charge of the Princesse <hi>Pamela,</hi> (whose minde goes beyond the gouerning of many thousands such) to such a person as <hi>Dametas</hi> is (besides that the thing in it self is strange) it comes of a very euil ground, that ignorance should be the mother of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes. O no, he cannot be good, that knowes not why he is good, but stands so farre good, as his fortune may keepe him vnassaied: but comming once to that, his rude simplicitie is either easily changed, or easily decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: &amp; so growes that to be the last excuse of his fault, which seemed to haue been the first foundation of his faith. Thus farre hath your commaundement and my zeale drawn me; which I, like a man in a valley that may discern hilles, or like a poore passenger that may spie a rock, so humbly submit to your gracious consideration, beseeching you againe, to stand wholy vpon your own vertue, as the surest way to maintaine you in that you are, and to auoyd any euill which may be imagined.</p>

               <p>By the contents of this letter you may perceiue, that the cause of all, hath beene the vanitie which possesseth many, who (making a perpetuall mansion of this poore baiting place of mans life) are desirous to know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of things to come; wherein there is nothing so certaine, as our continual vncertaintie. But what in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points the oracle was, in faith I know not: nether (as you may see by one place of <hi>Philanax</hi> letter) he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe distinctly knew. But this experience shewes vs, that <hi>Basilius</hi> iudgement, corrupted with a Princes fortune, hath rather heard then followed the wise (as I take it) counsell of <hi>Philanax.</hi> For, hauing lost the sterne of his gouernment, with much amazement to the people, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom many strange bruits are receiued for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and with some apparance of daunger in respect of the valiant <hi>Amphalus</hi> his nephew, &amp; much enuy in the ambitious number of the Nobilitie against <hi>Philanax,</hi> to see <hi>Philanax</hi> so aduanced, though (to speake simply) he deserue more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as many of vs as there be in Arcadia: the prince himself hath hidden his head, in such sort as I told you, not sticking plainly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sesse, that he means not (while he breathes) that his daughters shal haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus solitary with him: wher he <label type="milestone">

               <p>And now you know as much as my self: wherin if I <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>4</label> haue held you ouer long, lay hardly the fault vpon my old eage, which in the very disposition of it is talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iue: whether it be (said he smiling) that nature loues to<pb facs="tcp:11334:21"/> exercise that part most, which is least decayed, and that is our tongue: or, that knowledge being the only thing whereof we poore old men can brag, we cannot make it knowen but by vtterance: or, that mankinde by all meanes seeking to eternize himselfe so much the more, as he is neere his end, dooth it not only by the children that come of him, but by speeches and writings recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the memorie of hearers and readers. And yet thus much I wil say for my selfe, that I haue not laid these matters, either so openly, or largely to any as your selfe: so much (if I much sayle not) doo I see in you, which makes me both loue and trust you. Neuer may he be old, answered <hi>Palladius,</hi> that dooth not reuerence that age, whose heauines, if it waie downe the frayl and fleshly ballance, it as much lifts vp the noble and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall part: and well might you haue alledged another reason, that their wisdome makes them willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site others. And that haue I receiued of you, neuer to be forgotten, but with vngratefulnes. But among many strange conceits you tolde me, which haue shewed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in your Prince, truly euen the last, that he should conceiue such pleasure in shepheards discourses, would not seeme the least vnto me, sauing that you told me at the first, that this countrie is notable in those wits, and that in deed my selfe hauing beene brought not onely to this place, but to my life, by <hi>Strephon</hi> and <hi>Claius,</hi> in their conference found wits as might better become such shepheards as <hi>Homer</hi> speakes of, that be gouernors of peoples, then such senatours who hold their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in a shepecoate: for them two (said <hi>Kalander</hi>) espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Claius,</hi> they are beyond the rest by so much, as learning commonlie doth adde to nature: for, hauing<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11334:21"/> neglected their wealth in respect of their knowledge, they haue not so much empayred the meaner, as they bettered the better. Which all notwithstanding, it is a sporte to heare howe they impute to loue, whiche hath indewed their thoughts (saie they) with suche a strength.</p>
               <p>But certainely, all the people of this countrie from <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> high to lowe, is giuen to those sportes of the witte, so as you would wonder to heare how soone euen chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will beginne to versifie. Once, ordinary it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the meanest sorte, to make Songes and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues in meeter, either loue whetting their braine, or long peace hauing begun it, example and emulation amending it. Not so much, but the clowne <hi>Dametas</hi> will stumble sometimes vpon some Songs that might become a better brayne: but no sorte of people so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in that kinde as the pastors; for their liuing stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but vpon the looking to their beastes, they haue ease, the Nurse of Poetrie. Neither are our shepheards such, as (I heare) they be in other countries; but they are the verie owners of the sheepe, to which eyther themselues looke, or their children giue daylie atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce. And then truely, it would delight you vnder some tree, or by some riuers side (when two or three of them meet together) to heare their rurrall muse, how pretely it will deliuer out, sometimes ioyes, sometimes lamentations, sometimes chalengings one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, sometimes vnder hidden formes vttering such matters, as otherwise they durst not deale with. Then they haue most commonly one, who iudgeth the price to the best doer, of which they are no lesse gladde, then great Princes are of triumphes: and his parte is to sette<pb facs="tcp:11334:22"/> downe in writing all that is saide, saue that it may be, his pen with more leasure doth polish the rudenesse of an vnthought-on songe. Now the choise of all (as you may well thinke) either for goodnesse of voice, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnesse of wit, the Prince hath: among whom also there are two or three straungers, whom inwarde me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholies hauing made weery of the worldes eyes, haue come to spende their liues among the countrie people of <hi>Arcadia;</hi> &amp; their conuersation being well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, the prince vouchsaseth them his presence, and not onely by looking on, but by great courtesie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie, animates the Shepheardes the more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely to labour for his good liking. So that there is no cause to blame the Prince for somtimes hearing them; the blame-worthinesse is, that to heare them, he rather goes to solitarinesse, then makes them come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. Neyther doo I accuse my maister for aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a countriman, as <hi>Dametas</hi> is, since God forbid, but where worthinesse is (as truely it is among diuers of that fellowship) any outward lownesse should hinder the hiest raysing, but that he would needes make ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of one, the basenesse of whose minde is such, that it sinckes a thousand degrees lower, then the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest bodie could carrie the most base fortune: Which although it might bee aunswered for the Prince, that it is rather a trust hee hath in his simple plainnesse, then any great aduauncement, beyng but chiefe heardman: yet all honest hartes feele, that the trust of their Lord goes beyond all aduauncement. But I am euer too long vppon him, when hee crosseth the waie of my speache, and by the shaddowe of yonder Tower, I see it is a fitter time, with our supper to pay the duties we<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11334:22"/> owe to our stomacks, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to break the aire with my idle discourses: And more witte I might haue learned of <hi>Homer</hi> (whome euen now you mentioned) who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer entertayned eyther guestes or hostes with long speaches, till the mouth of hunger be throughly stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. So withall he rose, leading <hi>Palladius</hi> through the gardeine againe to the parler, where they vsed to suppe; <hi>Palladius</hi> assuring him, that he had alreadie bene more fed to his liking, then hee could bee by the skilfullest trencher-men of <hi>Media.</hi>

               <p>BVt beeing come to the supping place, one of <hi>Kalanders</hi> seruaunts <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>1</label> rounded in his eare; at which (his collour chaungyng) hee retired him selfe into his chamber; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding his men diligentlie to waite and attend vpon <hi>Palladius,</hi> and to excuse his absence with some necessarie busines he had presentlie to dispatch.<pb facs="tcp:11334:23"/> Which they accordinglie did, for some fewe dayes forcing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to let no change appeare: but though they framed their countenaunces neuer so cunningly, <hi>Palladius</hi> perceaued there was some il-pleasing accident fallen out. Whereupon, being againe set alone at sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he called to the Steward, and desired him to tell him the matter of his suddaine alteration: who after some trifling excuses, in the ende confessed vnto him, that his maister had receiued newes, that his sonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the daie of his neere marriage, chaunst to be at a battaile, which was to be fought betweene the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menne of Lacedaemon and the <hi>Helots:</hi> who winning the victorie, hee was there made prisoner, going to deliuer a friend of his taken prysoner by the <hi>Helots;</hi> that the poore young Gentleman had offered great raunsome for his life: but that the hate those paysaunts conceaued agaynst all Gentlemen was suche, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie houre hee was to looke for nothing, but some cruell death: which hether-vnto had onely beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed by the Captaines vehement dealing for him, who seemed to haue a hart of more manlie pittie then the rest. Which losse had stricken the old Gentleman with such sorrowe, as if aboundance of teares did not seeme suffciently to witnesse it, he was alone retyred, tearing his bearde and hayre, and cursing his old age, that had not made his graue to stoppe his eares from such aduertisements: but that his faithfull seruaunts had written in his name to all his friends, followers, and tenants (<hi>Philanax</hi> the gouernour refusing to deale in it, as a priuate cause, but yet giuing leaue to seeke their best redresse, so as they wronged not the state of Lacedaemon) of whom there were now gathered<pb n="19" facs="tcp:11334:23"/> vpon the frontiers good forces, that he was sure would spende their liues by any way, to redeeme or reuenge <hi>Clitophon.</hi> Now sir (said he) this is my maisters nature, though his grief be such, as to liue is a griefe vnto him, &amp; that euen his reason is darkened with sorrow; yet the lawes of hospitality (long and holily obserued by him) giue still such a sway to his proceeding, that he will no waie suffer the straunger lodged vnder his roofe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue (as it were) any infection of his anguish, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally you, toward whom I know not whether his loue, or admiration bee greater. But <hi>Palladius</hi> could scarce heare out his tale with patience: so was his hart torne in peeces with compassion of the case, liking of <hi>Kalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> noble behauiour, kindnesse for his respect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, and desire to finde some remedie, besides the image of his deerest friend <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> whom he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to suffer eythera like or a worse fortune: therefore rising from the boorde, he desired the steward to tell him particularly, the ground, and euent of this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, because by knowledge of many circumstaunces, there might perhaps some waie of helpe be opened.

My maisters sonne <hi>Clitophon</hi> (whose losse giues the cause to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and yet giues me cause to beginne with <hi>Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> since his losse proceedes from <hi>Argalus</hi>) beyng a young Gentleman, as of great birth (being our kings<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11334:24"/> sisters sonne) so truely of good nature, and one that can see good and loue it, haunted more the companie of this worthie <hi>Argalus,</hi> then of any other: so as if there were not? friendship (which is so rare, as it is to bee doubted whether it bee a thing in deede, or but a worde) at least there was such a liking and friendlines, as hath brought foorth the effects which you shall heare. About two yeares since, it so fell out, that hee brought him to a great Ladies house, sister to my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who had with her, her onely daughter, the faire <hi>Parthenia;</hi> faire in deede (same I thinke it selfe daring not to call any fayrer, if it be not <hi>Helena</hi> queene of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> and the two incomparable sisters of Arcadia) and that which made her fairenesse much the fayrer, was, that it was but a faire embassadour of a most faire minde, full of wit, and a wit which delighted more to judge it selfe, then to showe it selfe: her speach being is rare as pretious; her silence without sullennesse; her modestie without affectation; her shamefastnes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ignorance: in summe, one, that to praise well, one must first set downe with himselfe, what it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent: for so she is.</p>

There was victory &amp; courage against reuenge and despaire: safety of both sides being no otherwise to be gotten, but by destruction.</p>
               <p>At length, the left winge of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> began to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>7</label> loose ground; which <hi>Palladius</hi> seeing, he streight thrust himselfe with his choise bande against the throng that oppressed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with such an ouerflowing of valour, that the Captaine of the <hi>Helots</hi> (whose eies soone iudged of that wherwith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues were gouerned) saw that he alone was worth al the rest of the <hi>Arcadians.</hi> Which he so wondred at, that it was hard to say, whether he more liked his doings, or misliked the effects of his doings: but determining that vpon that cast the game lay, and disdaining to fight with any other, fought onely to ioine with him: which minde was no lesse in <hi>Palladius,</hi> hauing easily marked, that he was as the first mouer of al the other handes. And so their thoughts meeting in one point, they consented (though not agreed) to trie each others fortune: &amp; so drawing themselues to be the vttermost of the oneside, they began a combat, which was so much inferior to the battaile in noise and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as it was surpassing it in brauery of fighting, &amp; (as it<pb facs="tcp:11334:32"/> were) delightful terriblenes.

There I found my sworde among some of the shrowds, wishing (I must confesse) if I died, to be found with that in my hand, and withall wauing it about my head, that saylers by it might haue the better glimpse of me.

For being witnes to itselfe of his owne inward good, it findes nothing without it of so high a price, for which it should be altered. Euen the very countenaunce and behauiour of such a man doth shew forth Images of the same constancy, by maintaining a right harmonie betwixt it and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good, in yeelding it selfe sutable to the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous resolution of the minde. This speech I direct to you (noble friend <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) the excellencie of whose minde and well chosen course in vertue, if I doo not sufficiently know, hauing seene such rare demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, it is my weakenes, and not your vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines. But as in deede I know it, and knowing it, most dearely loue both it, and him that hath it; so must I needs saye, that since our late comming into this country, I haue marked in you, I will not say an alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but a relenting truely, &amp; a slacking of the maine career, you had so notably begon, &amp; almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed<pb facs="tcp:11334:41"/> and that in such sorte, as I cannot finde suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reason in my great loue toward you how to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; for (to leaue of other secreter arguments which my acquaintaunce with you makes me easily finde) this in effect to any manne may be manyfest, that whereas you were wont in all places you came, to giue your selfe vehemently to the knowledge of those thinges which might better your minde; to seeke the familiaritye of excellent men in learning and souldiery: and lastly, to put all these thinges in practise both by continuall wise proceedinge, and worthie enterprises, as occasion fell for them; you now leaue all these things vndone: you let your minde fal a sleepe: beside your countenaunce troubled (which surely comes not of vertue; for vertue like the cleare heauen, is without cloudes) and lastly you subiect your selfe to solitarines, the slye enimie, that doth most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate a man from well doing. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> minde was all this while so fixed vpon another deuotion, that he no more attentiuely marked his friends discourse, then the childe that hath leaue to playe, markes the last part of his lesson; or the diligent Pilot in a daungerous tempest doth attend the vnskilful words of a passinger: yet the very sound hauing imprinted the general point of his speech in his hart, pierced with any mislike of so deerely an esteemed friend, and desirous by degrees to bring him to a gentler consideration of him, with a shamefast looke (witnessing he rather could not helpe, then did not know his fault) answered him to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Excellent <hi>Musidorus,</hi> in the praise you gaue me in the beginning of your spech, I easily acknowledge the force of your good will vnto mee, for neither coulde<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11334:41"/> you haue thought so well of me, if extremitie of loue had not made your iudgement partiall, nor you could haue loued me so intierlie, if you had not beene apt to make so great (though vndeserued) iudgements of me; and euen so must I say to those imperfections, to which though I haue euer through weaknes been subiect, yet you by the daily me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of your mind haue of late bin able to looke into them, which before you could not discerne; so that the chaunge you speake of, falles not out by my impairing, but by your betring. And yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leaue of your better iudgement, I must needes say thus much, my deere cosin, that I find not my selfe wholye to be condemned, because I do not with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy folow those knowledges, which you call the bettering of my minde; for both the minde it selfe must (like other thinges) sometimes be vnbent, or else it will be either weakned, or broken: And these knowledges, as they are of good vse, so are they not all the minde may stretch it selfe vnto: who knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I feede not my minde with higher thoughts? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as I know not all the particularities, so yet I see the bounds of all these knowledges: but the workings of the minde I finde much more infinite, then can be led vnto by the eye, or imagined by any, that distract their thoughts without themselues. And in such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, or as I thinke more excellent, I enioye my solitarines; and my solitarines perchaunce is the nurse of these contemplations. Eagles we see fly alone; and they are but sheepe, which alvvaies heard together; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne not therefore my minde somtime to enioy it selfe; nor blame not the taking of such times as serue most fitte for it.

And here <hi>Pyrocles</hi> sodainly stopped, like a man vnsatisfied in himselfe, though his witte might wel haue serued to haue satisfied another. And so looking with a countenaunce, as though he desired he should know his minde without hearing him speake, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to speake, to breath out some part of his inward euill, sending againe new blood to his face, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his speach in this manner. And Lord (dere cosin, said he) doth not the pleasauntnes of this place carry in itselfe sufficient reward for any time lost in it? Do you not see how all things conspire together to make this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try a heauenly dwelling?

And see you not the rest of these beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull flowers, each of which would require a mans wit to know, and his life to expresse? Do not these stately trees seeme to maintaine their florishing olde age with the onely happines of their seat, being clothed with a continuall spring, because no beautie here should euer fade? Doth not the aire breath health, which the Birds (delightfull both to eare and eye) do dayly solemnize with the sweet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of their voyces? Is not euery <hi>eccho</hi> therof a perfect Musicke? and these fresh and delightful brookes how slowly they slide away, as loth to leaue the company of so many things vnited in perfection? and with how sweete a murmure they lament their forced departure? Certainelie, certainely, cosin, it must needes be that some Goddesse enhabiteth this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who is the soule of this soile: for neither is any, lesse then a Goddesse, worthie to be shrined in such a heap of pleasures: nor any lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Goddesse, could<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11334:42"/> haue made it so perfect a plotte of the celestiall dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. And so ended with a deep sigh, rufully casting his eye vpon <hi>Musidorus,</hi> as more desirous of pittie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But <hi>Musidorus</hi> had all this while helde his looke fixed vpon <hi>Pyrocles</hi> countenance; and with no lesse lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing attention marked how his words proceeded from him: but in both these he perceiued such strange diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, that they rather increased new doubts, then gaue him ground to settle any iudgement: for, besides his eyes sometimes euen great with teares, the oft cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging of his colour, with a kind of shaking vnstayednes ouer all his body, he might see in his countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce some great determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mixed with feare; and might perceiue in him store of thoughts, rather stirred then digested; his words interrupted continually with sighes (which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as a burthen to each sentence) and the tenor of his speech (though of his wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted phrase) not knit together to one consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t end, but rather dissolued in it selfe, as the vehemencie of the inwarde passion preuayled: which made <hi>Musidorus</hi> frame his aunswere neerest to that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which should soonest put out the secret. For, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the beginning of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> speech which defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his solitarines, framed in his minde a replie against it, in the praise of honourable action, in shewing that such a kind of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is but a glorious title to idlenes; that in actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man did not onely better himself, but benefit others; that the gods would not haue deliuered a soule into the body, which hath armes &amp; legges, only instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of doing, but that it wer inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the mind should imploy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; that the mind should best know his own good or euill, by practise: which knowledge was the onely way to increase the one, and correct the other: besides many other argumentes, which the plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the matter yeelded to the sharpnes of his wit.<pb facs="tcp:11334:43"/> When he found <hi>Pyrocles</hi> leaue that, and fall into such an affected praising of the place, he left it likewise, and ioyned with him therein: because he found him in that humor vtter more store of passion; and euen thus kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrasing him, he said: Your words are such (noble cousin) so sweetly and strongly handled in the praise of solitarinesse, as they would make me likewise yeeld my selfe vp into it, but that the same words make me know, it is more pleasant to enioy the companie of him that can speake such words, then by such wordes to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to follow solitarines. And euen so doo I giue you leaue (sweet <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) euer to defend solitarines; so long, as to defende it, you euer keep companie. But I maruell at the excessiue praises you giue to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie; in trueth it is not vnpleasant: but yet if you would returne into <hi>Macedon,</hi> you should see either many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, or find this no more then earthly.

                  <hi>Tempe</hi> in my <hi>Thessalia,</hi> (where you &amp; I to my great happinesse were brought vp together) is nothing inferiour vnto it. But I think you will make me see, that the vigor of your witte can shew it selfe in any subiect: or els you feede sometimes your solitarines with the conceites of the Poets, whose liberall pennes can as easilie trauaile ouer mountaines, as molehils: and so like wel disposed men, set vp euery thing to the highest note; especially, when they put such words in the mouths of one of these fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall mind-infected people, that children &amp; Musitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s cal Louers. This word, Louer, did no lesse pearce poore <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> then the right tune of musicke toucheth him that is sick of the <hi>Tarantula.</hi> There was not one part of his body, that did not feele a sodaine motion, while his hart with panting, seemed to daunce to the sounde of<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11334:43"/> that word; yet after some pause (lifting vp his eyes a litle from the ground, and yet not daring to place them in the eyes of <hi>Musidorus</hi>) armed with the verie cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance of the poore prisoner at the barr, whose aunswere is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but guiltie: with much a do he brought forth this question. And alas, saide he, deare cosin, what if I be not so much the Poet (the freedome of whose penne canne exercise it selfe in any thing) as euen that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable subiect of his conning, whereof you speake? Now the eternall Gods forbid (mainely cryed out <hi>Musidorus</hi>) that euer my eare should be poysoned with so euill newes of you.

O, saide he, you vvill neuer liue to my age, vvithout you kepe your selues in breath vvith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, and in hart vvith ioyfullnes: too much thinking doth consume the spirits: &amp; oft it falles out, that vvhile one thinkes too much of his doing, he leaues to doe the effect of his thinking.

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would he tell them stories of such gallaunts as he had knowen: and so with pleasant company beguiled the times hast, and shortned the wayes length, till they came to the side of the wood, where the houndes were in couples staying their comming, but with a whining Accent cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing libertie: many of them in colour and marks so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling, that it showed they were of one kinde. The huntsmen handsomely attired in their greene li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucries, as though they were children of Sommer, with staues in their hands to beat the guiltlesse earth, when the houndes were at a fault, and with hornes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their neckes to sounde an alarum vpon a sillie fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue. The houndes were straight vncoupled, and ere long the Stagge thought it better to trust the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of his feete, then to the slender fortification of his lodging: but euen his feete betrayed him; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they went, they themselues vttered themselues to the sent of their enimies; who one taking it of an<pb n="40" facs="tcp:11334:44"/> other, and sometimes beleeuing the windes aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, sometimes the view of (their faithfull councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors) the huntsmen, with open mouthes then denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced warre, when the warre was alreadie begun. Their crie being composed of so well sorted mouthes, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man would perceiue therein some kind of proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but the skilfull woodmen did finde a musick. Then delight and varietie of opinion drew the horsmen sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie wayes; yet cheering their houndes with voyce and horn, kept still (as it were) together. The wood seemed to conspire with them against his own citizens, disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their noise through all his quarters; and euen the Nimph <hi>Echo</hi> left to bewayle the losse of <hi>Narcissus,</hi> and became a hunter. But the Stagge was in the end so hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued, that (leauing his flight) he was driuen to make courage of despaire; &amp; so turning his head, made the hounds (with change of speech) to testifie that he was at bay: as if from hotte pursuite of their enemie, they were sodainly come to a parley.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Kalander</hi> (by his skill of coasting the Countrey) was among the first that came in to the besiged Deere; whom when some of the younger sort would haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with their swordes, he woulde not suffer: but with a Crossebowe sent a death to the poore beast, who with teares shewed the vnkindnesse he tooke of mans crueltie.</p>

That answer for the time satisfying, and they hauing perfourmed all dueties, as well for the Stagges funeral, as the hounds triumph, they returned: some talking of the fatnes of the Deeres bodie; some of the fairenes of his head; some of the hounds cunning; some of their speed; and some of their cry: til comming home (about the time that the candle begins to inherit the Suns office) they found <hi>Daiphantus</hi> was not to bee found.

O Lord, how did my soule hang at his lippes while he spake!

In summe, he left nothing vnassayed, which might disgrace himselfe, to grace his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d; in sweet termes making me receiue a most resolute refusal of himself. But when he found that his presence did far more perswade for himselfe, then his speeche could doo for his frend, he left my court: hoping, that forgetfulnesse (which commonly waits vpon absence) woulde make roome for his friende: to whome he woulde not vtter thus much (I thinke) for a kinde<pb facs="tcp:11334:51"/> feare not to grieue him, or perchance (though he cares little for me) of a certaine honorable gratefulnes, nor yet to discourse so much of my secrets: but as it should seeme, meant to trauell into farre countreyes, vntill his friends affection either ceased, or preuayled.</p>

I straight found ielousie and disdaine tooke hold of him: and yet the froward paine of mine owne harte made me so delight to punish him, whom I esteemed the chiefest let in my way; that when he with humble gesture, and vehement speeches, sued for my fauor; I told him, that I would heare him more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he would speake for <hi>Amphialus,</hi> as well as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi> had done for him: he neuer answered me, but pale and quaking, went straight away; and straight my heart misgaue me some euill successe: and yet though I had authoritie inough to haue stayed him (as in these fatall things it falles out, that the hie-working powers make second causes vnwittingly accessarie to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations) I did no further but sent a foot-man of mine (whose faithfulnes to me I well knew) from place to place to follow him, and bring me word of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: which (alas) haue brought foorth that which I feare I must euer rewe.</p>

               <p>But he would not attend his wordes, but still strake so fiercely at <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that in the end (nature preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling aboue determination) he was faine to defend him selfe, and with-all to offend him, that by an vnluckye blow the poore <hi>Philoxenus</hi> fell dead at his feete; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had time onely to speake some wordes, whereby <hi>Amphialus</hi> knew it was for my sake: which when <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi>

But that by and by, an vnhappie occasion made <hi>Amphialus</hi> passe himselfe in sorrow: for <hi>Philoxenus</hi> was but newly dead, when there comes to the same place, the aged and vertuous <hi>Timotheus,</hi> who (hauing heard of his sonnes so daine and passionate manner of parting from my Court) had followed him as speedily as he could; but alas not so speedily, but that he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him dead before he could ouer take him.

Where lying vnder the protection of a shadie tree, with intention to make forgetting sleepe comfort a sorrowfull memorie, he sawe a sight which perswaded, and obteyned of his eyes, that they would abide yet a while open. It was the appearing of a Ladie, who because she walked with her side toward him, he could not perfectly, see her face; but so much he might see of her, that was a suretie for the rest, that all was excellent.</p>

Vpon her bodie she ware a doublet of skie colour sattin, couered with plates of gold, &amp; as it were nailed with pretious stones, that in it she might seeme armed; the nether parts of her garment was so full of stuffe, &amp; cut after such a fashion, that though the length of it reached to the ankles, yet in her going one might sometimes discerne the smal of her leg, which with the foot was dressed in a short paire of crimson veluet bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, in some places open (as the ancient manner was) to shew the fairenes of the skin. Ouer all this she ware a certaine mantell, made in such manner, that comming vnder the right arme, and couering most of that side, it had no fastning of the left side, but onely vpon the top of the shoulder: where the two endes met, and were closed together with a very riche iewell: the deuise wherof (as he after saw) was this: a <hi>Hercules</hi> made in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fourme, but a distasseset within his hand as he once was by <hi>Omphales</hi> commaundement with a worde in Greeke, but thus to be interpreted, <hi>Neuer more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant.</hi> On the same side, on her thigh shee ware a sword, which as it witnessed her to be an <hi>Amazon,</hi> or one following that profession, so it seemed but a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les weapon, since her other forces were without with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.

O sweete <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> separate your selfe a little (if it be possible) from your selfe, and let your owne minde looke vpon your owne proceedings: so shall my wordes be needlesse, and you best instructed. See with your selfe, how sitt it will be for you in this your tender youth, borne so great a Prince, and of so rare, not onely expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but proofe, desired of your olde Father, and wanted of your natiue countrie, now so neere your home, to diuert your thoughts from the way of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; to loose, nay to abuse your time. Lastly to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the excellent things you haue done, which haue filled the world with your same; as if you should drowne your ship in the long desired hauen, or like an ill player, should marre the last act of his Tragedie.<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11334:56"/> Remember (for I know you know it) that if we wil be men, the reasonable parte of our soule, is to haue absolute commaundement; against which if any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall weaknes arise, we are to yeelde all our sounde forces to the ouerthrowing of so vnnaturall a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, wherein how can we wante courage, since we are to deale against so weake an aduersary, that in it selfe is nothinge but weakenesse? Nay we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue, that if reason direct it, we must doo it, and if we must doo it, we will doo it; for to say I cannot, is chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish, and I will not, womanish. And see how extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euery waye you endaunger your minde; for to take this womannish habit (without you frame your behauiour accordingly) is wholy vaine: your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour can neuer come kindely from you, but as the minde is proportioned vnto it. So that you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue, if you will playe your parte to any purpose, whatsoeuer peeuish affections are in that sexe, soften your hart to receiue them, the very first downe-steppe to all wickednes: for doo not deceiue your selfe, my deere cosin, there is no man sodainely excellentlie good, or extremely euill, but growes either as hee holdes himselfe vp in vertue, or lets himself slide to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnes. And let vs see, what power is the aucthor of all these troubles: forsooth loue, loue, a passion, and the basest and fruitlessest of all passions: feare breedeth wit, Anger is the cradle of courage: ioy openeth and enhableth the hart: sorrow, as it closeth, so it draweth it inwarde to looke to the correcting of it selfe; and so all generally haue power towards some good by the direction of right Reason. But this bastarde Loue (for in deede the name of Loue is most vnworthylie<pb facs="tcp:11334:57"/> applie to so hatefull a humour) as it is engendered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt lust and idlenes; as the matter it workes vpon is nothing, but a certaine base weakenes, which some gentle sooles call a gentle hart; as his adioyned compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions be vnquietnes, longings, fond comforts, saint discomforts, hopes, ielousies, vngrounded rages, caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse yeeldings; so is the hiest ende it aspires vnto, a litle pleasure with much paine before, and great repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce after. But that end how endlesse it runs to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite euils, were fit inough for the matter we speake of, but not for your eares, in whome indeede there is so much true disposition to vertue: yet thus much of his worthie effects in your selfe is to be seen, that (besides your breaking lawes of hospitality with <hi>Kalander</hi> and of friendship with me) it vtterly subuerts the course of nature, in making reason giue place to sense, &amp; man to woman. And truely I thinke heere-vpon it first gatte the name of Loue: for indeede the true loue hath that excellent nature in it, that it doth transform the very effence of the louer into the thing loued, vniting, and as it were incorporating it with a secret &amp; inward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. And herein do these kindes of loue imitate the excellent; for as the loue of heauen makes one heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the loue of vertue, vertuous; so doth the loue of the world make one become wordly, and this effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate loue of a woman, doth so womanish a man, that (if he yeeld to it) it will not onely make him an <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon;</hi> but a launder, a distass-spinner; or what so euer O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vile occupation their idle heads ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagin, &amp; their weake hands performe. Therefore (to trouble you no longer with my tedious but louing words) if either you remember what you are, what you haue bene, or<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11334:57"/> what you must be: if you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fider what it is, that moued you, or by what kinde of creature you are moued, you shall finde the cause so small, the effect so daungerous, your selfe so vnworthie to runne into the one, or to be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the other, that I doubt not I shall quickly haue occasion rather to praise you for hauing conquered it, then to giue you further counsell, how to doo it.</p>

But the exceeding good will he bare to <hi>Musido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> striuing with it, he thus, partely to satisfie him, but principally to loose the reines to his owne motions, made him answere. Cosin, whatsoeuer good disposition nature hath bestowed vpon me, or howsoeuer that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position hath bene by bringing vp co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, this must I confesse, that I am not yet come to that degree of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to thinke light of the sexe, of whom I haue my life; since if I be any thing (which your friendship rather finds, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I acknowledge) I was to come to it, born of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; nursed of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly (for this point of your speach doth neerest touch me) it is stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to see the vnman-like cruelty of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind; who not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with their tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bition, to haue brought the others ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous patience vnder them (like to childish maisters) thinke their masterhood nothing, without doing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iniury to them, who (if we will argue by reason) are framed of nature with the same parts of the minde for the exercise of vertue, as we are. And for example, euen this estate of <hi>Amazons,</hi> (which I now for my greatest honor do seek to counterfaite) doth well witnes, that if generally the swetnes of their dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did not make<pb facs="tcp:11334:58"/> them see the vainnesse of these thinges, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt glorious, they nether want valor of mind, nor yet doth their fairnes take away their force. And truely we men, and praisers of men, should remember, that if we haue such excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, it is reason to thinke them excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent creatures, of whom we are: since a Kite neuer brought forth a good flying Hauke. But to tel you true, as I thinke it superfluous to vse any wordes of such a subiect, which is so praised in it selfe, as it needes no praises; so withall I feare left my conceate (not able to reach vnto them) bring forth wordes, which for their vnworthines may be a disgrace vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I so inwardly honor. Let this suffice, that they are capable of vertue: &amp; vertue (ye your selues say) is to be loued, &amp; I too tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but this I willingly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that it likes me much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when I finde vertue in a faire lodging, then when I am bound to seeke it in an ill fauoured creature, like a pearle in a dounghill. As for my fault of being an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuill guest to <hi>Kalander,</hi> if you could feele what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward guest my selfe am host vnto: ye would thinke it very excuseable, in that I rather performe the dueties of an host, then the ceremonies of a guest. And for my breaking the lawes of friendshippe with you, (which I would rather dye, then effectually doo) truely, I could finde in my hart to aske you pardon for it, but that your handling of me giues me reason to my former dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And here <hi>Pyrocles</hi> stayed, as to breath himselfe, hauing bene transported with a litle vehemency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it seemed him <hi>Musidorus</hi> had ouer-bitterly glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against the reputation of woman-kinde: but then quieting his countenance (aswell as out of an vnquiet mind it might be) he thus procèeded on: And poore<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11334:58"/> Loue (said he) deare cosin, is little beholding vnto you, since you are not contented to spoile it of the honor of the highest power of the mind, which notable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue attributed vnto it; but ye deiect it below all other passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in trueth somewhat strangely; since, if loue receiue any disgrace, it is by the company of these passions you preferre before it. For those kinds of bitter obiections (as, that lust, idlenes, and a weak harte, should be, as it were, the matter and forme of loue) rather touch me, deare <hi>Musidorus,</hi> then loue: But I am good witnesse of mine own imperfections, &amp; therefore will not defende my selfe: but herein I must say, you deale contrary to your self: for if I be so weak, then can you not with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son stir me vp as ye did, by reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of my own ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: or if indeed I be vertuous, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feffe, that loue hath his working in a vertuous hart: &amp; so no dout hath it, whatsoeuer I be: for if we loue vertue, in whom shal we loue it but in a vertuous creature: without your meaning be, I should loue this word <hi>vertue,</hi> where I see it written in a book. Those troblesome effects you say it breedes, be not the faults of loue, but of him that loues; as an vnable vessel to beare such a licour: like euill eyes, not able to look on the Sun; or like an ill braine, soonest ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with best wine. Euen that heauenly loue you speake of, is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied in some harts with hopes, griefs, longings, &amp; dispaires. And in that heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly loue, since ther are two parts, the one the loue it self, th' other the excellencey of the thing loued; I, not able at the first leap to frame both in me, do now (like a diligent work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) make ready the chiefe instrument, and first part of that great worke, which is loue itself; which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue a while practised in this sort, then you shall see me turn<pb facs="tcp:11334:59"/> it to greater matters. And thus gently you may (if it please you) think of me. Neither doubt ye, because I weare a womans apparell, I will be the more woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, since, I assure you (for all my apparrel) there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I desire more, then fully to proue my selfe a man in this enterprise. Much might be said in my defence, much more for loue, and most of all for that diuine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, which hath ioyned me and loue together. But these disputations are fitter for quiet schooles, then my troubled braines, which are bent rather in deeds to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, then in wordes to defende the noble desire which possesseth me. O Lord (saide <hi>Musidorus</hi>) how sharp-witted you are to hurt your selfe? No (answered he) but it is the hurt you speake of, which makes me so sharp-witted. Euen so (said <hi>Musidorus</hi>) as euery base oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation makes one sharp in that practise, and foolish in all the rest. Nay rather (answered <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) as each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing once well learned, serues for a measure of all other knowledges. And is that become (said <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>) a measure for other things, which neuer receiued measure in it selfe? It is counted without measure (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Pyrocles,</hi>) because the workings of it are without measure: but otherwise, in nature it hath measure, since it hath an end allotted vnto it. The beginning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so excellent, I would gladly know the end. Enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, answered <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> with a great sigh. O (said <hi>Musido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>) now set ye foorth the basenes of it: since if it ende in enioying, it shewes all the rest was nothing. Ye mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake me (answered <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) I spake of the end to which it is directed; which end ends not, no sooner then the life. Alas, let your owne braine dis-enchaunt you (said <hi>Musidorus.</hi>) My hart is too farre possessed (said <hi>Pyrocles.</hi>)<pb n="55" facs="tcp:11334:59"/> But the head giues you direction. And the hart giues me life; aunswered <hi>Pyrocles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Musidorus</hi> was so greeued to see his welbeloued <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>7</label> friend obstinat, as he thought, to his owne destruction, that it forced him with more then accustomed vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, to speake these words; Well, well, (saide he) you list to abuse your selfe; it was a very white and red vertue, which you could pick out of a painterly glosse of visage: Confesse the truth; and ye shall finde, the vtmost was but beautie; a thing, which though it be in as great excellencye in your selfe as may be in any, yet I am sure you make no further reckning of it, then of an outward fading benefite Nature bestowed vpon you. And yet such is your want of a true grounded vertue, which must be like it selfe in all points, that what you wisely account a trifle in your selfe, you fondly become a flaue vnto in another. For my part I now protest, I haue left nothing vnfaid, which my wit could make me know, or my most entier friendship to you requires of me; I do now besech you euen for the loue betwixt vs (if this other loue haue left any in you towards me) and for the remembraunce of your olde careful father (if you can reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber him that forget your self) lastly for <hi>Pyrocles</hi> owne sake (who is now vpon the point of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or rising) to purge yourselfe of this vile infection; other wife giue me leaue, to leaue of this name of friendship, as an idle title of a thing which cannot be, wherevertue is abolished. The length of these speaches before had not so much cloied <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> though he were very vnpatient of long deliberations, as the last farewel of him he loued as his owne life, did wound his soule, thinking him selfe afflicted, he was the apter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue<pb facs="tcp:11334:60"/> vnkindnesse deepely: insomuch, that shaking his head, and deliuering some shewe of teares, he thus vttered his griefes. Alas (said he) prince <hi>Musidorus,</hi> how cruelly you deale with me; if you seeke the victory, take it; and if ye liste, triumph. Haue you all the reason of the world, and with me remaine all the imperfections; yet such as I can no more lay from me, then the Crow can be perswaded by the Swanne to cast of all his black fethers. But truely you deale with me like a Phisition, that seeing his patient in a pestilent feuer, should chide him, in steede of ministring helpe, and bid him be sick no more; or rather like such a friend, that visiting his friend condemned to perpectuall prison; and loaden with greeuous fetters, should will him to shake of his fetters, or he wuld leaue him. I am sicke, &amp; sicke to the death; I am a prisoner, neither is any redresse, but by her to whom I am slaue. Now if you list to leaue him that loues you in the hiest degree: But remember euer to cary this with you, that you abandon your friend in his greatest extremity.</p>
               <p>And herewith the deepe wound of his loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rubbed afresh with this new vnkindnes, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as it were) to bleed again, in such fort that he was not hable to beare it any longer, but gushing out aboundance of teares, and crossing his armes ouer his woefull hart, as if his teares had beene out-flowing blood, his armes an ouer-pressing burthen, he suncke downe to the ground, which sodaine traunce went so to the hart of <hi>Musidorus</hi> that falling down by him &amp; kissing the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping eyes of his friend, he besought him not to make account of his speach; which if it had bene ouer vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<pb n="56" facs="tcp:11334:60"/> yet was it to be borne withall, because it came out of a loue much more vehement; that he had not thought fancie could haue receiued so deep a wound: but now finding in him the force of it, hee woulde no further contrary it; but imploy all his seruice to medicine it, in such fort, as the nature of it required. But euen this kindnes made <hi>Pyrocles</hi> the more melte in the former vnkindnes, which his manlike teares well shewed, with a silent look vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Musidorus,</hi> as who should say, And is it possible that <hi>Musidorus</hi> should threaten to leaue me? And this strooke <hi>Musidorus</hi> minde and senses so dumbe too, that for griefe being not able to say any thing, they rested, with their eyes placed one vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in such sort, as might well paint out the true pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of vnkindnes to be neuer aright, but betwixt them that most dearely loue.</p>
               <p>And thus remayned they a time; till at length, <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> embrasing him, said, And will you thus shake of your friend? It is you that shake me of (saide <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) being for my vnperfectnes vnworthie of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe. But this (said <hi>Musidorus</hi>) shewes you more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, to be cruell to him, that submits himselfe vnto you; but since you are vnperfect (said he smiling) it is reason you be gouerned by vs wise and perfect men. And that authoritie will I beginne to take vpon me, with three absolute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements: The first, that you increase not your euill with further griefes: the second, that you loue her with all the powers of your mind: &amp; the last co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shalbe, ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand me to do what seruice I can, towards the attaining of your desires. <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi> hart was not so oppressed with the mighty passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<pb facs="tcp:11334:61"/> of loue and vnkindnes, but that it yeelded to some mirth at this commaundement of <hi>Musidorus,</hi> that he should loue: so that something cleering his face from his former shewes of griefe; Wel (said he) deare cousin, I see by the well choosing of your commandementes, that you are fitter to be a Prince, then a Counseller: and therfore I am resolued to imploy all my endeuour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey you; with this condition, that the comandementes ye commaund me to lay vpon you, shall onely be, that you continue to loue me, and looke vpon my imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with more affection then iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Loue you? (said he) alas, how can my hart be seperated from the true imbrasing of it, without it burst, by being too full of it? But (said he) let vs leaue of these flowers of newe begun frendship: and now I pray you againe tel me; but tell it me fully, omitting no circumstance, the storie of your affections both beginning, and proceeding: assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your selfe, that there is nothing so great, which I will feare to doo for you: nor nothing so small, which I will disdaine to doo for you. Let me therfore receiue a cleere vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, which many times we misse, while those things we account small, as a speech, or a look are omitted, like as a whole sentence may faile of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie, by wanting one particle. Therefore betweene frends, all must be layd open, nothing being superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor tedious. You shalbe obeyed (said <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) and here are we in as fitte a place for it as may be; for this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor no body offers to come into but my selfe; I vsing it as my melancholy retiring place, and therefore that respect is born vnto it; yet if by cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce any should come, say that you are a seruant sent from the Q. of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons</hi> to seeke me, and then let me alone for the rest.

Yet alas so sweete was it vnto me, that I could not be contented, til <hi>Kalander</hi> had made it more and more strong with his declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which the more I questioned, the more pittie I conceaued of her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie fortune: and when with pittie once my harte was made tender, according to the aptnesse of the humour, it receaued quickly a cruell impression of that wonderful passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which to be definde is impossible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no wordes reach to the strange nature of it: they onely know it, which inwardly feele it, it is called loue. Yet did I not (poore wretch) at first know my disease, thinking it onely such a woonted kind of desire, to see rare sights; &amp; my pitie to be no other, but the fruits of a<pb facs="tcp:11334:62"/> gentle nature. But eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this arguing with my selfe came of further thoughts; &amp; the more I argued, the more my thoughts encreased. Desirous I was to see the place where she remained, as though the <hi>Architecture</hi> of the lodges would haue bene much for my learning; but more desirous to see her selfe, to be iudge, forsooth, of the painters cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning. For thus at the first did I flatter my selfe, as though my wound had bene no deeper: but when within short time I came to the degree of vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wishes, and that the wishes grew to vnquiet lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, when I could fix my thoughts vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing, but that within little varying, they should end with <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea:</hi> when each thing I saw, seemed to figure out some parts of my passions; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen <hi>Parthenias</hi> faire face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a lecture to me of <hi>Philocleas</hi> imagined beautie; when I heard no word spoken, but that me thought it caried the sum of <hi>Philocleas</hi> name: then indeed, then I did yeeld to the burthen, finding my selfe prisoner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had leasure to arme my selfe; &amp; that I might well, like the spaniel, gnaw vpon the chaine that ties him, but I should sooner marre my teeth, then procure liberty.</p>

But (alas) what resistance was there, when ere long my very reason was (you will say corrupted) I must needs confesse, conquered; and that me thought euen reason did assure me, that all eies did degenerate from their creation, which did not honour such beautie? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in trueth could holde any plea with it, but the reuerent friendship I bare vnto you. For as it went<pb n="58" facs="tcp:11334:62"/> against my harte to breake any way from you, so did I feare more then anie assault to breake it to you: finding (as it is indeed) that to a hart fully resolute, counsaile is tedious, but reprehension is lothsome: &amp; that there is nothing more terrible to a guilty hart, then the eie of a respected frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.

At length staying, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe without the compasse of blowes, he fell to a fresh scolding, in such mannerlie manner, as might well shewe he had passed through the discipline of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne. But seeing me walke vp and downe, without<pb facs="tcp:11334:64"/> marking what he saide, he went his way (as I perceiued after) to <hi>Basilius:</hi> for within a while he came vnto mee, bearing in deed shewes in his countenaunce of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and well-minded gentleman, and with as much courtesie, as <hi>Dametas</hi> with rudenesse saluting me, Faire Lady (saide he) it is nothing strange, that such a solitary place as this should receiue solitary persons; but much do I maruaile, how such a beauty as yours is, should be suffered to be thus alone.

To obey you (said he) I will doe it, although it were so much more reason, yours should be knowen first, as you doo deserue in all points to be preferd.

The table was set neere to an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent water-worke; for by the casting of the water in most cunning maner, it makes (with the shining of the Sunne vpon it) a perfect rainbow, not more pleasant to the eye then to the mind, so sensibly to see the proof of the heauenly <hi>Iris.</hi> There were birds also made so finely, that they did not onely deceiue the sight with their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, but the hearing with their songs; which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie instruments did make their gorge deliuer. The ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at which we sate, was round, which being fast to the floore whereon we sate, and that deuided from the rest of the buildings (with turning a vice, which <hi>Basili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> at first did to make me sport) the table, and we about the table, did all turne rounde, by meanes of water which ranne vnder, and carried it about as a Mille. But alas, what pleasure did it to mee, to make diuers times the full circle round about, since <hi>Philoclea</hi> (being also set) was carried still in equall distance from me, and that onely my eyes did ouertake her; which when the table was stayed, and wee beganne to feede, dranke much more eagerlie of her beautie, then my mouth did of any other licour. And so was my common sense deceiued (being chiefly bent to her) that as I dranke the wine, and withall stale a looke on her, me seemed I tasted her deliciousnesse. But alas, the one thirste was much more inflamed, then the other quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Sometimes my eyes would lay themselues open to receiue all the dartes she did throwe, somtimes cloze vp with admiration, as if with a contrary fancie, they woulde preserue the riches of that sight they had<pb n="63" facs="tcp:11334:67"/> gotten, or cast my lidde as curtaines ouer the image of beautie, her presence had painted in them. True it is, that my Reason (now growen a seruant to Passion) did yet often tel his master, that he should more moderatly vse his delight. But he, that of a rebell was become a Prince, disdayned almost to allow him the place of a Counseller: so that my senses delights being too stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g for any other resolution, I did euen loose the raines vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: hoping, that (going for a woman) my lookes would passe, either vnmarked, or vnsuspected.</p>
               <p>Now thus I had (as me thought) well playd my first <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>2</label> acte, assuring my selfe, that vnder that disguisment, I should find opportunitie to reueal my self to the owner of my harte. But who would thinke it possible (though I feele it true) that in almost eight weekes space, I haue liued here (hauing no more companie but her parents, and I being familiar, as being a woman, and watchfull, as being a louer) yet could neuer finde opportunitie to haue one minutes leasure of priuie conference: the cause where of is as strange, as the effects are to me mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And (alas) this it is.</p>
               <p>At the first sight that <hi>Basilius</hi> had of me (I think <hi>Cupid</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>3</label> hauing headed his arrows with my misfortune) he was striken (taking me to be such as I professe) with great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards me: which since is growen to such a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting loue, that (till I was faine to gette this place, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to retire vnto freely) I was euen choaked with his tediousnes. You neuer saw fourscore yeares daunce vp and downe more liuely in a young Louer: now, as fine in his apparrell, as if he would make me in loue with a cloake; and verse for verse with the sharpest-witted Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Doo you not think that this is a sallet of<pb facs="tcp:11334:68"/> woormwood, while mine eyes feede vpon the <hi>Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> of <hi>Philocleas</hi> beauty.</p>
               <p>But this is not all; no this is not the worst; for he (good man) were easy enough to be dealt with: but (as I thinke) Loue and mischeefe hauing made a wager, which should haue most power in me, haue set <hi>Gynecia</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>4</label> also on such a fire towardes me, as will neuer (I feare) be quenched but with my destruction. For she (being a woman of excellent witte, and of strong working thoughts) whether she suspected me by my ouer-vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment showes of affection to <hi>Philoclea</hi> (which loue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me vnwisely to vtter, while hope of my maske foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly incouraged me) or that she hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some other marke of me, that I am not a woman: or what deuil it is hath reuealed it vnto her, I know not; but so it is, that al her countenances, words and gestures, are miserable portraitures of a desperate affection. Whereby a man may learne, that these auoydings of companie, doo but make the passions more violent, when they meete with fitte subiects. Truely it were a notable dumb shew of <hi>Cupids</hi> kingdome, to see my eyes (languishing with ouer-vehement longing) direct themselues to <hi>Philoclea: &amp; Basilius</hi> as busie about me as a Bee, &amp; indeed as cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome; making such suits to me, who nether could if I would; nor would if I could, helpe him: while the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble witte of <hi>Gynecia,</hi> carried with the beere of violent loue, runnes thorow vs all. And so ielious is she of my loue to her daughter, that I could neuer yet beginne to open my mouth to the vneuitable <hi>Philoclea,</hi> but that her vnwished presence gaue my tale a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion, before it had a beginning.</p>
               <p>And surely if I be not deceiued, I see such shewes of<pb n="64" facs="tcp:11334:68"/> liking, and (if I bee acquainted with passions) of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a passionate liking in the heauenly <hi>Philoclea,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me, that I may hope her eares would not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre my discourse. And for good <hi>Basilius,</hi> he thought it best to haue lodged vs together, but that the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall hatefulnes of my destinie, made <hi>Cynecias</hi> ielousie stoppe that, and all other my blessings. Yet must I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that one way her loue doth me pleasure: for since it was my foolish fortune, or vnfortunate follie, to be knowen by her, that keepes her from bewraying me to <hi>Basilius.</hi> And thus (my <hi>Musidorus</hi>) you haue my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie played vnto you by myselfe, which I pray the gods may not in deede prooue a Tragedie. And there he ended, making a full point of a hartie sigh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Musidorus</hi> reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to his best discourse, all which <label type="milestone">

Well (said he) deare co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, since it hath pleased the gods to mingle your other excellencies with this humor of loue, yet happie it is, that your loue is imployed vpon so rare a woman: for certainly, a noble cause dooth ease much agrieuous case. But as it stands now, nothing vexeth me, as that I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not see wherein I can be seruisable vnto you.

But now, (said she) it is time for me to leaue you, and towardes euening wee will walke out of purpose hetherward, therefore keepe your selfe close in that time. But <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidorus</hi> bethinking him selfe that his horse might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to bewray them, thought it best to returne for that day, to a village not farre of, and dispatching his horse in some sorte, the next day early to come a foote thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so to keepe that course afterward, which <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi> very well liked of.

But as it was rather choise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature, that led him to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of armes, so as soon as the spur of honor ceased, he willingly rested in peaceable delightes, being beloued in all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies for his louely qualities, &amp; (as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may terme it) cunning cherefulnes, wherby to the Prince &amp; Court of <hi>Laconia,</hi> none was more agreable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus:</hi> and he not giuen greatly to struggle with his<pb facs="tcp:11334:71"/> owne disposition, followed the gentle currant of it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a fortune sufficient to content, &amp; he content with a sufficient fortune. But in that court he sawe, and was acquainted with this <hi>Artesia,</hi> whose beautie he now defendes, became her seruant, said him selfe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce thought him selfe her louer. But certainly, (said <hi>Basilius</hi>) many times it falles out, that these young companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s make themselues beleeue they loue at the first liking of a likely beautie; louing, because they will loue for want of other businesse, not because they feele indeed that diuine power, which makes the heart finde a reason in passion: and so (God knowes) as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constantly leane vpon the next chaunce that beautie castes before them. So therefore taking loue vppon him like a fashion, he courted this Ladie <hi>Artesia,</hi> who was as fit to paie him in his owne monie as might be. For she thinking she did wrong to her beautie if she were not prowde of it, called her disdaine of him cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, and placed her honour in little setting by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring her: determining neuer to marrie, but him, whome she thought worthie of her: and that was one, in whome all worthinesse were harboured. And to this conceipt not onely nature had bent her, but the bringing vp she receaued at my sister in lawe <hi>Cecro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> had confirmed her: who hauing in her widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood taken this young <hi>Artesia</hi> into her charge; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her Father had bene a deare friend of her dead husbandes, and taught her to thinke that there is no wisdome but in including heauen &amp; earth in ones self: and that loue, courtesie, gratefulnesse, friendship, and all other vertues are rather to be taken on, then taken in ones selfe: And so good discipline she found of her,<pb n="67" facs="tcp:11334:71"/> that liking the fruits of her owne planting, she was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>After her was the goodly <hi>Artaxia,</hi> great Q. of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a Lady vpon whom nature bestowed, &amp; wel placed her delightful colours; &amp; withal, had proportioned her without any fault, quickly to be discouered by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, yet altogether seemed not to make vp that harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that <hi>Cupid</hi> delights in; the reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof might seem a mannish countenance, which ouerthrew that louely<pb facs="tcp:11334:73"/> sweetnes, the noblest power of womankinde, farre fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to preuaile by parley, then by battell.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The other (whose name was written <hi>Leucippe</hi>) was of a fine daintines of beauty, her face carying in it a sober simplicitie; like one that could do much good, &amp; ment no hurt, her eyes hauing in them such a cheerefulnes, as nature seemed to smile in them: though her mouth and cheekes obeyed that prety demurenes which the more one markes, the more one woulde iudge the poore soule apt to beleue; &amp; therefore the more pitie<pb n="70" facs="tcp:11334:73"/> to deceiue her.</p>
               <p>Next came the Queene of <hi>Laconia,</hi> one that seemed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> borne in the confines of beauties kingdome: for all her lineame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were neither perfect possessions thereof, nor absent strangers thereto: but she was a Queene, and therefore beautyfull.</p>
               <p>But she that followed, conquered indeed with being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> conquered; &amp; might well haue made all the beholders waite vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her triumph, while her selfe were led captiue.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Of a farre differing (though esteemed equall) beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was the faire <hi>Parthenia,</hi> who next wayted on <hi>Artesias</hi> triumph, though farre better she might haue sitte in the throne. For in her euery thing was goodly, and stately; yet so, that it might seeme that great-mindednes was but the auncient-bearer to humblenes. For her great graie eye, which might seem full of her owne beauties, a large, and exceedingly faire forhead, with all the rest of her face and body, cast in the mould of Noblenes; was yet so attired, as might shew, the mistres thought it either not to deserue, or not to need any exquisite dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, hauing no adorning but cleanlines; and so farre from all arte, that it was full of carelesnesse: vnlesse that carelesnesse it selfe (in spite of it selfe) grew artificiall. But <hi>Basilius</hi> could not abstaine from praising <hi>Parthenia,</hi> as the perfect picture of a womanly vertue, and wiuely faithfulnes: telling withall <hi>Zelmane,</hi> how he had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, that when in the court of <hi>Laconia,</hi> her picture (maintained by a certaine <hi>Sycionian</hi> Knight) was lost, thorow want, rather of valour, then iustice: her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (the famous <hi>Argalus</hi>) would in a chafe haue gone and redeemed it with a new triall. But she (more spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting then sorrowing for her vndeserued champion) tolde her husbande, she desired to be beautifull in no bodies eye but his; and that she would rather marre her face as euill as euer it was, then that it should be a cause to make <hi>Argalus</hi> put on armour. Then would <hi>Basilius</hi> haue tolde <hi>Zelmane,</hi> that which she alredie knew, of the rare triall of their coupled affection: but the next pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture made the mouth giue place to their eyes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> It was of a young mayd, which fate pulling out a thorne out of a Lambs foote, with her looke so atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11334:74"/> vppon it, as if that little foote coulde haue bene the circle of her thoughts; her apparell so poore, as it had nothing but the inside to adorne it; a she phooke lying by her with a bottle vpon it. But with al that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, beauty plaid the prince, and commanded as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harts as the greatest Queene there did. Her beautie and her estate made her quicklie to be knowne to be the faire shepheardesse, <hi>Vrania,</hi> whom a rich knight cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lacemon,</hi> farre in loue with her, had vnluckely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
               <p>The last of all in place, because last in the time of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> her being captiue, was <hi>Zelmane,</hi> daughter to the King <hi>Plexirtus:</hi> who at the first sight seemed to haue some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> but with more marking (co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring it to the present <hi>Philoclea,</hi> who indeed had no paragon but her sister) they might see, it was but such a likenesse, as an vnperfect glasse doth giue; aunswerable enough in some feitures, &amp; colors, but erring in others. But <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> sighing, turning to <hi>Basilius,</hi> Alas sir (said she) here be some pictures which might better become the to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bes of their Mistresses, then the triumphe of <hi>Artesia.</hi> It is true sweetest Lady (saide <hi>Basilius</hi>) some of them be dead, and some other captiue: But that hath happened so late, as it may be the Knightes that defended their beauty, knew not so much: without we will say (as in some harts I know it would fall out) that death it selfe could not blot out the image which loue hath engraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, into one Tent, by which he had another: where they both wayted who would first strike vpon the shielde, while <hi>Basilius</hi> the Iudge appointed sticklers, and trumpets, to whom the other should obey. But non that day appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor the next, till already it had consumed halfe his allowance of light; but then there came in a knight, protesting himselfe as contrarie to him in minde, as he was in apparrell. For <hi>Phalantus</hi> was all in white, hauing in his bases, and caparison imbroidered a wauing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: at each side whereof he had nettings cast ouer, in which were diuers fishes naturally made, &amp; so pretily, that as the horse stirred, the fishes seemed to striue, and leape in the nette.</p>
               <p>But the other knight, by name <hi>Nestor,</hi> by birth an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadian,</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:11334:75"/> &amp; in affection vowed to the faire Shepherdesse, was all in black, with fire burning both vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his armour, and horse. His <hi>impresa</hi> in his shield, was a fire made of Iuniper, with this word, <hi>More easie, and more sweete.</hi> But this hote knight was cooled with a fall, which at the third course he receiued of <hi>Phalantus,</hi> leauing his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to keepe companie with the other of the same stampe; he going away remedilesly chasing at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke. The next was <hi>Polycetes,</hi> greatly esteemed in <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> for deedes he had done in armes: and much spoken of for the honourable loue he had long borne to <hi>Gyne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia;</hi> which <hi>Basilius</hi> himselfe was content, not onely to suffer, but to be delighted with; he carried it in so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and open plainnes, setting to his loue no other marke, then to do her faithfull seruice. But neither her faire picture, nor his faire running, could warrant him from ouerthrow, and her from becomming as then the last of <hi>Artesias</hi> victories: a thing <hi>Gynecias</hi> vertues would little haue recked at another time, nor then, if <hi>Zelmane</hi> had not seene it. But her champion went away asmuch discomforted, as discomfited. Then <hi>Telamon</hi> for <hi>Polixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> &amp; <hi>Eurimelo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And well might his proportion be iudged; for he had nothing vpon him but a paire of sloppes, and vpon his bodie a Gote-skinne, which he cast ouer his shoulder, doing all things with so pretie grace, that it seemed ignorance could not make him do amisse, because he had a hart to do well, holding in his right hand a long stasfe, &amp; so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with a looke ful of amiable fiercenes, as in whom choller could not take away the sweetnes, he came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the king, and making a reuerence (which in him was comely because it was kindly) My liege Lord (said he) I pray you heare a few words; for my hart wil break if I say not my minde to you. I see here the picture of <hi>Vrania,</hi> which (I cannot tell how, nor why) these men when they fall downe, they say is not so faire as yonder gay woman. But pray God, I may neuer see my olde mother aliue, if I thinke she be any more match to <hi>Vra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> then a Goate is to a fine Lambe; or then the Dog that keepes our flock at home, is like your white Grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounde, that pulled down the Stagge last day.</p>
               <p>And therefore I pray you let me be drest as they be, and my hart giues me, I shall tumble him on the earth: for indeede he might aswell say, that a Couslip is as white as a Lillie: or els I care not let him come with his great stasfe, and I with this in my hand, and you shall see what I can doo to him. <hi>Basilius</hi> sawe it was the fine shepheard <hi>Lalus,</hi> whom once he had afore him in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall sportes, and had greatly delighted in his wit full of prety simplicitie, and therefore laughing at his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse, he bad him be content, since he sawe the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of so great Queenes, were faine to follow their champions fortune. But <hi>Lalus</hi> (euen weeping ripe)<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11334:76"/> went among the rest, longing to see some bodie that would reuenge <hi>Vranias</hi> wronge; and praying hartely for euery bodie that ran against <hi>Phalantus,</hi> then began to feele pouerty, that he could not set him selfe to that triall. But by and by, euen when the Sunne (like a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble harte) began to shew his greatest countenaunce in his lowest estate, there came in a Knight, called <hi>Phebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> a Gentleman of that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, for whom hatefull for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had borrowed the dart of Loue, to make him mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable by the sight of <hi>Philoclea.</hi> For he had euen from her infancie loued her, and was striken by her, before she was able to knowe what quiuer of arrowes her eyes caried; but he loued and dispaired; and the more he dispaired, the more he loued. He sawe his owne vnworthines, and thereby made her excellencie haue more terrible aspect vpon him: he was so secrete there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as not daring to be open, that to no creature he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer spake of it, but his hart made such silent complaints within it selfe, that while all his senses were attentiue thereto, cunning iudges might perceaue his minde: so that he was knowne to loue though he denied, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the better knowne, because he denied it. His armour and his attire was of a Sea couler, his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presa,</hi> the fishe called <hi>Sepia,</hi> which being in the nette castes a blacke inke about it selfe, that in the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof it may escape: his worde was, <hi>Not so. Philocleas</hi> picture with almost an idolatrous magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was borne in by him. But streight ielousie was a harbinger for disdaine in <hi>Zelmanes</hi> harte, when she <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>3</label> sawe any (but her selfe) should be auowed a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for <hi>Philoclea:</hi> in somuch that she wisht his shame, till she sawe him shamed: for at the second course he<pb facs="tcp:11334:77"/> was striken quite from out of the saddle, so full of grief, and rage withall, that he would faine with the sworde haue reuenged it: but that being contrary to the order set downe, <hi>Basilius</hi> would not suffer; so that wishing him selfe in the bottome of the earth, he went his way, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Zelmane</hi> no lesse angry with his los, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she would haue beene with his victory. For if she thought before a riuals prayse woulde haue angred her, her Ladies disgrace did make her much more forget what she then thought, while that passion raigned so much the more, as she saw a pretie blush in <hi>Philocleas</hi> cheekes bewray a modest discontentment. But the night commaunded truce for those sportes, &amp; <hi>Phalantus</hi> (though intreated) would not leaue <hi>Artesia,</hi> who in no case would come into the house, hauing (as it were) suckte of <hi>Cecropias</hi> breath a mortall mislike against <hi>Basilius.</hi>

The new Knight was quickly knowne to be <hi>Clitophon</hi> (<hi>Kaladers</hi> sonne of <hi>Basilius</hi>-his sister) by his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which al guilt, was so well ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, that it shewed like a glittering sande and grauell, interlaced with sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer riuers: his deuice he had put in the picture of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> which hee defended. It was the <hi>Ermion,</hi> with a<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11334:77"/> speach that signified, <hi>Rather dead then spotted.</hi> But in that armour since he had parted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Helen</hi> (who would no longer his companie, finding him to enter into termes of affection,) he had performed so honourable actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, (stil seeking for his two friends by the names of <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Daiphatus,</hi>) that though his face were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, his being was discouered, which yet <hi>Basilius</hi> (which had brought him vp in his court) would not seeme to do; but glad to see triall of him, of whom he had heard very well, he commaunded the trumpets to sound; to which the two braue Knights obeying, they performed their courses, breaking their six staues, with so good, both skill in the hitting, &amp; grace in the maner, that it bred some difficulty in the iudgement. But <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> in the ende gaue sentence against <hi>Clitophon,</hi> because <hi>Phalantus</hi> had broken more staues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head, &amp; that once <hi>Clitophon</hi> had receiued such a blowe, that he had lost the raines of his horse, with his head well nie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the crooper of the horse. But <hi>Clitophon</hi> was so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, (wherin he thought he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g) that he omitted his duty to his Prince, &amp; vncle; and sodainly went his way, still in the quest of them, whom as then he had left by seeking: &amp; so yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the field to the next commer.</p>
               <p>Who comming in about two houres after, was no <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> lesse marked then al the rest before, because he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth the marking. For he had neither picture, nor deuice, his armour of as old a fashion (besides the rustie poorenesse,) that it might better seeme a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his graundfathes courage: about his middle he had in steede of bases, a long cloake of silke, which as vnhandsomely, as it needes must, became the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:<pb facs="tcp:11334:78"/> so that all that lookt on, measured his length on the earth alreadie, since he had to meete one who had bene victorious of so many gallants. But he went on towardes the shielde, and with a sober grace strake it; but as he let his sworde fall vpon it, another Knight, all in blacke came rustling in, who strake the shield al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most assoone as he, and so strongly, that he brake the shield in two: the ill appointed Knight (for so the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders called him) angrie with that, (as he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,) insolent iniurie to himselfe, hit him such a sound blowe, that they that looked on saide, it well became a rude arme. The other aunswered him againe in the same case, so that Launces were put to silence, the swordes were so busie.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Phalantus</hi> angry of this defacing his shield, came vpon the blacke Knight, and with the pommell of his sworde set fire to his eyes, which presently was reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, not onely by the Blacke, but the ill apparelled Knight, who disdained another should enter into his quarrell, so as, who euer sawe a matachin daunce to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate fighting, this was a sight that did imitate the matachin: for they being but three that fought, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one had aduersaries, striking him, who strooke the third, and reuenging perhaps that of him, which he had receaued of the other. But <hi>Basilius</hi> rising himselfe to parte them, the sticklers authoritie scarflie able to perswade cholerike hearers; and parte them he did.</p>
               <p>But before he could determine, comes in a fourth,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>6</label> halting on foote, who complained to <hi>Basilius,</hi> demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding iustice on the blacke Knight, for hauing by force taken away the picture of <hi>Pamela</hi> from him, whiche in little forme he ware in a Tablet, and couered with<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11334:78"/> silke had fastened it to his Helmet, purposing for want of a bigger, to paragon the little one with <hi>Artesias</hi> length, not doubting but in that little quantitie, the excellencie of that would shine thorow the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the other: as the smallest starre do the thorow the whole Element of fire. And by the way he had met with this blacke Knight, who had (as he said) rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him of it. The iniurie seemed grieuous, but when it came fully to be examined, it was found, that the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Knight meeting the other, asking the cause of his going thetherward, and finding it was to defend <hi>Pame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> diuine beautie against <hi>Artesias,</hi> with a prowde iol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie commaunded him to leaue that quarrell onely for him, who was onely worthy to enter into it. But the blacke Knight obeying no such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, they fell to such a bickering, that he gat a halting, &amp; lost his picture. This vnderstood by <hi>Basilius,</hi> he told him he was now fitter to looke to his owne bodie, then an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers picture: &amp; so (vncomforted therein) sent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to learn of <hi>AEsculapius</hi> that he was not fit for <hi>Venus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then the question arising who should be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer against <hi>Phalantus,</hi> of the blacke, or the ill apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <label type="milestone">

But because perhappes all eyes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not taste the Diuinitie of her beautie, and would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be dazeled, then taught by the light, if it bee not clowded by some meaner thing; know you then, that I desend that same Ladie, whose image <hi>Phebilus</hi> so feebly lost yesternight, and in steede of an other (if you ouercome mee) you shall haue me your slaue to carrie that image in your mistresse triumphe. <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus</hi> casilie agreed to the bargaine, which alreadie he made his owne.</p>

And at the seconde gaue him such a couterbusse, that because <hi>Phalantus</hi> was so perfite a horseman, as not to be driuen from the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, the saddle with broken girthes was driuen from the horse: <hi>Phalantus</hi> remaining angrie and amazed, because now being come almost to the last of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised enterprise, that disgrace befell him, which he had neuer before knowne.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>8</label> But the victorie being by the iudges giuen, and the trumpets witnessed to the ill apparelled Knight; <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus</hi> disgrace was ingrieued in lieu of comforte by <hi>Artesia;</hi> who telling him she neuer lookt for other, bad him seeke some other mistresse.

               <p>Nay truely Madame (saide <hi>Phalantus</hi>) it shall not<pb n="76" facs="tcp:11334:79"/> be so: for I thinke the losse of such a Mistresse will prooue a great gaine: and so concluded; to the sporte of <hi>Basilius,</hi> to see young folkes loue, that came in maskt with so great pompe, goe out with so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie.

               <p>And hauing ended, he strake himselfe on the brest; saying, O miserable wretch, whether do thy destenies guide thee? The voice made <hi>Zelmane</hi> hasten her pace to ouertake him: which hauing done, she plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued that it was her deare friend <hi>Musidorus,</hi> whereat maruailing not a little, she demaunded of him, whether the Goddesse of those woods had such a powre to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme euery body, or whether, as in all enterprises else he had done, he meant thus to match her in this newe alteration.</p>
               <p>Alas, (said <hi>Musidorus</hi>) what shall I say, who am loth <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>3</label> to say, and yet faine would haue said? I find indeed, that all is but lip-wisdome, which wants experience. I now<pb facs="tcp:11334:81"/> (woe is me) do try what loue can doo. O <hi>Zelmane,</hi> who will resist it, must either haue no witte, or put out his eyes? can any man resist his creation? certainely by loue we are made, and to loue we are made. Beasts one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot discerne beauty, and let them be in the role of Beasts that doo not honor it. The perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>Zelmane</hi> bare him, and the great pitie she (by good triall) had of such cases, coulde not keepe her from smiling at him, remembring how vehemently he had cryed out against the folly of louers. And therefore a litle to punish him, Why how now deere cousin (said she) you that were last day so hie in Pulpit against lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, are you now become so meane an auditor? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that loue is a passion; and that a woorthie mans reason must euer haue the masterhood. I recant, I recant (cryed <hi>Masidorus,</hi>) and withall falling downe prostrate, O thou celestial, or infernal spirit of Loue, or what other heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly or hellish title thou list to haue (for effects of both I finde in my selfe) haue compassion of me, and let thy glory be as great in pardoning them that be submitted to thee, as in conquering those that were rebellious. No, no saide <hi>Zelmane,</hi> I see you well enough: you make but an enterlude of my mishaps, and doo but counterfaite thus, to make me see the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of my passions: but take heede, that this iest do not one day turne to earnest. Now I beseech thee (saide <hi>Musidorus</hi> taking her fast by the hand) euen for the truth of our friendship, of which (if I be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together an vnhappy man) thou hast some remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, &amp; by those sacred flames which (I know) haue likewise neerely touched thee; make no iest of that, which hath so ernestly pearced me thorow, nor let that<pb n="78" facs="tcp:11334:81"/> be light to thee, which is to me so burdenous, that I am not able to beare it. <hi>Musidorus</hi> both in words &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, did so liuely deliuer out his inward grief, that <hi>Zelmane</hi> found indeede, he was thorowly wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: but there rose a new iclousy in her minde, lest it might be with <hi>Philoclea,</hi> by whom, as <hi>Zelmane</hi> thought, in right all hartes and eyes should be inherited. And therefore desirous to be cleered of that doubt, <hi>Musidorus</hi> shortly (as in hast and full of passionate perplexednes,) thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his case vnto her.</p>
               <p>The day (said he) I parted from you, I being in mind <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>4</label> to returne to a towne, from whence I came hether, my horse being before tired, would scarce beare me a mile hence: where being benighted, the light of a candle (I saw a good way of) guided me to a young shepheards house, by name <hi>Menalcas,</hi> who seing me to be a straying stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, with the right honest hospitality which seemes to be harboured in the <hi>Arcadian</hi> brests, &amp; though not with curious costlines, yet with cleanly sufficiencie, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained me: and hauing by talke with him, found the manner of the countrie, something more in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, then I had by <hi>Kalanders</hi> report, I agreed to soiourne with him in secret, which he faithfully promised to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue. And so hether to your arbour diuers times repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: &amp; here by your meanes had the sight (O that it had neuer bene so, nay, O that it might euer be so) of a Goddesse, who in a definite compasse can set forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite beauty. All this while <hi>Zelmane</hi> was racked with iealousie. But he went on, For (saide he) I lying close, and in truth thinking of you, and saying thus to my selfe, O sweet <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> how art thou bewitched? where is thy vertue? where is the vse of thy reason? how much<pb facs="tcp:11334:82"/> am I inferior to thee in the state of the mind? And yet know I, that all the heauens cannot bring me to such thraldome. Scarcely, thinke I, had I spoken this word, when the Ladies came foorth; at which fight, I thinke the very words returned back again to strike my soule; at least, an vnmeasurable sting I felt in my selfe, that I had spoken such words. At which sight? said <hi>Zelmane,</hi> not able to beare him any longer. O (sayd <hi>Musidorus</hi>) I know your suspition; No, no, banish all such feare, it was, it is, and must be <hi>Pamela</hi> Then all is safe (sayd <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>) proceede, deare <hi>Musidorus.</hi> I will not (said he) impute it to my late solitarie life (which yet is prone to affections) nor, to the much thinking of you (though that cald the consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of loue into my mind, which before I euer neglected) nor to the exaltation of <hi>Venus;</hi> nor reuenge of <hi>Cupid;</hi> but euen to her, who is the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, nay, the Goddesse, against which, the onely shielde must be my Sepulchre. When I first saw her, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently striken, and I (like a foolish child, that when any thing hits him, wil strike himselfe again vpon it) would needs looke againe; as though I would perswade mine eyes, that they were deceiued. But alas, well haue I found, that Loue to a yeelding hart is a king; but to a resisting, is a tyrant. The more with arguments I shaked the stake, which he had planted in the grounde of my harte, the deeper still it sanke into it. But what meane I to speake of the causes of my loue, which is as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to describe, as to measure the backside of heauen? Let this word suffice, I loue.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> And that you may know I doo so, it was I that came in black armour to defende her picture, where I was both preuented, and beaten by you. And so, I that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<pb n="79" facs="tcp:11334:82"/> here to do you seruice, haue now my self most need of succor. But wherupon got you your self this aparrel? said <hi>Zelmane.</hi> I had forgotten to tel you (said <hi>Musidorus</hi>) though that were one principall matter of my speech; so much am I now master of my owne minde. But thus it happened: being returned to <hi>Menalcas</hi> house, full of tormenting desire, after a while faynting vnder the weight, my courage stird vp my wit to seeke for some releese, before I yeelded to perish. At last this came into my head, that very euening, that I had to no purpose last vsed my horse and armour. I tolde <hi>Menalcas,</hi> that I was a <hi>Thessalian</hi> Gentle-man, who by mischaunce ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing killed a great fauorit of the Prince of that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, was pursued so cruelly, that in no place, but either by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, or corruption, they would obtaine my destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that therefore I was determined (till the fury of my persecutions might be asswaged) to disguise my selfe among the shephadrs of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> &amp; (if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) to be one of them that were allowed the Princes presence; Because if the woorst should fall, that I were discouered, yet hauing gotten the acquaintance of the Prince, it might happen to moue his hart to protect me. <hi>Menalcas</hi> (being of an honest dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) pittied my case, which my face through my inward torment made credible; and so (I giuing him largely for it) let me haue this rayment, instructing me in all the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, touching himselfe, or my selfe, which I desired to know: yet not trusting so much to his constancic, as that I would lay my life, and life of my life, vpon it, I hired him to goe into <hi>Thessalia</hi> to a friend of mine, &amp; to deliuer him a letter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me; coniuring him to bring me as speedy an answeere as he could, because it imported<pb facs="tcp:11334:83"/> me greatly to know, whether certaine of my friendes did yet possesse any fauour, whose intercessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s I might vse for my restitution. He willingly tooke my letter, which being well sealed, indeed conteyned other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For I wrote to my trustie seruant <hi>Calodoulus</hi> (whom you know) that assoone as he had deliuered the letter, he should keep him prisoner in his house, not suffering him to haue conference with any body, till he knewe my further pleasure: in all other respects that he should vse him as my brother. And thus is <hi>Menalcas</hi> gone, and I here a poore shepheard; more proud of this estate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any kingdom: so manifest it is, that the highest point outward things can bring one vnto, is the contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the mind: with which, no estate; without which, all estates be miserable. Now haue I chosen this day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as <hi>Menalcas</hi> tolde me) the other shepheards are called to make their sports, and hope that you wil with your credite, finde meanes to get me allowed among them. You neede not doubt (answered <hi>Zelmane)</hi> but that I will be your good mistresse: marrie the best way of dealing must be by <hi>Dametas,</hi> who since his blunt braine hath perceiued some fauour the Prince dooth beare vnto me (as without doubt the most seruile flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is lodged most easilie in the grossest capacitie; for their ordinarie conceite draweth a yeelding to their greaters, and then haue they not witte to learne the right degrees of duetie) is much more seruiceable vnto me, then I can finde any cause to wish him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dispaire not to winne him: for euery present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will catch his senses, and his senses are masters of his sillie mind; onely reuerence him, and reward him, and with that bridle and saddle you shall well ride him.<pb n="80" facs="tcp:11334:83"/> O heauen and earth (said <hi>Musidorus</hi>) to what a passe are our mindes brought, that from the right line of vertue, are wryed to these crooked shifts? But ô Loue, it is thou that doost it: thou changest name vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> name; thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisest our bodies, and disfigurest our mindes.

But the Lion (seing <hi>Philoclea</hi> run away) bent his race to her-ward, &amp; was ready to seaze him selfe on the pray, when <hi>Zelmane</hi> (to whome daunger then was a cause of dreadlesnes, all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>positions of her eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts being nothing but fierie) with swiftnesse of desire crost<pb n="82" facs="tcp:11334:85"/> him, and with force of affection strake him such a blow vpon his chine, that she opened al his body: wherwith the valiant beast turning vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her with open iawes, she gaue him such a thrust thorow his brest, that al the Lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could do, was with his paw to teare of the mantle and sleeue of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> with a little scratch, rather then a wound; his death-blow hauing take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away the effect of his force.

As soone (said she) as ye were all run away, and that I hoped to be in safetie, there came out of the same woods a foule horrible Beare, which (fearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to deale while the Lion was present, as soone as he was gone) came furiously towardes the place where I was, and this youug shepheard left alone by me; I truly (not guilty of any wisedome, which since they lay to my charge, because they say, it is the best refuge against that beast, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pure feare bringing forth that effect of wisedome) fell downe flat of my face, needing not cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfait being dead, for indeed I was litle better.

I pray you (saide <hi>Zelmane,</hi> speaking to <hi>Dorus,</hi> whose valour she was carefull to haue manifested) in what sorte, so ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, could you atchiue this enterprise? Noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (saide <hi>Dorus</hi>) the manner of these beastes fighting with any man, is to stande vp vpon their hinder feete: and so this did, &amp; being ready to giue me a shrewd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement, I thinke, the God <hi>Pan,</hi> (euer carefull of the chiefe blessings of <hi>Arcadia</hi>) guided my hand so iust to the hart of the beast, that neither she could once touch me, nor (which is the only matter in this worthy reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And with that word (scorne borrowing the countenance of myrth) somewhat she smiled, and thus spake on: When (said she) <hi>Dorus</hi> made me assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly perceiue, that all cause of feare was passed (the truth is) I was ashamed to finde my selfe alone with this shepheard: and therefore looking about me, if I could see any bodie; at length we both perceiued the gentle <hi>Dametas,</hi> lying with his breast and head as farre as he could thrust himselfe into a bush: drawing vp his legges as close vnto him as hee coulde: for, like a man of a very kind nature, soone to take pittie of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he was full resolued not to see his owne death. And when this shepheard pushed him, bidding him to be of good cheere, it was a good while, ere we could perswade him, that <hi>Dorus</hi> was not the beare: so that he was faine to pull him out by the heeles, &amp; shew him the beast, as deade as he could wish it: which you may beleeue me, was a very ioyful sight vnto him. But then he forgate al curtesie, for he fel vpon the beast, giuing it many a manfull wound: swearing by much, it was not wel such beasts shuld be suffered in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth.

The vttermost of the good she could aspire vnto, was a mortall wound to her vexed spirits: and lastly no small part of her euils was, that she was wife to see her euils.

Or wilt thou doo me seruice, which hast alredie brought me into eternall slauerie? <hi>Zelmane</hi> then knowing well at what marke she shot, yet loth to enter into it; Most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ladie (said she) you were best retire your selfe into your lodging, that you the better may passe this sodaine fitte. Retire my selfe?

But now alas, I am forced to flie to thee for succour, whom I accuse of all my hurt; and make thee iudge of my cause, who art the onely author of my mischiefe. <hi>Zelmane</hi> the more astonished, the more she vnderstood her, Madam (said she) whereof do you accuse me, that I will not cleere my selfe? Or wherein may I steed you, that you may not command me? Alas, answered <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necia,</hi> what shall I say more? Take pitty of me, O <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> but not as <hi>Zelmane,</hi> and disguise not with me in words, as I know thou doost in apparell.</p>

               <p>Which being done, he looked verie curiously vpon himselfe, sometimes fetching a little skippe, as if he had said, his strength had not yet forsaken him. But <hi>Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> hauing in this time gotten leasure to thinke for an answere; looking vpon <hi>Gynecia,</hi> as if she thought she did her some wrong: Madam (said she) I am not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with those words of disguising, neither is it the profession of an <hi>Amazon,</hi> neither are you a partie with whom it is to be vsed. If my seruice may please you, imploy it, so long as you do me no wrong in misiudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me. Alas <hi>Zelmane</hi> (said <hi>Gynecia</hi>) I perceiue you know ful little, how percing the eyes are of a true louer.<pb facs="tcp:11334:105"/> There is no one beame of those thoughts you haue planted in me, but is able discerne a greater cloud then you doo goe in. Seeke not to conceale your selfe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from me, nor force not the passion of loue into violent extremities. Nowe was <hi>Zelmane</hi> brought to an exigent, when the king, turning his eyes that way thorow the trees, perceiued his wife and mistres togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so that framing the most louely countenance he could, he came straightway towards them; and at the first word (thanking his wife for hauing entertained <hi>Zelmane,</hi>) desired her she would now returne into the lodge, because hee had certaine matters of estate to impart to the Ladie <hi>Zelmane.</hi> The Queene (being nothing troubled with ielousie in that point) obeyed the kings commaundement; full of raging agonies, and determinatly bent, that as she would seeke all lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing meanes to winne <hi>Zelmane,</hi> so she would stirre vp terrible tragedies, rather then faile of her entent. And so went she from them to the lodge-ward, with such a battaile in her thoughts, and so deadly an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw giuen to her best resolutions, that euen her bodie (where the fielde was fought) was oppressed withall: making a languishing sicknesse waite vpon the triumph of passion; which the more it preuailed in her, the more it made her ielousie watchfull, both ouer her daughter, and <hi>Zelmane;</hi> hauing euer one of them entrusted to her owne eyes.</p>
               <p>But as soone as <hi>Basilius</hi> was ridde of his wiues pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, falling downe on his knees, O Lady (said he) which hast onely had the power to stirre vp againe those flames which had so long layn deade in me; see in me the power of your beautie; which can make<pb n="102" facs="tcp:11334:105"/> old age come to aske counsaile of youth; and a Prince vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered, to become a slaue to a stranger. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you see that power of yours, loue that at left in me, since it is yours, although of me you see nothing to be loued. Worthy Prince (answered <hi>Zelmane,</hi> taking him vp from his kneeling) both your manner, and your speech are so straunge vnto me, as I know not how to answere it better then with silence. If silence please you (said the king) it shal neuer displease me, since my heart is wholly pledged to obey you: otherwise if you would vouchsafe mine eares such happinesse, as to heare you, they shall conuary your words to such a mind, which is with the humblest degree of reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to receiue them. I disdaine not to speake to you (mightie Prince said <hi>Zelmane,</hi>) but I disdaine to speake to any matter which may bring my honor into question. And therewith, with a braue counterfeited scorne she departed from the king; leauing him not so sorie for his short answere, as proud in himself that he had broken the matter. And thus did the king (feeding his minde with those thoughts) passe great time in writing verses, &amp; making more of himselfe, then he was wont to doo: that with a little helpe, he would haue growne into a prettie kind of dotage.<label type="milestone">

For my parte, I must confesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that from a huge darkenes of sorrowes, I am crept (I cannot say to a lightsomnes, but) to a certain dawning, or rather, peeping out of some possibilitie of comfort: But woe is me, so farre from the marke of my desires, that I rather thinke it such a light, as comes through a small hole to a dungeon, that the miserable caitife may the better remember the light, of which he is depriued: or like a scholler, who is onely come to that degree of knowledge, to finde him selfe vtterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
               <p>But thus stands it with me: After that by your meanes I was exalted to serue in yonder blessed lodge, for a while I had, in the furnace of my agonies, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing; that (because of the seruice I had done in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Beare) it pleased the Princesse (in whom indeede statelines shines through courtesie) to let fall some gratious looke vpon me. Sometimes to see my<pb n="104" facs="tcp:11334:107"/> exercises, sometimes to heare my songes. For my parte, my harre woulde not suffer me to omitte any occasion, whereby I might make the incomparable <hi>Pamela,</hi> see how much extraordinarie deuotion I bare to her seruice: and withall, straue to appeare more wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rthy in her sight; that small desert, ioyned to so great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, might preuaile something in the wisest Ladie. But too well (alas) I founde, that a shepheards seruice was but considered of as from a shepheard, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation limitted to no further proportion, then of a good seruant. And when my countenance had once giuen notice, that there lay affection vnder it, I sawe straight, Maiesty (sitting in the throne of Beautie) draw foorth such a sworde of iust disdaine, that I remayned as a man thunder-striken; not daring, no not able, to beholde that power. Now, to make my estate knowen, seemed againe impossible, by reason of the suspitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of <hi>Dametas, Miso,</hi> and my young Mistresse, <hi>Mop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa.</hi> For, <hi>Dametas</hi> (according to the constitution of a dull head) thinkes no better way to shewe him selfe wife, then by suspecting euery thing in his way. Which suspition <hi>Misc</hi> (for the hoggish shrewdnesse of her braine) and <hi>Mopsa</hi> (for a very vnlikely enuie she hath stumbled vpon, against the Princesses vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able beauti) were very gladde to execute. So that I (finding my seruice by this meanes lightlie regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, my affection despised, and my selfe vnknowen) remayned no fuller of desire, then voyde of comfort how to come to my desire. Which (alas) if these trees could speak, they might well witnesse. For, many times haue I stoode here, bewailing my selfe vnto them:<pb facs="tcp:11334:108"/> many times haue I, leaning to yonder Palme, admired the blessednes of it, that coulde beare Loue without sence of paine. Many times, when my masters cattle came hether to chewe their cudde, in this fresh place, I might see the young Bull testifie his loue. But how with proud lookes, and ioyfulnes. O wretched man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (said I then to my selfe) in whom witte (which should be the gouerner of his welfare) becomes the traitor to his blessednes. These beasts, like children to nature, inherite her blessings quietly; we, like bastards, are layd abroad, euen as foundlinges to be trayned vp by griefe and sorrow. Their mindes grudge not their bodies comfort, nor their sences are letted from enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their obiects: we haue the impediments of honor, and the torments of conscience. Truely in such cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue I sometimes so long stood, that me thought my feete began to grow into the ground, with such a darkenes and heauines of minde, that I might easilie haue bene perswaded to haue resigned ouer my very essence. But Loue, (which one time layeth burthens, another time giueth wings) when I was at the lowest of my downward thoughts, pulled vp my harte to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, that nothing is atchieued before it be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie attempted; and that lying still doth neuer goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and that therefore it was time, now or neuer, to sharpen my inuention, to pearce thorow the hardnes of this enterprise; neuer ceasing to assemble al my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites, one after the other, how to manifest both my minde and estate. Till at last, I lighted and resolued on this way, which yet perchaunce you will think was a way rather to hide it.</p>

But if you will knowe what is the bande that ought to knit all these excellencies together, it is a kinde of mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to such a one, as is in his soule deuoted to those perfections. <hi>Mopsa</hi> (who already had had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine smackring towardes me) stood all this while with her hand sometimes before her face, but most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a certaine speciall grace of her owne, wagging her lips, and grinning in steede of smiling: but all the wordes I could get of her, was, wringing her waste, and thrusting out her chinne, In faith you iest with me: you are a merry man indeede. But the euer-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Pamela</hi> (that well found the Comedie would be marred, if she did not helpe <hi>Mopsa</hi> to her parte) was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to vrge a little further of me. Maister <hi>Dorus</hi> (said the faire <hi>Pamela</hi>) me thinks you blame your fortune ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wrongfully, since the fault is not in Fortune, but in you that cannot frame your selfe to your fortune: and as wrongfully do require <hi>Mopsa</hi> to so great a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to her Fathers seruaunt; since she is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be loued, that hath not some feeling of her owne worthines. I staied a good while after her words,<pb facs="tcp:11334:110"/> in hope she would haue continued her speech (so great a delight I receaued in hearing her) but seeing her say no further, (with a quaking all ouer my body) I thus answered her. Ladie, most worthie of all dutie, how falles it out that you in whom all vertue shines, will take the patronage of fortune, the onely rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous handmaide against vertue? Especially, since before your eyes, you haue a pittifull spectacle of her wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, a forlorne creature, which must remaine not such as I am, but such as she makes me, since she must be the ballance of worthinesse or disparagement. Yet alas, if the condemned man (euen at his death) haue leaue to speake, let my mortall wound purchase thus much consideration; since the perfections are such in the partie I loue, as the feeling of them cannot come into any vnnoble hart; shall that harte, which doth not onely feele them, but hath all the working of his life placed in them, shall that hart I saie, lifted vp to such a height, be counted base? O let not an excellent spirit doo it selfe such wrong, as to thinke, where it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, imbraced, and loued; there can be any vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, since the weakest mist is not easilier driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Sunne, then that is chased away with so high thoughts. I will not denie (answered the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Pamela</hi>) but that the loue you beare to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> hath brought you to the consideration of her vertues, and that consideration may haue made you the more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and so the more worthie: But euen that then (you must confesse) you haue receiued of her, and so are rather gratefully to thanke her, then to presse any further, till you bring something of your owne wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to claime it. And truely <hi>Dorus,</hi> I must in <hi>Mopsaes</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:11334:110"/> behalfe say thus much to you, that if her beauties haue so ouertaken you, it becomes a true Loue to haue your harte more set vpon her good then your owne, and to beare a tenderer respect to her honour, then your satisfaction. Now by my hallidame, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame (said <hi>Mopsa,</hi> throwing a great number of sheeps eyes vpon me) you haue euen touched mine owne minde to the quicke, forsooth. I (finding that the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie that I had vsed, had at lest wise procured thus much happinesse vnto me, as that I might euen in my Ladies presence, discouer the sore which had deepely festered within me, and that she could better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue my reasons applied to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> then she would haue vouchsafed them, whilest her selfe was a partie) thought good to pursue on my good beginning, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this fit occasion of <hi>Pameleas</hi> wit, and <hi>Mopsaes</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Therfore with an humble pearcing eye, looking vpon <hi>Pamela,</hi> as if I had rather bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by her mouth, then highly exalted by the other, turning my selfe to <hi>Mopsa,</hi> but keeping mine eye where it was, faire <hi>Mopsa</hi> (said I) well doo I finde by the wise knitting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of your answere, that any disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I can vse is asmuch too weake, as Ivnworthy. I find my loue shalbe proued no loue, without I leue to loue, being too vnfit a vessell in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so high thoughts should be engraued. Yet since the Loue I beare you, hath so ioyned it self to the best part of my life, as the one ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not depart, but that th' other will follow, before I seeke to obey you in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my last passage, let me know which is my vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, either of mind, estate, or both? <hi>Mopsa</hi> was about to say, in neither; for her hart I thinke tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled with ouer much kindnesse, when <hi>Pamela</hi> with a more fauourable<pb facs="tcp:11334:111"/>

This <hi>Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> being yet in the tendrest age, his worthy father paied to nature (with a violent death) her last dueties, leauing his childe to the faith of his friends, and the proofe of time: death gaue him not such pangs as the foresight-full care hee had of his silly successour. And yet if in his foresight he could haue seene so much, happie was that good Prince in his timely depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which barred him from the knowledge of his sonnes miseries, which his knowledge could neither haue preuented, nor relieued. The young <hi>Musidorus</hi> (being thus, as for the first pledge of the destinies good will, depriued of his principall stay) was yet for some yeares after (as if the starres would breath themselues for a greater mischiefe) lulled vp in as much good luck, as the heedfull loue of his dolefull mother, and the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing estate of his country could breed vnto him.</p>

His people (to whom all forraine matters in foretime were odious) beganne to wish in their beloued Prince, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by trauaile: his deare mother (whose eyes were held open, onely with the ioy of looking vpon him) did now dispense with the comfort of her wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhead life, desiring the same her subiectes did, for the increase of her sonnes worthinesse. And here to did <hi>Musidorus</hi> owne vertue (see how vertue can be a minister to mischiefe) sufficiently prouoke him: for<pb n="109" facs="tcp:11334:113"/> indeed thus much I must say for him, although the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our mishaps makes me presume to patterne my selfe vnto him) that well-doing was at that time his scope, from which no faint pleasure could with-hold him. But the present occasion which did knit all this togither, was his vncle the king of <hi>Macedon;</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lately before gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such victories, as were beyond expectation, did at this time send both for the Prince his sonne (brought vp togither, to auoid the warres, with <hi>Musidorus</hi>) and for <hi>Musidorus</hi> himselfe, that his ioy might be the more full, hauing such partakers of it. But alas, to what a sea of miseries my plaintfull toong doth lead me; and thus out of breath, rather with that I thought, then that I said, I stayed my speech, till <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mela</hi> shewing by countenance that such was her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, I thus continued it. These two young Princes to satisfie the king, tooke their way by sea, towards <hi>Thrace,</hi> whether they would needs go with a Nauie to succour him: he being at that time before <hi>Bizantium</hi> with a mighty Army beseeging it; where at that time his court was. But when the conspired heauens had gotten this Subiect of their wrath vpon so fit a place as the sea was, they streight began to breath out in boystrous windes some part of their malice against him; so that with the losse of all his Nauie, he onely with the Prince his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin, were cast a land, farre off from the place whether their desires would haue guided them. O cruell winds in your vnconsiderte rages, why either beganne you this furie, or why did you not end it in his end? But your cruelty was such, as you would spare his life for many deathfull torments. To tel you what pittiful mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fell to the young Prince of <hi>Macedon</hi> his cosen, I<pb facs="tcp:11334:114"/> should too much fill your eares with strange horrors; neither will I stay vpon those laborsome adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures, nor loathsome misaduentures, to which, &amp; through which his fortune and courage conducted him; My speach hastneth it self to come to the ful-point of <hi>Musidorus</hi> his infortunes.

For would you thinke it? she hath heard heretofore of vs both, by meanes of the valiant prince <hi>Plangus,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of our casting away: which she (following my owne stile) thus delicately brought foorth.

For the prince <hi>Musidorus</hi> with his cosen <hi>Pyrocles</hi> did both perish vpon the coast of <hi>Laconia;</hi> as a noble gentleman, called <hi>Plangus</hi> (who was well acquainted with the historie) did assure my father.

As for <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocles</hi> (said I) I will not denie it, but that he is perished: (which I said, least sooner suspition might arise of your being, then your selfe would haue it) and yet affirmed no lye vnto her, since I onely said, I would not deny it. But for <hi>Musidorus</hi> (said I) I perceiue indeed you haue neither heard or read the story of that vnhappy Prince; for this was the verie obiection, which that peerelesse Princesse did make vnto him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fought to appeare such as he was before her wisdome: and thus as I haue read it faire written in the certaintie of my knowledge he might answere her, that indeed the ship wherein he came, by a treason was perished, and therefore that <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> might easily be deceaued: but that he himselfe was cast vpon the coast of <hi>Laconia,</hi> where he was taken vp by a couple of shepheards, who liued in those dayes famous; for that both louing one faire maide, they yet remained constant friends; one of whose songs not long since was song before you by the shepheard <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and brought by them to a noble-mans house, neere <hi>Mantinea,</hi> whose sonne had a little before his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, bene taken prisoner, and by the helpe of this Prince, <hi>Musidorus</hi> (though naming himselfe by another name) was deliuered. Now these circumlocutions I did vse, because of the one side I knewe the Princesse would knowe well the parties I ment; and of the other, if I should haue named <hi>Strephon, Claius, Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander, <hi>and</hi> Clitophon,</hi> perhappes it would haue rubd some coniecture into the heauie heade of Mistresse <hi>Mopsa.</hi>

Besides, the Princesse must needes iudge, that no lesse then a Prince durst vndertake such an enterprise, which (though he might gette the fauour of the Princesse) he could neuer defend with lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Princes power, against the force of <hi>Arcadia.</hi> Lastly, (said he) for a certaine demonstration, he presumed to shew vnto the Princesse a marke he had on his face, as I might (said I) shew this of my neck to the rare <hi>Mopsa:</hi> and withall, shewed my necke to them both, where (as you know) there is a redde spotte, bearing figure (as they tell me) of a Lyons pawe, that she may ascertaine her selfe, that I am <hi>Menalcas</hi> brother. And so did he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching her to send some one she might trust, into <hi>Thessalia,</hi> secretely to be aduertised, whether the age, the complexion, and particularly that notable signe, did not fully agree with this Prince <hi>Musidorus.</hi> Doo you not know further (saide she, with a setled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, not accusing any kind of inwarde motion) of that storie.

All the bloud of <hi>Zelmanes</hi> body stirring in her, as wine will do when suger is hastely put into it, seeking to sucke the sweetnes of the beloued guest; her hart, like a lion new imprisoned, seeing him that restraines his libertie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the grate; not panting, but striuing violently (if it had bene possible) to haue leapt into the lappe of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea.</hi> But <hi>Dametas,</hi> euen then proceeding from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maister of a carte, to be doctor of a coach, not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle prowd in himselfe, that his whippe at that time gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the rule of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> drauc the coach (the couer<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11334:118"/> whereof was made with such ioints, that as they might (to auoid the weather) pull it vp close when they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, so when they would they might put each ende downe, and remaine as discouered &amp; open sighted as on horsebacke) till vpon the side of the forrest they had both greyhounds, spaniels, and hounds: whereof the first might seeme the Lords, the second the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and the last the Yeomen of dogges; a cast of Merlins there was besides, which flying of a gallant height ouer certaine bushes, would beate the birds (that rose) downe vnto the bushes, as Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons will doo wilde-foule ouer a riuer.

Which when once it was enacted, not onely by the comminaltie of Passions, but agreed vnto by her most noble Thoughts, and that by Reason it self (not yet experienced in the issues of such matters) had granted his royall assent; then Friendship (a diligent officer) tooke care to see the statute tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly obserued. Then grew on that not onely she did imitate the sobernes of her countenance, the graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of her speech, but euen their particular gestures: so that as <hi>Zelmane</hi> did often eye her, she would often eye <hi>Zelmane;</hi> &amp; as <hi>Zelmanes</hi> eyes would deliuer a submissiue, but vehement desire in their looke, she, though as yet she had not the desire in her, yet should her eyes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere in like pearcing kindnesse of a looke. <hi>Zelmane</hi> as much as <hi>Gynecias</hi> iealousie would suffer, desired to be neere <hi>Philoclea; Philoclea,</hi> as much as <hi>Gynecias</hi> iealousie would suffer, desired to be neere <hi>Zelmane.</hi> If <hi>Zelmane</hi> tooke her hand, and softly strained it, she also (thinking the knots of friendship ought to bee mutuall) would (with a sweete fastnes) shew she was loth to part from it. And if <hi>Zelmane</hi> sighed, she would sigh also; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> was sad, she deemed it wisdome, and therefore she would be sad too. <hi>Zelmanes</hi> la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guishing cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with croft armes, and sometimes cast-vp eyes, she thought to haue an excellent grace: and therefore she also wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly put on the same countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: til at the last (poore soule, ere she were aware) she accepted not onely the band, but the seruice; not only the signe, but the passion signified. For whether it were, that her wit in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did finde, that <hi>Zelmanes</hi> friendship was full of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent desire, hauing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordinarie limits, &amp; therefore<pb facs="tcp:11334:121"/> shee was content to second <hi>Zelmane,</hi> though herselfe knew not the limits; or that in truth, true-loue (well considered) haue an infectiue power. At last she fell in acquaintance with loues harbinger, wishing. First she would wish, that they two might liue all their liues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, like two of <hi>Dianas</hi> Nimphes. But that wish, she thought not sufficient, because she knew, there would be more Nimphes besides them, who also would haue their part in <hi>Zelmane.</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would she wish, that she were her sister, that such a natural band might make her more speciall to her. But against that, she considered, that though being her sister, if she happened to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, she should be robbed of her. Then growne bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, she would wish either her selfe, or <hi>Zelmane</hi> a man, that there might succeed a blessed marriage betwixt them. But when that wish had once displaied his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe in her minde, then followed whole squadrons of longings, that so it might be, with a maine battaile of mislikings, and repynings against their creation, that so it was not. Then dreames by night beganne to bring more vnto her, then she durst wish by day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making did make her know herselfe the better by the image of those fancies. But as some diseases when they are easie to be cured, they are hard to be knowne, but when they grow easie to be knowne, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most impossible to be cured: so the sweete <hi>Philoclea,</hi> while she might preuent it, she did not feele it, now she felt it, when it was past preuenting; like a riuer, no ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers being built against it, till alreadie it haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed. For now indeed, Loue puld of his maske, and shewed his face vnto her, and told her plainly, that shee was his prisoner. Then needed she no more paint<pb n="117" facs="tcp:11334:121"/> her face with passions; for passions shone thorow her face; Then her rosie coulor was often encreased with extraordinarie blushing: and so another time, perfect whitenesse ascended to a degree of palenesse; now hot, then cold, desiring she knew not what, nor how, if she knew what. Then her minde (though too late) by the smart was brought to thinke of the disease, and her owne proofe taught her to know her mothers minde; which (as no error giues so strong assault, as that which comes armed in the authoritie of a parent, so) greatly fortified her desires, to see, that her mother had the like desires. And the more iealous her mother was, the more she thought the Iewell precious, which was with so many lookes garded. But that preuailing so far, as to keepe the two louers from priuate conference, then began she to feele the sweetnesse of a louers soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarinesse, when freely with words and gestures, as if <hi>Zelmane</hi> were present, shee might giue passage to her thoughts, and so as it were vtter out some smoke of those flames, wherewith else she was not only burned, but smothered. As this night, that going from the one lodge to the other by her mothers commandement, with dolefull gestures and vncertaine paces, shee did willingly accept the times offer, to be a while alone: so that going a little aside into the wood; where manie times before she had delighted to walke, her eyes were saluted with a tuft of trees, so close set togither, as with the shade the moone gaue thorow it, it might breede a fearefull kinde of deuotion to looke vpon it. But true thoughts of loue banish all vaine fancie of superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Full well she did both remember and like the place; for there had she often with their shade begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<pb facs="tcp:11334:122"/> 
                  <hi>Phoebus</hi> of looking vpon her: There had she enioyed her selfe often, while she was mistresse of her selfe, and had no other thoughts, but such as might arise out of quiet senses.</p>

But at last, I pray you (said she) sweete <hi>Philoclea,</hi> let vs talke of some other thing: &amp; tell me whether you did euer see any thing so ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded as our Pastoral sports be, since that <hi>Dorus</hi> came hether?

Tell me deare sister (for the gods are my witnesses I desire to doo vertuously) can I without the detestable staine of vngratefulnesse abstaine from louing him, who (far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the beautifulnesse of his shape with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnesse of his minde, and the greatnesse of his estate with the greatnesse of his actes) is content so to abase him selfe, as to become <hi>Dametas</hi> seruaunt for my sake? you will say, but how know I him to be <hi>Musidorus,</hi> since the handmaid of wisdome is slow belief? That co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not want in me, for the nature of desire it selfe is no easier to receiue beliefe, then it is hard to ground belief.

Lastly he would haue me send to <hi>Thessalia:</hi> but truly I am not as now in mind to do my honorable Loue so much wrong, as so far to suspect him: yet poor soule knowes he no other, but that I doo both suspect, neglect, yea &amp; detest him. For euery day he finds one way or other to set forth him selfe vnto me, but all are rewarded with like coldnesse of acceptation.</p>

If you remember the ship we saw once, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sea went hie vpon the coast of <hi>Argos;</hi> so went the beast: But he (as if Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taurlike he had bene one peece with the horse) was no more moued, then one is with the going of his owne legges: and in effect so did he command him, as his owne limmes, for though he had both spurres and wande, they seemed rather markes of soueraintie, then instruments of punishment; his hand and legge (with most pleasing grace) comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding without threatning, &amp; rather reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring then chastising, at lest if sometimes he did, it was so stolen, as neyther our eyes could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it, nor the horse with any chaunce did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of it, he euer going so iust with the horse, either foorth right, or turning, that it seemed as he borrowed the horses body, so he lent the horse his minde: in the turning one might perceiue the bridle-hand somthing gently stir, but indeed so gently, as it did rather distill vertue, then vse violence. Him self (which me thinkes is straunge) shewing at one instant both steadines &amp; nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes; somtimes making him turne close to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,<pb facs="tcp:11334:127"/> like a cat, when scratchingly she wheeles about after a mouse: sometimes with a little more rising before, now like a Rauen leaping from ridge to ridge, then like one of <hi>Dametas</hi> kiddes bound ouer the hillocks: and all so done, as neither the lustie kinde shewed any roughnesse, nor the easier any idlenesse: but still like a well obeyed maister, whose becke is enough for a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, euer concluding ech thing he did with his face to me-wards, as if thence came not onely the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but ending of his motions. The sporte was to see <hi>Dametas,</hi> how he was tost from the sadle to the mane of the horse, and thence to the ground, giuing his gay apparell almost as foule an outside, as it had an inside. But as before he had euer said, he wanted but horse &amp; apparell to be as braue a courtier as the best, so now brused with proofe, he proclaimed it a folly for a man of wisedome, to put himselfe vnder the tuition of a beast; so as <hi>Dorus</hi> was fayne alone to take the Ringe. Wherein truely at lest my womanish eyes could not discerne, but that taking his staffe from his thigh, the descending it a little downe, the getting of it vp into the rest, the letting of the point fall, and taking the ring was but all one motion, at lest (if they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers motions) they did so stealingly slippe one into another, as the latter parte was euer in hande, before the eye could discerne the former was ended.

Tell me (sweet <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea</hi>) did you euer see such a shepheard? tell me, did you euer heare of such a Prince? And then tell me, if a small or vnworthy assaulte haue conquered me. Truely I would hate my life, if I thought vanitie led me. But since my parents deale so cruelly with me, it is time for me to trust something to my owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

For they hauing the power of kinges, but not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of kings, vsed the authority as men do their farms, of which they see within a yeere they shal goe out: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Kinges sworde strike whom they hated, the Kings purse reward whom they loued: and (which is worst of all) making the Royall countenance serue to vndermine the Royall soueraintie. For the Subiectes could taste no sweeter fruites of hauing a King, then grieuous taxations to serue vaine purposes; Lawes made rather to finde faults, then to preuent faultes: the Court of a Prince rather deemed as a priuiledged place of vnbrideled licentiousnes, then as a biding of him, who as a father, should giue a fatherly example vnto his people. Hence grew a very dissolution of all estates, while the great men (by the nature of ambition neuer satisfied) grew factious among themselues: and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlings, glad indeede to be vnderlings to them they hated left, to preserue them from such they hated most. Men of vertue suppressed, lest their shining should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the others filthines; and at length vertue it selfe almost forgotten, when it had no hopefull end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto to be directed; olde men long nusled in corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, scorning them that would seeke reformation; yong men very fault-finding, but very faultie: and so to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanglenes both of manners, apparrell, and each thing<pb facs="tcp:11334:132"/> els, by the custome of selfe-guiltie euill, glad to change though oft for a worse; marchandise abused, and so townes decayed for want of iust and naturall libertie; offices, euen of iudging soules, solde; publique defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neglected; and in summe, (left too long I trouble you) all awrie, and (which wried it to the most wrie course of all) witte abused, rather to faine reason why it should be amisse, then how it should be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

But so soone as some fewe (but in deede notable) examples, had thundred a duetie into the subiects hartes, he soone shewed, no basenes of sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, nor the basest basenes of enuie, could any whit rule such a Ruler. But then shined foorth indeede all loue among them, when an awfull feare, ingendred by iustice, did make that loue most louely: his first &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall care being to appeare vnto his people, such as he would haue them be, &amp; to be such as he appeared; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his life the example of his lawes, as it were; his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions arising out of his deedes. So that within small<pb n="128" facs="tcp:11334:132"/> time, he wanne a singular loue in his people, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grassed singular confidence. For how could they chuse but loue him, whom they found so truely to loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? He euen in reason disdayning, that they that haue charge of beastes, should loue their charge, and care for them; and that he that was to gouerne the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creature, should not loue so noble a charge. And therefore, where most Princes (seduced by flatterie to builde vpon false grounds of gouernment) make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues (as it were) another thing from the people; and so count it gaine what they can get from them: and (as if it were two counter-ballances, that their estate goes hiest when the people goes lowest) by a fallacie of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument thinking themselues most Kinges, when the subiect is most basely subiected: he contrariwise, vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie and wisely acknowledgeing, that he with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made all but one politike bodie, whereof himselfe was the head; euen so cared for them, as he woulde for his owne limmes: neuer restrayning their liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it stretched to licenciousnes, norpulling from them their goods, which they found were not imployed to the purchase of a greater good: but in all his actions shewing a delight to their welfare, broght that to passe, that while by force he tooke nothing, by their loue he had all. In summe (peerelesse Princesse) I might as easily sette downe the whole Arte of gouernement, as to lay before your eyes the picture of his proceedings. But in such forte he flourished in the sweete comforte of dooing much good, when by an action of leauing his Countrie, he was forced to bring foorth his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of magnanimitie, as before he had done of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>

For forthwith the windes began to speake lowder, and as in a tumultuous kingdome, to thinke themselues fittest instruments of commaundement; and blowing whole stormes of hayle and raine vpon them, they were soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in daunger, then they coulde almost bethinke themselues of chaunge. For then the traiterous Sea began to swell in pride against the afflicted Nauie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which (while the heauen fauoured them) it had layne so calmely, making mountaines of it selfe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which the tossed and tottring ship shoulde clime, to be streight carried downe againe to a pit of hellish darkenesse; with such cruell blowes against the sides of the shippe (that which way soeuer it went, was still in his malice) that there was left neither power to stay, nor way to escape. And shortly had it so diffeuered the louing companie, which the daie before had tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together, that most of them neuer met againe,<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11334:136"/> but were swallowed vp in his neuer-satisfied mouth. Some indeed (as since was knowne) after long wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring returned into <hi>Thessalia;</hi> other recouered <hi>Bizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> and serued <hi>Euarchus</hi> in his warre. But in the ship wherein the Princes were (now left as much alone as proud Lords be when fortune fails them) though they employed all industrie to saue themselues, yet what they did was rather for dutie to nature, then hope to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape. So ougly a darkenesse, as if it would preuent the nights comming, vsurped the dayes right: which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied sometimes with thunders, alwayes with horrible noyses of the chasing winds) made the masters and pilors so astonished, that they knew not how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and if they knew they could scarcely (when they directed) heare their owne whistle. For the sea straue with the winds which should be lowder, &amp; the shrouds of the ship with a ghastful noise to them that were in it, witnessed, that their ruine was the wager of the others contention, and the heauen roaring out thunders the more amazed them, as hauing those powers for eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Certainely there is no daunger carries with it more horror, then that which growes in those flowing kingdomes. For that dwelling place is vnnaturall to mankind, and then the terriblenesse of the continuall motion, the dissolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fare being from comfort, the eye and the eare hauing ougly images euer before it, doth still vex the minde, euen when it is best armed against it. But thus the day past (if that might be called a day) while the cunningest mariners were so conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the storme, as they thought it best with stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sailes to yeelde to be gouerned by it: the valian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test feeling inward dismayednesse, and yet the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest<pb facs="tcp:11334:137"/> ashamed fully to shew it, seeing that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (who were to parte from the greatest fortunes) did in their countenances accuse no point of feare, but encouraging them to doo what might be done (put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their handes to euerie most painefull office) taught them at one instant to promise themselues the best, and yet not to despise the worst. But so were they carryed by the tyrannie of the winde, and the treason of the sea, all that night, which the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it was, the more wayward it shewed it selfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: till the next morning (knowne to be a morning better by the houre-glasse, then by the day cleerenesse) hauing runne fortune as blindly, as it selfe euer was painted, lest the conclusion should not aunswere to the rest of the play, they were driuen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rocke: which hidden with those outragious waues, did, as it were, closely dissemble his cruel mind, till with an vnbeleeued violence (but to them that haue tried it) the shippe ranne vpon it; and seeming willinger to perish then to haue her course stayed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled her blowes, till she had broken her selfe in peeces; and as it were tearing out her owne bowels to feede the seas greedinesse, left nothing within it but despaire of safetie, and expectation of a loathsome end. There was to be seene the diuerse manner of minds in distresse: some sate vpon the toppe of the poupe wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and wailing, till the sea swallowed them; some one more able to abide death, then feare of death, cut his owne throate to preuent drowning; some prayed, and there wanted not of them which cursed, as if the heauens could not be more angrie then they were. But a monstrous crie begotten of manie roaring<pb n="133" facs="tcp:11334:137"/> vowes, was able to infect with feare a minde that had not preuented it with the power of reason.</p>

But the peece they were on sinking by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vnder them, not able to support the weight of so manie, the brethren (the elder whereof was <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus,</hi> the younger <hi>Nelsus</hi>) shewed themselues right faithfull and gratefull seruants vnto them; gratefull (I say) for this cause: Those two gentlemen had bene taken prisoners in the great warre the king of <hi>Phrygia</hi> made vpon <hi>Thessalia,</hi> in the time of <hi>Musidorus</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie; and hauing beene solde into another countrie (though peace fell after betweene these Realmes) could not be deliuered, because of their valor knowne, but for a farre greater summe, then either all their friends were able, or the Dowager willing to make, in respect of the great expences her selfe and people had bene put to in those warres; and so had they remained in prison about thirteene yeares, when the two young Princes (hearing speaches of thier good deserts) found meanes both by selling all the Iewels they had of great price, and by giuing vnder their hands great estates when they should come to be Kings (which promises their vertue promised for them should be kept) to get<pb facs="tcp:11334:138"/> so much treasure as redeemed them from captiuitie. This remembred, and kindly remembred by these two brothers, perchance helped by a naturall duetie to their Princes blood, they willingly left holde of the boord, committing themselues to the seas rage, &amp; euen when they went to dye, themselues praying for the Princes liues. It is true, that neither the paine nor daunger, so moued the Princes hartes as the tendernesse of that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing part, farre from glorie, hauing so few lookers on; farre from hope of reward, since themselues were sure to perish.</p>

For hauing quite loste the way of noblenes, he straue to clime to the height of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riblenes; and thinking to make all men adread, to make such one an enemie, who would not spare, nor feare to kill so great a Prince; and lastly, hauing nothing in him why to make him his friend, thought, he woulde make him away, for being his enemie. The day was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all things appointed for that cruell blow, in so solemne an order, as if they would set foorth tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny in most gorgeous decking.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> But so it fell out that his death was preuented by a rare example of friendshippe in <hi>Musidorus:</hi> who being almost drowned, had bene taken vp by a Fisherman belonging to the kingdome of <hi>Pontus;</hi> and being there, and vnderstanding the full discourse (as Fame was very prodigall of so notable an accident) in what case <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> was; learning withall, that his hate was farre more to him then to <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> he founde meanes to acquaint him selfe with a noble-man of that Countrie, to whom largely discouering what he was, he found him a most fitte instrument to effectuate his desire. For this noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had bene one, who in many warres had serued <hi>Euarchus,</hi> and had bene so mind-striken by the beautie of vertue in that noble King, that (though not borne his Subiect) he euen profeste himselfe his seruaunt.

                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:11334:140"/> in a strong Castle of his, and then to make the King of <hi>Phrygia</hi> vnderstande, that if he would deliuer <hi>Pyrocles, Musidorus</hi> woulde willingly put him selfe into his handes: knowing well, that how thirstie so euer he was of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> bloud, he woulde rather drinke that of <hi>Musidorus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nobleman was loath to preserue one by the losse of another, but time vrging resolution: the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of <hi>Musidorus</hi> (who shewed a minde not to ouer-liue <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) with the affection he bare to <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> so preuayled, that he carried this strange offer of <hi>Musidorus,</hi> which by that Tyrant was greedelie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
               <p>And so vpon securitie of both sides, they were <label type="milestone">

Where I may not omitte that worke of friendshippe in <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> who both in speache and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance to <hi>Musidorus,</hi> well shewed, that he thought himselfe iniured, and not releeued by him: asking him, what he had euerseene in him, why he could not beare the extremities of mortall accidentes as well as any man? and why he shoulde enuie him the glorie of suffering death for his friendes cause, and (as it were) robbe him of his owne possession? But in this notable contention, (where the conquest must be the conquerers destruction, and safetie the punishment of the conquered) <hi>Musidorus</hi> preuayled: because he was a more welcome prize to the vniuste King, that wisht none well, to them worse then others, and to him worste of all: and as chearefully going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, as <hi>Pyrocles</hi> went frowardly fromwarde his death, he was deliuered to the King, who could not be inough sure of him, without he fed his owne eies vpon<pb facs="tcp:11334:141"/> one, whom he had begon to feare, as soone as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther began to be.</p>

And so the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, he was led foorth by many armed men (who often had beene the fortifiers of wickednes) to the place of execution: where comming with a mind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in that he had done such seruice to <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> this strange encounter he had.</p>

And (finding he could get in that countrie no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sufficient by force to rescue him) to bring himselfe to die with him, (little hoping of better euent) he put himselfe in poore rayment, and by the helpe of some few crownes he tooke of that noble-man, (who full of sorrow, though not knowing the secrete of his intent, suffered him to goe in such order from him) he (euen he, born to the greatest expectation, and of the greatest bloud that any Prince might be) submitted himselfe to be seruant to the executioner that should put to death <hi>Musidorus:</hi> a farre notabler proofe of his friendship, considering the height of his minde, then any death could be. That bad officer not suspecting him, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raied fit for such an estate, &amp; hauing his beautie hidden<pb n="137" facs="tcp:11334:141"/> by many foule spots he artificially put vpon his face, gaue him leaue not onely to weare a sworde himselfe, to beare his sworde prepared for the iustified mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

In truth, neuer ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betweene ioy before know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what to be glad of, and feare after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering his cafe, had such a confusion of thoughts, as I had, when I saw <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> so neare me. But with that <hi>Dorus</hi> blushed, and <hi>Pamela</hi> smiled: and <hi>Dorus</hi> the more blushed at her smiling, and she the more smiled at his blushing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had (with the remembraunce of that plight was in) forgotten in speaking of him selfe to vse the therd person. But <hi>Musidorus</hi> turned againe her thoughts from his cheekes to his tongue in this forte: But (said he) when they were with swordes in handes, not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning backes one to the other (for there they knew was place of defence) but making that a preseruation in nothoping to be preserued, and now acknowledging themselues subiect to death, meaning onely to do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to their princely birth, they flew amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all (for all were enimies) &amp; had quickly either with flight or death, left none vpon the scaffolde to annoy them.

But the King with angry threatnings from-out a window (where he was not ashamed, the worlde should behold him a beholder) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his garde, and the rest of his souldiers to hasten their death. But many of them lost their bodies to loose their soules, when the Princes grew almost so weary, as they were ready to be conquered with conquering.</p>

But he (as many times it falls out) onely valiant, when he was angrie, in reuenge thrust him through: which with his death was streight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged by a brother of his: and that againe requited by a fellow of the others. There began to be a great tumult amongst the souldiers; which seene, and not vnderstood by the people (vsed to feares but not vsed to be bolde in them) some began to crie treason; and that voice streight multiplying it selfe, the King (O the cowardise of a guiltie conscience) before any man set vpon him, fled away. Where-with a bruit (either by arte of some well meaning men, or by such chaunce as such thinges often fall out by) ran from one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the King was slaine; wherwith certaine yong men of the brauest minds, cried with lowde voice, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; and encouraging the other Citizens to follow<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11334:142"/> them, set vpon the garde, and souldiers as chiefe instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Tyrannie: and quickly, aided by the Princes, They had left none of them aliue, nor any other in the cittie, who they thought had in any sorte set his hand to the worke of their seruitude, and (God knowes) by the blindnesse of rage, killing many guiltles persons, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for affinity to the Tyrant, or enmitie to the tyrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killers. But some of the wisest (seeing that a popular li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is indeede the many-headed tyranny) preuailed with the rest to make <hi>Musidorus</hi> their chiefe: choosing one of them (because Princes) to defende them, and him because elder and most hated of the Tyrant, and by him to be ruled: whom foorthwith they lifted vp, fortune (I thinke) smiling at her worke therein, that a scaffold of execution should grow a scaffold of coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

Which was the more euident to them; because it sodainly fell from an excesse offauor, which (many examples hauing taught<pb n="141" facs="tcp:11334:145"/> them) neuer stopt his race till it came to an headlong ouerthrow: they full of rage, retyred themselues vnto this castle. Where thinking nothing iuster the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reuenge, nor more noble then the effects of anger, that (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature) ful of inward brauery and fiercenes, scarcely in the glasse of Reason, thinking it self faire, but when it is terrible, they immediately gaue themselues to make all the countrie about them (subiect to that King) to smart for their Lords folly: not caring how innocent they were, but rather thinking the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent they were, the more it testified their spite, which they desired to manifest. And with vse of euill, growing more and more euill, they tooke delight in slaughter, and pleasing themselues in making others wracke the effect of their power: so that where in the time that they obeyed a master, their anger was a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable power of the minde to doo publike good; so now vnbridled, and blinde iudge of it selfe, it made wickednesse violent, and praised it selfe in excellencie of mischiefe; almost to the ruine of the countrie, not greatly regarded by their carelesse and louelesse king. Till now these Princes finding them so fleshed in cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as not to be reclaimed, secreatly vndertooke the matter alone: for accompanied they would not haue suffered them to haue mounted; and so those great fellowes scornefully receiuing them, as foolish birds falne into their net, it pleased the eternall iustice to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suffer death by their hands: So as they were manifold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged the sauers of that countrie.</p>

These dolefull speeches, and some others to like purpose (well shewing they had not bene borne to the fortune they were in,) moued the Princes to goe out vnto them, and aske the younger what they were? Sirs (answered he, with a good grace, and made the more agreable by a certaine noble kinde of pitiousnes) I see well you are straungers, that know not our miserie so well here knowne, that no man dare know, but that we must be miserable.

And if thou doest it to spare my eares, (the onely sense nowe left me proper for knowledge) assure thy selfe thou dost mistake me. And I take witnesse of that Sunne which you see (with that he cast vp his blinde eyes, as if he would hunt for light,) and wish my selfe in worse case then I do wish my selfe, which is as euill as may be, if I speake vntruely; that nothing is so welcome to my thoughts, as the publishing of my shame. Therefore know you Gentlemen (to whom from my harte I wish that it may not proue ominous foretoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of misfortune<pb facs="tcp:11334:148"/> to haue mette with such a miser as I am) that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my sonne (ô God, that trueth binds me to reproch him with the name of my sonne) hath said, is true. But besides those truthes, this also is true, that hauing had in lawful mariage, of a mother fitte to beare royall chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, this sonne (such one as partly you see, and better shall knowe by my shorte declaration) and so enioyed the expectations in the world of him, till he was growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to iustifie their expectations (so as I needed enuie no father for the chiefe comfort of mortalitie, to leaue an other ones-selfe after me) I was caried by a bastarde sonne of mine (if at least I be bounde to beleeue the words of that base woman my concubine, his mother) first to mislike, then to hate, lastly to destroy, to doo my best to destroy, this sonne (I thinke you thinke) vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing destruction. What waies he vsed to bring me to it, if I should tell you, I should tediously trouble you with as much poysonous hypocrisie, desperate fraude, smoothe malice, hidden ambition, &amp; smiling enuie, as in any liuing person could be harbored. But I list it not, no remembrance, (no, of naughtines) delights me, but mine own; &amp; me thinks, the accusing his traines might in some manner excuse my fault, which certainly I loth to doo. But the conclusion is, that I gaue order to some seruants of mine, whom I thought as apte for such cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities as my selfe, to leade him out into a forrest, &amp; there to kill him.</p>
               <p>But those theeues (better natured to my sonne then my selfe) spared his life, letting him goe, to learne to liue poorely: which he did, giuing himselfe to be a priuate souldier, in a countrie here by. But as he was redy to be greatly aduaunced for some noble pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<pb n="144" facs="tcp:11334:148"/> of seruice which he did, he hearde newes of me: who (dronke in my affection to that vnlawfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall sonne of mine) suffered my self so to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him, that all fauors and punishments passed by him, all offices, and places of importance, distributed to his fauourites; so that ere I was aware, I had left my self nothing but the name of a King: which he shortly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of too, with many indignities (if any thing may be called an indignity, which was laid vpon me) threw me out of my feat, and put out my eies; and then (proud in his tyrannie) let me goe, nether imprisoning, nor killing me: but rather delighting to make me feele my miserie; miserie indeed, if euer there were any; full of wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, fuller of disgrace, and fullest of guiltines. And as he came to the crowne by so vniust meanes, as vniustlie he kept it, by force of stranger souldiers in <hi>Cittadels,</hi> the nestes of tyranny, &amp; murderers of libertie; disarming all his own countrimen, that no man durst shew himself a wel-willer of mine: to say the trueth (I think) few of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being so (considering my cruell follie to my good sonne, and foolish kindnes to my vnkinde bastard:) but if there were any who fell to pitie of so great a fall, and had yet any sparkes of vnstained duety lefte in them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me, yet durst they not shewe it, scarcely with giuing me almes at their doores; which yet was the onelie sustenaunce of my distressed life, no bodie daring to shewe so much charitie, as to lende me a hande to guide my darke steppes: Till this sonne of mine (God knowes, woorthie of a more vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and more fortunate father) forgetting my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable wrongs, not recking danger, &amp; neglecting the present good way he was in doing himselfe good,<pb facs="tcp:11334:149"/> came hether to doo this kind office you see him performe towards me, to my vnspeakable griefe; not onely because his kindnes is a glasse eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to my blind eyes, of my naughtines, but that aboue all griefes, it greeues me he should desperatly aduenture the losse of his souldeseruing life for mine, that yet owe more to fortune for my deserts, as if he would cary mudde in a chest of christall. For well I know, he that now raigneth, how much soeuer (and with good reason) he despiseth me, of all men despised; yet he will not let slippe any aduantage to make away him, whose iust title (ennobled by courage and goodnes) may one day shake the seate of a neuer secure tyrannie. And for this cause I craued of him to leade me to the toppe of this rocke, indeede I must confesse, with meaning to free him from so Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine a companion as I am. But he finding what I purposed, onely therein since he was borne, shewed himselfe disobedient vnto me. And now Gentlemen, you haue the true storie, which I pray you publish to the world, that my mischieuous proceedinges may be the glorie of his filiall pietie, the onely reward now left for so great a merite. And if it may be, let me obtaine that of you, which my sonne denies me: for neuer was there more pity in sauing any, then in ending me; both because therein my agonies shall ende, and so shall you preserue this excellent young man, who els wilfully fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes his owne ruine.</p>

But bringing vp (rather then choise) hauing first knit their minds vnto him, (indeed crastie inough, eyther to hide his faultes, or neuer to shew them, but when they might pay home) they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly held out the course, rather to satisfie him, then al the world; and rather to be good friendes, then good men: so as though they did not like the euill he did, yet they liked him that did the euill; and though not councellors of the offence, yet protectors of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Now they hauing heard of this sodaine going out, with so small a company, in a country full of euil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishing minds toward him (though they knew not the cause) followed him; till they found him in such case as they were to venture their liues, or else he to loose his: which they did with such force of minde and bodie, that truly I may iustly say, <hi>Pyrocles &amp; Musidorus</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer till then found any, that could make them so well repeate their hardest lesson in the feates of armes.

               <p>But as <hi>Zelmane</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the latter end of her song, she might see the same water-spaniell which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, come and fetch away one of <hi>Philocleas</hi> gloues; whose fine proportion, shewed well what a daintie guest was wont there to be lodged. It was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to <hi>Zelmane,</hi> to see that the dogge was therewith delighted, and so let him goe a little way withall, who<pb n="153" facs="tcp:11334:157"/> quickly caried it out of sight among certaine trees and bushes, which were very close together. But by &amp; by he came againe, &amp; amongst the raiments (<hi>Miso</hi> and <hi>Mopsa</hi> being preparing sheets against their comming out) the dog lighted vpon a little booke of foure or fiue leaues of paper, &amp; was bearing that away to. But then <hi>Zelmane</hi> (not knowing what importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it might be of) ran after the dog, who going streight to those bushes, she might see the dog deliuer it to a Gentleman who secretly lay there. But she hastily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in, the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman rose vp, &amp; with a courteous (though sad) countenance presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe vnto her. <hi>Zelmanes</hi> eies streight willed her mind to marke him: for she thought, in her life she had neuer seene a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a more goodly presence, in whom strong making tooke not away delicacie, nor beautie fiercenesse: being indeed such a right man like man, as Nature often erring, yet shewes she would faine make. But when she had a while (not without admiration) vewed him, she desired him to deliuer backe the gloue &amp; paper, because they were the Ladie <hi>Philocleas;</hi> telling him withall, that she would not willingly let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know of his close lying in that prohibited place, while they were bathing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues; because she knew they would be mortally offended withall. Faire Ladie (answered he) the worst of the complaint is already passed, since I feele of my fault in my self the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But for these things I assure you, it was my dogs wanton boldnesse, not my presumption. With that he gaue her backe the paper: But for the gloue (said he) since it is my Ladie <hi>Philocleas,</hi> giue me leaue to keepe it, since my hart ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not persuade it selfe to part from it. And I pray you tell the Lady (Lady indeed of all my desires) that owes it, that<pb facs="tcp:11334:158"/> I will direct my life to honour this gloue with seruing her. O villain (cried out <hi>Zelmane,</hi> madded with finding an vnlooked-for Riuall, and that he would make her a messenger) dispatch (said she) and deliuer it, or by the life of her that owes it, I wil make thy soul (though too base a price) pay for it. And with that drewe out her sworde, which (<hi>Amazon</hi>-like) she euer ware about her. The Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> retired himself into an open place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the bushes; &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drawing out his too, he offred to deliuer it vnto her, saying withall, God forbid I should vse my sworde against you, since (if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued) you are the same famous <hi>Amazon,</hi> that both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended my Ladies iust title of beautie against the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Phalantus,</hi> &amp; saued her life in killing the Lion; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am rather to kisse your hands, with acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging my selfe bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to obey you. But this courtesie was worse then a bastonado to <hi>Zelmane:</hi> so that againe with ragefull eyes she bad him defend himselfe, for no lesse then his life should answere it. A hard case (said he) to teach my sworde that lesson, which hath euer vsed to turne it self to a shield in a Ladies presence. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> harkening to no more wordes, began with such wittie furie to pursue him with blowes &amp; thrusts, that Nature &amp; Vertue commanded the Gentleman to looke to his safetie. Yet stil courtesie, that seemed incorporate in his hart, would not be perswaded by daunger to offer any offence, but only to stand vpon the best defensiue gard he could; somtimes going backe, being content in that respect to take on the figure of cowardise; sometime with strong and well-met wards; sometime cunning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoidings of his body; and sometimes faining some blowes, which himself puld backe before they needed<pb n="154" facs="tcp:11334:158"/> to be with stood. And so with play did he a good while fight against the fight of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> who (more spited with that curtesie, that one that did nothing should be able to resist her) burned away with choller any moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which might grow out of her owne sweet disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, determining to kill him if he fought no better; &amp; so redoubling her blowes, draue the stranger to no other shift, then to warde, and go backe; at that time seeming the image of innocencie against violence. But at length he found, that both in publike and priuate respectes, who standes onely vpon defence, stands vpon no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: For <hi>Zelmane</hi> seeming to strike at his head, and he going to warde it, withall stept backe as he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed, she stopt her blow in the aire, and suddenly turning the point, ranne full at his breast; so as he was driuen with the pommell of his sworde (hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weapon of defence) to beate it downe: but the thrust was so strong, that he could not so wholy beate it awaie, but that it met with his thigh, thorow which it ranne. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> retiring her sworde, and seeing his bloud, victorious anger was conquered by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-conquered pittie; and hartily sorie, and euen asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with her selfe she was, considering how little he had done, who well she found could haue done more. In so much that she said, truly I am forie for your hurt, but your selfe gaue the cause, both in refusing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the gloue, and yet not fighting as I knowe you could haue done. But (said shee) because I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue you disdayne to fight with a woman, it may be before a yeare come about, you shall meete with a neere kinsman of mine, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> Prince of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and I giue you my worde, he for me shall maintaine<pb facs="tcp:11334:159"/> this quarell against you. I would (answered <hi>Amphialus</hi>) I had many more such hurtes to meete and know that worthy Prince, whose vertue I loue &amp; admire, though my good destiny hath not bene to see his person.</p>

Now so euill could she conceale her fire, and so wilfully perseuered she in it, that her father offering her the mariage of the great <hi>Tiridates,</hi> king of <hi>Armenia</hi> (who desired her more then the ioyes of heauen) she for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphilus</hi>-sake refused it.

But nether she liked perswasions, nor feared threateninges, nor changed for absence: and when she thought him<pb n="160" facs="tcp:11334:164"/> dead, she sought all meanes (as well by poyson as by knife) to send her soule, at least, to be maried in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall church with him. This so brake the tender fathers hart, that (leauing things as he found them) he shortly after died.

So it was agreed vpon; and against <hi>Pyrocles</hi> was <hi>Euardes,</hi> King of <hi>Bithinia; Barzanes</hi> of <hi>Hircania,</hi> against<pb n="161" facs="tcp:11334:165"/>

               </p>
               <p>Then lo if <hi>Cupid</hi> be a God, or that the tyranny of our <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>6</label> own thoughts seeme as a God vnto vs. But whatsoeuer it was, then it did set foorth the miserablenes of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes: she being drawne to two contraries by one cause. For the loue of him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded her to yeeld to no other: the loue of him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to preserue his life: which knot might well be cut, but vntied it could not be. So that Loue in her passions (like a right makebate) whispered to both sides arguments of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. What (said he of the one side) doost thou loue <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> Ô <hi>Erona?</hi> and shal <hi>Tiridates</hi> enioy thy bodie; with what eyes wilt thou looke vpon <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> when he shall know that another possesseth thee? But if thou wilt do it, canst thou do it? canst thou force thy hart? Thinke with thy selfe, if this man haue thee, thou shalt neu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>er haue more part of <hi>Antiphilus</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he were dead.<pb facs="tcp:11334:166"/> But thus much more, that the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shalbe gnawing, &amp; the remorse still present. Death perhaps will coole the rage of thy affection: where thus, thou shalt euer loue, and euer lacke. Thinke this beside, if thou marrie <hi>Tiridates, Antiphilus</hi> is so excellent a man, that long he cannot be from being in some high place maried:canst thou suffer that too? If an other kill him, he doth him the wrong: if thou abuse thy body, thou doost him the wrong. His death is a worke of nature, and either now, or at another time he shall die. But it shalbe thy worke, thy shamefull worke, which is in thy power to shun, to make him liue to see thy faith falsified, and his bed defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But when Loue had well kindled that parte of her thoughts, then went he to the other side. What (said he) O <hi>Erona,</hi> and is thy Loue of <hi>Antiphilus</hi> come to that point, as thou doost now make it a question, whether he shall die, or no? O excellent affection, which for too much loue, will see his head of. Marke well the reasons of the other side, and thou shalt see, it is but loue of thy selfe which so disputeth. Thou canst not abide <hi>Tirida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> this is but loue of thy selfe: thou shalt be ashamed to looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him afterward; this is but feare of shame, &amp; loue of thy selfe: thou shalt want him as much then; this is but loue of thy selfe: he shalbe married; if he be well, why should that grieue thee, but for loue of thy selfe? No, no, pronounce these wordes if thou canst, let <hi>Antiphilus</hi> die. Then the images of each side stood before her vnderstanding; one time she thought she saw <hi>Antiphilus</hi> dying: an other time she thought <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> faw her by <hi>Tiridates</hi> enioyed: twenty times cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for a seruaunt to carry message of yeelding, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came the minde was altered. She blusht when she considered the effect of granting; she was pale, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:11334:166"/> she reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred the fruits of denial. As for weeping, sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wringing her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; tearing her haire, were indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of both sides. Easily she wold haue agreed to haue broken al disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with her owne death, but that the feare of <hi>Antiphilus</hi> furder torments staied her. At le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the euening before the day apointed of his death, the determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of yeelding preuailed, especially, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a message of <hi>Antiphilus;</hi> who with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuring termes he could deuise, besought her to saue his life, vpon any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition. But she had no sooner sent her messenger to <hi>Tiridates,</hi> but her mind changed, and she went to the two yong Princes, <hi>Pyrocles</hi> &amp; <hi>Musidorus,</hi> &amp; falling downe at their feet, desired the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to trie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some way for her deliuerance; shewing her selfe resolued, not to ouer-liue <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> nor yet to yeeld to <hi>Tiridates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that knew not what she had done in priuate,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>7</label> prepared that night accordingly: &amp; as sometimes it fals out, that what is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancy, seemes cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning; so did this cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge indeed stand in as good steed as a witty diffimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And I cannot tell you how, by what deuise (though <hi>Plangus</hi> at large described it) the conclusion was, the wonderfull valour of the two Princes so preuailed, that <hi>Antiphilus</hi> was succoured, and the King slaine. <hi>Plangus</hi> was then the chiefe man left in the campe; and therefore seeing no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied in safety into her country <hi>Artaxia,</hi> now Queene of <hi>Armenia;</hi> who with truelame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tations, made,<label type="milestone">

I remember full well it stood in the lane as you go to the Barbers shop, all the towne knew her, there was a great losse of her: she called me to her, and taking first a soppe of wine to comfort her hart (it was of the same wine that comes out of <hi>Candia,</hi> which we pay so deere for now a daies, and in that good worlde was very good cheape) she cald me to her; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion said she, (indeed I was a pretie one in those daies thongh I say it) I see a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of lads that loue you; Wel (said she) I say no more: doo you know what Loue is? With that she brought me into a corner, where ther was painted a foule fie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d I trow: for he had a paire of hornes like a Bull, his feete clouen, as many eyes vpon his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as my gray-mare hath dappels, &amp; for all the world so placed. This mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ster fat like a ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gman vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a paire of gallowes, in his right hand he was painted holding a crowne of Laurell, in his left hand a purse of mony, &amp; out of his mouth honge a lace of two faire pictures, of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; such a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance he shewed, as if he<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11334:168"/> would perswade folks by those alureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; be hanged. I, like a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der harted wench, skriked out for feare of the diuell. Well (sayd she) this fame is euen Loue: therefore do what thou list with all those fellowes, one after another; &amp; it recks not much what they do to thee, so it be in secreat; but vpon my charge, neuer loue none of them. Why mother (said I) could such a thing come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the belly of the faire <hi>Fenus</hi>? for a few dayes before, our (priest betweene him &amp; me) had tolde me the whole storie of <hi>Venus.</hi> Tush (said she) they are all deceaued: and therewith gaue me this Booke, which she said a great maker of bailets had giuen to an old painter, who for a litle pleasure, had bestowed both booke and picture of her.

And so she gaue me this Booke, &amp; there now you may reade it. With that the remembrance of the good old woman, made her make such a face to weepe, as if it were not sorrow, it was the carkasse of sorrow that appeared there. But while her teares came out, like raine falling vpon durtie furrowes, the latter end of her praier booke was read among these Ladies, which contained this.</p>

Noble Lady (answered she, beautifying her face with a sweete smiling, and the sweetnes of her smiling with the beautie of her face) since I am borne a Princes daughter, let me not giue example of disobedience. My gouernesse will haue vs draw cuts, and therefore I pray you let vs do so: and so perhaps it will light vpon you to entertaine this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with some storie of your owne; and it is reason our eares should be willinger to heare, as your tongue is abler to deliuer.

In time past (sayd she) there
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> was a King, the mightiest man in all his country, that had by his wife, the fairest daughter that euer did eate pappe. Now this King did keepe a great house, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body might come and take their meat freely. So one day, as his daughter was sitting in her window, playing vpon a harpe, as sweete as any Rose; and combing her head with a combe all of precious stones, there came in a Knight into the court, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a goodly horse, one haire of gold, &amp; the other of siluer; <hi>and so</hi> Knight casting vp his eyes to the window, did fall into such loue with her, that he grew not worth the bread he eate; till many a sorry day going ouer his head, with Dayly Diligence and Grisly Grones, he wan her affection, so that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to run away togither. <hi>And so in May, when all true hartes reioyce,</hi> they stale out of the Castel, without stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much as for their breakfast. Now forsooth, as they went togither, often all to kissing one another, the Knight told her, he was brought vp among the water Nymphes, who had so bewitched him, that if he were euer askt his name, he must presently vanish away: and therefore charged her vpon his blessing, that she neuer aske him what he was, nor whether he would. <hi>And so</hi> a great while she kept his commandement; til once, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through a cruell wildernes, as darke as pitch; her mouth so watred, that she could not choose but aske him the question. And then, he making the greeuousest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints that would haue melted a tree to haue heard them, vanisht quite away: &amp; she lay down, casting forth as pitifull cries as any shrich-owle. But hauing laien so, (wet by the raine, and burnt by the Sun) fiue dayes, &amp; fiue nights, she gat vp and went ouer many a high hil, &amp;<pb n="166" facs="tcp:11334:170"/> many a deepe riuer; till she came to an Aunts house of hers; and came, &amp; cried to her for helpe: and she for pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie gaue her a Nut, and bad her neuer open her Nut, til she was come to the extremest misery that euer tongue could speake of. <hi>And so</hi> she went, &amp; she went, &amp; neuer rested the euening, wher she we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the morning; til she came to a second Aunt; and she gaue her another Nut.</p>
               <p>Now good <hi>Mopsa</hi> (said the sweete <hi>Philoclea</hi>) I pray <label type="milestone">

It sufficeth, that the yong man perswaded himself he loued her: she being a woman beautiful enough, if it be possible, that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side onely can iustly entitle a beauty. But finding such a chase as onely fledde to be caught, the young Prince broght his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with her to that point, which ought to engraue remorse in her harte, &amp; to paint shame vpon<pb n="167" facs="tcp:11334:171"/> her face. And so possest he his desire without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption; he constantly fauouring her, and she thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that the enameling of a Princes name, might hide the spots of a broken wedlock. But as I haue seene one that was sick of a sleeping disease, could not be made wake, but with pinching of him: so out of his sinfull sleepe his minde (vnworthie so to be loste) was not to be cald to it selfe, but by a sharpe accident.</p>
               <p>It fell out, that his many-times leauing of the court <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>3</label> (in vndue times) began to be noted; and (as Princes eares be manifolde) from one to another came vnto the King; who (carefull of his onely sonne) sought, and found by his spies (the necessarie euill seruauntes to a King) what it was, whereby he was from his better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights so diuerted.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, the King (to giue his fault the greater <label type="milestone">

And that way he tooke, laying threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings vpon her, and vpon him reproaches. But the poore young Prince (deceiued with that young opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if it be euer lawfull to lie, it is for ones Louer,<hi>)</hi> employed all his witte to bring his father to a better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. And because he might bende him from that (as he counted it) crooked conceit of her, he wrested him, as much as he coulde possiblie, to the other side: not sticking with prodigall protestations to set foorth her chastitie; not denying his own attempts, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more extolling her vertue. His Sophistrie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled, his father beleeued; and so beleeued, that ere long (though he were alredy stept into the winter of<pb facs="tcp:11334:172"/> his age) he founde himselfe warme in those desires, which were in his sonne farre more excusable. To be short, he gaue himselfe ouer vnto it; and (because he would auoide the odious comparison of a yong riuall) sent away his sonne with an armie, to the subduing of a Prouince lately rebelled against him, which he knewe could not be a lesse worke, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of three or foure yeares.

For, accompanying her mourning with a dolefull countenaunce, yet neither forgetting hansomnes in her mourning garments, nor sweetenes in her dolefull countenance; her wordes were euer sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with sighes; and any fauour she shewed, bathed in teares, that affection might see cause of pity; and pity might perswade cause of affection. And being growen skilfull in his humors, she was no lesse skilfull in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his humors: neuer suffering his feare to fall to a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, nor his hope to hasten to an assurance: she was content he should thinke that she loued him; and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine<pb n="168" facs="tcp:11334:172"/> stolne looke should sometimes (as though it were against her will) bewray it: But if thereupon he grewe bolde, he straight was encountred with a maske of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. And that which seemeth most impossible vnto me, (for as neere as I can I repeate it as <hi>Plangus</hi> tolde it) she could not onely sigh when she would, as all can doo; &amp; weep when she would, as (they say) some can doo; but (being most impudent in her hart) she could, when she would, teach her chekes blushing, and make shame fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the cloake of shamelesnes. In summe, to leaue out many particularities which he recited, she did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vse so the spurre, that his Desire ran on, but so the bit, that it ran on, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in such a careere as she would haue it; that within a while, the king, seeing with no other eyes but such as she gaue him, &amp; thinking no other thoghts but such as she taught him; hauing at the first liberall measure of fauors, then shortned of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when most his Desire was inflamed; he saw no other way but mariage to satisfie his longing, and her mind (as he thought) lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but chastly louing. So that by the time <hi>Plangus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from being notably victorious of the Rebels, he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his father, not only maried, but already a father of a sonne &amp; a daughter by this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Therefore did she trie the vttermost of her wicked wit, how to ouerthrow him in the foundation of his strength, which was, in the fauour of his father: which because she saw strong both in nature and desert, it required the more cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning how to vndermine it. And therefore (shunning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary trade of hireling sycophants) she made her prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of him, to be accusations; and her aduauncing him, to be his ruine. For first with words (neerer admiration then liking) she would extoll his excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of his shape, the power of his witte, the valiantnes of his courage, the fortunatenes of his successes: so as the father might finde in her a singular loue towardes him: nay, she shunned not to kindle some fewe sparkes of ielousie in him. Thus hauing gotten an opinion in his father, that she was farre from meaning mischiefe to the sonne, then fell she to praise him with no lesse vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of affection, but with much more cunning of malice. For then she sets foorth the liberty of his mind, the high flying of his thoughts, the fitnesse in him to beare rule, the singular loue the Subiects bare him; that it was doubtfull, whether his wit were greater in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their fauors, or his courage in employing their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours: that he was not borne to liue a subiect-life, each action of his bearing in it Maiestie, such a Kingly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement, such a Kingly magnificence, such a Kingly harte for enterprises: especially remembring those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which in a successor are no more honoured by the subiects, then suspected of the Princes. Then would she<pb n="169" facs="tcp:11334:173"/> by putting-of obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, bring in obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands head, already infected with suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nay (would she say) I dare take it vpon my death, that he is no such sonne, as many of like might haue bene, who loued greatnes so well, as to build their greatnes vpon their fathers ruine. Indeed Ambition, like Loue, can abide no lingring, &amp; euer vrgeth on his own successes; hating nothing, but what may stop the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the Gods forbid, we should euer once dreame of any such thing in him, who perhaps might be content, that you &amp; the world should know, what he can do: but the more power he hath to hurte, the more admirable is his praise, that he wil not hurt. Then euer remembring to strengthen the suspition of his estate with priuate ielousie of her loue, doing him excessiue honour when he was in presence, and repeating his pretie speaches and graces in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; besides, causing him to be imployed in all such dangerous matters, as ether he should perish in them, or if he preuailed, they should increase his glory: which she made a weapon to wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him, vntill she found that suspition began already to speake for it selfe, and that her husbands eares were growne hungry of rumours, and his eies prying into euery accident.</p>

And so they two, with diuers wayes, nourished one humour, like Musitians, that singing diuers parts, make one musicke. He sometime with fearefull countenaunce would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire<pb facs="tcp:11334:174"/> the King to looke to himselfe; for that all the court and Cittie were full of whisperings, and expectation of some suddaine change, vpon what ground himselfe knew not. Another time he would counsell the King to make much of his sonne, and holde his fauour, for that it was too late now to keepe him vnder. Now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to feare himselfe, because (he said) <hi>Plangus</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued none of them that were great about his father. Lastly, breaking with him directly (making a sorrowful countenance, &amp; an humble gesture beare false witnesse for his true meaning) that he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, not only souldiery, but people weary of his gouernment, &amp; al their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bent vpon <hi>Plangus.</hi> Both he and the Queene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in strange dreames, &amp; each thing else, that in a mind (already perplexed) might breed astonishment: so that within a while, all <hi>Plangus</hi> actions began to be translated into the language of suspition.</p>

This word (finding the King alredy supersticious through suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) amazed him streight, as a presage of his owne fortune: so that, returning, and breaking with his wife how much he misdoubted his estate, she made such gaine-saying an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres, as while they straue, straue to be ouercome.

Intend? (said <hi>Basilius,</hi> proud that that was brought in question) what may they intend, but a refreshing of my soule, and a swaging of my heat, and enioying those your excellencies, wherein my life is vpheld, and my death threatned? <hi>Zelmane</hi> lifting vp her face as if she had receaued a mortall iniurie of him, And is this the deuotion your ceremonies haue bene bent vnto? said she: Is it the disdaine of my estate, or the opinion of my lightnesse, that haue emboldned such base fancies towards me? enioying quoth you? now little ioy come to them that yeeld to such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying. Poore <hi>Basilius</hi> was so appalled, that his legges bowed vnder him; his eyes lookt as though he would gladly hide himself; and his old blood going to his hart, a generall shaking all ouer his bodie possessed him. At length with a wanne mouth; he was about to giue a stammering answere, when it came into <hi>Zelmanes</hi> head by this deuise to make her profite of his folly; and therefore with a relented countenance, thus said vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Your words (mightie Prince) were vnfit either for me to heare, or you to speake: but yet the large testimonie I see of your affection makes me willing to suppresse a great number of errors. Onely thus much<pb n="175" facs="tcp:11334:179"/> I thinke good to say, that the same words in my Ladie <hi>Philocleas</hi> mouth, as from one woman to another (so as there were no other bodie by) might haue had a better grace; and perchance haue found a gentler receipt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basilius</hi> (whose senses by Desire were held open, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>6</label> conceipt was by Loue quickned) heard scarcely halfe her answere out, but that (as if speedie flight might saue his life) he turned away, and ran with all the speede his bodie would suffer him, towardes his daughter <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea:</hi> whom he found at that time duetifully watching by her mother, and <hi>Miso</hi> curiouslie watching her; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing left <hi>Mopsa</hi> to doo the like seruice to <hi>Pamela. Basilius</hi> foorthwith calling <hi>Philoclea</hi> aside, (with all the coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words which Desire could endite, and authoritie vtter) besought her she would preserue his life, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her life was begonne; she would saue his graye haires from rebuke, and his aged mind from despaire; that if she were not cloyed with his companie, and that she thought not the earth ouer-burdened with him, she would coole his fierie griefe, which was to be done but by her breath. That in fine, whatsoeuer he was, he was nothing but what it pleased <hi>Zelmane;</hi> all the powers of his spirite depending of her: that if she continued cruell, he could no more sustaine his life, then the earth remaine fruitefull in the Sunnes continuall absence. He concluded, she should in one payment requite all his deserts: and that she needed not disdaine any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice (though neuer so meane) which was warranted by the sacred name of a father. <hi>Philoclea</hi> more glad then euer she had knowen her selfe, that she might by this occasion, enioy the priuate conference of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> yet<pb facs="tcp:11334:180"/> had so sweete a feeling of vertue in her minde, that she would not suffer a vile colour to be cast ouer her faire thoughts; but with humble grace answered her father: That there needed nether promise nor perswasion to her, to make her doo her vttermost for her fathers ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. That for <hi>Zelmanes</hi> fauour, she would in all vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sort seeke it towards him: and that as she woulde not pearce further into his meaning, then himselfe should declare, so would she interprete all his doinges to be accomplished in goodnes: and therefore desired, (if otherwise it were) that he woulde not imparte it to her, who then should be forced to beginne (by true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience) a shew of disobedience: rather perfourming his generall commandement, which had euer beene, to embrace vertue, then any new particular, sprong out of passion, and contrarie to the former. <hi>Basilius</hi> content to take that, since he could haue no more (thinking it a great point, if by her meanes, he could get but a more free accesse vnto <hi>Zelmane</hi>) allowed her reasons, &amp; took her prosser tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfully, desiring onely a speedy returne of comfort. <hi>Philoclea</hi> was parting, and <hi>Miso</hi> streight behind her, like <hi>Alecto</hi> following <hi>Proserpina.</hi> But <hi>Basilius</hi> forced her to stay, though with much a doo, she being sharp-set vpon the fulfilling of a shrewde office, in ouer-looking <hi>Philoclea:</hi> and so said to <hi>Basilius,</hi> that she did as she was comanded, and could not answere it to <hi>Gynecia,</hi> if she were any whitte from <hi>Philoclea:</hi> telling him true, that he did euill to take her charge from her.

What shall I doo then? shal I seeke far-fetched inuentions? shall I labour to lay marble coulours ouer my ruinous thoughts? or rather, though the purenes of my virgin-minde be stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, let me keepe the true simplicitie of my word. True it is, alas, too true it is, ô <hi>Zelmane</hi> (for so I loue to call thee, since in that name my loue first began, and in the shade of that name my loue shall best lie hidden,) that euen while so thou wert, (what eye bewitched me I know not) my passions were fitter to desire, then to be desired. Shall I say then, I am sory, or that my loue must be turned to hate, since thou art turned to <hi>Pyrocles</hi>? how may that wel be, since when thou wert <hi>Zelmane,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire thou mightest not be thus, did most torment me. Thou hast then the victorie: vse it with vertue. Thy vertue wan me; with vertue preserue me. Doost thou loue me? keepe me then still worthy to be beloued.</p>
               <p>Then held she her tongue, and cast downe a self-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing <label type="milestone">

But <hi>Pyrocles</hi> so caried vp with ioy, that he did not enuy the Gods felicitie, presented her with some iewels of right princely value, as some litle tokens of his loue, &amp; qualitie: and withall shewed her letters from his father King <hi>Euarchus,</hi> vnto him, which euen in the Sea had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his iewels bene preserued. But little needed those prooses to one, who would haue fallen out with her selfe, rather then make any contrarie coniectures to <hi>Zelmanes</hi> speeches; so that with such imbracements,<pb facs="tcp:11334:184"/> as it seemed their soules desired to meete, and their harts to kisse, as their mouthes did: which faine <hi>Pyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> would haue sealed with the chiefe armes of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but <hi>Philoclea</hi> commaunded the contrary; and yet they passed the promise of mariage.</p>

For (saide she) I haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, how you first in the companie of your Noble cousin <hi>Musidorus</hi> parted from <hi>Thessalia,</hi> and of diuers aduentures, which with no more daunger then glory you passed through, till your comming to the succour of the Queene <hi>Erona;</hi> and the ende of that warre (you might perceiue by my selfe) I had vnderstood of the Prince <hi>Plangus.</hi> But what since was the course of your doings, vntil you came, after so many victories, to make a conquest of poore me, that I know not, the fame thereof hauing rather shewed it by pieces; then deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any full forme of it. Therefore, deere <hi>Pyrocles</hi> (for what can mine eares be so sweetly fed with as to heare you of you) be liberall vnto me of those things which haue made you indeede pretious to the worlde, and now doubt not to tell of your perils; for since I haue you here out of them, euen the remembraunce of them is pleasaunt. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> easily perceiued she was content with kindnesse, to put of occasion of further kindnesse; wherein Loue shewed himselfe a coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boy, that durst not attempt for feare of offending. But rather Loue prooued him selfe valiant, that durst with the sworde of reuerent dutie gaine-stand the<pb n="180" facs="tcp:11334:184"/> force of so many enraged desires. But so it was, that though he knewe this discourse was to entertaine him from a more streight parley, yet he duist not but kisse his rod, and gladly make much of the entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which she allotted vnto him: and therefore with a desirous sigh chastning his brest for too much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Sweete Princesse of my life (said he) what Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees, what Triumph, what Monuments, what Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may euer make my fame yeeld so sweete a Musicke to my eares, as that it pleaseth you to lend your minde to the knowledge of any thing touching <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> onely therefore of value, because he is your <hi>Pyrocles</hi>? And therefore grow I now so proud, as to thinke it worth the hearing, since you vouchsafe to giue it hearing. Therefore (onely height of my hope) vouchsafe to know, that after the death of <hi>Tiridates,</hi> and setling <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> in her gouernement; for setled we left her, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer since (as I perceiued by your speech the last day) the vngrateful treason of her ill-chosen husband ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw her (a thing in trueth neuer till this time by me either heard, or suspected) for who could thinke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hauing such a minde as <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> that so great a beautie as <hi>Eronas</hi> (indeed excellent) could not haue held his affection? so great goodnes could not haue bound gratefulnesse? and so high aduancement could not haue satisfied his ambition? But therefore true it is, that wickednesse may well be compared to a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pit, into which it is farre easier to keepe ones selfe from falling, then being fallen, to giue ones selfe any stay from falling infinitely. But for my Cosen, and me, vpon this cause we parted from <hi>Erona.</hi>

                  <hi>EVardes</hi> (the braue &amp; mighty Prince, whom it was my fortune to kill in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat for <hi>Erona</hi>) had three Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, sonnes to a sister of his; all three set among the foremost ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cks of Fame for great minds to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, and great force to perfourme what they did attempt; especially the eldest, by name <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius;</hi> to whom al men would willingly haue yeelded the height of praise, but that his nature was such, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it vpon himselfe, before any could giue it. For of so vnsupportable a pride he was, that where his deede might well stirre enuie, his demeanor did rather breed disdain. And if it be true that the <hi>Gyants</hi> euer made war against heauen, he had bene a fit ensigne-bearer for that company. For nothing seemed hard to him, though impossible; and nothing vniust, while his liking was his iustice. Now he in these wars had flatly refused his aid; because he could not brooke, that the worthy Prince <hi>Plagus</hi> was by his cosen <hi>Tiridates</hi> preferred before him. For allowing no other weights, but the sword &amp; speare in iudging of desert, how-much he esteemed himselfe<pb n="181" facs="tcp:11334:185"/> before <hi>Plangus</hi> in that, so much would he haue had his allowance in his seruice.</p>
               <p>But now that he vnderstood that his vncle was slaine <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>2</label> by me, I thinke rather scorne that any should kil his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, then any kindnesse (an vn-vsed guest to an arrogant soule) made him seeke his reuenge; I must confesse in manner gallant enough. For he sent a challenge to me to meete him at a place appointed, in the confines of the kingdome of <hi>Lycia;</hi> where he would proue vpon me, that I had by some trecherie ouercome his vncle, whom els many hundreds such as I, could not haue withstood. Youth &amp; successe made me willing enough to accept any such bargaine; especially, because I had heard that your cosen <hi>Amphialus</hi> (who for some yeares hath vniuersally borne the name of the best Knight in the world) had diuers times fought with him, &amp; neuer bene able to master him; but so had left him, that euery man thought <hi>Anaxius</hi> in that one vertue of curtesie far short of him, in al other his match; <hi>Anaxius</hi> stil deeming himselfe for his superiour. Therefore to him I would goe, and I would needs goe alone, because so I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood for certaine, he was; and (I must confesse) desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to do something without the company of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Prince <hi>Musidorus,</hi> because in my hart I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that I owed more to his presence, then to any thing in my self, whatsoeuer before I had done. For of him indeed (as of any worldly cause) I must grant, as receiued, what euer there is, or may be good in me. He taught me by word, and best by example, giuing me in him so liuely an Image of vertue, as ignorance could not cast such mist ouer mine eyes, as not to see, and to loue it, and all with such deare friendship and care, as (ô<pb facs="tcp:11334:186"/> heauens) how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my life euer requite vnto him? which made me indeed find in my selfe such a kind of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon him, as without him I found a weakenesse, and a mistrustfulnes of my selfe, as one strayed from his best strength, when at any time I mist him. Which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour perceiuing to ouer-rule me, I straue against it; not that I was vnwilling to depend vpon him in iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but by weakenesse I would not; which though it held me to him, made me vnworthy of him. Therfore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired his leaue, and obtained it: such confidence he had in me, preferring my reputation before his owne tendernesse; and so priuately went from him, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining (as after I knew) in secreat maner, not to be far from the place, where we appointed to meete, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent any foule play that might be offered vnto me. Full loth was <hi>Erona</hi> to let vs depart from her, (as it were) foreseeling the harmes which after fell to her. But I, (ridde fully from those combers of kindnesse, and halfe a dayes iourney in my way toward <hi>Anaxius</hi>) met an aduenture, (though in it selfe of small importance) I will tell you at large, because by the occasion thereof I was brought to as great comber and danger, as lightly any might escape.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>3</label> As I past through a Laund (ech side where of was so bordred both with high tymber trees, and copses of farre more humble growth, that it might easily bring a solitarie minde to looke for no other companions then the wild burgesses of the forrest) I heard certaine cries, which comming by pawses to mine eares from within the wood of the right hand, made me well assured by the greatnesse of the crie, it was the voice of a man, though it were a veric vnmanlike voice, so to crie. But<pb n="182" facs="tcp:11334:186"/> making mine eare my guide, I left not many trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me, before I saw at the bottome of one of them a gentle-man bound (with many garters) hand &amp; foot, so as well he might tomble and tosse, but neither runne nor resist he could. Vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him (like so many Eagles vpon an Oxe) were nine Gentle-women; truely such, as one might well enough say, they were hansome. Each of them helde bodkins in their handes, wherewith they continually pricked him, hauing bene before-hand vnarmed of any defence from the wast vpward, but onely of his shirte: so as the poore man wept and bled, cryed and prayed, while they sported themselues in his paine, and delighted in his prayers, as the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their victorie.</p>
               <p>I was moued to compassion, and so much the more <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>4</label> that he straight cald to me for succour, desiring me at lest to kill him, to deliuer him from those tormenters. But before my-self could resolue, much lesse any other tell what I would resolue, there came in cholericke hast towards me about seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or eight knights; the foremost of which willed me to get me away, and not to trouble the Ladies, while they were taking their due reuenge, but with so ouer-mastring a maner of pride, as truly my hart could not brooke it: &amp; therfore (answering them, that how I would haue defended him from the Ladies I knew not, but from them I would) I began a combate first with him particularly, and after his death with the others (that had lesse good maners) ioyntly. But such was the end of it, that I kept the fielde with the death of some, and flight of others. In so much as the women (afraid, what angrie victorie would bring forth) ranne away; sauing onely one; who was so flesht in malice,<pb facs="tcp:11334:187"/> that neither during, nor after the fight, she gaue any truce to her crueltie, but still vsed the little instrument of her great spight, to the well-witnest paine of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient patient: and was now about to put out his eies, which all this while were spared, because they should do him the discomfort of seeing who preuailed ouer him. When I came in, and after much ado, brought her to some conference, (for some time it was before she would harken, more before she would speake; &amp; most, before she would in her speech leaue off that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her bodkin) but at length whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I puld off my head-peece, and humbly entreated her pardon, or knowledge why she was cruell; out of breath more with choller (which increased in his owne exercise) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the paine she tooke, much to this purpose she gaue her griefe vnto my knowledge. Gentleman (said she) much it is against my will to forbeare any time the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting of my iust reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge vpon this naughtie creature, a man in nothing, but in deceauing women; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I see you are young, and like enough to haue the power (if you would haue the mind) to do much more mischiefe, then he, I am content vpon this bad subiect to reade a lecture to your vertue.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> This man called <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> in birth I must confesse is noble (but what is that to him, if it shalbe a staine to his deade auncestors to haue left such an ofspring?) in shape as you see not vncomely (indeed the fit maske of his disguised falshood) in conuersation wittily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, and pleasantly gamesome; his eyes full of merie simplicitie, his words of hartie companablenesse; and such a one, whose head one would not think so stayed, as to thinke mischieuously: delighted in al such things,<pb n="183" facs="tcp:11334:187"/> which by imparting their delight to others, makes the vser therof welcome; as, Musicke, Daunsing, Hunting, Feasting, Riding, &amp; such like. And to conclude, such a one, as who can keepe him at armes ende, neede neuer wish a better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But vnder these qualities lies such a poysonous addar as I will tell you. For by those gifts of Nature and Fortune (being in all places acceptable) he creepes, nay (to say truely) he flies so into the fauour of poore fillie women, that I would be too much asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to confesse, if I had not reuenge in my hande, as well as shame in my cheekes. For his hart being wholy delighted in deceiuing vs, we could neuer be warned, but rather, one bird caught, serued for a stale to bring in more. For the more he gat, the more still he shewed, that he (as it were) gaue away to his new mistresse, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he betrayed his promises to the former. The cunning of his flatterie, the readines of his teares, the infinitenes of his vowes, were but among the weakest threedes of his nette. But the stirring our owne passions, and by the entrance of them, to make himselfe Lord of our forces; there lay his Masters part of cunning, making vs now iealous, now enuious, now proud of what we had, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of more; now giuing one the triumph, to see him that was Prince of many, Subiect to her; now with an estranged looke, making her feare the losse of that minde, which indeede could neuer be had: neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing humblenes and diligence, till he had imbarked vs in some such disaduantage, as we could not return dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shod; and then suddenly a tyrant, but a crastie tyrant. For so would he vse his imperiousnes, that we had a delightfull feare, and an awe which made vs loath to lose our hope. And, which is strangest (when some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times<pb facs="tcp:11334:188"/> with late repentance I thinke of it) I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, euen in the greatest tempest of my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was I neuer driuen to think him excellent, and yet so could set my minde, both to gette and keepe him, as though therein had laien my felicitie: like them I haue seene play at the ball, growe extremely earnest, who shoulde haue the ball, and yet euery one knew it was but a ball. But in the end, the bitter sauce of the sport was, that we had ether our hartes broken with sorrow, or our estates spoyled with being at his direction, or our honours for euer lost, partly by our owne faults, but principally by his faultie vsing of our faults. For neuer was there man that could with more scornefull eyes beholde her, at whose feete he had lately laine, nor with a more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike brauerie vse his tongue to her disgrace, which lately had song Sonets of her praises: being so natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconstant, as I maruell his soule findes not some way to kill his bodie, whereto it had beene so long v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited. For so hath he dealt with vs (vnhappie fooles,) as we could neuer tell, whether he made greater haste after he once liked, to enioy, or after he once enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to forsake. But making a glorie of his own shame, it delighted him to be challenged of vnkindnesse: it was a triumph vnto him to haue his mercie called for: and he thought the fresh colours of his beautie were painted in nothing so well, as in the ruines of his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: yet so farre had we engaged our selues, (vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate soules) that we listed not complaine, since our complaintes could not but carrie the greatest accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our selues. But euerie of vs (each for her selfe,) laboured all meanes how to recouer him, while he rather daily sent vs companions of our deceipt, then<pb n="184" facs="tcp:11334:188"/> euer returned in any sound and faithfull manner. Till at length he concluded all his wronges with betro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing himselfe to one (I must confesse) worthie to be liked, if any worthinesse might excuse so vnworthie a changeablenesse; leauing vs nothing but remorse for what was past, and despaire of what might followe. Then indeede, the common iniurie made vs all ioyne in friendshippe, who till that time, had employed our endeuours one against the other. For, we thought nothing was a more condemning of vs, then the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of his loue to her by mariage: then Despaire made Feare valiant, and Reuenge gaue Shame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: whereupon, we (that you saw here) deuised how to get him among vs alone: which he (suspecting no such matter of them, whom he had by often abuses he thought made tame to be still abused) easilie gaue vs opportunitie to doo.</p>
               <p>And a man may see, euen in this, how soone Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers <label type="milestone">

And when we began in courteous manner, one after the other, to lay his vnkindnesse vnto him, he seeing himselfe confronted by so many (like a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Orator,) went not to deniall, but to iustifie his cruell falshoode, and all with such iestes, and disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full passages, that if the iniurie could not be made grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet were our conceiptes made the apter to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende it.</p>
               <p>Among other of his answeres (forsooth) I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forgette, how he woulde prooue it was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancie to chaunge from one Loue to an other,<pb facs="tcp:11334:189"/> but a great constancie; and contrarie, that which we call constancie, to be most changeable. For (said he) I euer loued my Delight, &amp; delighted alwayes in what was Louely: and where-soeuer I founde occasion to obtaine that, I constantly folowed it. But these constant fooles you speak of, though their Mistres grow by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes foule, or by fortune miserable, yet stil will loue her, and so committe the absurdest inconstancie that may be, in changing their loue from fairenes to foulenesse, and from louelines to his contrarie; like one not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to leaue a friend, but will streight giue ouer himself to his mortall enemie: where I (whom you call incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant) am euer constant; to Beautie, in others; and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in my self. And so in this iollie scoffing brauerie he went ouer vs all, saying, He left one, because she was ouer-waiwarde; another, because she was too soone woon; a third, because she was not merie inough; a fourth, because she was ouer-gamesome; the fifth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she was growen with griefe subiect to sicknesse; the sixt, because she was so foolish, as to be ielous of him; the seuenth, because she had refused to carie a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him, to another that he loued; the eight, because she was not secrete; the ninth, because she was not libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: but to me, who am named <hi>Dido,</hi> (and indeede haue mette with a false <hi>AEnoeas</hi>) to me, I say, (ô the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull villaine) he could finde no other fault to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, but that (perdie) he met with many fayrer.</p>

And therefore how-soeuer my fellowes pardon his iniuries, for my parte I will euer remember, &amp; remember to reuenge this scorne of al scornes. With that she to him afresh; &amp; surely would haue put out his cies (who lay muet for shame, if he did not sometimes crie for feare) if I had not lept from my horse, &amp; ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling force with in treaty, staied her furie.</p>

But then I was faine to forsake the ensigne; vnder which I had before serued, and to spend my vttermost force in the protecting of the Ladie; which so well preuailed for her, that in the ende there was a faithfull peace promised of all sides. And so I lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her in a place of securitie (as she thought) went on my iourney towards <hi>Anaxius,</hi> for whom I was faine to stay two daies in the apointed place, he disdaining to waite for me, till he was sure I were there.</p>

And assoone as euer he came neere me, in fit distaunce for his purpose, he with much fury, (but with fury skilfully guided) ran vpon me; which I (in the best sort I could) resisted, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kept my selfe ready for him, because I had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that he obserued but few complements in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of armes, but such as a proud anger did in dite vnto him. And so putting our horses into a full careere, we hit ech other vpon the head with our Launces: I think he felte my blowe; for my parte (I must confesse) I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer receiued the like: but I thinke though my senses were astonished, my minde forced them to quicken themselues, because I had learned of him, how little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour he is woont to show in any matter of aduantage.<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11334:190"/> And indeede he was turned, and comming vpon me with his sworde drawne, both our staues hauing bene broken at that encounter. But I was so ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere him, that truely I know not who gaue the first blowe. But whosoeuer gaue the first, it was quickly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the second. And indeed (excellentest La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) I must say truely, for a time it was well fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs; he vndoubtedly being of singular valour, (I would to God, it were not abased by his too much loftinesse) but as by the occasion of the combate, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and loosing ground, we chaunged places, his horse happened to come vpon the point of the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken speare, which fallen to the ground chaunced to stand vpward; so as it lighting vpon his hart, the horse died. He driuen to dismount, threatned, if I did not the like, to doo as much for my horse, as Fortune had done for his. But whether for that, or because I would not be beholding to Fortune for any part of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I descended.</p>
               <p>So began our foote-fight in such sort, that we were <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>2</label> well entred to bloud of both sides, when there comes by, that vnconstant <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> whom I had deliuered (easie to be knowne, for he was bare faced) with a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen armed men after him; but before him he had <hi>Dido</hi> (that Ladie, who had most sharpely punished him) riding vpon a palfrey, he following her with most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manlike crueltie; beating her with wandes he had in his hande, she crying for sense of payne, or hope of succour: which was so pittifull a sight vnto me, that it mooued me to require <hi>Anaxius</hi> to deferre our combate, till an other day, and now to perfourme the duties of Knighthood in helping this distressed Ladie.<pb facs="tcp:11334:191"/> But he that disdaines to obey any thing but his passion (which he cals his mind) bad me leaue of that thought; but when he had killed me, he would then (perhaps) go to her succour. But I well finding the fight would be long betweene vs (longing in my hart to deliuer the Poore <hi>Dido</hi>) giuing him so great a blowe, as somewhat staied him, (to terme it a right) I flatly ran away from him toward my horse, who trotting after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, in mine armour I was put to some paine, but that vse made me nimble vnto it. But as I followed my horse, <hi>Anaxius</hi> followed me: but his prowde harte did so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine that exercise, that I had quickly ouer-run him, &amp; ouer-taken my horse; being (I must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse) ashamed to see a number of country folks, who happened to passe thereby, who hallowed &amp; howted after me as at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantest coward, that euer shewed his shoulders to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie. But when I had leapt on my horse (with such speedy agility, that they all cried, O see how feare giues him wings) I turned to <hi>Anaxius,</hi> &amp; aloud promised him to returne thether again, as soone as I had relieued the iniuried Ladie. But he railing at me, with all the base wordes angry contempt could endite; I said no more, but, <hi>Anaxius,</hi> assure thy self, I nether feare thy force, nor thy opinion. And so vsing no weapon of a Knight as at that time, but my spurres, I ranne in my knowledge after <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> but in al their conceipts from <hi>Anaxius,</hi> which as far as I could heare, I might well heare testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such laughters and games, that I was some few times moued to turne backe againe.</p>

For there they began to strip her of her clothes, when I came in among them, &amp; running through the first with a lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the iustnesse of the cause so enhabled me against the rest (falsharted in their owne wrong doing) that I had, in as short time almost as I had bene fighting with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Anaxius,</hi> deliuered her from those iniurious wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: most of whom carried newes to the other world, that amongst men secret wronges are not alwaies left vnpunished. As for <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> he hauing once seene, &amp; (as it should seeme) remembred me, euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning began to be in the rereward, and before they had left fighting, he was too far of to giue them thanks for their paines. But when I had deliuered to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die a ful libertie, both in effect, &amp; in opinion, (for some time it was before she could assure her selfe she was out of their handes, who had layd so vehement appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of death vpon her) she then tolde me, how as she was returning toward her fathers, weakely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied (as too soone trusting to the falshood of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement) <hi>Pamphilus</hi> had set vpon her, and killing those that were with her, carried her selfe by such force, and with such ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner as I had seene, to this place, where he meant in cruell and shamefull manner to kill her, in the sight of her owne Father; to whom he had already sent worde of it, that out of his castle windowe (for this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, she said, was his) he might haue the prospect of his onely childes destruction, if my comming, whom (she said) he feared (as soone as he knew me by the<pb facs="tcp:11334:192"/> armour) had not warraunted her from that neere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching crueltie. I was glad I had done so good a deede for a Gentlewoman not vnhandsome, whome before I had in like sorte helped. But the night begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to perswade some retiring place, the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, euen out of countenaunce before she began her speach, much after this manner inuited me to lodge that night with her father.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>4</label> Sir (said she) how much I owe you, can be but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based by wordes, since the life I haue, I holde it now the second time of you: and therefore neede not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer seruice vnto you, but onely to remember you, that I am your seruaunt: and I would, my being so, might any way yeeld any small contentment vnto you. Now onely I can but desire you to harbour your selfe this night in this castle; because the time requires it; and in truth this countrie is very daungerous for murthering theeues, to trust a sleeping life among them. And yet I must confesse, that as the loue I beare you makes me thus inuite you, so the same loue makes me ashamed to bring you to a place, where you shalbe so (not spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ceremonie but by truth) miserably entertained. With that she tolde me, that though she spake of her father (whom she named <hi>Chremes</hi>) she would hide no truth from me, which was in summe, that as he was of all that region the man of greatest possessions, and riches, so was he either by nature, or an euill receiued opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, giuen to sparing, in so vnmeasurable a sorte, that he did not onely barre him selfe from the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but almost from the necessarie vse thereof; scarse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowing him selfe fitte sustenaunce of life, rather then he would spende of those goods, for whose sake<pb n="188" facs="tcp:11334:192"/> onely he seemed to ioye in life. Which extreame dealing (descending from himselfe vpon her) had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her to put her selfe with a great Lady of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, by which occasion she had stumbled vpon such mischance, as were little for the honour either of her, or her familie. But so wise had he shewed himselfe therein, as while he found his daughter maintained without his cost, he was content to be deafe to any noise of infamie: which though it had wronged her much more then she deserued, yet she could not denie, but she was driuen thereby to receaue more then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent fauours. She concluded, that there at left I should be free from iniuries, &amp; should be assured to her-wards to abound as much in the true causes of welcomes, as I should want of the effects thereof.</p>
               <p>I, who had acquainted my selfe to measure the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacie <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> of foode and rest, by hunger and wearinesse, at that time well stored of both, did not abide long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie; but went with her to the Castle: which I found of good strength, hauing a great more rounde about it; the worke of a noble Gentleman, of whose vnthrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie sonne he had bought it. The bridge drawne vp, where we were faine to crie a good while before we coulde haue answeare, and to dispute a good while before answeare would bee brought to acceptance. At length a willingnesse, rather then a ioy to receaue his daughter, whome hee had lately seene so neere death, and an opinion rather brought into his heade by course, because he heard himselfe called a father; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then any kindnesse that hee found in his owne harte, made him take vs in; for my part by that time growne so wearie of such entertainement, that no<pb facs="tcp:11334:193"/> regard of my selfe, but onely the importunitie of his daughter made me enter. Where I was met with this <hi>Chremes,</hi> a driueling old fellow, leane, shaking both of head and hands, alredie halfe earth, and yet then most greedie of Earth: who scarcely would giue me thankes for that I had done, for feare I suppose, that thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse might haue an introduction of reward. But with a hollow voice, giuing me a false welcome, I might perceaue in his eye to his daughter, that it was hard to say, whether the displeasure of her company did not ouer-way the pleasure of her owne comming. But on he brought me, into so bare a house, that it was the picture of miserable happinesse, and rich beggerie (ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued onely by a company of rusticall villaines, full of sweate and dust, not one of them other, then a labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer) in summe (as he counted it) profitable drudgerie: and all preparations both for foode and lodging such, as would make one detest nigardnesse, it is so sluttish a vice. His talke nothing but of his pouertie, for feare belike lest I should haue proued a young borrower. In summe, such a man, as any enemy could not wish him worse, then to be himselfe. But there that night bidde I the burthen of being a tedious guest to a loathsome host; ouer-hearing him sometimes bitterly warne his daughter of bringing such costly mates vnder his roofe: which she grieuing at, desired much to know my name, I thinke partly of kindnesse to remember who had done some-thing for her, and partly because she assured her selfe I was such a one as would make euen his miser-minde contented, with what he had done. And accordingly she demaunded my name, and estate, with such earnestnesse, that I whom Loue had<pb n="189" facs="tcp:11334:193"/> not as then so robbed me of my selfe, as to be another then I am, told her directly my name and condition: whereof she was no more gladde then her father, as I might well perceaue by some ill-fauoured cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, which then first began to wrinckle it selfe in his face.</p>
               <p>But the causes of their ioyes were farre different; for <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>6</label> as the shepheard and the butcher both may looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one sheepe with pleasing conceipts, but the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard with minde to profite himselfe by preseruing, the butcher with killing him: So she reioyced to finde that mine owne benefits had tyed me to be her friend, who was a Prince of such greatnesse, and louingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced: but his ioy grew, (as I to my danger after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued) by the occasion of the Queene <hi>Artaxias</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my head to sale, for hauing slaine her brother <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridates</hi>; which being the summe of an hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand crownes (to whosoeuer brought me aliue into her hands) that old wretch, (who had ouer-liued all good nature) though he had lying idly by him much more then that, yet aboue all things louing money, for monies owne sake determined to betray me, so well deseruing of him, for to haue that which he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined neuer to vse. And so knowing that the next morning I was resolued to go to the place where I had left <hi>Anaxius,</hi> he sent in all speed to a Captaine of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison hard by; which though it belonged to the King of <hi>Iberia,</hi> (yet knowing the Captaines humor to delight so in riotous spending; as he cared not how he came by the meanes to maintaine it) doubted not, that to be halfe with him in the gaine, he would play his quarters part in the treason. And therefore that night agreeing<pb facs="tcp:11334:194"/> of the fittest places where they might surprise me in the morning, the old caitiffe was growne so ceremonious, as he would needs accompanie me some myles in my way; a sufficient token to me, if Nature had made me apte to suspect; since a churles curtesie rathely comes but either for gaine, or falshood. But I suffered him to stumble into that point of good manner: to which purpose he came out with all his clownes, horst vpon such cart-iades, and so furnished, as in good faith I thought with my selfe, if that were thrist, I wisht none of my friends or subiects euer to thriue. As for his daughter (the gentle <hi>Dido</hi>) she would also (but in my conscience with a farre better minde) prolong the time of farewell, as long as he.</p>

And therefore making necessitie and iustice my bestsword and shield, I vsed the other weapons I had as well as I could; I am sure to the little case of a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who trusting to their number more then to their valure, and valewing money higher then equitie, felt, that guiltlesnesse is not alwayes with ease oppressed. As for <hi>Chremes,</hi> he withdrew himselfe, yet so guilding<pb n="190" facs="tcp:11334:194"/> his wicked conceipts with his hope of gaine, that he was content to be a beholder, how I should be taken to make his pray.</p>
               <p>But I was growne so wearie, that I supported my <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>8</label> selfe more with anger then strength, when the most excellent <hi>Musidorus</hi> came to my succour; who hauing followed my trace as well as he could, after he had found I had left the fight with <hi>Anaxius,</hi> came to the niggards Castell, where he found all burnd and spoiled by the countrie people, who bare mortall hatred to that couetous man, and now tooke the time, when the castell was left almost without garde, to come in, and leaue monuments of their malice therein: which <hi>Must<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> not staying either to further, or impeach, came vpon the spurre after me (because with one voice ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny told him, that if I were in his company, it was for no good meant vnto me) and in this extremitie found me. But when I saw that Cosen of mine, me thought my life was doubled, and where before I thought of a noble death, I now thought of a noble victorie. For who can feare that hath <hi>Musidorus</hi> by him? who, what he did there for me, how many he killed, not straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for the number, then for the straunge blowes wherwith he sent them to a wel-deserued death, might well delight me to speake off, but I should so holde you too long in euery particular. But in trueth, there if euer, and euer, if euer any man, did <hi>Musidorus</hi> shew himselfe second to none in able valour.</p>

Which, because of the straunge successes we had in the kingdomes of <hi>Phrigia, Pontus</hi> &amp; <hi>Galatia</hi>) seemed not vnlikely to him, who (but skimming any thing that came before him) was disciplined to leaue the through-handling of all, to his gentle wife: who foorth with caused vs to be put in prison, hauing (while we slept) depriued vs of our armour: a prison, indeede iniurious, because a prison, but els well testifying affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because in all respectes as commodious, as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son might be: and indeede so placed, as she might at all houres, (not seene by many, though she cared not much how many had seene her) come vnto vs. Then fell she to sause her desires with threatnings, so that we were in a great perplexitie, restrained to so vnworthie a bondage, and yet restrained by Loue, which (I cannot tell how) in noble mindes, by a certain duety, claimes<pb n="193" facs="tcp:11334:197"/> an answering. And how much that loue might mooue vs, so much, and more that faultines of her mind remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs; her beautie being balanced by her shamelesnes. But that which did (as it were) tie vs in captiuitie, was, that to graunt, had ben wickedly iniurious to him, that saued our liues: and to accuse a Ladie that loued vs, of her loue vnto vs, we esteemed almost as dishonorable: &amp; but by one of those waies we sawe no likelihood of going out of that place, where the words would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to your eares, which should expresse the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of her suite: while yet many times earnestnes died her cheekes with the colour of shamefastnes; and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton languishing borrowed of her eies the downe-cast looke of modestie. But we in the meane time far from louing her, and often assuring her, that we would not so recompence her husbandes sauing of our liues; to such a ridiculous degree of trusting her, she had brought him, that she caused him sende vs worde, that vpon our liues, we should doo whatsoeuer she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs: good man, not knowing any other, but that all her pleasures bent to the preseruation of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. But when that made vs rather pittie, then obey his folly, then fel she to seruile entreating vs, as though force could haue bene the schoole of Loue, or that an honest courage would not rather striue against, then yeelde to iniurie. All which yet could not make vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse her, though it made vs almost pine awaie for spight, to loose any of our time in so troublesome an i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenesse.</p>
               <p>But while we were thus full of wearinesse of what <label type="milestone">

This King by this Queene had a sonne of tender age, but of great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, brought vp in the hope of themselues, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acceptation of the inconstant people, as succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour of his fathers crowne: whereof he was as worthy, considering his partes, as vnworthie, in respect of the wrong was therby done against the most worthy <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus:</hi> whose great desertes now either forgotten, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully remembred, all men set their sayles with the fauourable winde, which blewe on the fortune of this young Prince, perchaunce not in their harts, but surely not in their mouths, now giuing <hi>Plangus</hi> (who some yeares before was their only cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion) the poore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of calamitie, pittie. This youth therefore accounted Prince of that regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by name <hi>Palladius,</hi> did with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment affection loue a young Ladie, brought vp in his fathers court, called <hi>Zelmane,</hi> daughter to that mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously vnhappie Prince <hi>Plexirtus</hi> (of whom already I haue, and sometimes must make, but neuer honorable mention) left there by her father, because of the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate changeablenes of his estate; he by the motherside being halfe brother to this Queene <hi>Andromana,</hi> and therefore the willinger committing her to her care.

               <p>Such was therein my ill destinie, that this young <label type="milestone">

Wherefore he sought to haue that by practise, which he could not by praier.

For as her beautie hath wonne the prize from all women, that stande in degree of comparison (for as for the two sisters of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> they are farre beyond all conceipt of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison) so hath her gouernment bene such, as hath bene no lesse beautifull to mens iudgements, then her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the eiesight.

The Eclogue had great praise:<pb facs="tcp:11334:201"/> I onely remember sixe verses, while hauing questioned one with the other, of their fellow-shepheards so daine growing a man of armes, and the cause of his so doing, they thus said.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>ME thought some staues he mist: if so, not much amisse:</l>
                  <l>For where he most would hit, he euer yet did misse.</l>
                  <l>One said he brake acrosse; full well it so might be:</l>

               </lg>
               <p>Thus I haue digrest, because his maner liked me wel: But when he began to run against <hi>LElius,</hi> it had neere growne (though great loue had euer bene betwixt them) to a quarrell. For <hi>Philisides</hi> breaking his staues with great commendation, <hi>Lelius</hi> (who was knowne to be second to none in the perfection of that Art) ranne euer ouer his head, but so finely to the skilfull eyes, that one might well see, he shewed more knowledge in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, then others did in hitting. For with so gallanta grace his staffe came swimming close ouer the crest of the Helmet, as if he would represent the kisse, and not the stroke of <hi>Mars.</hi> But <hi>Philisides</hi> was much moued with it, while he thought <hi>Lelius</hi> would shew a contempt of his youth: till <hi>Lelius</hi> (who therefore would satisfie him, because he was his friend) made him know, that to such bondage he was for so many courses tyed by her, whose disgraces to him were graced by her excellency, and whose iniuries he could neuer otherwise returne, then honours.</p>
               <p>But so by <hi>Lelius</hi> willing-missing was the odds of the<pb n="197" facs="tcp:11334:201"/>

He came in like a wild man; but such a wildnes, as shewed his eye-sight had tamed him, full of withered leaues, which though they fell not, still threatned falling. His <hi>Impresa</hi> was, a mill-horse still bound to goe in one circle; with this word, <hi>Data fata sequutus.</hi> But after him the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Knights absolutely preuailed, especially a great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of <hi>Corinth</hi>; whose deuife was to come without any deuise, all in white like a new knight, as indeed he was; but so new, as his newnes shamed most of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers long exercise. Then another from whose tent I remember a birde was made flie, with such art to carry a written embassage among the Ladies, that one might say, If a liue bird, how so taught? if a dead bird, how so made? Then he, who hidden, man and horse in a great figure liuely representing the <hi>Phoenix</hi>: the fire tooke so artificially, as it consumed the birde, and left him to rise as it were, out of the ashes thereof. Against whom was the fine frosen Knight, frosen in despaire; but his armor so naturally representing Ice, and all his furniture so liuely answering therto, as yet did I neuer see any thing that pleased me better.</p>
               <p>But the delight of those pleasing sights haue carried <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> me too farre in an vnnecessary discourse. Let it then suffice (most excellent Ladie) that you know the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that morning in the exercise (as they had done the dayes before) had the better; <hi>Palladius</hi> neither suffring<pb facs="tcp:11334:202"/> vs, nor himselfe to take in hand that partie till the afternoone; when we were to fight in troopes, not differing otherwise from earnest, but that the sharpenesse of the weapons was taken away. But in the triall <hi>Palladius</hi> (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially led by <hi>Musidorus,</hi> and somewhat aided by me) himselfe truely behauing himselfe nothing like a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner, brought the honor to rest it selfe that night of the <hi>Iberian</hi> side: And the next day, both morning, and after-noone being kept by our party, He (that saw the time fitte for that deliuerie he intended) called vnto vs to follow him; which we both bound by oth, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by good-wil, obeyed: and so the gard not daring to interrupt vs (he commanding passage) we went after him vpon the spur to a little house in a forrest neere by: which he thought would be the fittest resting place, till we might go further from his mothers fury, whereat he was no lesse angry, &amp; ashamed, then desirous to obay <hi>Zelmane.</hi>

For so impatiently she commanded, as a good while no body knew what she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded; so as we had gotten so far the start, as to be alredy past the confines of her kingdome before she ouertooke vs: and ouertake vs she did in the kingdome of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> not regarding shame, or daunger of hauing entred into anothers dominions: but (hauing with her<pb n="198" facs="tcp:11334:202"/> about a three score hors-men) streight commaunded to take vs aliue, and not to regard her sonnes threatening therein: which they attempted to do, first by speach, &amp; then by force. But neither liking their eloquence, nor fearing their might, we esteemed few swordes in a iust defence, able to resist any vniust affaulters. And so <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidorus</hi> incredible valour (beating downe all lets) made both me, and <hi>Palladius,</hi> so good way, that we had little to doo to ouercome weake wrong.</p>

               <p>All this while disdaine, strengthened by the furie of <label type="milestone">

But when she perceiued it was her onely sonne that lay hurt, and that his hurt was so deadly, as that alredy his life had loste the vse of the reasonable, and almost sensible part; then onely did misfortune lay his owne ouglinesse vpon his faulte, and make her see what she had done, and to what she was come: especiallie, finding in vs rather detestation<pb facs="tcp:11334:203"/> then pittie (considering the losse of that young Prince) and resolution presently to depart, which stil she labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to stay. But depriued of all comfort, with eyes full of death, she ranne to her sonnes dagger, and before we were aware of it (who else could haue stayed it) strake her selfe a mortall wound. But then her loue, though not her person, awaked pittie in vs, and I went to her, while <hi>Musidorus</hi> labored about <hi>Palladius.</hi> But the wound was past the cure of a better surge on then my selfe, so as I could but receaue some few of her dying words; which were cursings of her ill set affection, and wishing vnto me many crosses &amp; mischances in my loue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer I should loue, wherin I feare, and only feare that her prayer is from aboue granted. But the noise of this fight, &amp; issue thereof being blazed by the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to some noble-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there-abouts, they came thither, and finding the wrong offered vs, let vs go on our iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, we hauing recommended those royal bodies vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be conueyed to the King of <hi>Iberia.</hi> With that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea,</hi> seeing the teares stand in his eyes with remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of <hi>Palladius,</hi> but much more of that which ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon grew, she would needs drinke a kisse from those eyes, and he sucke another from her lippes; whereat she blushed, &amp; yet kissed him againe to hide her blushing.

Her apparrell of white, wrought vpon with broken knots, her horse, faire &amp; lustie, which she rid so, as might shew a fearefull boldnes, daring to doo that, which she knew that she knew not how to doo: and the sweetnes of her countenance did giue such a grace to what she did, that it did make hansome the vnhansomnes, and make the eye force the minde to beleeue, that there was a praise in that vnskilfulnesse. But she straight approached me, and with fewe words (which borowed the help of her countenance to make themselues vnderstood) she desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to accept her in my seruice; telling me, she was a noble-mans sonne of <hi>Iberia,</hi> her name <hi>Daiphantus,</hi> who hauing seene what I had done in that court, had stolne from her father, to follow me. I enquired the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the maner of <hi>Andromanas</hi> following me, which by her I vnderstood, she hiding nothing (but her sexe) from me. And still me thought I had seen that face, but the great alteration of her fortune, made her far distant from my memorie: but liking very well the yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, (such I tooke her to be<hi>)</hi> admitted this <hi>Daiphan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> about me: who well shewed, there is no seruice like his, that serues because he loues.

In which time we brought to good end, a cruell warre long maintained betweene the King of <hi>Bythinia</hi> and his brother.

But he (no more wittie to frame, then blinde to iudge hopes) bitte hastely at the baite, and in priuate maner poasted toward her, but by the way he was met by this Knight, far better accompanied, who quickly laid holde of him, &amp; condemned him to death, cruell inough, if any thing may be both cruell and iust. For he caused him to be kept in a miserable prison, till a day appointed, at which time he would deliuer him to be deuoured by a monstrous beast, of most vgly shape, armed like a <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> as strong as an Elephant, as fierce as a Lion, as nimble as a Leopard, and as cruell as a Tigre: whom he hauing kept in a strong place, from the first youth of it, now thought no fitter match, then such a beastly monster with a monstrous Tyrant: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming yet withall, that if any so well loued him, as to venture their liues against this beast, for him, if they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame, he should be saued: not caring how many<pb facs="tcp:11334:212"/> they were (such confidence he had in the monsters strength) but especially hoping to entrappe therby the great courages of <hi>Tydeus</hi> and <hi>Telenor,</hi> whom he no lesse hated, because they had bene principall instruments of the others power.</p>

But these causes indeed mouing vs to come by this land, we embarked our selues in the next porte, whether all those Princes (sauing <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as he pretended, not able to tarry long from <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) conueied vs. And there found we a ship most royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnished by <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> who made all thinges so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (as well for our defence, as ease) that all the other Princes greatly commended him for it: who (seeming a quite altered man) had nothing but repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance in his eies, friendship in his gesture, &amp; vertue in his mouth: so that we who had promised the sweete <hi>Zelmanc</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, now not onely forgaue, but began to fauour; perswading our selues with a youthfull credulitie, that perchance things were not so euil as we tooke them, &amp; as it were desiring our owne memorie, that it might be so. But so were we licensed from those Princes, truly not without teares, especially of the vertuous <hi>Leonatus,</hi> who with the king of <hi>Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tus,</hi> would haue come with vs, but that we (in respect of the ones young wife, &amp; both their new settled kingdomes) would not suffer it. Then would they haue sent whole fleets to guard vs: but we, that desired to passe secretely into <hi>Greece,</hi> made them leaue that motion, when they found that more ships, then one, would be displeasing vnto vs. But so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selues to the vncertaine discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wind, we (then determining as soone as we came to <hi>Greece,</hi> to take the names of <hi>Daiphantus</hi> and <hi>Palladius,</hi> as well for our owne promise to <hi>Zelmane,</hi> as because we desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to come vnknowne into <hi>Greece</hi>) left the <hi>Asian</hi> shore full of Princely persons, who euen vpon their knees, recommended our safeties to the deuotion of<pb facs="tcp:11334:214"/> their chiefe desires: among whom none had bene so officious (though I dare affirme, all quite contrarie to his vnfaithfulness) as <hi>Plexirtus.</hi>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>2</label> So hauing sailed almost two daies, looking for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but when we might looke vpon the land, a graue man (whom we had seene of great trust with <hi>Plexir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and was sent as our principall guide) came vnto vs, and with a certaine kinde manner, mixt with shame, and repentaunce, began to tell vs, that he had taken such a loue vnto vs (considering our youth and fame) that though he were a seruaunt, and a seruaunt of such trust about <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> as that he had committed vnto him euen those secretes of his hart, which abhorde all other knowledge; yet he rather chose to reueale at this time a most pernitious counsell, then by concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it bring to ruin those, whom he could not choose but honour. So went he on, and tolde vs, that <hi>Plexir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (in hope thereby to haue <hi>Artaxia,</hi> endewed with the great Kingdome of <hi>Armenia,</hi> to his wife) had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him order, when we were neere <hi>Greece,</hi> to finde some opportunitie to murder vs, bidding him to take vs a sleepe, because he had seene what we could do wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Now sirs (said he) I would rather a thousand times loose my life, then haue my remembrance (while I liued) poysoned with such a mischiefe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it were onely I, that knewe herein the Kings order, then should my disobedience be a warrant of your safetie. But to one more (said he) namely the Captaine of the shippe, <hi>Plexirtus</hi> hath opened so much touching the effect of murdering you, though I think, laying the cause rather vpon old grudge, then his hope of <hi>Artaxia.</hi> And my selfe, (before the consideration<pb n="210" facs="tcp:11334:214"/> of your excellencies had drawne loue and pittie into minde) imparted it to such, as I thought fittest for such a mischiefe. Therefore, I wishe you to stand vpon your garde, assuring you, that what I can doo for your safetie, you shall see (if it come to the pushe) by me perfourmed. We thanked him, as the matter indeed deserued, and from that time would no more disarme our selues, nor the one sleepe without his friendes eyes waked for him: so that it delaied the going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of their bad enterprize, while they thought it rather chaunce, then prouidence, which made vs so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our selues.</p>
               <p>But when we came within halfe a daies sayling of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>3</label> the shore, soone they saw it was speedily, or not at all to be done. Then (and I remember it was about the first watch in the night) came the Captaine and whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered the councellour in the eare: But he (as it should seem) disswading him from it, the Captaine (who had bene a pyrate from his youth, and often blouded in it) with a lowde voice sware, that if <hi>Plexirtus</hi> bad him, he would not sticke to kill God him selfe. And therewith cald his mates, and in the Kings name willed them to take vs, aliue or dead; encouraging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the spoile of vs, which he said, (&amp; indeed was true) would yeeld many exceeding rich iewels. But the Councellour (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise) commanded them they should not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit such a villany, protesting that he would sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d betweene them and the Kings anger therein. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Captaine enraged: Nay (said he) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we must begin with this traitor him selfe: and therewith gaue him a sore blow vpon the head, who honestly did the best he could to reuenge himselfe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11334:215"/>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>4</label> But then we knew it time rather to encounter, then waite for mischiefe. And so against the Captaine we went, who straight was enuironned with most parte of the Souldiers and Mariners. And yet the truth is, there were some, whom either the authoritie of the councellour, doubt of the Kings minde, or liking of vs, made draw their swords of our side: so that quickly it grew a most confused fight. For the narrownesse of the place, the darkenesse of the time, and the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in such a tumult how to know frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds from foes, made the rage of swordes rather guide, then be guided by their maisters. For my cousin and me, truly I thinke we neuer perfourmed lesse in any place, doing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurte, then the defence of our selues, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring them who came for it, draue vs to: for not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning perfectlie, who were for, or against vs, we thought it lesse euill to spare a foe, then spoyle a friend. But from the hiest to the lowest parte of the shippe there was no place lefte, without cries of murdring, and murdred persons. The Captaine I hapt a while to fight withall, but was driuen to parte with him, by hearing the crie of the Councellour, who receiued a mortall wounde, mistaken of one of his owne side. Some of the wiser would call to parley, &amp; wish peace, but while the wordes of peace were in their mouthes, some of their auditours gaue them death for their hire. So that no man almost could conceiue hope of liuing, but being lefte aliue: and therefore euery one was willing to make him selfe roome, by dispatching almost any other: so that the great number in the ship was reduced to exceeding few, when of those few the most part weary of those troubles leapt into the boate,<pb n="211" facs="tcp:11334:215"/> which was fast to the ship: but while they that were first, were cutting of the rope that tied it, others came leaping in, so disorderly, that they drowned both the boate, and themselues.</p>
               <p>But while euen in that little remnant (like the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> of <hi>Cadmus</hi>) we continued still to slay one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a fire, which (whether by the desperate malice of some, or intention of separate, or accidentally while all things were cast vp and downe) it should seeme had taken a good while before, but neuer heeded of vs, (who onely thought to preserue, or reuenge) now vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently burst out in many places, and began to maister the principall partes of the ship. Then necessitie made vs see, that, a common enimy sets at one a ciuill warre: for that little all we were (as if we had bene waged by one man to quench a fire) streight went to resist that furious enimie by all art and labour: but it was too late, for already it did embrace and deuoure from the sterne, to the wast of the ship: so as labouring in vaine, we were driuen to get vp to the prowe of the ship, by the worke of nature seeking to preserue life, as long as we could: while truely it was a straunge and ougly sight, to see so huge a fire, as it quickly grew to be, in the Sea, and in the night, as if it had come to light vs to death. And by and by it had burned off the maste, which all this while had prowdly borne the sayle (the winde, as might seeme, delighted to carrie fire and bloud in his mouth) but now it fell ouer boord, and the fire growing neerer vs, it was not onely terrible in respect of what we were to attend, but insupportable through the heat of it.</p>
               <p>So that we were constrained to bide it no longer,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>6</label>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11334:216"/> but disarming and stripping our selues, and laying our selues vpon such things, as we thought might help our swimming to the lande (too far for our owne strength to beare vs) my cousin and I threw our selues into the Sea. But I had swomme a very little way, when I felt (by reason of a wound I had) that I should not be able to bide the trauaile, and therefore seeing the maste (whose tackling had bene burnt of) flote cleare from the ship, I swamme vnto it, and getting on it, I found mine owne sworde, which by chaunce, when I threw it away (caught by a peece of canuas) had honge to the maste. I was glad, because I loued it well; but gladder, when I saw at the other end, the Captaine of the ship, and of all this mischiefe; who hauing a long pike, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like had borne him selfe vp with that, till he had set him selfe vpon the mast. But when I perceiued him, Villaine (said I) doost thou thinke to ouerliue so many honest men, whom thy falsehood hath brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction? with that bestriding the mast, I gat by little and little towards him, after such a manner as boies are wont (if euer you saw that sport) when they ride the wild mare. And he perceiuing my intention, like a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that had much more courage then honestie, set him selfe to resist. But I had in short space gotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and (giuing him a sound blowe) sent him to feede fishes. But there my selfe remainde, vntill by py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates I was taken vp, and among them againe taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and brought into <hi>Laconia.</hi>

And then he faine would haue remembred to haue forgot himselfe. But she, with a sweetly disobeying grace, desired that her desire (once for euer) might serue, that no spotte might disgrace that loue which shortly she hoped shold be to the world warrantable. Faine he would not haue heard, til she threatned anger. And then the poore louer durst not, because he durst not. Nay I pray thee, deare <hi>Pyrocles</hi> (said she) let me haue my story.

Yet before they could winne the lodge by twentie paces, they were ouertaken by an vnruly sort of clownes, and other rebels, which like a violent floud, were caried, they themselues knewe not whether. But assoone as they came within perfect discerning these Ladies, like enraged beastes, without respect of their estates, or pitie of their sexe, they began to runne against them, as right villaines, thinking abilitie to doo hurt, to be a great aduancement: yet so many as they were, so many almost were their mindes, all knitte together onely in madnes.

                  <hi>Zelmane</hi>(whose vertuous couragé was euer awake) drew out her sword, which vpon those il-armed churls giuing as many wounds as blowes, &amp; as many deathes almost as wounds (lightning courage, and thundering smart vpon them) kept them at a bay, while the two Ladies got the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues into the lodge: out of the which, <hi>Basilius</hi> (hauing put on an armour long vntried) came to proue his authoritie among his subiects, or at lest, to aduenture his life with his deare mistresse, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he brought a shield, while the Ladies tremblingly attended the issue of this dangerous aduenture. But <hi>Zelmane</hi>

                  <hi>mane</hi> made them perceiue the ods betweene an Eagle and a Knight, with such a nimble stayednes, and such an assured nimblenes, that while one was running backe for feare, his fellow had her sword in his guts.</p>
               <p>And by and by was both her harte and helpe well <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>8</label> encreased by the comming of <hi>Dorus,</hi> who hauing been making of hurdles for his masters sheepe, hearde the horrible cries of this madde multitude; and hauing streight represented before the eies of his carefull loue, the perill wherein the soule of his soule might be, he went to <hi>Pamelas</hi> lodge, but found her in a caue hard by, with <hi>Mopsa</hi> and <hi>Dametas,</hi> who at that time would not haue opened the entrie to his father. And therefore leauing them there (as in a place safe, both for being strong, and vnknowen) he ranne as the noise guyded him. But when he saw his friend in such danger among them, anger and contempt (asking no counsell but of courage) made him roome among them, with no other weapon but his sheephooke, and with that ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing one of the villaines, took away a two-hand sword from him, and withall, helpt him from euer being asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of losing it. Then lifting vp his braue head, and flashing terror into their faces, he made armes &amp; legs goe complaine to the earth, how euill their masters had kept them. Yet the multitude still growing, and the verie killing wearying them (fearing, left in long fight they should be conquered with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quering) they drew back toward the lodge; but drew back in such sort, that still their terror went forwarde: like a valiant mastisse, whom when his master pulles backe by the taile from the beare (with whom he hath alreadie interchanged a hatefull imbracement) though his pace be backwarde,<pb facs="tcp:11334:220"/> his gesture is foreward, his teeth and eyes threatening more in the retiring, then they did in the aduancing: so guided they themselues homeward, neuer stepping steppe backward, but that they proued themselues ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the ground where they stept.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>9</label> Yet among the rebels there was a dapper fellowe, a tayler by occupation, who fetching his courage onelie from their going back, began to bow his knees, &amp; very fencer-like to draw neere to <hi>Zelmane.</hi> But as he came within her dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, turning his sword very nicely about his crown, <hi>Basilius,</hi> with a side blow, strake of his nose. He (being a suiter to a seimsters daughter, and therfore not a little grieued for such a disgrace<hi>)</hi> stouped downe, because he had hard, that if it were fresh put to, it would cleaue on againe. But as his hand was on the grounde to bring his nose to his head, <hi>Zelmane</hi> with a blow, sent his head to his nose. That saw a butcher, a butcherlie chuffe indeed (who that day was sworn brother to him in a cup of wine) &amp; lifted vp a great leauer, calling <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> all the vile names of a butcherly eloquence. But she (letting slippe the blowe of the leauer) hitte him so surely on the side of his face, that she lefte nothing but the nether iawe, where the tongue still wagged, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to say more, if his masters reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance had serued. O (said a miller that was halfe dronke) see the lucke of a good fellow, and with that word, ran with a pitchforke at <hi>Dorus:</hi> but the nimblenes of the wine caried his head so fast, that it made it ouer-runne his feet, so that he fell withall, iust betwene the legs of <hi>Dorus:</hi> who setting his foote on his neck (though he offered two milche kine, and foure fatte hogs for his life) thrust his sword quite through, from one eare to the other; which toke it very<pb n="216" facs="tcp:11334:220"/> vnkindlie, to feele such newes before they heard of them, in stead of hearing, to be put to such feeling. But <hi>Dorus</hi> (leauing the miller to vomit his soul out in wine and bloud) with his two-hand sword strake of another quite by the waste, who the night before had dreamed he was growen a couple, and (interpreting it he should be maried) had bragd of his dreame that morning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his neighbors. But that blow astonished quite a poore painter, who stood by with a pike in his handes. This painter was to counterfette the skirmishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the <hi>Centaures</hi> and <hi>Lapithes,</hi> and had bene very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to see some notable wounds, to be able the more liuely to expresse them; and this morning (being caried by the streame of this companie) the foolish felow was euen delighted to see the effect of blowes. But this last, (hapning neere him) so amazed him, that he stood still, while <hi>Dorus</hi> (with a turne of his sword) strake of both his hands. And so the painter returned, well skilled in wounds, but with neuer a hand to performe his skill.</p>

But <hi>Zelmane</hi> seeing no way of defence, not time to deliberate (the number of those villaines still encreasing, and their madnesse still encreasing with their number) thought it onely the meanes to goe beyond their expectation with an vnused boldenesse, and with danger to auoide danger: and therefore ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe the gate, and (<hi>Dorus</hi> and <hi>Basilius</hi> standing redie for her defence) she issued againe among them. The blowes she had dealt before (though all in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall were hastie) made each of them in particular take breath, before they brought them sodainly ouer-neere her, so that she had time to gette vp to the iudgement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate of the Prince, which (according to the guise of that countrie) was before the gate. There she paused a while, making signe with her hand vnto them, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, speaking aloud, that she had something to say vnto them, that would please them. But she was answered a while with nothing but shouts and cries; and some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to throw stones at her, not daring to approach her. But at length, a young farmer (who might do most among the countrie sort; and was caught in a little affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towardes <hi>Zelmane</hi>) hoping by this kindenesse to haue some good of her, desired them, if they were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, to heare the woman speake. Fie fellowes, fie, (said he) what will all the maides in our towne say, if so many tall men shall be afraide to heare a faire wench? I sweare vnto you by no little ones, I had rather giue my teeme of oxen, then we should shewe our selues so vnciuill wights. Besides, I tell you true, I haue heard it<pb n="217" facs="tcp:11334:222"/> of old men counted wisdome, to heare much, &amp; say lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. His sententious speech so preuailed, that the most parte began to listen. Then she, with such efficacie of gracefulnes, &amp; such a quiet magnanimitie represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in her face in this vttermost perill, as the more the barbarous people looked, the more it fixed their looks vpon her, in this forte began vnto them.</p>
               <p>It is no small comfort vnto me (said she) hauing to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>2</label> speake something vnto you for your owne behoofs, to find that I haue to deale with such a people, who shew indeed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues the right nature of valure, which as it leaues no violence vnattempted, while the choller is nourished with resistance; so when the subiect of their wrath, doth of it self vnloked-for offer it self into their hands, it makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at lest take a pause before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine cruelty. Now then first (before I come to the principall matter) haue I to say vnto you; that your Prince <hi>Basilius</hi> himselfe in person is within this Lodge, &amp; was one of the three, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a few of you went about to fight withall: (&amp; this she said, not doubting but they knew it well inough; but because she would haue them imagine, that the Prince might think that they did not know it) by him am I sent vnto you, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Prince to his well approoued subiects, nay as from a father to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued children, to know what it is that hath bred iust quarrell among you, or who they be that haue any way wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged you? what it is with which you are displeased, or of which you are desirous? This he requires: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (for he knowes your faithfulnes) he commaunds you presently to set downe, &amp; to choose among your selues some one, who may relate your griefes or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes vnto him.</p>

At length they fel to direct contrarieties.

And of ech side were like diuisions, one neighbourhood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to find fault with another. But no confusion was greater then of particular mens likings and disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings: one dispraising such a one, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another praised, &amp; demanding such a one to be punished, whom the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would haue exalted. No lesse ado was there about choosing him, who should be their spokes-man.

O vnhappie men, more madde then the Giants that would haue plucked <hi>Iupiter</hi> out of heauen, how long shal this rage continue? why do you not all throw downe your weapons, and submit your<pb n="221" facs="tcp:11334:226"/> selues to our good Prince, our good <hi>Basilius,</hi> the <hi>Pelops</hi> of wisdom, &amp; <hi>Minos</hi> of all good gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? when will you begin to beleue me, and other honest and faithfull subiects, that haue done all we could to stop your surie?</p>
               <p>The farmer that loued <hi>Zelmane</hi> could abide him no <label type="milestone">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, hoping to haue gotten great soueramties, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest <hi>Zelmane</hi>: so now perceiuing, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, once any thing downe the hill from their furie, would neuer stop till they came to the bottom of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute yeelding, and so that he should be nearer feares of punishment, then hopes of such aduancement, he was one of them that stood most against the agreement: and to begin withall, disdaining this fellow should play the preacher, who had bin one of the chiefest make-bates, strake him a great wound vpon the face with his sword. The cowardly wretch fell down, crying for succour, &amp; (scrambling through the legs of them that were about him) gat to the throne, where <hi>Zelmane</hi> tooke him, and comforted him, bleeding for that was past, and quaking for feare of more.</p>
               <p>But as soone as that blow was giuen (as if <hi>AEolus</hi> had <label type="milestone">

For being diuided in minds &amp; not diuided in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies, they that would yeeld to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius</hi> were intermingled with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would not yeeld. These men thinking their ruine stood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it; those men to get fauor of their Prince, conuerted their vngracious motion into their owne bowels, &amp; by a true iudgement grew their owne punishers. None was sooner killed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those that had bene leaders in the disobedience: who<pb facs="tcp:11334:227"/> by being so, had taught them, that they did leade dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the same leaders. And many times it fel out that they killed them that were of their owne faction, anger whetting, and doubt hastening their fingers. But then came downe <hi>Zelmane</hi>; and <hi>Basilius</hi> with <hi>Dorus</hi> is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, and sometimes seeking to draw together those of their party, somtimes laying indifferently among them, made such hauocke (amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the rest <hi>Zel-mane</hi> striking the farmer to the hart with her sworde, as before she had done with her eyes) that in a while all they of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary side were put to flight, and fled to certaine woods vpon the frontiers; where feeding coldly, and drinking onely water, they were disciplined for their dronken ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots; many of them being slaine in that chase, about a score onely escaping. But when these late rebels, nowe souldiers, were returned from the chase, <hi>Basilius</hi> calling them togither, partly for policy sake, but principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Zelmane</hi> before had spoken it (which was to him more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a diuine ordinance) he pronounced their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall pardon, willing them to returne to their houses, and therafter be more circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spect in their proceedings: which they did most of them with share-marks of their folly. But imagining <hi>Clinias</hi> to be one of the chiefe that had bred this good alteration, he gaue him particular thanks, and withall willed him to make him know, how this frenzie had entred into the people.</p>

                  <hi>Clinias</hi> purposing indeede to tell him the trueth of al, sauing what did touch himself, or <hi>Cecropia,</hi> first, dipping his hand in the blood of his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, Now by this blood (said he) which is more deare to me, then al the rest that is in my body, since it is spent for your safety: this to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue (perchance vnfortunate, but neuer false) shall not now begin to lie vnto my Prince, of me most beloued. Then<pb n="222" facs="tcp:11334:227"/> stretching out his hand, and making vehement counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces the vshers to his speches, in such maner of tearms recounted this accident. Yesterday (said he) being your birth-day, in the goodly greene two mile hence before the city of <hi>Enispus,</hi> to do honour to the day, were a four or fiue thousand people (of all conditions, as I thinke) gathered together, spending al the day in dancings and other exercises: and when night came, vndertents and bowes making great cheare, and meaning to obserue a wassaling watch all that night for your sake. <hi>Bacchus</hi> (the learned say) was begot with thunder : I think, that made him euer since so full of stur &amp; debate. <hi>Bacchus</hi> indeed it was which sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the first tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet to this rude alaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that barbarous opinion being generally among<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>them, to thinke with vice to do honor, &amp; with actiuitie in beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines to shew abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nce of loue, made most of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seeke to shew the depth of their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the depth of their draught. But being once wel chased with wine (hauing spent al the night, &amp; some peece of the morning in such reuelling) &amp; imboldned by your absented maner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, there was no matter their eares had euer heard of that grew not to be a subiect of their winie conference. I speake it by proofe: for I take witnes of the gods (who neuer leaue periuries vnpunished) that I ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cried out against their impudency, &amp; (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would not serue) stopt mine eares, because I wold not be partaker of their blasphemies, till with buffets they forced me to haue mine eares &amp; eies defiled. Publike affairs were minlegd with priuate grudges, neither was any man thoughts of wit, that did not pretende some cause of mislike. Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was counted the fruite of freedome, and saying nothing had his vttermoste prayse in ignoraunce. At the length, your sacred person (alas why did I<pb facs="tcp:11334:228"/> liue to heare it? alas how do I breath to vtter it? But your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement doth not onely enioine obedience, but giue me force: your sacred person (I say) fell to be their table-talke: a proud word swelling in their stomacks, &amp; disdainfull reproches against so great a greatnes, hauing put on the shew of greatnes in their little mindes: till at length the very vnbrideled vse of words hauing increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed fire in their mindes (which God knowes thought their knowledge notable, because they had at all no knowledge to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne their own want of knowledge) they descended (O neuer to be forgotten presumption) to a direct mislike of your liuing from among them. Whereupon it were tedious to remember their far-fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched constructions. But the summe was, you disdained them: and what were the pompes of your estate, if their armes mainteyned you not? Who woulde call you a Prince, if you had not a people? When cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of them of wretched estates, and worse mindes (whose fortunes, change could not impaire) began to say, that your gouernment was to be looked into; how the great treasures (you had leuied amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) had bene spent; why none but great men &amp; gentlemen could be admitted into counsel, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons (forsooth) were to plain headed to say their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: but yet their blood &amp; sweat must maintain all. Who could tell whether you were not betraied in this place, where you liued? nay whether you did liue or no? Therefore that it was time to come &amp; see; and if you were here, to know (if <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> were growne lothsome in your sight) why you did not ridde your selfe of the trouble? There would not want those that would take so faire a cumber in good part. Since the Countrie was theirs, and the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<pb n="223" facs="tcp:11334:228"/> an adherent to the countrie, why should they not consider of the one, as well as inhabite the other? Nay rather (said they) let vs beginne that, which all <hi>Arcadia</hi> will followe. Let vs deliuer our Prince from daunger of practises, and our selues from want of a Prince. Let vs doo that, which all the rest thinke. Let it be said, that we onely are not astonished with vaine titles, which haue their force but in our force. Lastly, to haue saide &amp; heard so much, was as da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, as to haue atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted: &amp; to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt they had the name of glorious liberty with them. These words being spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (like a furious storme) presently caried away their wel inclined braines. What I, and some other of the honester sort could do, was no more, then if with a puffe of breath, one should goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make a saile goe against a mightie winde: or, with one hand, stay the ruine of a mightie wall. So ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall grewe this madnes among them, there needed no drumme, where each man cried, each spake to other that spake as fast to him, and the disagreeing sounde of so many voices, was the chiefe token of their vnmeete agreement. Thus was their banquette turned to a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, their winie mirthes to bloudie rages, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie prayers for your life, to monstrous threatning of your estate; the solemnizing your birth-day, tended to haue been the cause of your funerals. But as a dronken rage hath (besides his wickednes) that follie, that the more it seekes to hurt, the lesse it considers how to be able to hurt: they neuer weyed how to arme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, but tooke vp euery thing for a weapon, that furie offered to their handes. Many swordes, pikes, and billes there were: others tooke pitchforkes and rakes, conuerting husbandrie to souldierie: some caught hold<pb facs="tcp:11334:229"/> of spittes (thinges seruiceable for life) to be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death. And there was some such one, who held the same pot wherein he drank to your health, to vse it (as he could) to your mischiefe. Thus armed, thus gouerned, forcing the vnwilling, and hartening the willing, adding furie to furie, and encreasing rage with running, they came headlong towarde this lodge: no man (I dare say) resolued in his own hart, what was the vttermost he would doo when he came hether. But as mischief is of such nature, that it cannot stand but with strengthning one euill by an other, and so multiplie in it selfe, till it come to the highest, and then fall with his owne weight: so to their mindes (once passed the bounds of obedience) more and more wickednes ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it selfe, so that they who first pretended to preserue you, then to reforme you, (I speak it in my conscience, and with a bleeding hart) now thought no safetie for them, without murdering you. So as if the Gods (who preserue you for the preseruation of <hi>Arcadia</hi>) had not shewed their miraculous power, and that they had not vsed for instruments, both your owne valour (not fit to be spoken of by so meane a mouth as mine) and some (I must confesse) honest minds, (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alas why should I mention, since what we did, reached not the hundred part of our duetie?) our hands (I tremble to think of it) had destroyed all that, for which we haue cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce that we are <hi>Arcadians.</hi>

But neuer was it his dooing to come so soone thence, till the coast were more assuredly cleare: for it was a rule with him, that <hi rend="margQuotes">after a great storme there euer fell a fewe droppes before it be fully finished.</hi> But <hi>Pamela</hi> (who had now experienced how much care doth sollicite a Louers hart) vsed this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of going to her parents and sister, indeed aswel for that cause, as being vnquiet, till her eye might be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how her shepheard had gone through the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But <hi>Basilius</hi> with the sight of <hi>Pamela</hi> (of whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most his head otherwise occupied, had left the wonted remembrance) was sodainly striken into a deuout kind of admiration, remembring the oracle, which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fauning humour of salfe hope) he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted now his owne to his owne best, and with the willing blindnesse of affection (because his minde ran wholly vpon <hi>Zelmane)</hi> he thought the Gods in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles did principally minde her.</p>
               <p>But as he was deepely thinking of the matter, one of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>3</label> the shepheards tolde him, that <hi>Philanax</hi> was already come with a hundred horse in his company. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by chaunce rid not farre of the little desert, he had heard of this vprore, and so was come vpon the spurre (gathering a company of Gentlemen as fast as he could) to the succour of his Master. <hi>Basilius</hi> was glad of it; but (not willing to haue him, nor any other of the Noble men, see his Mistresse<hi>)</hi> he himselfe went out of the Lodge, and so giuing order vnto him of placing garrisons, and examining these matters; and <hi>Philanax</hi> with humble earnestnesse beginning to entreate him to leaue of his solitarie course (which already had bene so daungerous vnto him) Well (said <hi>Basilius</hi>) it may be<pb facs="tcp:11334:231"/> ere long I wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>discend vnto your desire. In the meane time, take you the best order you can to keepe me safe in my solitarinesse. But, (said he) doo you remember, how earnestly you wrote vnto me, that I should not be moued by that Oracles authoritie, which brought me to this resolution? Full well Sir (answered <hi>Philanax</hi>) for though it pleased you not as then to let me knowe, what the Oracles words were, yet all Oracles holding (in my conceipt) one degree of reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it suffised me to know, it was but an Oracle, which led you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your owne course. Well (said <hi>Basilius</hi>) I will now tell you the wordes; which before I thought not good to doo; because when al the euents fall out (as some already haue done) I may charge you with your incredulitie. So he repeated them in this sorte.</p>

                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:11334:231"/> &amp; there receiued this answere: you replied to me, that the onely supernaturall causes were the humors of my body, which bred such melancholy dreames; and that both they framed a mind full of conceipts, apt to make presages of things, which in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaungeable: &amp; with all as I say, you reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber what you wrot vnto me, touching authoritie of the Oracle: but now I haue some notable triall of the truth therof, which herafter I wil more largly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate vnto you.

For that hath ben done by <hi>Zelmane,</hi> but not as I feared, to my ruine, but to my preseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had once named <hi>Zelmane,</hi> that name was as good as a pully, to make the clocke of his praises run on in such sort, that (<hi>Philanax</hi> found) was more exquisite then the only admiration of vertue breedeth: which his faithful hart inwardly repining at, made him shrinke away as soone as he could, to go about the other matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which <hi>Basilius</hi> had enioyned vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Basilius</hi> returned into the Lodge, thus by him selfe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>4</label> construing the oracle, that in that he said, his elder care should by Princely meane be stolne away from him, and yet not lost, it was now perfourmed, since <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> had as it were robd from him the care of his first begotten childe, yet was it not lost, since in his harte the ground of it remained. That his younger should with Natures blisse embrace the loue of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had so commaunded her for his sake to doo; yet shoulde it be with as much hate of Nature, for being so hatefull an opposite to the iealousie hee thought her mother had of him. The sitting in his<pb facs="tcp:11334:232"/> seate he deemed by her already perfourmed: but that which most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted him, was his interpretation of the adulterie, which he thought he should commit with <hi>Zelmane,</hi> whom afterwards he should haue to his wife. The point of his daughters marriage, because it threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his death withall, he determined to preuent, with keeping them vnmaried while he liued. But hauing as he thought, gotten thus much vnderstanding of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, he determined for three daies after to perfourme certaine rites to <hi>Apollo</hi>: and euen then began with his wife and daughters to singe this Hymne, by them yearely vsed.</p>

But imagining no so true propertie of souereigntie, as to do what he listed, and to list whatsoeuer pleased his fansie, he quickly made his kingdome a Teniscourt, where his subiects should be the balles; not in truth cruelly, but licenciously abusing them, presuming so far vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that what he did was liked of euery bodie: nay, that his disgraces were fauours, and all because he was a King. For in Nature not able to conceyue the bonds of great matters (suddenly borne into an vnknowne Ocean of absolute power) he was swayed withall (he knewe not howe) as euerie winde of passions puffed him. Whereto nothing helped him better, then that poysonous sugar of flatterie: which some vsed, out of the innate basenesse of their hart, straight like dogges sawning vppon the greatest; others secretely hating him, and disdayning his great rising so suddenly, so vndeseruedly (finding his humour) bent their exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him only to his ouerthrow; like the bird that caries the shell-fish high, to breake him the easier with his fall.<pb facs="tcp:11334:234"/> But his minde (being an apt matter to receiue what forme their amplifying speeches woulde lay vpon it) daunced so prettie a musicke to their false measure, that he thought himselfe the wysest, the woorthyest, and best beloued, that euer gaue honour to a royall tytle.

So borne by the hastie tide of short leysure, he did hastily deliuer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his affection, and affectionate care. But she (as if he had spoken of a small matter, when he mencioned her life, to which she had not leisure to attend<hi>)</hi> desired him if he loued her, to shew it, in finding some way to saue <hi>Antiphilus.</hi> For her, she found the world but a wearisom stage vnto her, where she played a part against her will: and therefore besought him, not to cast his loue in so vnfruitfull a place, as could not loue it selfe: but for a testimonie of constancie, and a sutablenes to his word, to do so much comfort to her minde, as that for her sake <hi>Antiphilus</hi> were saued. He tolde me how much he argued against her tendering him, who had so vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully betraied her, and foolishly cast away himselfe. But perceiuing she did not only bend her very good wits to speake for him against her-selfe, but when such a cause could be allied to no reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet loue would needs make it-self a cause, &amp; barre her rather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hearing, then yeeld that she should yeeld to such arguments: he likewise in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the power of Loue (as they say of spirits) was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the loue in her, with griefe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sented, &amp; (though backwardly) was dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to labor the help of <hi>Antiphilus:</hi> a man whom he not onely hated, as a trair our to <hi>Erona,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11334:236"/> but enuied as a possessor of <hi>Erona.</hi> Yet Loue sware, his hart, in spite of his hart, should make him become a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant to his riuall. And so did he, seeking all the meanes of perswading <hi>Artaxia,</hi> which the authority of so neere, and so vertuous a kinsma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would giue vnto him. But she to whom the eloquence of hatred had giuen reuenge the face of delight, reiected all such motions; but rather the more closely imprisoning them in her chiefe citie, where she kept them with intention at the birth-day of <hi>Tiridates</hi> (which was very nere) to execute <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> &amp; at the day of his death (which was about halfe a yeere after) to vse the same rigor towars <hi>Erona. Plangus</hi> much grieued (because much louing) attempted the humors of the <hi>Lycians,</hi> to see, whether they would come in with forces to succor their Princesse. But there the next inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritor to the crowne (with the true play that is vsed in the game of kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) had no sooner his mistres in captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but he had vsurped her place, &amp; making her odious to her people, because of the vnfit electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she had made, had so left no hope there: but which is worse, had sent to <hi>Artaxia,</hi> perswading the iusticing her, because that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice might giue his title the name of iustice. Wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting that way, <hi>Plangus</hi> practised with some deere friends of his, to saue <hi>Antiphilus</hi> out of prison, whose day because it was much neerer then <hi>Eronaes,</hi> &amp; that he wel found, she had twisted her life vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same threed with his, he determined first to get him out of prison: &amp; to that end ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prepared al matters as wel as in such case he could, where <hi>Artaxia</hi> had set many of <hi>Tiridates</hi> old seruants to haue well-marking eyes, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred with <hi>Antiphilus,</hi> as (by the auothoritie he had) he found meanes to do; &amp; agreed with him of the time and maner, how he should<pb n="231" facs="tcp:11334:236"/> by the death of some of his iaylors escape.</p>
               <p>But all being well ordered, and <hi>Plangus</hi> willinglie <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>6</label> putting himselfe into the greatest danger, <hi>Antiphilus</hi> (who, like a bladder, sweld redie to breake, while it was full of the winde of prosperitie, that being out, was so abiected, as apt to be trode on by euery bodie) when it came to the point, that with some hazard, he might be in apparant likelihoode to auoide the vttermost harm, his harte fainted, and (weake foole, neither hoping, nor fearing as he should) gat a conceite, that with bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his practise, he might obtaine pardon: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, euen a little before <hi>Plangus</hi> should haue come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, opened the whole practise to him that had the charge, with vnpittyed teares idly protesting, he had rather die by <hi>Artaxias</hi> commaundement, then against her will escape: yet begging life vpon any the hardest, and wretchedest conditions that she woulde lay vpon him. His keeper prouided accordingly, so that when <hi>Plangus</hi> came, he was like, himself to haue bene entrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud: but that finding (with a luckie in-sight) that it was discouered, he retired; and (calling his friendes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him) stood vpon his guard, as he had good cause. For, <hi>Artaxia</hi> (accounting him most vngrateful, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that her brother and she, had not onely preserued him against the malice of his father, but euer vsed him much liker his birth, then his fortune) sent forces to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him. But he among the martiall men had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so great loue, that he could not onely keep himselfe from the malice, but worke in their mindes a compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Eronas</hi> aduersitie.</p>
               <p>But for the succour of <hi>Antiphilus</hi> he could gette no <label type="milestone">

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>8</label> But <hi>Plangus</hi> well perceiuing that <hi>Artaxia</hi> staied one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the appointed day, that the faire <hi>Eronas</hi> bodie, (consumed to ashes) should make a notorious testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, how deepely her brothers death was engrauen in her brest, he assembled good numbers of friendes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his vertue (though a stranger) had tied vnto him, by force to giue her libertie. Contrariwise, <hi>Artaxia,</hi> to whom Anger gaue more courage then her sexe did feare, vsed her regall authoritie (the most she could) to suppresse that sedition, and haue her will: which (she thought) is the most princely thing that may be. But <hi>Plangus,</hi> who indeede (as all men witnes) is one of the best captains (both for policie and valour) that are trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the schoole of <hi>Mars,</hi> in a conflict ouerthrew <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxias</hi> power, though of far greater number: and there toke prisoner a base sonne of her brothers, whom she deerly affected, &amp; then sent her word that he should run the same race of fortune (whatsoeuer it was) that <hi>Erona</hi> did: &amp; happy was that threatning for her; for els <hi>Artaxia</hi> had hastened the day of her death, in respecte of those tumults.</p>

But by the way it was his fortune to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept letters, written by <hi>Artaxia</hi> to <hi>Plexirtus:</hi> wherein she signified her accepting him to her husband, whom she had euer fauoured, so much the rather, as he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed the conditions of her mariage, in bringing to their deserued end, her greatest enemies: withall, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the sea, in such tearmes, as he might well perceiue, it was by some treason wrought in <hi>Plexirtus</hi> shippe. Whereupon (to make more diligent search) he tooke shippe himselfe, and came into <hi>Laconia,</hi> enquiring, and by his enquirie finding, that such a shippe was indeede with fight, and fire, perished, none (almost) escaping. But for <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus,</hi> it was assuredly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they were cast away: for the name of such Princes (especially in <hi>Greece)</hi> would quickly els haue bene a large witnesse to the contrarie. Full of griefe with that, for the losse of such, who left the world poor of perfection: but more sorie for <hi>Eronas</hi> sake, who now by them could not be relieued. A new aduertisement from <hi>Armenia</hi> ouertooke him, which multiplied the<pb n="233" facs="tcp:11334:238"/> force of his anguish. It was a message from the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had <hi>Erona</hi> in ward, giuing him to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that since his departure, <hi>Artaxia</hi> (vsing the benefite of time) had besieged him in his castell, demaunding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent deliuery of her, whom yet for his faith giuen, he would not, before the day appointed, if possibly he could resist, which he foresaw, lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g he should not do for want of victuall, which he had not so wisely prouided, because he trusted vpon the generall oth taken for two yeares space: &amp; therfore willed him to make hast to his succour, &amp; come with no small forces; for all they that were of his side in <hi>Armenia,</hi> were consumed, &amp; <hi>Artaxia</hi> had encreased her might by mariage of <hi>Plexirtus,</hi> who now crowned King there, stickt not to glory in the murder of <hi>Pyrocles</hi> and <hi>Musidorus,</hi> as hauing iust cause thereto, in respect of the deaths of his sister <hi>Andromana,</hi> her sonne his nephew, and his own daughter <hi>Zelmane,</hi> all whose losse he vniustly charged them withal, &amp; now openly stickt not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, what a reuenge his wit had brought forth. <hi>Plangus</hi> much astonished herewith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himselfe what to doo. For to returne to <hi>Armenia</hi> was vaine, since his friends there were vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought he of going to his father; but he had already (euen since the death of his stepmother, &amp; brother) attempted the recouering his fauour, &amp; all in vaine. For they, that had before ioined with <hi>Andromana</hi> to do him the wrong, thought now no life for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he returned, &amp; therfore kept him stil (with new forged sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions) odious to his father. So that <hi>Plangus</hi> reseruing that for a worke of longer time, then the sauing of <hi>Ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> could beare, determined to go to the mighty and good King <hi>Euarchus:</hi> who lately hauing (to his eternall fame) fully, not onely conquered his enimies, but esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished<pb facs="tcp:11334:239"/> good gouernment in their countries, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped he might haue present succour of him, both for the iustnes of the cause, &amp; reuenge of his childrens death, by so hainous a treason murthered. Therefore with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence he went to him; &amp; by the way (passing through my country) it was my hap to find him, the most ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with griefe, that euer I hope to see againe. For stil it seemed he had <hi>Erona</hi> at a stake before his eies; such an apprehension he had taken of her daunger; which in despite of all the comfort I could giue him, he poured out in such lamentations, that I was moued not to let him passe, till he had made full declaration, which by peeces my daughters &amp; I haue deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you. Fayne he would haue had succour of my selfe, but the course of my life being otherwise bent, I onely accompanied him with some that might safely guide him to the great <hi>Euarchus</hi>: for my parte hauing had some of his speeches so feelingly in my memory, that at an idle time (as I tolde you) I set them downe Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue-wise, in such manner as you haue seene. And thus, excellent Ladie, I haue obeyed you in this storie; wherein if it well please you to consider, what is the straunge power of Loue, and what is due to his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, you shall exercise therein the true noblenesse of your iudgement, and doo the more right to the vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Historian. <hi>Zelmane</hi> (sighing for <hi>Eronaes</hi> sake, yet inwardly comforted in that she assured her selfe, <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> would not spare to take in hande the iust deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of her, ioyned with the iust reuenge of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens losse) hauing now what she desired of <hi>Basilius,</hi> to auoide his further discourses of affection, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the shepheards to begin, whom she saw all ready for them.</p>

Their breasts liberall to the eye: the face of the formoste of of them, in excellencie faire; and of the rest louely, if not beautifull: and beautifull would haue bene, if they had not suffered greedy <hi>Phaebus,</hi> ouer-often, and harde, to kisse them. Their countenaunces full of a gracefull grauitie; so as the gesture matcht with the apparrell, it might seem a wanton modestie, and an entising sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Each of them had an instrument of musick in their hands, which consorting their wel-pleasing tunes, did charge each eare with vnsensiblenes, that did not lende it selfe vnto them. The Musicke entring alone into the lodge, the Ladies were all desirous to see from whence so pleasant a guest was come: and therefore went out together; where, before they coulde take the paines to doubt, much lesse to aske the question of their qualitie, the fairest of them (with a gay, but yet discreete demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) in this sort spake vnto them. Most excellent La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, (whose excellencies haue power to make cities enuie these woods, and solitarines to be accounted the sweetest companie) vouchsafe our message your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearing, which as it comes from Loue, so comes it from louely persons. The maides of all this coast of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> vnderstanding the often accesse that certaine<pb n="249" facs="tcp:11334:254"/> shepheards of these quarters, are allowed to haue in this forbidden place; and that their rurall sports are not disdained of you, haue bene stird with emulation to them, and affection to you, to bring forth some thing, which might as well breede your contentment: and therefore hoping that the goodnes of their intention, &amp; the hurtlesnes of their sex shall excuse the breach of the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to this place vnsent for, they chose out vs, to inuite both your princely parents, &amp; your selues, to a place in the woods about half a mile hence: where they haue prouided some such sports, as they trust your gratious acceptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s will interpret to be deliteful. We haue bene at the other lodge, but finding them there, busied in weightier affaires, our trust is, that you yet will not denie the shining of your eies vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs.</p>
               <p>The Ladies stood in some doubte, whether they <label type="milestone">

But <hi>Miso</hi> (that had bene at none of the pastorals, and had a great desire to lead her old senses abroad to some pleasure<hi>)</hi> told them plainely, they should nor will nor choose, but go thether, and make the honest countrie people know, that they were not so squeamish as folkes thought of them. The Ladies glad to be warranted by her authoritie; with a smiling humblenesse obeied her: <hi>Pamela</hi> only casting a seeking looke, whether she could see <hi>Dorus</hi> (who poore wretch wandred halfe mad for sorrow in the woods, crying for pardon of her, who could not heare him) but indeed was grieued for his absence, hauing giuen the wound to him through her owne harte. But so the three Ladies &amp; <hi>Miso</hi> went with those six <hi>Nymphes,</hi> conquering the length of the way with the force of musique, leauing only <hi>Mopsa</hi> behind,<pb facs="tcp:11334:255"/> who disgraced weeping with her countenaunce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her mother would not suffer her to shewe her newskoured face among them. But the place apointed (as they thought) met them halfe in their way, so well were they pleased with the sweete tunes and prettie conuersation of their inuiters. There founde they in the midst of the thickest part of the wood, a litle square place, not burdened with trees, but with a boord coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; beautified with the pleasantest fruites, that Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnd <hi>Autumne</hi> could deliuer vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

The Ladies would not shew to scorne their prouision, but eat, and dranke a little of their coole wine, which seemed to laugh for ioy to come to such lips.</p>

But when they had caried them a foure or fiue mile fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they lefte <hi>Miso</hi> with a gagge in her mouth, and bound hande and foote, so to take her fortune: and brought the three Ladies (by that time that the Night seemed with her silence to conspire to their treason)<pb n="250" facs="tcp:11334:255"/> to a castle about ten mile of from the Lodges: where they were fayne to take a boate whiche wayted for them. For the castle stood in the midst of a great lake, vppon a high rocke, where partly by Arte, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie by Nature, it was by all men esteemed impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p>But at the Castle gate their faces were discouered,<label type="milestone">

But <hi>Pamelas</hi> high harte disdayning humblenesse to iniurie, Aunt, (said she) what you haue determined of vs I pray you doo it speedily: for my part I looke for no seruice, where I finde violence.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cecropia</hi> (vsing no more wordes with them) conueyed them all three to seuerall lodgings (<hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> harte so swelling with spite, that she coulde not bring foorth a worde) and so lefte them: first taking from them their kniues, because they should do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues no hurte, before she had determined of them: and then giuing such order that they wanted nothing but libertie, &amp; comfort, she went to her sonne, who yet kept his bed, because of his wound he had receiued of <hi>Zelmane,</hi> &amp; told him, whom now he had in his power.<pb facs="tcp:11334:256"/> 
                  <hi>Amphialus</hi> was but euen then returned from far countries, where he had wonne immortall fame, both of courage &amp; curtesie, when he met with the Princesses, and was hurt by <hi>Zelmane,</hi> so as he was vtterly ignorant of all his mothers wicked deuises; to which he would neuer haue consented, being (like a rose out of a brier) an excellent sonne of an euill mother: and now when he heard of this, was as much amazed, as if he had seen the Sunne fall to the earth. And therefore desired his mother that she would tell him the whole discourse, how all these matters had happened.</p>

And howsoeuer I might be ashamed to tell it strangers, who would thinke it wickednesse, yet what is done for your sake (how euill soeuer to others) to you is vertue. To begin then euen with the beginning, this doting foole <hi>Basilius</hi> that now raignes, hauing liued vnmarried till he was nigh threescore yeares old (and in all his spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches affirming, and in all his dooings assuring, that he neuer would marrie) made all the eyes of the country to be bent vpon your father, his onely brother (but then younger by thirty yeares<hi>)</hi> as vpon the vndoubted successour: being indeed a man worthy to raigne, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nothing enough for himselfe: where this goose (you see) puts downe his head, before there be any thing neere to touch him. So that he holding place and estimation as heyre of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> obteyned me of my father the King of <hi>Argos,</hi> his brother helping to the conclusion, with protesting his bachelerly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for else you may be sure the King of <hi>Argos,</hi> nor his daughter would haue suffered their Royall bloud<pb n="251" facs="tcp:11334:256"/> to be stained with the base name of subiection. So that I came into this countrie as apparant Princesse therof, and accordingly was courted, and followed of all the Ladies of this countrie. My porte and pompe did well become a King of <hi>Argos</hi> daughter: in my presence their tongues were turned into eares, &amp; their cares were captiues vnto my tongue. Their eyes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired my Maiestie, &amp; happy was he or she, on whom I would suffer the beames thereof to fall. Did I goe to church? it seemed the very Gods wayted for me, their deuotions not being solemnized till I was ready. Did I walke abroad to see any delight? Nay, my walking was the delight it selfe: for to it was the concourse; one thrusting vpon another, who might shewe him selfe most diligent and seruiceable towardes me: my sleepes were inquired after, and my wakings neuer vnsaluted: the very gate of my house full of principall persons, who were glad, if their presents had receaued a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acceptation. And in this felicitie wert thou borne, the very earth submitting it selfe vnto thee to be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on as by his Prince; and to that passe had my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes vertue (by my good helpe) within short time brought it, with a plot we laide, as we should not haue needed to haue waited the tedious worke of a naturall end of <hi>Basilius</hi>; when the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (I thinke enuying my great felicity) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stopt thy fathers breath, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed nothing but power and soueraigntie.

It is certaine, <hi rend="margQuotes">it is not so great a spite to be surmounted by straungers, as by ones owne allies.</hi> Thinke then what my minde was, since withall there is no question: The fall is greater from the first to the second, then from the second to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermost. The rage did swell in my harte, so much the more as it was faine to be suppressed in sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with humblenes. But aboue al the rest, the griese of grieues was, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with these daughters (now thy priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) she cut of al hope of thy successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It was a tedious thing to me; that my eies should looke lower then any bodies, that (my selfe being by<hi>)</hi> anothers voice then mine, should be more respected. But it was insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto me, to think that not only I, but thou shouldst spend al thy time in such misery, &amp; that the Sun should see my eldest son lesse then a Prince. And though I had ben a sainct I could not choose, finding the chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge this chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of fortune bred vnto me, for now fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of followers, sile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce grew to be at my gate, &amp; abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in my presence. The guesse of my mind could preuaile more before, then now many of my earnest requests. And thou (my deare sonne) by the fickle multitude no more then any ordinary person (borne of the mud of the people) regarded. But I (reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring that <hi rend="margQuotes">in all mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries weeping becomes fooles, and practize wise folks</hi>) haue tried diuers meanes to pull vs out of the mire of subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And though many times Fortune failed me, yet did I neuer faile my self. Wild beasts I kept in a caue<pb n="252" facs="tcp:11334:257"/> hard by the lodges, which I caused by night to be fed in the place of their pastorals, I as then liuing in my house hard by the place, and against the houre they were to meete (hauing kept the beasts without meate) then let them loose, knowing that they would seeke their food there, and deuoure what they founde. But blind For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hating sharpe-sighted inuentions, made them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily to be killed. After, I vsed my seruant <hi>Clinias</hi> to stir a notable tumult of country people: but those louts were too grosse instruments for delicate conceits. Now lastly, finding <hi>Philanax</hi>-his examinations grow daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, I thought to play double or quit; &amp; with a sleight I vsed of my fine-witted we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch <hi>Artesia,</hi> with other maids of mine, would haue sent these good inheritrixes of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi> to haue pleaded their cause before <hi>Pluto,</hi> but that ouer-fortunatly for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you made me know the last day how vehemently this childish passion of loue doth tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you. Therefore I haue brought them vnto you, yet wishing rather hate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue in you. For Hate often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth victory; Loue commonly is the instrument of'' subiection. It is true, that I would also by the same prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise haue entrapped the parents, but my maids failed of it, not daring to tary long about it. But this sufficeth, since (these being taken away) you are the vndoubted inheritor, and <hi>Basilius</hi> will not long ouer-liue this losse.</p>
               <p>O mother (said <hi>Amphialus</hi>) speake not of doing them <label type="milestone">

Let others finde what sweetnesse they will in euer fearing, because they are euer feared: for my part, I will thinke my selfe highly intitled, if I may be once by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea</hi> accepted for a seruant.

But since you haue tied your thoughts in so wilfull a knot, it is happie I haue brought matters to such a passe, as you may both enioy affection, and vppon that build your soueraigntie. Alas (said <hi>Amphialus</hi>) my hart would faine yeeld you thanks for setting me in the way of felicitie, but that feare killes them in me, before they are fully borne. For if <hi>Philoclea</hi> be displeased, how can I be pleased? if she count it vnkindnes, shal I giue tokens of kindnes? perchance she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnes me of this action, and shall I triumph? perchance she drownes nowe the beauties I loue with sorrowful teares, and where is then my reioicing? You haue reason (said <hi>Cecropia</hi> with a fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned grauitie) I will therefore send her away presently, that her contentment may be recouered. No good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (said <hi>Amphialus</hi>) since she is here, I would not for my life constraine presence, but rather would I die then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent to absence. Prety intricat follies (said <hi>Cecropia</hi>) but get you vp, &amp; see how you can preuaile with her, while I go to the other sister. For after we shal haue our hands full to defend our selues, if <hi>Basilius</hi> hap to besiege vs. But remembring herself, she turned back, &amp; asked him what he woulde haue done with <hi>Zelmane,</hi> since nowe he might be reuenged of his hurt. Nothing but honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, answered <hi>Amphialus,</hi> hauing deserued no other of me, especially being (as I heare) greatly cherished of <hi>Philoclea.</hi> And therefore I could wish they were lodged together.

Manie a pitifull looke doth she cast vpon it, and many a time doth she draw backe her hand before she can giue the stroke. For euen so <hi>Amphialus</hi> by a hunger-sterued affection, was compelled to offer this iniurie, and yet the same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection made him with a tormenting griefe, thinke vnkindnesse in himselfe, that he could finde in his hart any way to restraine her freedome. But at length, neither able to grant, nor denie, he thus answered her. Deare ladie (said he) I will not say vnto you (how iustly soeuer I may do it) that I am neither author, nor acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie vnto this your withholding. For since I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres it, I am as faultry as if I had begun it. But this I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test vnto you (and this protestation of mine, let the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens heare, and if I lie, let them answer me with a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thunderbolt) that in my soule I wish I had neuer<pb n="255" facs="tcp:11334:260"/> seene the light, or rather, that I had neuer had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to beget such a child, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that by my meanes those eyes should ouerflow their owne beauties, then by my meanes the skie of your vertue should be ouerclowded with sorrow. But woe is me, most excellent Ladie, I finde my selfe most willing to obey you: neither truely doo mine eares receaue the least word you speak, with any lesse reuerence, then as absolute, and vnresistable commaundements. But alas, that Tyrant Loue, (which now possesseth the holde of all my life and reason) will no way suffer it. It is Loue, it is Loue, not I, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey you. What then shall I say? but that I, who am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to lie vnder your feete, to venture, nay to loose my life at your least commandement: I am not the staye of your freedome, but Loue, Loue, which ties you in your owne knots. It is you your selfe, that imprison your selfe: it is your beautie which makes these castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walles embrace you: it is your owne eyes, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect vpon themselues this iniurie. Then is there no other remedie, but that you some way vouchsafe to satisfie this Loues vehemencie; which (since it grewe in your selfe) without question you shall finde it (far more then I) tractable.</p>
               <p>But with these wordes <hi>Philoclea</hi> fell to so extreame a quaking, and her liuely whitenesse did degenerate to so dead a palenesse, that <hi>Amphialus</hi> feared some daungerous traunce: so that taking her hande, and feelinge that it (which was woonte to be one of the chiefe firebrands of <hi>Cupid</hi>) had all the sense of it wrapt vp in coldnes, he began humblie to beseech her to put away all feare, and to assure herselfe vpon the vowe he made thereof vnto God, and her selfe, that the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most<pb facs="tcp:11334:261"/> forces he would euer employ to conquere her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, should be Desire, and Desert.

For, beginning how much the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which is owed to the countrie, goes beyond all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dueties, since in it selfe it conteines them all, and that for the respect therof, not onely all tender respects of kinred, or whatsoeuer other friendshippes, are to be laide aside, but that euen long-helde opinions (rather builded vpon a secreate of gouernement, then any grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of truthe) are to be forsaken. He fell by degrees to shew, that since the ende whereto any thing is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, is euer to be of more noble reckning, then the thing thereto directed: that therfore, the weale-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke was more to be regarded, then any person or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate that thereunto was ordeined. The feeling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whereof, had moued him (though as nere of kinne to <hi>Basilius</hi> as could be, yet) to set principally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, the good estate of so many thousands, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whom <hi>Basilius</hi> raigned: rather then so to hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winke himselfe with affection, as to suffer the realme to runne to manifest ruine.

But besides the waies he vsed to weaken the aduerse partie, he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing for the strengthning of his owne. The chiefe trust whereof (because he wanted men to keepe the field) he reposed in the suretie of his castle; which at lest would winne him much time, the mother of many mutations. To that therefore he bent his outward &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eyes, striuing to make Art striue with Nature, to whether of them two that fortification should be most beholding.

Therfore would he not employ the still ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a shifting practise, nor the liberall man to be a dispenser of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, nor the kind-harted man to be a punisher: but would exercise their vertues in sorts, where they might be profitable, employing his chief care to know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all particularly, &amp; throughly, regarding also the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their bodies; some being able better to abide watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, some hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, some labour, making his benefit of ech hability, &amp; not forcing beyond power.

Euen of vices he made his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, making the cowardly <hi>Clinias</hi> to haue care of the watch, which he knew his own feare would make him very wakefully performe. And before the siege began, he himselfe caused rumors to be sowed, and libels to be spread against himselfe, fuller of mallice, then witty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion: partly, to knowe those that would be apt to<pb facs="tcp:11334:264"/> stumble at such motions, that he might cull them from the faithfuller band; but principally, because in necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they should not know when any such thing were in earnest attempted, whether it were, or not, of his owne inuention. But euen then (before the enemies face came neere to breed any terrour) did he exercise his men dayly in all their charges, as if Daunger had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently presented his most hideous presence: him selfe rather instructing by example, then precept; being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more sparing in trauile, nor spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in diet, then the meanest souldier: his hand and body disdaining no base matters, nor shrinking from the heauy.</p>

Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten when he had begun to commaund one, somewhat before halfe the sentence were ended, his inward guest did so entertaine him, that he would breake it of, and a prettie while after end it, when he had (to the maruaile of the standers by) sent himself in to talke with his own thoughts. Sometimes when his hand was lifted vp to some thing, as if with the sight of <hi>Gorgons</hi> head he had bene sodainely turned into a stone, so would he there abide with his eyes planted, and handes lifted, till at length, comming to the vse of himself, he would looke about whether any had perceiued him; then would he accuse, and in himselfe condemne all those wits, that durst affirme Idlenesse to be the well-spring of Loue.

The more I stirre about vrgent affaires, the more me thinks the very stirring breeds a breath to blow the coales of my loue: the more I exercise my thoughts, the more they encrease the appetite of my desires.

Woe, woe is me, they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my destruction: and whom doo they threaten this destruction? euen him that loues them; and by what means will they destroy, but by louing them? O deare (though killing) eyes, shall death head his darte with the golde of <hi>Cupids</hi> arrowe? Shall death take his ayme from the rest of Beautie? O beloued (though hating) <hi>Philoclea,</hi> how if thou beest mercifull, hath crueltie stolne into thee?

Like an euill vessell which turnes sweete licour to sowernes; so when thy grace fals vpon me, my wretched consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution makes it become fiercenesse. Thus would he exercise his eloquence, when she could not heare him, and be dumbe-striken, when her presence gaue him fit occasion of speaking: so that his witte could finde out<pb facs="tcp:11334:265"/> no other refuge, but the comfort and counsell of his mother, desiring her (whose thoughts were vnperplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to vse for his sake the most preuailing manners of intercession.</p>

For that (said <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cropia</hi>) beleue me vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith of a kings daughter, you shall be free, so soone as your freedome may be free of mortal da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, being brought hither for no other cause, but to preuent such mischiefes as you know not of. But if you thinke indeed to winne me to haue care of you, euen as of mine owne daughter, then lend your eares vnto me, &amp; let not your mind arme it self with a wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be flexible to nothing. But if I speake reason, let Reason haue his due reward, persuasion.

Imagin neece (I say) that some heauenly spirit should appeare vnto you, and bid you follow him through the doore, that goes into<pb n="261" facs="tcp:11334:266"/> the garden, assuring you, that you should therby return to your deare mother, and what other delights soeuer your mind esteemes delights: would you (sweet neece) would you refuse to folow him, &amp; say, that if he led you not through the chiefe gate, you would not enioy your ouer-desired liberty? Would you not drinke the wine you thirst for, without it were in such a glasse, as you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially fancied? tel me (deare neecc:) but I wil answer for you, because I know your reason and will is such, as must needs conclude, that such nicenesse can no more be in you, to disgrace such a mind, then disgracefulnesse can haue any place in so faultles a beauty. Your wisdom would assuredly determin, how the marke were hit, not whether the bow were of Ewe or no, wherein you shot. If this be so, and thus sure (my deare neece) it is, then (I pray you) imagin, that I am that same good Angel, who grieuing in your griefe, and in truth not able to suffer, that bitter sighs should be sent foorth with so sweetc a breath, am come to lead you, not only to your desired, and imagined happines, but to a true and essentiall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines; not only to liberty, but to libertie with comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. The way I will shew you (which if it be not the gate builded hitherto in your priuate choise, yet shall it be a doore to bring you through a garden of pleasures, as sweet as this life can bring foorth; nay rather, which makes this life to be a life: My son, (let it be no blemish to him that I name him my son, who was your fathers own nephew: for you know I am no smal kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,) my sonne (I say) farre passing the neernesse of his kinred, with the neernesse of good-will, and striuing to match your matchlesse beautie with a matchlesse affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, doth by me present vnto you the full enioying of<pb facs="tcp:11334:267"/>

I might say much both for the person and the matter; but who will crie out the Sun shines? It is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest a profit vnto you, as the meanest iudgement must straight apprehend it: so farre is it from the sharpenesse of yours, therof to be ignorant. Therfore (sweet neece) let your gratefulnes be my intercession, &amp; your gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse my eloquence, and let me cary comfort to a hart which greatly needs it. <hi>Philoclea</hi> looked vpon her, &amp; cast downe her eie again. Aunt (said she) I would I could be so much a mistres of my owne mind, as to yeelde to my cousins vertuous request: for so I construe of it. But my hart is already set (and staying a while on that word, she brought foorth afterwards) to lead a virgins life to my death: for such a vow I haue in my selfe deuoutly made. The heauens preuent such a mischiefe (said <hi>Cecropia.</hi>) A vowe, quoth you? no, no, my deere neece, Nature, when you were first borne, vowed you awoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; as she made you child of a mother, so to do your best to be mother of a child: she gaue you beautie to moue loue; she gaue you wit to know loue; she gaue you an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t body to reward loue: which kind of liberall rewarding is crowned with vnspeakable felicitie. For this, as it bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the receiuer, so it makes happy the bestower: this doth not impouerish, but enrich the giuer. O the sweet name of a mother: O the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts, to see your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grow vp, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are (as it were) eternized: if you could conceiue what a hart-tickling ioy it is to see your own litle ones, with awfull loue come running to your lap, and like litle models of your selfe, still cary you<pb n="262" facs="tcp:11334:268"/> about them, you would thinke vnkindnes in your own thoughts, that euer they did rebell against the mean vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I set this blessednes before your eies, as Captains do victorie before their souldiers, to which they might come through many paines, grieues &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. No, I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent you shrinke from this my counsel, if the way to come vnto it, be not most of all pleasant. I know not (answered the sweet <hi>Philoclea,</hi> fearing least si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence would offend her sullennes) what contentment you speake of: but I am sure the best you can make of it, (which is mariage) is a burdenous yoke. Ah, deer neece (said <hi>Cecropia</hi>) how much you are deceiued? A yoke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we all beare, laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs in our creation, which by mariage is not increased, but thus farre eased, that you haue a yoke-fellow to help to draw through the cloddy cumbers of this world. O widow-nights, beare witnes with me of the difference. How often alas do I embrace the orfan-side of my bed, which was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the body of my deare husband, &amp; with teares ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that I now enioy such a liberty as the bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath; who may, if he list, wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ouer the world, but is euer restrained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his most delightful home? that I haue now such a liberty as the seeled dou hath, which being first depriued of eies, is then by the falconer cast off? For beleue me, neece, beleue me, mans experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s best eie-sight. Haue you euer seene a pure Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water kept in a christal glas; how fine it lokes, how sweet it smels, while that beautifull glasse imprisons it? Breake the prison, and let the water take his owne course, doth it not imbrace dust, and loose all his former sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and fairenesse? Truly so are we, if we haue not the stay, rather then the restraint of Cristailine mariage. My hart meltes to thinke of the sweete comfortes,<pb facs="tcp:11334:269"/> I in that happie time receiued, when I had neuer cause to care, but the care was doubled: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I neuer reioiced, but that I saw my ioy shine in anothers eies. What shall I say of the free delight, which the hart might embrace, without the accusing of the inward conscience, or feare of outward shame? and is a solitary life as good as this? then can one string make as good musicke as a consort: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can one colour set forth a beautie. But it may be, the generall consideration of mariage dooth not so much mislike you, as the applying of it to him. He is my so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, I must confesse, I see him with a mothers eyes, which if they doo not much deceiue me, he is no such one, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer whom Contempt may make any iust chalenge. He is comely, he is noble, he is rich; but that which in it selfe should carie all comelinesse, nobilitie, and riches, he loues you; and he loues you, who is beloued of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Driue not away his affection (sweete Ladie) and make no other Ladie hereafter proudly bragge, that she hath robbed you of so faithfull and notable a seruant. <hi>Philoclea</hi> heard some pieces of her speches, no otherwise then one doth when a tedious pratler co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a delightful musicke. For her thoughts had left her eares in that captiuitie, and conueied themselues to behold (with such eies as imagination could lend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) the estate of her <hi>Zelmane</hi>: for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how wel she thought many of those sayings might haue ben vsed with a farre more gratefull acceptation. Therefore listing not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in a matter whereof her selfe was resolute, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired not to enforme the other, she onely told her, that whilest she was so captiued, she could not conceiue of any such persuasions (though neuer so reasonable) any otherwise, then as constraints: and as constraints must<pb n="263" facs="tcp:11334:269"/> needs eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in nature abhor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which at her libertie, in their owne force of reason, might more preuaile with her: and so faine would haue returned the strength of <hi>Cecropias</hi> perswasions, to haue procured freedome.</p>

Desirous he was that euery body should do valiantly, but himselfe; and therefore was afraid to shew his feare, but for very feare would haue hid his feare; lest it should disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort others: but the more he sought to disguize it, the more the vnsutablenes of a weake broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voice to high braue wordes, and of a pale shaking countenance to a gesture of animating, did discouer him.</p>

Among whom there was a young man, youngest brother to <hi>Philanax,</hi> whose face as yet did not bewray his sex, with so much as shew of haire; of a minde hauing no limits of hope, nor knowing why to feare; full of iollitie in conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lately growne a Louer.

But <hi>Amphialus</hi> launce was already come to the last of his descending line, and began to make the full point of death against the head of this young Gentleman, when <hi>Amphia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> perceyuing his youth and beautie, Compassion so rebated the edge of Choller, that he spared that faire<pb facs="tcp:11334:274"/> nakednesse, and let his staste fall to <hi>Agenors</hi> vamplat: so as both with braue breaking should hurtleslie haue perfourmed that match, but that the pittilesse launce of <hi>Amphialus</hi> (angry with being broken) with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky counterbuffe full of vnsparing splinters, lighted vpon that face farre fitter for the combats of <hi>Venus</hi>; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not onely a suddaine, but a fowle death, leauing scarsely any tokens of his former beautie: but his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds abandoning the reynes, and his thighes the saddle, he fellsidewarde from the horse.

The clashing of armour, and crushing of staues; the iustling of bodies, the resounding of blowes, was the first part of that ill-agreeing musicke, which was beautified with the griseliness of wounds, the rising of dust, the hideous falles, and grones of the dying. The verie horses angrie in their maisters anger, with loue and obedience brought foorth the effects of hate and resistance, and with minds of seruitude, did as if they affected glorie. Some lay deade vnder their dead maisters, who me vnknightly wounds had vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished for a faithfull dutie.

Some hauing lost their commaunding burthens, ranne scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red about the field, abashed with the madnesse of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. The earth itselfe (woont to be a buriall of men) was nowe (as it were) buried with men: so was the face thereof hidden with deade bodies, to whome Death had come masked in diuerse manners. In one place lay disinherited heades, dispossessed of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall seignories: in an other, whole bodies to see to, but that their harts wont to be bound all ouer so close, were nowe with deadly violence opened: in others, fowler deaths had ouglily displayed their trayling guttes. There lay armes, whose fingers yet mooued, as if they woulde feele for him that made them feele: and legges, which contrarie to common nature, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discharged of their burthen, were growne heauier. But no sworde payed so large a tribute of soules to the eternall Kingdome, as that of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> who like a Tigre, from who me a companie of Woolues did<pb facs="tcp:11334:275"/> seeke to rauish a newe gotten pray; so he (remembring they came to take away <hi>Philoclea</hi>) did labour to make valure, strength, hatred, and choller to answere the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his loue, which was infinit.</p>

But vertue quickly made him knowne, and admiration bred him such authoritie, that though they of whose side he came knew him not, yet they all knew<pb n="271" facs="tcp:11334:277"/> it was fitte to obey him: and while he was followed by the valiantest, he made way for the vilest. For, taking part with the besiegers, he made the <hi>Amphialians</hi> bloud serue for a caparison to his horse, and a decking to his armour. His arme no oftner gaue blowes, then the blowes gaue wounds, then the wounds gaue deathes: so terrible was his force, and yet was his quicknes more forcible then his force, and his iudgement more quick then his quicknes. For though the sword went faster then eyesight could follow it, yet his owne iudgement went still before it. There died of his hand, <hi>Sarpedon, Plistonax, Strophilus,</hi> and <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> men of great proofe in warres, and who had that day vndertaken the guard of <hi>Amphialus.</hi> But while they sought to saue him, they lost the fortresses that Nature had placed them in. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> slew he <hi>Megalus,</hi> who was a little before proude, to see himselfe stained in the bloud of his enemies: but when his owne bloud came to be married to theirs, he then felt, that <hi rend="margQuotes">Crueltie dooth neuer enioy a good cheape glorie.</hi> After him sent he <hi>Palemon,</hi> who had that daye vowed (with foolish brauerie) to be the death of tenne: and nine already he had killed, and was carefull to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his (almost performed) vowe, when the Blacke Knight helpt him to make vp the tenth himselfe.</p>
               <p>And now the often-changing Fortune began also <label type="milestone">

For at the first, though it were terrible, yet Terror was deckt so braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with rich furniture, guilte swords, shining armours, pleasant pensils, that the eye with delight had scarce leasure to be afraide: But now all vniuersally defiled with dust, bloud, broken armours, mangled bodies, tooke away the maske, and sette foorth Horror in his<pb facs="tcp:11334:278"/> owne horrible manner. But neither could danger be dreadfull to <hi>Amphialus</hi> his vndismayable courage, nor yet seeme ougly to him, whose truely-affected minde, did still paint it ouer with the beautie of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clea.</hi> And therefore he, rather enflamed then troubled with the encrease of dangers, and glad to finde a woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie subiect to exercise his courage, sought out this newe Knight, whom he might easilie finde: for he, like a wanton rich man, that throwes down his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houses, to make himselfe the better prospecte, so had his sworde made him so spatious a roome, that <hi>Amphialus</hi> had more cause to wonder at the finding, then labour for the seeking: which, if it stirred hate in him, to see how much harme he did to the one side, it prouoked as much aemulation in him, to perceaue how much good he did to the other side. Therefore, they approaching one to the other, as in two beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full folkes, Loue naturally stirres a desire of ioyning, so in their two courages Hate stirred a desire of triall. Then began there a combatte betweene them, worthy to haue had more large listes, and more quiet behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: for with the spurre of Courage, and the bitte of Respect, each so guided himselfe, that one might well see, the desire to ouercome, made them not forget how to ouercome: in such time &amp; proportion they did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their blowes, that none of <hi>Ceres</hi> seruaunts coulde more cunningly place his flaile: while the lefte foote spurre set forwarde his owne horse, the right sette back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the contrarie horse, euen sometimes by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage of the enemies legge, while the lefte hande (like him that helde the sterne) guy ded the horses obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient courage: All done in such order, that it might<pb n="272" facs="tcp:11334:278"/> seeme, the minde was a right Prince indeede, who sent wise and diligent Lieutenants into each of those well gouerned partes. But the more they fought, the more they desired to fight; and the more they smarted, the lesse they felte the smarte: and now were like to make a quicke proofe, to whom Fortune or Valour woulde seeme most friendly, when in comes an olde Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> alwayes a good Knight, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his charge; who giuing a sore wounde to the blacke Knights thigh, while he thought not of him, with an other blowe slewe his horse vnder him. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phialus</hi> cried to him, that he dishonoured him: You say well (answered the olde Knight) to stande now like a priuate souldier, setting your credite vpon particular fighting, while you may see <hi>Basilius</hi> with all his hoste, is getting betweene you and your towne.</p>
               <p>He looked that way, and found that true indeede,<label type="milestone">

The other partie being sorie for the losse of <hi>Philanax,</hi> was yet sorrier when the blacke Knight could not be found. For he hauing gotten on a horse, whom his dying master had bequeathed to the world, finding himselfe<pb facs="tcp:11334:279"/> sore hurt, and not desirous to be knowen, had in the time of the enemies retiring, retired away also: his thigh not bleeding bloud so fast, as his harte bledde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. But <hi>Basilius</hi> hauing attempted in vaine to barre the safe returne of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> encamped himselfe as strongly as he could, while he (to his grief) might heare the ioy was made in the towne by his owne subiectes, that he had that day sped no better. For <hi>Amphialus</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well beloued of that people) when they sawe him not vanquished, they esteemed him as victorious, his youth setting a flourishing shew vpon his worthinesse, and his great nobilitie ennobling his dangers.</p>

For the flowers she had wrought, caried such life in them, that the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningest painter might haue learned of her needle: which with so prety a maner made his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reers to &amp; fro through the cloth, as if the needle it selfe would haue bene loth to haue gone fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ward such a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres, but that it hoped to return the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceward very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againe: the cloth loking with many eies vpon her, &amp; louingly embracing the wounds she gaue it: the sheares also were at hand to behead the silke, that was growne to short. And if at any time she put her mouth to bite it off, it seemed, that where she had beene long in making of a Rose with her hand, she would in an instant make Roses with her lips; as the Lillies seemed to haue their whitenesse, rather of the hande that made them, then of the matter whereof they were made; and that they grew there by the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of her eyes, &amp; were refreshed by the most in discomfort comfortable ayre, which an vnwares sigh might bestow vpon them. But the colours for the grounde were so well chosen, neither sullenly darke, nor glaringly lightsome, and so well proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as that, though much cunning were in it, yet it was but to serue for an ornament of the principall woorke; that it was not without maruaile to see, howe a minde which could cast a carelesse semblant vppon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test conflictes of Fortune, coulde commaunde it selfe to take care for so small matters.

In faith he shall haue cause to account it, not as a purse for treasure, but as a treasure it selfe, worthie to be pursed vp in the purse of his owne hart. And thinke you so indeed (said <hi>Pamela</hi> halfe smiling) I promise you I wrought it, but to make some tedious houres beleeue, that I thought not of them: for else I valued it, but euen as a verie purse. It is the right nature (saide <hi>Cecropia</hi>) of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to woorke vnwitting effectes of wonder. Truely (saide <hi>Pamela</hi>) I neuer thought till nowe, that this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward glasse, intitled Beautie, which it pleaseth you to lay to my (as I thinke) vnguiltie charge, was but a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt mixture of naturall colours, delightfull to the eye, as musicke is to the eare, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consequence: since it is a thing, which not onely beastes haue; but euen stones and trees many of<pb n="279" facs="tcp:11334:285"/> them doo greatly excell in it. That other thinges (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Cecropia</hi>) haue some portion of it, takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the excellencie of it, where indeede it doth excell: since we see, that euen those beastes, trees, &amp; stones, are in the name of Beauty only highly praised. But that the beautie of humaine persons be beyond all other changs there is great likelihood of reason, since to them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is giuen the iudgement to discerne Beautie; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong reasonable wights, as it seemes, that our fex hath the preheminence, so that in that preheminence, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture counteruailes all other liberalities, wherin she may be thought to haue dealte more fauourably towarde mankind. How doo men crowne (thinke you) them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with glorie, for hauing either by force brought others to yeeld to their minde, or with long studie, and premeditated orations, perswaded what they woulde haue perswaded? and see, a faire woman shall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaund without authoritie, but perswade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out speaking. She shall not neede to procure attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for their owne eyes will chaine their eares vnto it. Men venture liues to conquere; she conqueres liues without venturing. She is serued, and obeyed, which is the most notable, not because the lawes so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it, but because they become lawes to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to obey her; not for her parents sake, but for her owne sake. She neede not dispute, whether to gouerne by Feare, or by Loue, since without her thinking thereof, their loue will bring foorth feare, and their feare will fortifie their loue: and she neede not seeke offensiue, or defensiue force, since her lippes may stande for ten thousand shieldes, and tenne thousand vneuitable shot goe from her eyes. Beautie, Beautie (deare Neece) is<pb facs="tcp:11334:286"/> the crowne of the feminine greatnes; which gifte, on whom soeuer the heauens (therein most nigardly) do bestowe, without question, she is bound to vse it to the noble purpose, for which it is created: not onely win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but preseruing; since that indeede is the right happines, which is not onely in it selfe happie, but can also deriue the happines to another. Certainly Aunt (said <hi>Pamela</hi>) I feare me you will make me not onely thinke my selfe fairer then euer I did, but think my fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes a matter of greater valew then heretofore I coulde imagine it. For I euer (till now) conceaued these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests you spake of, rather to proceed from the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the conquered, then from the strength of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But since your elder yeares, and abler iudgement, finde Beautie to be worthy of so incomparable estimation, certainly me thinks, it ought to be held in dearnes, according to the excellencie, and (no more then we would do of things which we accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pretious) euer to suffer it to be defiled.</p>

Deare neece, or rather, deare daughter, if my affection and wishe might preuaile therein, how much dooth it increase (trowe you) the earnest desire I haue of this blessed match, to see these vertues of yours knit fast with such zeale of Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (indeede the best bonde) which the most politicke wittes haue found, to holde mans witte in well doing? For, as children must first by feare be induced to know that, which after (when they doo know) they are most glad of: So are these bugbeares of opinions brought by great Clearkes into the world, to serue as shewelles to keepe them from those faults, whereto els the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the worlde, and weakenes of senses might pull them. But in you (Neece) whose excellencie is such, as it neede not to be helde vp by the staffe of vulgar o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, I would not you should loue Vertue seruil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, for feare of I know not what, which you see not: but euen for the good effects of vertue which you see. Feare, and indeede, foolish feare, and fearefull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, was the first inuenter of those conceates. For, when they heard it thunder, not knowing the naturall cause, they thought there was some angrie body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, that spake so lowde: and euer the lesse they did<pb n="281" facs="tcp:11334:287"/> perceiue, the more they did conceiue. Whereof they knew no cause that grewe streight a miracle: foolish folks, not marking that the alterations be but vpon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular accidents, the vniuersalitie being alwaies one. Yesterday was but as to day, and to morrow will tread the same footsteps of his foregoers: so as it is manifest inough, that all things follow but the course of their own nature, sauing only Man, who while by the preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie of his imagination he striues to things super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, meane-while he looseth his owne naturall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie. Be wise, and that wisedome shalbe a God vnto thee; be contented, and that is thy heauen: for els to thinke that those powers (if there be any such) aboue, are moued either by the eloquence of our prayers, or in a chafe by the folly of our actions; caries asmuch reason as if flies should thinke, that men take great care which of them hums sweetest, and which of them flies nimblest.</p>

Peace (wicked woman) peace, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to breathe, that doest not acknowledge the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer; most vnworthy to haue a tongue, which speakest against him, through whom thou speakest: keepe your affection to your self, which like a bemired dog, would defile with fauning. You say yesterday was as to day. O foolish woman, and most miserably foolish, since wit makes you foolish. What dooth that argue, but that there is a constancie in the euerlasting gouernour? Would you haue an inconstant God, since we count a<pb facs="tcp:11334:288"/> man foolish that is inconstant? He is not seene you say, and would you thinke him a God, who might be seene by so wicked eyes, as yours? which yet might see enough if they were not like such, who for sport-sake willingly hood-wincke themselues to receaue blowes the easier. But though I speake to you without any hope of fruite in so rotten a harte, and there be no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die else here to judge of my speeches, yet be thou my witnesse, O captiuitie, that my eares shall not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly guiltie of my Creators blasphemie. You saie, because we know not the causes of things, therefore feare was the mother of superstition: nay, because we know that each effect hath a cause, that hath engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a true &amp; liuely deuotion. For this goodly worke of which we are, and in which we liue, hath not his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Chaunce; on which opinion it is beyond mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile by what chaunce any braine could stumble. For if it be eternall (as you would seeme to conceiue of it) Eternity, &amp; Chaunce are things vnsufferable together. For that is chaunceable which happeneth; &amp; if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, there was a time before it hapned, when it might not haue happened; or els it did not happen; and so of chaunceable, not eternall, as now being, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not being. And as absurd it is to thinke that if it had a beginning, his beginning was deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chaunce: for Chaunce could neuer make all thinges of nothing: and if there were substaunces before, which by chaunce shoulde meete to make vp this worke, thereon followes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bottomlesse pitt of absurdities. For then those substaunces must needes haue bene from euer, and so eternall: and that eternall causes should bring forth chaunceable effects, is as sensible, as that the Sunne<pb n="282" facs="tcp:11334:288"/> should be the author of darkenesse. Againe, if it were chaunceable, then was it not necessarie; whereby you take away all consequents. But we see in all thinges, in some respect or other, necessitie of consequence: therfore in reason we must needs know that the causes were necessarie.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Chaunce is variable, or els it is not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chaunce: but we see this worke is steady and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent. If nothing but Chaunce had glewed those pieces of this All, the heauie partes would haue gone infinitely downewarde, the light infinitely vpwarde, and so neuer haue mett to haue made vp this goodly bodie. For before there was a heauen, or a earth, there was neyther a heauen to stay the height of the rising, nor an earth, which (in respect of the round walles of heauen) should become a centre. Lastly, perfect order, perfect beautie, perfect constancie, if these be the children of Chaunce, or Fortune the efficient of these, let Wisedome be counted the roote of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and eternitie the fruite of her inconstancie. But you will say it is so by nature, as much as if you said it is so, because it is so: if you meane of many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures conspiring together, as in a popular gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to establish this fayre estate; as if the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishe and ethereall partes should in their towne-house set downe the boundes of each ones office; then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what followes: that there must needes haue bene a wisedome which made them concurre: for their natures beyng absolute contrarie, in nature rather woulde haue sought each others ruine, then haue serued as well consorted partes to such an vnexpress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<pb facs="tcp:11334:289"/> harmonie. For that contrary things should meete to make vp a perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without a force and Wisedome aboue their powers, is absolutely impossible; vnles you will flie to that hissed-out opinion of Chaunce againe. But you may perhaps affirme, that one vniuerfall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which hath bene for euer) is the knitting together of these many partes to such an excellent vnitie. If you meane a Nature of wisdome, goodnes, &amp; prouidence, which knowes what it doth, then say you that, which I seeke of you, and cannot conclude those blasphemies, with which you defiled your mouth, &amp; mine eares. But if you meane a Nature, as we speake of the fire, which goeth vpward, it knowes not why: and of the nature of the Sea which in ebbing and flowing seemes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue so iust a daunce, and yet vnderstands no musicke, it is but still the same absurditie subscribed with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther title. For this worde, one, being attributed to that which is All, is but one mingling of many, and many ones; as in a lesse matter, when we say one kingdome which conteines many citties; or one cittie which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines many persons, wherein the vnder ones (if there be not a superiour power and wisedome) cannot by nature regarde to any preseruation but of themselues: no more we see they doo, since the water willingly quenches the fire, and drownes the earth; so farre are they from a conspired vnitie: but that a right heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature indeed, as it were vnnaturing them, doth so bridle them.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is as absurde in nature that from an vnitie many contraries should proceede still kept in an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: as that from the number of contrarieties an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<pb n="283" facs="tcp:11334:289"/> should arise. I say still, if you banish both a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie, and pluralitie of iudgement from among them, then (if so earthly a minde can lift it selfe vp so hie) doo but conceaue, how a thing whereto you giue the highest, and most excellent kinde of being (which is eternitie) can be of the base and vilest degree of being, and next to a not-being; which is so to be, as not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy his owne being? I will not here call all your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to witnes, which can heare, nor see nothing, which yeeldes not most euident euidence of the vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse of that Wisedome: each thing being dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to an ende, and an ende of preseruation: so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effects of iudgement, as speaking, and laughing are of mankind.</p>
               <p>But what madd furie can euer so enueagle any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipte, as to see our mortall and corruptible selues to haue a reason, and that this vniuersalitie (whereof we are but the lest pieces) should be vtterly deuoide thereof? as if one should saie, that ones foote might be wise, and him selfe foolish. This hearde I once al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged against such a godlesse minde as yours, who being driuen to acknowledge these beastly absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that our bodies should be better then the whole worlde, if it had the knowledge, where of the other were voide; he sought (not able to answere directly) to shifte it of in this sorte: that if that reason were true, then must it followe also, that the worlde must haue in it a spirite, that could write and reade to, and be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; since that was in vs so commendable: wretched foole, not considering that Bookes be but supplies of defects; and so are praysed, because they helpe our<pb facs="tcp:11334:290"/> want, and therefore cannot be incident to the eternall intelligence, which needs no recording of opinions to confirme his knowledge, no more then the Sunne wants waxe to be the fewell of his glorious lightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. This worlde therefore cannot otherwise consist but by a minde of Wisedome, whiche gouernes it, which whether you wil allow to be the Creator there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as vndoubtedly he is, or the soule and gouernour thereof, most certaine it is that whether he gouerne all, or make all, his power is aboue either his creatures, or his gouernement. And if his power be aboue all thinges, then consequently it must needes be infinite, since there is nothing aboue it to limit it. For beyond which there is nothing, must needes be boundlesse, and infinite: if his power be infinite, then likewise must his knowledge be infinite: for else there should be an infinite proportion of power which he shoulde not know how to vse; the vnsensiblenesse whereof I thinke euen you can conceaue: and if infinite, then must no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no not the estate of flies (which you with so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauerie skorne did iest at) be vnknowne vnto him. For if it were, then there were his knowledge bounded, and so not infinite: if knowledge and power be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, then must needs his goodnesse and iustice march in the same rancke: for infinitenes of power, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without like measure of goodnesse, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily bring foorth destruction and ruine, and not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and preseruation. Since then there is a God, and an all-knowing God, so as he sees into the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest of all naturall secretes, which is the harte of Man; and sees therein the deepest dissembled thoughts, nay<pb n="284" facs="tcp:11334:290"/> sees the thoughts before they be thought: since he is iust to exercise his might, and mightie to performe his iustice, assure thy selfe, most wicked woman (that hast so plaguily a corrupted minde, as thou canst not keepe thy sickenesse to thy selfe, but must most wickedly infect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) assure thy selfe, I say, (for what I say dependes of euerlasting and vnremooueable causes) that the time will come, when thou shalt knowe that power by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, when thou shalt see his wisedome in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting thy ougly shamelesnesse, and shalt onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him to haue bene a Creator in thy destruction.</p>

True it is, that <hi>Amphialus</hi> was the sooner vp; but <hi>Argalus</hi> had his sworde out the sooner: and then fell they to the cruellest combate, that any present eye had seene. Their swordes first, like Canons, batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring downe the walles of their armour, making brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches almost in euerie place for troupes of woundes to enter.

But though the blood accused the hurt of <hi>Argalus,</hi> yet woulde he in no action of his confesse it: but keeping himselfe in a lower warde, stoode watching with time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrustes to repaire his losse; which quickly he did. For <hi>Amphialus</hi> (following his fawning fortune) laid on so thicke vpon <hi>Argalus,</hi> that his shield had almost fallen peece-meale to the earth, when <hi>Argalus</hi> comming in with his right foote, and something stowping to come vnder his armour, thrust him into the belly daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and mortally it would haue beene, but that with the blowe before, <hi>Amphialus</hi> had ouerthrowne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so, as he fell side-warde downe, and with falling saued himselfe from ruine.

But he striuing without aunswere to rise, <hi>Argalus</hi> strake with all his might vpon his head. But his hurte arme not able to maister so sounde a force, let the swoorde fall so, as <hi>Amphialus,</hi> though astonished with the blowe, could arise: which <hi>Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> considering, ranne in to graspe with him, and so closed together; falling so to the grounde, nowe one getting aboue, and then the other; at length, both wearie of so vnlouely embracements, with a dissenting consent gate vp, and went to their swordes: but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened eche of his enemies: where <hi>Argalus</hi> finding his focs sworde garnished in his blood, his hart rase with the same swoorde to reuenge it, and on that blade to allie their bloods together. But his minde was euill wayted-on by his lamed force, so as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued<pb n="294" facs="tcp:11334:300"/> still more and more woundes, which made all his armour seeme to blush, that it had defended his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster no better. But <hi>Amphialus</hi> perceiuing it, &amp; waying the small hatefulnesse of their quarrell, with the worthinesse of the Knight, desired him to take pitie of himselfe. But <hi>Argalus,</hi> the more repining, the more he founde himselfe in disaduauntage, filling his veynes with spite in steade of blood, and making courage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise agaynst faintnesse, (like a Candle, which a little before it goes out, giues then the greatest blaze) so did he vnite all his force, that casting away the little remnaunt of his shielde, and taking his swoorde in both handes, he stroke such a notable blowe, that he cleft his shielde, armour, and arme almost to the bone.</p>

But <hi>Parthenia</hi> ranne betweene them (feare of loue making her forget the feare of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and then fell downe at their feete, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning so to part them, till she coulde get breathe to sigh out her doolefull speeches: and when her breath (which running had spent, and dismayednesse<pb facs="tcp:11334:301"/> made slowe to returne) had by sobbes gotten into her; sorow-closed breast, for a while she coulde say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but, O wretched eyes of mine, O wailefull sight, O day of darkenesse: at length turning her eyes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in sorrowe swamme) to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> My Lorde (saide she) it is saide you loue; in the power of that loue, I beseech you to leaue of this combate, as euen your harte may finde comfort in his affection, euen for her sake, I craue it: or if you be mortally determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, be so pitifull vnto me, as first to kill me, that I may not see the death of <hi>Argalus.

And can not <hi>Argalus</hi> liue but by request? Is it a life? With that he went aside, for feare of hurting her, and woulde haue begunne the combate afresh. But <hi>Amphialus</hi> not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured by that which helde the Monarchie of his mind, but euen in his noble hart melting with compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at so passionate a sight, desired him to withholde his handes, for that he shoulde strike one, who sought his fauour, and woulde not make resistaunce. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table examble of the woonderfull effectes of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, where the conquerour, sought for friendship of the conquered, and the conquered woulde not pardon the conquerour: both indeede being of that minde to loue eche other for accepting, but not for giuing mercie, and neyther affected to ouer-liue a dishonour: so that <hi>Argalus</hi> not so much striuing with <hi>Amphialus</hi> (for if he had had him in the like sorte,<pb n="295" facs="tcp:11334:301"/> in like sort he would haue dealt with him) as labouring against his owne power (which he chiefly despised) set himselfe forward, stretching his strength to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most. But the fire of that strife, blowen with his inward rage, boyled out his bloud in such aboundance, that he was driuen to rest him vpon the pommel of his sword: and then each thing beginning to turne rounde in the daunce of Death before his eyes, his sight both daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and dimmed, till (thinking to sit downe) he fell in a sowne. <hi>Parthenia,</hi> and <hi>Amphialus</hi> both hastely went vnto him: <hi>Amphialus</hi> tooke of his helmet, and <hi>Parthenia</hi> laid his head in her lap, tearing of her linnen sleeues &amp; partlet, to serue about his wounds; to bind which, she tooke of her hair-lace, and would haue cut of her faire haire her selfe, but that the squires and iudges came in with fitter things for the purpose: while she bewayled her selfe with so lamentable sweetnes, as was inough to haue taught sorrow to the gladdest thoughts, and haue engraued it in the mindes of hardest mettall.</p>
               <p>O <hi>Parthenia,</hi> no more <hi>Parthenia</hi> (said she) What art <label type="milestone">

O God, what hath bene my desert to be thus punished? or if such haue bene my desert, why was I not in my selfe punished? O wandring life, to what wildernes wouldst thou lead one? But Sorow, I hope thou art sharp inough to saue my labour from other remedies. <hi>Argalus, Argalus,</hi> I will folow thee, I wil folow thee.</p>
               <p>But with that <hi>Argalus</hi> came out of his sowne, and <label type="milestone">

But since so it pleaseth him, whose wisdome and goodnesse guideth all, put thy confidence in him, and one day we shall blessedly meet againe, neuer to depart: meane while liue happily, deare <hi>Parthenia,</hi> and I perswade my selfe, it will increase the blessednes of my soule, so to see thee. Loue well the remembrance of thy louing, and truely louing, <hi>Argalus</hi>: and let not (with that worde he sighed) this disgrace of mine, make thee one day thinke, thou hadst an vnwoorthie husband. They could scarcely vnderstand the last wordes: for Death began to seaze him selfe of his harte, neither coulde <hi>Parthenia</hi> make answere, so full was her breast of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish. But while the other sought to stanch his reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles wounds, she with her kisses made him happie: for his last breath was deliuered into her mouth.</p>

And well might she heare as she past through the Campc, the great prayses spoken of her husbande, which all were recordes of her losse. But the more excellent he was (being indeede accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted seconde to none in all Greece) the more did the breath of those praises, beare vp the winges of <hi>Amphia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>-his fame: to whom yet (such was his case) that Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe vpon Trophe, still did but builde vp the monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his thraldome; he euer finding himselfe in such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of <hi>Philoclea,</hi> that she was most absent, when he was present with her; and euer sorriest, when he had best successe: which would haue made him renounce all comfort, but that his mother, with diuersity of deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, kept vp his hart.</p>
               <p>But while he allayed thus his outward glorie, with inward discomfort, he was like to haue bene ouertaken<pb facs="tcp:11334:303"/> with a notable treason, the beginning wherof (though meerely ridiculous) had like to haue brought forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a weeping effect.</p>

But they (hauing him now on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe) led him vnto the ferrie, and so into the Iland; the clashing of his owne armour striking miserable seare into him, and in his minde thinking greate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse in his friende, that he had brought him to a matter so contrarie to his complexion.

Sometimes his witte made him bethinke him selfe what was beste to be done; but feare did so corrupt his witt, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruer he thought was best, he still found daunger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; fearefulnesse (contrarie to all other vices) making him thinke the better of another, the worse he found him selfe; rather imagining in him selfe, what wordes would vse (if he were ouercome) to get his life of <hi>Damaetas,</hi> then how to ouercome, where of he could thinke with no patience.

Fame he would haue prayed, but he had not harte inough to haue confidence in praier; the glittering of the armour, and sounding of the trumpets giuing such an affault to the weake-breache of his false senses, that he grewe from the degree of feare to an amazement, not almost to know what he did; till two iudges (chosen for the purpose) making the trumpets cease, and taking the oth of those champions, that they came without guile or witchcraft, set them at wonted distaunce; one from the other.</p>

For well he deemed, it would be a great barre to practize, and a pulling on of iniuries, when men nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not care, how they vsed him. Insomuch, that <hi>Clinias</hi> (finding himselfe the scorning-stocke of euery compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie) fell with repining to hate the cause thereof; &amp; hate in a cowards hart, could set it selfe no other limites, but death.

But despised, because of his coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and not marked, because despised, he had the freer scope of practize.

For, by a strange composition of minde, there was no man more tenderly sensible in any thing offred to himselfe, which in the farthest-fette construction, might be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fted to the name of wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g; no man, that in his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could worse distinguish betwene Valour and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: So proud, as he could not abstaine from a <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so</hi>-like boasting, and yet (so vnluckie a lodging his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues had gotten) he would neuer boast more then he would accomplish: falsly accounting an vnflexible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a couragious constancie: esteeming feare, and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, righter causes of admiration, then Loue and Honour. This man had foure sundrie times fought with <hi>Amphialus,</hi> but <hi>Mars</hi> had bene so vnpartiall an arbiter, that neither side gate aduauntage of the other. But in the end it hapned, that <hi>Anaxius</hi> found <hi>Amphialus</hi> (vnknowen) in a great danger, and saued his life: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (louing his owne benefite) began to fauour him, so much the more, as, thinking so well of himselfe, he coulde not choose but like him, whom he founde a match for himselfe: which at last grewe to as much friendship towardes him, as could by a proud harte be<pb n="305" facs="tcp:11334:311"/> conceiued. So as in this trauaile (seeking <hi>Pyrocles</hi> to be reuenged of his vncles death) hearing of this siege, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taking paines to examine the quarrell (like a man whose will was his God, and his hand his lawe) taking with him his two brothers (men accounted little infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to him selfe in martiall matters) and two hundred chosen horsemen (with whome he thought him selfe able to conquere the world) yet commaunding the rest of his forces to follow, he him selfe vpon such an vnexpected suddainenesse entred in vpon the backe of <hi>Basilius,</hi> that many with great vnkindnesse tooke their death, not knowing why, nor how they were so mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. There, if euer, did he make knowne the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of his force. But the valiant, &amp; faithfull <hi>Philanax,</hi> with wel gouerned speed made such head against him, as would haue shewed, <hi rend="margQuotes">how soone Courage falles in the ditch which hath not the eie of wisdome.</hi> But that <hi>Amphialus</hi> at the same time issued out, &amp; winning with an abondaunce of courage one of the sconses, which <hi>Basilius</hi> had builded, made waie for his friend <hi>Anaxius</hi> with great losse of both sides, but especially of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silians</hi>; such notable monuments had those two swords especially lefte of their Maisters redoubted worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

For causing the streates and houses of the towne to witnes his welcome (making both souldiers<pb facs="tcp:11334:312"/> and Magistrates in their countenaunces to shewe their gladnesse of him) he led him to his mother, whom he besought to entertain him with no lesse loue and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then as one, who once had saued her sonnes life, and now came to saue both life and honour. Tush (said <hi>Anaxius,</hi> speaking alowde, looking vpon his brothers) I am onely sorie there are not halfe a dozen Kinges more about you: that what <hi>Anaxius</hi> can doo, might be the better manifested. His brothers smiled, as though he had ouer-modestly spoken farre vnderneath the pitch of his power. Then was he disarmed at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest request of <hi>Amphialus</hi>: for <hi>Anaxius</hi> boiled with desire to issue out vppon the enemies, perswading himselfe, that the Sunne shoulde not be sette, before he had ouerthrowne them. And hauing reposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, <hi>Amphialus</hi> asked him, whether he woulde vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site the yong Princesses. But <hi>Anaxius</hi> whispered him in the care: In trueth (saide he) deare friende <hi>Amphialus,</hi> though I am none of those, that loue to speake of themselues, I neuer came yet in companic of Ladies, but that they fell in loue with me. And I that in my heart scorne them as a peeuish paltrie sexe, not woorthie to communicate with my vertues, would not do you the wrong: since (as I heare) you doo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base your selfe so much as to affect them. The curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Amphialus</hi> could haue beene angrie with him for those wordes; but knowing his humour, suffered him to daunce to his owne musicke: and gaue himselfe to entertaine both him and his brothers, with as cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a maner, as coulde issue from a minde whome vnluckie loue had filled with melancholie. For to <hi>Anaxius</hi> he yeelded the direction of all. He gaue<pb n="306" facs="tcp:11334:312"/> the watchwoorde, and if any grace were graunted, the meanes were to be made to <hi>Anaxius.</hi> And that night when supper was ended, wherein <hi>Amphialus</hi> woulde needes himselfe waite vpon him, he caused in Boates vpon the Lake an excellent musicke to be ordered: which, though <hi>Anaxius</hi> might conceiue was for his honour, yet indeede he was but the Bricke-wall to conuey it to the eares of the beloued <hi>philoclea.</hi>

For now (as if he would turne his inside outwarde) he would needes appeare all in blacke; his decking both for him selfe, and horse, being cut out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fashion of very ragges: yet all so dainty, ioyned together with pretious stones, as it was a braue rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gednesse, and a riche pouertie: and so cunningly had a workeman followed his humour in his armour, that<pb facs="tcp:11334:322"/> he had giuen it a rustie shewe, and yet so, as any man might perceiue was by arte, and not negligence; cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one instant a disgraced handsomnesse, and a new oldnes.

His <hi>Impresa</hi> was a <hi>Catoblepta</hi> which so long lies dead, as the Moone (whereto it hath so naturall a sympathie) wants her light. The worde signified that <hi>The Moone wanted not the light, but the poore beast wanted the Moones light.</hi> He had in his headpiece, a whippe, to witnesse a selfe-punishing repentaunce. Their very horses were cole-blacke too, not hauing so much as one starre to giue light to their night of blackenesse: so as one would haue thought they had bene the two sonnes of Sorrow, and were come thether to fight for<pb n="316" facs="tcp:11334:322"/> their birth-right in that sorie inheritance.</p>
               <p>Which aliance of passions so moued <hi>Amphialus</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> tender-minded by the afflictions of Loue) that without staffe or sword drawne, he trotted fairely to the forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Knight, willing to haue put off his combat, to which his melancholy hart did (more then euer in like occasion) misgiue him: and therefore faluting him, Good Knight (said he) because we are men, and should knowe reason why we doo things; tell me the cause, that makes you thus eager to fight with me. Because I affirme (answered the forsaken Knight) that thou dost most rebellious iniurie to those Ladies, to whome all men owe seruice. You shall not fight with me (saide <hi>Amphialus</hi>) vpon that quarrell: for I confesse the same too: but it proceeds from their owne beauty, to inforce Loue to offer this force. I maintaine then (said the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken Knight) that thou art not worthy so to loue. And that confesse I too (saide <hi>Amphialus</hi>) since the world is not so richly blessed, as to bring forth any thing worthy thereof. But no more vnworthy then any other, since in none can be a more worthy loue. Yes, more vnworthy then my self (said the forsaken Knight) for though I deserue contempt, thou deseruest both contempt, and hatred.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Amphialus</hi> by that thinking (though wrongly,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>6</label> each indeede mistaking other) that he was his riuall, forgat all minde of reconciliation, and hauing all his thoughts bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vp in choler, neuer staying either iudge, tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet, or his owne lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, drew out his sword, &amp; saying, Thou lyest false villaine, vnto him; his words &amp; blowes came so quick togither, as the one seemed a lightning of the others thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der. But he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d no barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of such<pb facs="tcp:11334:323"/> seede: for it yeelded him his owne with such encrease, that though Reason and Amazement go rarely togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet the most reasonable eies that saw it, founde reason to be amazed at the fury of their combat. Neuer game of death better plaid; neuer fury set it self forth in greater brauerie. The curteous <hi>Vulcan,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wrought at his nowe more curteous wiues request, <hi>AEnaes</hi> an armour, made not his hammer beget a greater sounde; then the swordes of those noble Knights did; they nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no fire to their forge; for they made the fire to shine at the meeting of their swords, &amp; armours; ech side fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching new spirit from the castle window, and careful of keeping their sight, it was a matter of greater considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their combat, then either the aduantage of Sun or winde: which Sunne and wind (if the astonished eies of the beholders were not by the astonishment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued) did both stand still to be beholders of this rare match. For neither could their amazed eies discerne motion in the Sunne, and no breath of wind stirred, as if either for feare it would not come amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g such blows, or with delight had his eies so busie, as it had forgot to open his mouth. This fight being the more cruell, since both Loue and Hatred conspired to sharpen their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that hard it was to say, whether Loue with one trumpet, or Hatred with another, gaue the lowder ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum to their courages. Spite, rage, disdaine, shame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, came waighting vpon Hatred: of the other side came with loue-longing Desire, both inuincible Hope, and fearelesse Despaire, with riuallike Iealousie, which (although brought vp within doores in the schoole of <hi>Cupid</hi>) woulde shewe themselues no lesse forwarde, then the other dustie bande of <hi>Mars,</hi> to make<pb n="317" facs="tcp:11334:323"/> themselues notable in the notablenes of this combat. Of eyther side Confidence, vnacquainted with Losse, but assured trust to ouercome, and good experience howe to ouercome: nowe seconding their terrible blowes with cunning labouring the horses, to winne ground of the enimie; now vnlooked-for parting one from the other, to win aduantage by an aduantageous retourne. But force against force, skill against skill, so enterchangeably encountred, that it was not easie to determine, whether enterprising, or preuenting came former: both, sometimes at one instant, doing and suffring wrong, and choller no lesse rising of the doing, then of the suffring. But as the fire, the more fuell is put to it, the more hungrie still it is to deuoure more: so the more they strake, the more vnsatissied they were with striking. Their verie armour by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale fell away from them: and yet their flesh abode the wounds constantly, as though it were lesse sensible of smarte, then the senselesse armour: their blood in most places stayning the blacke, as if it would giue a more liuely coulour of mourning, then blacke can doo. And so a long space they fought, while neither vertue, nor fortune seemed partiall of either side: which so tormented the vnquiet hart of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that he resolued to see a quicke ende: and therefore with the violence of courage, adding strength to his blow, he strake in such wise vpon the side of the others heade, that his remembrance left that battered lodging: so as he was quite from himselfe, casting his armes abroade, and redie to fall downe; his sword likewise went out of his hande; but that being fast by a chaine to his arme, he could not loose. And <hi>Amphialus</hi> vsed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour<pb facs="tcp:11334:324"/> of occasion, redoubling his blowes: but the horse (weary to be beaten, as well as the master) carried his master away, till he came vnto himselfe: But then who could haue seene him, might wel haue diserned shame in his cheekes, and reuenge in his eyes: so as setting his teeth togither with rage, he came running vpon <hi>Amphialus,</hi> reaching out his arme, which had gathered vp the sword, meaning with that blow to haue cleaued <hi>Amphialus</hi> in two. But <hi>Amphialus</hi> seeing the blow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, shunned it with nimble turning his horse aside; wherwith the forsaken Knight ouer-strake himself so, as almost he came downe with his owne strength. But the more hungrie he was of his purpose, the more he was bard the food of it: disdaining the resistance, both of force, and fortune, he returned vpon the spurre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ranne with such violence vpon <hi>Amphialus,</hi> that his horse with the force of the shocke rose vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, almost ouerturned: which <hi>Amphialus</hi> perceauing, with rayne and spurre put forth his horse; and withall gaue a mightie blow in the descent of his horse, vpon the shoulder of the forsaken Knight; from whence sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it fell vpon the necke of his horse, so as horse and man fell to the ground: but he was scarce downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was vp on his feete againe, with braue ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture shewing rising of corage, in the falling of fortune.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>7</label> But the curteous <hi>Amphialus</hi> excused himselfe, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (against his will) kild his horse. Excuse thy selfe for viler faults (answered the forsaken Knight) and vse this poore aduantage the best thou canst; for thou shalt quickely finde thou hast neede of more. Thy folly (said <hi>Amphialus</hi>) shall not make me forget my selfe: and therewith (trotting a little aside) alighted from his<pb n="318" facs="tcp:11334:324"/> horse, because he would not haue fortune come to claime any part of the victory. Which curteous act would haue mollified the noble harte of the forsaken Knight, if any other had done it, besides the Iaylor of his mistres: but that was a sufficient deseazaunce for the firmest bonde of good nature; and therfore he was no sooner alighted, but that he ranne vnto him, re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into as cruel a fight, as eye did euer see, or thought could reasonably imagine; farre beyond the reach of weak words to be able to expresse it. For what they had done on horsebacke, was but as a morsell to keep their stomakes in appetite, in comparison of that, which now (being themselues) they did. Nor euer glutton by the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of daintie diet could be brought to fetch feeding (when he might haue bene satisfied before) with more earnestnes, then those (by the change of their maner of fight) fell cleane to a new fight, though any elfe would haue thought they had had their fill alredy. <hi>Amphialus</hi> being the taller man, for the most part stood with his right legge before; his shield at the vttermost length of his arme; his sword hie, but with the point toward his enemy. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he strake, which came so thick, as if eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blow would striue to be foremost, his arme seemed still a postillion of death. The forsaken Knight shewed with like skil, vnlike gesture, keeping himselfe in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual motion, proportioning the distance betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to any thing that <hi>Amphialus</hi> attempted his eye guided his foote, and his foote conueighed his hand; and since nature had made him something the lower of the two, he made art follow, and not striue with nature: Shunning rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warding his blowes; like a cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning mastiffe, who knowes the sharpnes of the horne, and stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the Bul; fights low to get his proper adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage;<pb facs="tcp:11334:325"/> answering mightines with nimblencs, and yet at times imploying his wonderfull force, wherein he was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde to none. In summe, the blowes were stronge, the thrusts thicke, and the auoydings cunning. But the forsaken Knight (that thought it a degree of being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered to belong in conquering) strake so mightie a blow, that he made <hi>Amphialus</hi> put knee to the ground, without any humblenes. But when he felt himselfe striken downe, and saw himselfe striken downe by his riuall, then shame seemed one arme, and disdaine ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; fury in his eyes, and reuenge in his hart; skill and force gaue place, &amp; they tooke the place of skil &amp; force: with so vnweariable a manner, that the forsaken Knight was also driuen to leaue the streame of cunning, and giue himselfe wholly to be guided by the storme of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: there being in both (because hate would not suffer admiration) extreame disdaine to finde themselues so matched.</p>

These thoughtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede not staying, but whetting their angrie swordes, which now had put on the apparraile of Crueltie: they bleeding so aboundantly, that euery bodie that sawe them, fainted for them, &amp; yet they fainted not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: their smart being more sensible to others eyes, then to their owne feeling: Wrath and Courage bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the common sense from bringing any message of their case to the minde: Paine, Wearines, and Weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, not daring to make knowen their case (though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the limits of death) in the presence of so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent furie: which filling the veines with rage, in stead of bloud, and making the minde minister spirites to the bodie, a great while held out their fight, like an arrowe shotte vpward by the force of the bowe, though by his<pb facs="tcp:11334:326"/> owne nature he would goe downward. The forsaken Knight had the more wounds, but <hi>Amphialus</hi> had the soarer; which the other (watchinge time and place) had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly geuen vnto him. Who euer saw a well-mand Galley fight with a tall ship, might make vnto himselfe some kind of comparison of the difference of these two Knights; a better couple then which, the world could not bragge of. <hi>Amphials</hi> seemed to excell in strength, the forsaken Knight in nimblenes; and yet did the ones strength excel in nimblenes, and the others nimblenes excell in strength: but now, strength and nimblenes were both gone, and excesse of courage only maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the fight.

Which <hi>Amphialus</hi> perceauing (fearing death, onely because it should come with ouerthrow) he seemed to coniure all his strength for one moments seruice; and so, lifting vp his sword with both hands, hit the forsaken knight vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head, a blow, wherewith his sword brake. But (as if it would do a notable seruice before it died) it preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so, euen in the instant of breaking, that the forsaken Knight fell to the ground, quite for that instant forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both loue and hatred: and <hi>Amphialus</hi> (finding him self also in such weaknes, as he loked for speedy death) glad of the victorie, though little hoping to enioy it, puld vp his visar, meaning with his dagger to giue him death; but in stead of death, he gaue him life: for, the aire so reuiued his spirits, that comming to himself, and seeing his present danger, with a life conquering death, he tooke <hi>Amphialus</hi> by the thigh, &amp; together rose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and ouerturned him. But <hi>Amphialus</hi> scrambled vp againe, both now so weake indeede, as their motions rather seemed the afterdrops to a storme, then any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great furie.</p>

But they were foorthwith encountred with the two braue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions of the forsaken Knight; whereof the one being all in greene, both armour and furniture, it seemed a pleasant garden, wherein grewe orange trees, which with their golden fruites, cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten in, &amp; embrodered, greatly enriched the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing colour of greene. In his shield was a sheep, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a pleasant field, with this word, <hi>Without feare, or cnuie.</hi> And therfore was called the Knight of the sheep.

But Fame set the honour vpon his backe, which he would not suffer to shine in his face: no mans mouth being barrein of prayses to the noble Knight, that had bettered the most estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Knight in the world: euery bodie praying for his life, and thinking that therein they prayed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. But he him selfe, when by the diligent care of friends, and well applied cunning of furgeons, he came to renewe againe the league between his minde and body, then felt he to a freshe warre with his owne thoughts, wrongfully condemning his manhood, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cowardise to him selfe, whome the impudentest backbiter would not so haue wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged. For his courage (vsed to vse victory as an inheritaunce) could brooke no resistance at any time: but now that he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him selfe, not onely the conquest of him, but the scaling of the walles, and deliuery of <hi>Pamela,</hi> though he had done beyond at others expectation, yet so short was he of his owne; that he hated to looke vpon the Sunne, that had seene him do so weakely: and so much abhorred all visitation or honour, whereof he thought him selfe vnworthy, that he besought his two noble friends to carrie him away to a castle not far of, where he might cure his wounds, and neuer be knowne till he made successe excuse this (as he thought) want in him. They louingly obeyed him, leauing <hi>Basilius</hi> and all the campe very sorrie for the parting of these three vnknowne Knights, in whose prowesse they had repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed greatest trust of victory.</p>

But now, caitife that I am, what euer I haue done, serues but to builde vp my riuals glory. To these speeches he would couple such gestures of vexation, &amp; would fortifie the gestures with such effects of furie, as sometimes ofiring to teare vp his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, sometimes to refuse the sustenance of meat, &amp; counsell of phisitions, that his perplexed mother was driuen to make him by force to be tended, with extreame corsey to her selfe, &amp; annoiance to him: till in the end he was contented to promise her, he would attempt no violence vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, vpon condition he might be troubled by no body, but onely his Phisitions: his melancholy detesting all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, so as not the very surgeons nor seruants durst speak vnto him in doing him seruice: only he had prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mother, as she tendered his life, she would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him grace; and that without that, she would neuer come at him more.</p>

Yet first, because he should be the freer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outward force, she sent a messenger to the campe, to denounce vnto <hi>Basilius,</hi> that if he did not presently raise his siege, she would cause the heads of the three Ladies, prisoners, to be cut of before his eies.

One might see in <hi>Pamela</hi> a willingnesse to die, rather then to haue life at others discretion, though sometimes a princely disdaine would sparkle out of her Princely eies, that it should be in others power to force her to die. In <hi>Philoclea</hi> a prety feare came vp, to endamaske her rosie cheekes: but it was such a feare, as rather seemed a kindly childe to her innate humblenes, then any other dismaiednes: or if she were dismaied, it was more for <hi>Zelmane,</hi> then for her selfe; or if more for her selfe, it was because <hi>Zelmane</hi> should loose her.

The lookers on were so moued withal, as they misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what themselues did, and yet still did what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues misliked.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celors: amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g which, those he chiefly trusted were <hi>Philanax</hi> and <hi>Kalander</hi> (lately come to the campe at <hi>Basilius</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, &amp; in him selfe wery of his solitary life, wanting his sons presence, &amp; neuer hauing heard him his beloued guestes since they parted from him). Now in this doubt what he should do, he willed <hi>Kalander</hi> to giue him his aduise: who spake much to this purpose. You co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund me Sir (said he) to speake, rather because you will keepe your wonted graue, &amp; noble manner, to do nothing of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce without cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, then that in this cause (which indeed hath but one way) your mind needs to haue any counsell: so as my speech shall rather be to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme what you haue alredy determined, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to<pb n="324" facs="tcp:11334:330"/> argue against any possibilitie of other determination. For what sophistical scholler can finde any question in this, whether you will haue your incomparable daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters liue, or dye? whether since you be here to cause their deliuerance, you will make your being here the cause of their destruction? for <hi rend="margQuotes">nothing can be more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible, then to thinke what one doth, &amp; to forget the end why it is done.</hi> Do therefore as I am sure you meane to doo, remoue the siege, and after seeke by practise, or other ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle meanes, to recouer that which by force you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not: &amp; therof is indeed (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it please you) more cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

He said no more, for he durst not attempt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the marrying of his daughter to <hi>Amphialus,</hi> but left that to bring in at another consultation. But <hi>Basilius</hi> made signe to <hi>Philanax,</hi> who sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding a while in a maze as inwardly perplexed, at last thus deliuered his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>If euer I could wish my faith vntried, &amp; my counsell <label type="milestone">

Therefore as to a Prince I say, that the graue and (I well know) true-minded counsell of my Lord <hi>Kalander</hi> had come in good time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you first tooke armes, before al your subiects gate notice of your intention, before so much blood was spe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; before they were driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to seek this shift for their last remedy. But if now, this force you<pb facs="tcp:11334:331"/> away, why did you take armes? since you might be sure when euer they were in extremitie they would haue recourse to this threatning? and for a wise man to take in hand that which his enimie may with a word ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, hath in my conceit great incongruity, &amp; as great not to forethink what his enemy in reason wil doo. But they threaten they wil kil your daughters. What if they promised you if you remoued your siege, they would honorably send home your daughters? would you be angled by their promises? truly no more ought you be terrified by their threatnings. <hi rend="margQuotes">For yet of the two, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise binds faith more then threatning.

But it may be said, <hi rend="margQuotes">no man knows what desperate folkes will do: it is true, and as true that no reason nor policie can preuent what desperate folks wil do: &amp; therefore they are amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g those dangers, which wisdome is not to recke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Only let it suffice to take away their despaire, which may be by granting pardon for what is past; so as the Ladies may be freely deliuered.<pb n="325" facs="tcp:11334:331"/> And let them that are your subiects, trust you that are their Prince: doo not you subiect your selfe to trust them, who are so vntrusty as to be manifest traitors. For if they finde you so base-minded, as by their theatning to remoue your force, what indignitie is it, that they would not bring you vnto, still by the same threatning since then if Loue stir them, loue will keep them from murthering what they loue; and if Ambition prouoke them, ambitious they will be, when you are away, as well as while you are here: take not away your force, which bars not the one, &amp; bridels the other. For as for their shewes and words they are but to feare babes, not worthy once to moue a worthy mans conceit; which must still co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider what in reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are like to do.

And therefore (taking counsell of one of her olde associates who so far excelled in wickednesse as that she had not onely lost all feeling of conscience, but had gotten a very glory in euill) in the ende they determined, that beating, and other such sharp dealing did not so much pull downe a womans harte, as it bred anger, and that nothing was more enemy to yeelding, then anger; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der harts take on the armour of obstinacy: (for thus did their wicked mindes blind to the light of vertue, &amp; owly eied in the night of wickednes interpret of it) &amp; that therfore that was no more to be tried.

But <hi>Cecropia,</hi> (who had already set downe to her selfe what she would do) with bitter both termes, &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, told her, that she should not neede to woo death ouer-egerly: for if her sister going before her did not teach her witt, herselfe should quickly follow. For since they were not to be gotten, there was no way for her sonnes quiet, but to know, that they were past getting. And so since no intreating, nor threatning might preuayle, she bad her prepare her eies for a new play, which she should see within fewe houres in the hall of that castle.</p>

And by and by came in at one ende of the hall, with about a dozen armed souldiers a Ladie, led by a couple, with her handes bounde before her: from aboue her eyes to her lippes muffled with a faire kerchiefe, but from her mouth to the shoulders all bare: and so was led on to a scaffold raised a good deale from the floore, and all couered with crimsin veluet.

Then how to preuent the next degree to death (which was her being possest by another) was the point of his minds labour: and in that he found no other way, but that <hi>Philoclea</hi> should pretend a yeelding vnto <hi>Cecropias</hi> request; &amp; so by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with <hi>Amphialus,</hi> and making faire (but delaying) promises, procure libertie for <hi>Zelmane</hi>; who onely wisht but to come by a sword, not doubting then to destroy them all, and deliuer <hi>Philoclea</hi>: so little did both the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and their forces seeme in her eyes, looking downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them from the hye toppe of affections tower.</p>

And with that (caried with the madnes of anguish, not hauing a redier way to kill himselfe) he ranne as hard as euer he could, with his head against the wall, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to braine himself: but the haste to doo it, made the doing the flower. For, as he came to giue the blow, his foot tript, so as it came not with the full force: yet forcible inough to strike him downe, and withall, to depriue him of his sense, so that he lay a while, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by the hurt, in that he felte not his discomfort.</p>

For, hauing in vaine attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fardest of her wicked eloquence, to make ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of vs yeeld to her sonne, and seeing that neither it, accompanied with great flatteries, and riche presents, could get any grounde of vs, nor yet the violent way she fell into of crueltie, tormenting our bodies, could preuayle with vs; at last, she made either of vs thinke the other dead, and so hoped to haue wrested our mindes to the forgetting of vertue: and first she gaue to mine eyes the miserable spectacle of my sisters (as<pb n="339" facs="tcp:11334:345"/> I thought) death: but indeede not my sister: it was onely <hi>Artesia,</hi> she who so cunningly brought vs to this misery. Truly I am sory for the poore Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though iustly she be punished for her double falshood: but <hi>Artesia</hi> muffled so, as you could not easily discerne her; and in my sisters apparell (which they had taken from her vnder colour of giuing her O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) did they execute: And when I (for thy sake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially deare <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) could by no force, nor feare be won, they assayed the like with my sister, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me downe vnder the scaffolde, and (making me thrust my head vp through a hole they had made ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) they did put about my poore necke a dishe of gold, where out they had beaten the bottome, so as hauing set bloud in it, you sawe how I played the parte of death (God knowes euen willing to haue done it in earnest) and so had they set me, that I reached but on tiptoes to the grounde, so as scarcely I could breathe, much lesse speake: And truely if they had kepte me there any whitlonger, they had strangled me, in steed of beheading me: but then they tooke me away, and seeking to see their issue of this practise, they found my noble sister (for the deare loue she vouchsafeth to beare me) so grieued withall, that she willed them to doo their vttermost crueltie vnto her: for she vowed, neuer to receiue sustenaunce of them, that had bene the causers of my murther: and finding both of vs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen giuen ouer, not like to liue many houres longer, and my sister <hi>Pamela,</hi> rather worse then my selfe, (the strength of her harte worse bearing those indignities) the good woman <hi>Cecropia</hi> (with the same pittie as folkes keepe foule, when they are not fatte inough for<pb facs="tcp:11334:346"/> their eating) made vs know her deceipt, &amp; let vs come one to another; with what ioye you can well imagine, who I know feele the like; sauing that we only thought our selues reserued to miseries, and therefore fitter for condoling, then congratulating. For my parte, I am fully perswaded, it is but with a little respite, to haue a more feeling sense of the tormentes she prepares for vs. True it is, that one of my guardians would haue me to beleeue, that this proceedes of my gentle cousin <hi>Amphialus</hi>: who hauing hearde some inckling that we were euill entreated, had called his mother to his bedside, from whence he neuer rose since his last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and besought, &amp; charged her vpon all the loue she bare him, to vse vs with all kindnesse: vowing, with all the imprecations he could imagine, that if euer he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood for his sake, that I receiued further hurt then the want of my libertie, he woulde not liue an houre longer. And the good woman sware to me that he would kill his mother, if he knewe how I had bene dealte with; but that <hi>Cecropia</hi> keepes him from vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thinges how they passe, onely hauing heard a whispering, and my selfe named, he had (of aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce, forsooth, of honorable loue) giuen this charge for vs. Whereupon this enlargement of mine was growne: for my parte I know too well their cunning (who leaue no mony vnoffered that may buy mine honour) to beleeue any worde they say, but (my deare <hi>Pyrocles</hi>) euen looke for the worste, and prepare my selfe for the same. Yet I must confesse, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to robbe from death, and borrowe of my misery the sweet comfort of seeing my sweet sister, and moste sweete comforte of thee my <hi>Pyrocles.</hi> And so hauing<pb n="340" facs="tcp:11334:346"/> leaue, I came stealing into your chamber: where (O Lord) what a ioy it was vnto me, to heare you so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnise the funerals of the poore <hi>Philoclea</hi>? That I my selfe might liue to heare my death bewailed? and by whom? by my deere <hi>Pyrocles.</hi> That I saw death was not strong enough to diuide thy loue from me? O my <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> I am too well paide for my paines I haue suffred: ioyfull is my woe for so noble a cause; and welcome be all miseries, since to thee I am so welcome. Alas how I pittied to heare thy pittie of me; and yet a great while I could not finde in my hart to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt thee, but often had euen pleasure to weepe with thee: and so kindly came forth thy lamentations, that they inforced me to lament to, as if indeed I had beene a looker on, to see poore <hi>philoclea</hi> dye.

But <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> who had felt (with so smal dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time) in himself the ouerthrow both of hope and despaire, knew not to what key he should tune his mind, either of ioy, or sorrow.

But when he had a little taken breath from the panting motion of such contrarietie in passions, he fell to consider with her of her present estate, both comforting her, that certainely the worst of this storme was past, since alreadie they had done the worst, which mans wit could imagine: and that if they had determined to haue killed her, they would haue now done it: and also earnestly counselling her, and inhabling his counsels with vehement prayers, that she would so far second the hopes of <hi>Amphialus,</hi> as that she might but procure him liberty; promising then as much to her, as the liberalitie of louing corage durst promise to himselfe.</p>

But when the bodie was carried thorough the gate, and the people (sauing such as were appointed) not suffred to goe further, then was such an vniuersal crie, as if they had all had but one life, and all receaued but one blow.</p>
               <p>Which so moued <hi>Anaxius</hi> to consider the losse of <label type="milestone">

               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>3</label> This message was brought vnto the sisters, as they sate at that time together with <hi>Zelmane,</hi> conferring how to carrie themselues, hauing heard of the death of <hi>Amphialus.</hi> And as <hi rend="margQuotes">no expectation of death is so pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as where the resolution is hindred by the intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hopes,</hi> so did this new alarum, though not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue, yet moue som what the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancy of their minds, which were so vnconstantly dealt with. But within a while, the excellent <hi>Pamela</hi> had brought her minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to his old acquaintance: and then, as carefull for her sister (whom most deerely she loued) Sister (said she) you see how many acts our Tragedy hath: Fortune is not, yet a wearie of vexing vs: but what? A shippe is not counted strong for byding one strome? It is but the same trumpet of death, which now perhaps giues the last sounde: and let vs make that profite of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miseries, that in them we learned to dye willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Truely said <hi>Philoclea,</hi> deare sister, I was so beaten with the euils of life, that though I had not vertue enough to despise the sweetnesse of it, yet my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse bredde that strength, to be wearie of the paines of it: onely I must confesse, that little hope, which by these late accidents was awaked in me, was at the first angrie withall. But euen in the darkenesse of that horrour, I see a light of comfort appeare; and how can I treade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, that see <hi>Pamelas</hi> steppes? I would onely (O that my wish might take place) that my schoole-Mistres might liue, to see me say my lesson truely. Were that a life, my <hi>Philoclea</hi>? said <hi>Pamela.</hi> No, no, (said she) let it come, and put on his worst face: for at the worst it is<pb n="350" facs="tcp:11334:357"/> but a bug-beare. Ioy is it to me to see you so well resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and since the world will not haue vs, let it lose vs. Onely (with that she stayed a little, and sight) onely my <hi>Philoclea,</hi> (then she bowed downe, and whispered in her eare) onely <hi>Musidorus,</hi> my shepheard, comes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene me and death, and makes me thinke I should not dye, because I know he would not I should dye. With that <hi>Philoclea</hi> sighed also, saying no more, but looking vpon <hi>Zelmane</hi>: who was walking vp &amp; downe the chamber, hauing heard this message from <hi>Anaxius,</hi> and hauing in times past heard of his nature, thought him like enough to performe it, which winded her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the former maze of perplexitie. Yet deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with her selfe of the manner how to preuent it, she continued her musing humour, little saying, or indeed, little finding in her hart to say, in a case of such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, where peremptorily death was threatned: and so stayed they; hauing yet that comfort, that they might tarrie togither. <hi>Pamela</hi> nobly, <hi>Philoclea</hi> sweetly, and <hi>Zelmane</hi> sadly, and desperately none of them entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sleepe, which they thought should shortly begin, neuer to awake.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Anaxius</hi> came home, hauing safely conducted <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>4</label> 
                  <hi>Helen</hi>: and safely he might wel do it: For though many of <hi>Basilius</hi> Knights would haue attempted something vpon <hi>Anaxius</hi> by that meanes to deliuer the Ladies, yet <hi>Philanax,</hi> hauing receiued his masters comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, &amp; knowing his word was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent vnto it. And the black-Knight (who by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was able to carie abroad his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds) did not know therof; but was bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forces, by force to deliuer his Lady. So as <hi>Anaxius,</hi> interpreting it rather feare, then faith, and making<pb facs="tcp:11334:358"/> euen chance an argument of his vertue, returned: and as soone as he was returned, with a felon hart calling his brothers vp with him, he went into the chamber, where they were all three togither; with full intention to kill the sisters with his owne hands, and send their heads for tokens to their father: Though his brothers (who were otherwise inclined) disswaded him: but his reuerence stayed their perswasions. But when he was come into the chamber, with the very words of chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike threatning climing vp his throate, his eies first ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon <hi>Pamela</hi>; who hearing he was comming, and looking for death, thought she would keepe her owne maiestie in welcomming it; but the beames there of so strake his eyes, with such a counterbuffe vnto his pride, that if his anger could not so quickly loue, nor his pride so easily honor, yet both were forced to finde a worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neffe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>5</label> Which while it bred a pause in him, <hi>Zelmane</hi> (who had ready in her mind both what and how to say) stept out vnto him, &amp; with a resolute stayendes (void either of anger, kindnes, disdaine, or humblenesse) spake in this sort. <hi>Anaxius</hi> (said she) if <hi>Fame</hi> have not bene ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall to thee, thou art a man of exceeding valour. Therefore I doo call thee euen before that vertue, and will make it the iudge betweene vs. And now I doo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that to the eternall blot of all the faire actes that thou hast done, thou doest weakly, in seeking without daunger to reuenge his death, whose life wfth daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thou mightst perhaps haue preferued: thou doost cowardly, in going about by the death of these excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Ladies, to preuent the iust punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they by the powers, which they better then their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<pb n="351" facs="tcp:11334:358"/> ther, or any other could make, might lay vpon thee; and doost most basely, in once presenting thy selfe as an executioner; a vile office vpon men, and in a iust cause: beyond the degree of any vile worde, in so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust a cause, and vpon Ladies, and such Ladies. And therefore, as a hangman, I say, thou art vnworthy to be counted a Knight, or to be admitted into the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of Knights. Neither for what, I say, will I all eadge other reasons, of wisdome, or iustice, to prooue my speech, because I know thou doost disdaine to be tied to their rules: but euen in thine owne vertue (whereof thou so much gloriest) I will make my triall: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore defie thee, by the death of one of vs two, to proue, or disproue these reproaches. Choose thee what armes thou likest, I onely demaund, that these Ladies (whom I defend) may in liberty see the combat.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Zelmane</hi> began her speech, the excellency of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">argument key no. </seg>6</label> her beautie, and grace, made him a little content to heare. Besides that, a new lesson he had read in <hi>Pamela,</hi> had already taught him some regard. But when she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into brauerie of speech, he thought at first, a mad, and railing humor or possest her; till, finding the speeches hold well together, and at length come to flatte chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of combat; he stood leaning back with his bodie and head, sometimes with bent browes looking vpon the one side of her, sometimes of the other, beyonde maruell maruailing, that he, who had neuer heard such speeches from any Knight, should be thus rebuffed by a woman; and that maruell made him heare out her speech: which ended, he turned his head to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Zoilus,</hi> and said nothing, but onely lifting vp his eyes, smiled. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> finding his minde, <hi>Anaxius</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11334:359"/> (said she) perchaunce thou disdaynest to answere me, because, as a woman, thou thinkest me not fitte to be fought withall. But I tell thee, that I haue bene trayned vp in martial matters, with so good successe, that I haue many times ouercome better Knightes then thy selfe: and am well knowen to be equall in feates of armes, to the famous <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> who slewe thy valiaunt Vncle, the Giant <hi>Euardes.</hi> The remembraunce of his Vncles death something netled him, so as he answered thus.</p>
               <p>Indeed (saide he) any woman may be as valiaunt as that coward, and traytorly boy, who slewe my Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle trayterouslie, and after ranne from me in the plaine field. Fiue thousand such could not haue ouercome <hi>Euardes,</hi> but by falshood. But I sought him all ouer <hi>Asia,</hi> following him still from one of his cony-holes to another: till, comming into this Countrie, I heard of my friendes being besieged, and so came to blowe away the wretches that troubled him. But wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the miserable boy flie, heauen, nor hell, shall keep his harte from being torne by these handes. Thou lyest in thy throate (said <hi>Zelmane</hi>) that boye, where euer he went, did so noble actes, as thy harte (as proude as it is) dares not thinke of, much lesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme. But to please thee the better with my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, I tell thee, no creature can be neerer of kinne to him, then my selfe: and so well we loue, that he woulde not be sorrier for his owne death, then for mine: I being begotten by his father, of an Amazon Ladie. And therefore, thou canst not deuise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge thy selfe more vpon him, then by killing me: which, if thou darest doo mansuilie, doo it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if thou harme these incomparable Ladies, or<pb n="352" facs="tcp:11334:359"/> my selfe, without daring to fight with me, I protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Knightes, and before heauen, and earth, (that will reueale thy shame) that thou art the begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest dastardly villaine, that dishonoureth the earth with his steppes: and if thou lettest me ouer-liue them, so will I blaze thee. But all this could not moue <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxius,</hi> but that he onely said, Euill should it become the terror of the world, to fight, much lesse to skolde with thee.</p>
               <p>But (said he) for the death of these same (pointing <label type="milestone">

In summe, in all his speeches, more like the bestower, then the desirer of felicitie. Whom it was an excellent pastime (to those that would delight in the play of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rue) to see, with what a wittie ignorance she would not vnderstand: and how, acknowledging his perfections, she would make, that one of his perfections, not to be iniurions to Ladies. But when he knew not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, then would he fall to touching and toying, still vewing his gracesin no glasse but self-liking. To which, <hi>Philocleas</hi> shamefastnes, and humblenes, were as strong resisters,as choller, and disdaine. For though she yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, he thought she was to be ouercome: and that thought a while stayed him from further violence. But <hi>Zelmane</hi> had eye to his behauiour, and set in her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, vpon the score of Reuenge, while she her selfe was no lesse attempted by <hi>Zoilus</hi>; who lesse full of bragges, was forwardest in offering (indeed) dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable violence.</p>

But <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> whose soule might well be separeted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his body, but neuer aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the remembring what was comely, if at the first<pb n="359" facs="tcp:11334:366"/> he did a little apprehend the dangerousnes of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie, whom once before he had something tried, &amp; now perfectly saw, as the very picture of forcible furie: yet was that apprehension quickly stayed in him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strengthning, then weakning his vertue by that wrestling; like wine, growing the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger by being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. So that they both, prepared in harts, and able in hands, did honor solitarines there with such a combat, as might haue demaunded, as a right of fortune, whole armies of beholders. But no beholders needed there, where manhood blew the trumpet, &amp; satisfaction did whette, as much as glorie. There was strength against nimblenes; rage, against resolution; fury, against vertue; confidence, against courage; pride, against noblenesse: loue, in both, breeding mutual hatred, &amp; desire of reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the iniurie of his brothers slaughter, to <hi>Anaxius,</hi> being like <hi>Philocleas</hi> captituity to <hi>Pyrocles.</hi> Who had seen the one, would haue thought nothing could haue resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted; who had marked the other, would haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled that the other had so long resisted. But like two contrarie tides, either of which are able to carry worldes of shippes, and men vpon them, with such swiftnes, as nothing seemes able to withstand them: Yet meeting one another, with mingling their watrie forces, and strugling together, it is long to say whether streame gets the victorie: So betweene these, if <hi>Pallas</hi> had been there, she could scarcely haue tolde, whether she had nurced better in the feates of armes. The Irish greyhound, against the English mastiffe; the sword-fish, against the whale; the Rhinoceros, against the elepha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, might be models, &amp; but models of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat. <hi>Anaxius</hi> was better armed defensiuely: for (beside a strong caske<pb facs="tcp:11334:367"/> brauely couered, wherwith he couerd his head) he had a huge shield, such perchance, as <hi>Achilles</hi> shewed to the pale walles of Troy, where with all that body was coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> vtterly vnarmed for defence, to offend had the aduantage: for, in either hand he had a sword, &amp; with both hands nimbly performed that office. And according as they were diuersly furnished, so did they differ in the manner of fighting. For <hi>Anaxius</hi> most by warding, and <hi>Pyrocles</hi> oftnest by auoyding, resisted the aduerfaries assault. Both hastie to end, yet both often staying for aduantage. Time, distance, &amp; motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> custom made them so perfect in, that as if they had bene felow Counsellers, and not enemies, each knewe the others minde, and knew how to preuent it. So as their stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth fayled them sooner then their skill, and yet their breath fayled them sooner then their strength. And breathles indeed they grew, before either could complaine of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny losse of bloud.</p>

For in this pausing, ech had brought to his thoughts the maner of the others fighting, and the aduantages, which by that, and by the qualitie of their weapons, they might work themselues; and so againe repeated the lesson they had said before, more perfectly, by the vsing of it. <hi>Anaxius</hi> oftner vsed blowes, his huge force (as it were) more delighting therein, and the large protection of his shield, animating him vnto it. <hi>Pyrocles,</hi> of a more<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fine, and deliuer strength, watching his time when to giue fitte thrustes; as with the quick obeying of his bodie, to his eyes quicke commaundement, he shunned any harme <hi>Anaxius</hi> could do to him: so would he soon haue made an end of <hi>Anaxius,</hi> if he had not fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of<pb facs="tcp:11334:368"/> wonderful, &amp; almost matchlesse excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy in matters of armes. <hi>Pyrocles</hi> vsed diuers saynings, to bring <hi>Anaxius</hi> on, into some inconuenience.
