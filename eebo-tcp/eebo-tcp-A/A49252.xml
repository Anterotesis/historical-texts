         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He exuberant ſpawns of illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Books proceeding from the polluted wombs of the overloaded, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaded adulterate preſſes, which are all painted with fair titles, I can compare to nothing ſo fitly as a cheating Lotte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; which when the greedy invader comes with hopes for a little money laid down, to carry away a great deal of wit with him, 'tis nineteen at leaſt to one when he opens it, but he finds to his ſhame, that he hath drawn a blank, perhaps a blaſphemy; and yet couched under the title of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth, heavenly diſcoveries, beams of light, new Jeruſalem, Gods minde clearly revealed, with multitudes of ſuch paints upon their ſtrumpets faces.</p>
            <p>The ſacred Bible which indeed is an Alablaſter-box full of ſweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
<pb facs="tcp:102944:3"/>
and precious ointments, is made (alas!) like <hi>Pandora</hi>'s boxe (in the humane ſtory) which <hi>(Epimetheus</hi> preſumptuouſly opening) filled the world with evils, diſeaſes and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all kindes. The ſacred Bible is made now the patron of Prophane mens practiſes; never were groſſe ſins at ſuch an impudent height as now they are; what horrid impudence is that of hel to take heaven by the hand? Sins that were wont to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the holes and clefts of obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not daring to be hold the light, but Serpent-like, to creep under the low ſhrubs of deceitfull ſhifts, how do they Eagle-like ſit pearching on the goodly Cedars (I mean Pulpits and Thrones) the Cedars of God, and dare to caſt up their eyes towards the Sun? who would think it! yet what this day more common then to meet the devill with his eyes towards heaven, and a Bible under his arme, cloathing all his words and actions cap a pea in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſes; Murderers, traitors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, blaſphemers, ſoothſayers, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
<pb facs="tcp:102944:3"/>
ſabbath-breakers, perjurers, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours, and almoſt all notorious vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains have marſhalled themſelves (like the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy) into ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Sects of religion, all impudently aſſuming to themſelves the uſurped title of eminent Saints, and quoting Scripture for their actions, and ſcot-free paſſe the preſſe into the world to make more proſelytes: ſo that he that in this <hi>Soul-frozen</hi> age ſhall go to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Books to warm his <hi>Soul,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> did ſticks to warm his fingers) will be ſure, if he be not wary, to gather vipers into his boſome: And how am I ſtung with pain and horrour, whiles I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the thouſands of poor ſouls that are gnawed to death by theſe ſpeckled vipers! Sure it cannot but ſit ſad one day upon the ſpirits of thoſe licentious Licencers, that are as the midwives of ſuch monſters.</p>
            <p>For thy comfort therefore and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement (Reader) I do aſſure thee this Book is free from all ſuch veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beaſts, no toad of malice, nor ſerpent of deceit lurks either in the

matter or the phraſe hereof. In plain Engliſh, it is a pleaſant, heavenly, ſelf-ſearching, ſoul-convincing, ſin-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, heart-humbling, ſpirit-rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, grace-quickning, Chriſt-exalting book. I need ſay no more, they are the Sermons of Mr. <hi>Chriſtopher Love,</hi> Maſter of Arts, and Miniſter of the Goſpell of Chriſt, whoſe actions, life and death, will eternize his name; I may truly ſay of his elegant ſtyle, and pleaſant way of expreſſing himſelf, as he of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Beloved, this is a ſubject I could never have occaſion to ſpeak to you of before, and yet it is a point of admirable uſe, eſpecially in theſe times, wherein people think that when once they are brought into a ſtate of Grace, they muſt live in divine raptures, and revelations, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall joyes, above duties and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and never look back into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinfulneſſe and wickedneſſe they were guilty of before their converſion: Why, here the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were converted men, and had extraordinary priviledges, they were brought <hi>to ſit in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and yet the Apoſtle bids them remember their former ſinfulneſſe and miſery, Remember O you <hi>Epheſians</hi> that ye were once without Chriſt, and you were Aliens to the Common-wealth

of Iſrael, &amp;c. therefore you muſt take heed of this, to think that when you are converted, you muſt be only rapt up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third heavens, and never look back into your former condition; you ſee here the Apoſtle bids you remember what you were at that time during your unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eſtate, <hi>that you were then without Chriſt, and ſtrangers to the Covenants of promiſe,</hi> &amp;c. So that you ſee it is the will of God, that men in a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eſtate ſhould often cal to minde the ſins and miſerie they were in before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
               <p>Now before I come to give you the Reaſons of the point, give me leave to premiſe theſe three Cautions; when I tell you, that after your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſion, you ſhould call to minde your ſin and miſery before converſion, you muſt not do it 1. with complacency of ſpirit; nor 2. with ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of heart; nor 3. with deſpondency of minde.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Caution </seg>1</label> 1. You muſt not cal to minde your former ſinfulneſſe with complacency of ſpirit, to pleaſe your humors; you muſt not do as ſome great men uſe to do, that have been guilty of great and crying ſins; as adultery, drunkenneſſe, ſwearing, and the like, in their youth; go tell and boaſt of them in their age; this is a very great wickedneſſe: you muſt call to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102944:8"/>
minde your former ſinfulneſſe not with complacency, but with bitterneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, with grief, ſorrow, and perplexity of heart: Many men will tel you large ſtories of the wickedneſſe, that they have committed; but they do it with delight, and if they had ſtrength and abilities, they would be guilty of the ſame ſins and wickedneſſes ſtil; which is a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly practiſe, and that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture condemns men for, as in the 23. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 19, 21. <hi>Yet ſhe multiplyed her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,</hi>

heart neither: Beloved, there are many men can remember what lewd courſes they have taken, and what wicked lives they have lived; how often they have been drunk and unclean, and the like; and yet are never troubled at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it; their hearts do not ſmite them with remorſe and ſorrow, but are like a rock; the ſenſe of ſin never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them: this is no way of calling ſin to remembrance, with a blockiſh and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid heart, this is not thanks worthy; but it muſt be done with a broken, and a bleeding, and a contrite heart: And,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Take in this caution too, it muſt not be done with deſpondency of minde neither. There are many converted ones, that do cal their ſins to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, but it makes them diſcouraged and unwilling to come to Chriſt, it makes them think that they have no intereſt in the covenant of grace; but this ſhould not be, the true effect that the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your former ſinfulneſſe ſhould produce, ſhould be your laying your ſouls low, and making them humble, and the more ſenſible of that indiſpenſable need you have of Chriſt, of going unto him for ſalvation and comfort.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Cautions neceſſary to be premiſed; I come now to give you the Reaſons of the point, why it is the will

it ſo is, becauſe this will be as a ſpur to quicken and engage men to be more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in grace, after their converſion: when a man doth frequently and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider how bad and ſinful he was before converſion, it cannot but provoke him now to be more humble and holy, after his converſion.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102944:10"/>
them often; before converſion, he did compell men to blaſpheme Chriſt, but after converſion, he was very earneſt to perſwade people to beleive in Chriſt; he was exceeding mad againſt them before converſion, but afterward hee was ſo exceeding zealous for the people of God, that every one thought hee had been mad: and laſtly, before converſion he did perſecute Saints to ſtrange Cities, but afterwards he did go preaching of the Goſpel to ſtrange Cities: Oh my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, let <hi>Pauls</hi> pattern be your task, cal to minde your ſin and wickedneſſe in your unconverted condition, but ſo that it may provoke you, that now you are converted, you may labour to abound in grace, as formerly you have abounded in ſin.</p>

Another reaſon why God will have us call to minde the ſin and miſery we were in before converſion, is, becauſe this will be a means to kindle a great deal of pity and compaſſion in our ſouls, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that remain yet unconverted: this the Apoſtle exhorts us to in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 2, 3. <hi>Speak evill of no man,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>be no brawler,</hi>

ſhould have ſaid, I <hi>Paul,</hi> and thou <hi>Titus,</hi> we were ſinful as wel as they, and did ſerve divers luſts as wel as they once, let us therefore be pitiful, and merciful, and compaſſionate towards them, this conſideration wil greatly provoke us to commiſerate poor ſinful ſouls; the great reaſon why we pity them no more then we do, is becauſe we do not cal to mind our own ſinfulneſſe, and what we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converſion.</p>

1 A man may have a <hi>common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of Chriſt, and yet be without a ſpirituall knowledge of Chriſt, he may have a naturall knowledge by the works of God, by hearing, reading, or the like, and yet be without a ſpirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to know Chriſt in a ſpirituall manner.</p>

               <p>Oh therefore I beſeech you in the fear of God, look about you, to ſee whether you are the men that have a reall actuall intereſt in Chriſt or no. Are you ſuch men as are without the ſpirit of Chriſt? or are you without a ſaving power deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Chriſt, enabling you to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your boſome luſts? Are you without an unfeigned love to the perſon of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or without a true and ſaving knowledg of Chriſt? Are you contentedly ignorant of Chriſt, and care not to know more? or are you obſtinately ignorant, and wil not learn more? Are you without a hearing ear, and an obedient heart to the Word of Chriſt? Do you take greater induſtry, and complacency in the committing of ſin, then ever you did in the performance of any holy duty? Or do you backſlide from the wayes of Chriſt both in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in practiſe? If there be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of theſe ſeaven Characters in you, then conclude that you have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt at all in Chriſt, conclude then that at this time you are without Jeſus Chriſt.

A childe of God he ſees ſo many luſts in his own heart, and ſo many ſins within him, that he can ſcarſe have a charitable thought of his own ſoul, as <hi>David</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>The Lord had forſaken him, and caſt him off for ever:</hi> godly men are very apt to paſſe very harſh cenſures upon their own ſouls.</p>

the reaſon why they did not know, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well obſerves, was becauſe they did not know their own thoughts, they thought they did not know, but yet Chriſt he knew that they did know.

But here to branch out this more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I ſhall ſhew you in five particulars, wherein a man without Jeſus Chriſt wants ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every man out of Chriſt, wants <note place="margin">1.

As that would be an uncomfortable dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, where the Sun ſhould not ſhine by day, nor the Moon by night: even ſo would thy ſoul be very diſconſolate, if Chriſt did not ſhine in upon thy heart, the comforts of a child of God does either ebbe or flow, as Chriſt either comes to him, or goes from him.</p>

Take this caution, that men may be ſtrongly conceited and opinionated, that they have an intereſt in Chriſt when they have not: I ſhall give you a plain text for this in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 7. <hi>Doe you look on things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the outward appearance?</hi> (ſayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>if any man truſt to himſelf, that hee is Chriſts, let him of himſelf think this again, that as he is Chriſts, even ſo are we Chriſts:</hi> This is a very notable place; there were ſome among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that were ſtrongly conceited they did belong to Chriſt, when they did not; and had an ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtles, and thought they did not belong to Chriſt; and to ſuch as theſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks: men may be ſtrongly conceited they have an intereſt in Chriſt, when there is no ſuch matter, as it was with the Church of <hi>Laodioea,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Thou ſayeſt I am rich and increaſed in goods, and have need of nothing: and knoweſt</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Laſtly, take in this caution likewiſe, that in giving you theſe Characters, I ſhall not preſſe them ſo, as if the having of all theſe in exerciſe and feeling, and in your own apprehenſions, can only evidence your having an intereſt in Chriſt, but if you have them in habit, and in truth,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102944:47"/>
though not in exerciſe and practiſe, it is ſufficient to evidence your intereſt in Chriſt. For a poor ſoul may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny graces of Gods Spirit in truth in him, though he doth not feel, and exerciſe, and apprehend them in himſelf, as I told you it was with <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> ſhe talked to Chriſt face to face, and ſayes ſhe, <hi>they have</hi>

                  <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf,</hi> now one would think this man were a very holy and exact man; for ſayes he, <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf,</hi> that is, I know no ſin upon my ſoul, that I perform wittingly or willingly: but mark the next words, yet ſayes he, <hi>am I not hereby juſtified;</hi> he was quite out of conceit of all the good works that ever he did: every man that is in Chriſt, he is out of himſelf; he ſees his own in ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and Chriſts all-ſufficiency; he ſees his emptineſſe of grace, and Chriſts fulneſſe of grace; he ſees himſelf to be nothing, and Chriſt to be all in all. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 15. <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 15.</note> ſayes Chriſt there to the Phariſees, <hi>Ye are they which juſtifie your ſelves before men, but God knoweth your hearts;</hi> as if hee ſhould have ſaid, you think well of your ſelves and of your graces, but God knoweth your hearts, that you are not ſuch as you ſeem to be; and therefore (Beloved) conſider ſeriouſly of it, if God hath

that there is no known ſin but you labour to avoid, and no known grace but you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to exerciſe, and no known duty, but you labour to perform; if it be thus with you, you may comfort your ſelves in this, that you have a reall intereſt in Chriſt.</p>

Another character or diſcovery is this, he that hath an intereſt in Chriſt, he hath a power derived from Chriſt, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him to mortifie his inward and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome luſts: as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>They that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and luſts;</hi> when Chriſt came in the fleſh amongſt us we crucified him, but if ever Chriſt come in thy heart, he will crucifie thee; the crucifying of the fleſh with the affections and luſts that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here ſpeaks of, is not the killing and totall extirpation of ſin, but the giving a deadly blow to ſin, that ſin ſhall never reign in us, nor have dominion over us any more; if you be in Chriſt, ſin will be like thoſe beaſts ſpoken of in <hi>Daniel, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were preſerved for a little ſeaſon;</hi> ſo the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin wil be taken away, that ſin ſhal not reign in you, yet the life and being of ſin will remain in you for a little ſeaſon: but ſtill as the <hi>houſe of Saul</hi> grew weaker <note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 1.</note> and weaker, when the <hi>houſe of David</hi> grew ſtronger and ſtronger, ſo if Chriſt dwell in thy heart, ſin in thy ſoul will every day

                  <hi>Joh. He that ſaith he abideth in him, ought himſelf ſo alſo to walk, even as he walked:</hi> Hence it is that you finde in Scripture, that <hi>being in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>living a godly life,</hi> are both joined together; as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> that man whoſe perſon is in Chriſt, will labour
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102944:52"/>
that his wayes may be in Chriſt too; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a one would gladly have his perſon in Chriſt, though his life be not in Chriſt, but thoſe whoſe perſons and wayes are both in Chriſt, they may lay a comfortable claim to him; the difference between a man that hath an intereſt in Chriſt, and one that hath none, I ſhall demonſtrate to you by this familiar example: you know, a man that by experience knows what it is to make clean a room, he will be carefull that he does not upon every ſlight occaſion, dirt it again, becauſe he knowes, what a deal of pains and labour is taking in cleanſing of it; but now a dog or a ſpaniell he comes in and never cares for dirting of it, becauſe he does not know what it is to make it clean; why ſo a godly man, he will be carefull of walking worthy of his intereſt in Chriſt, becauſe he knowes how much it coſt him, how many tears, and ſighs, and groans, and prayers, before he got an intereſt in Chriſt, and an aſſurance of his love; but now a wicked man, he makes no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſinning againſt Chriſt, and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of him, becauſe he never knew what it was to get an intereſt in him. In <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. ſayes the Apoſtle there, <hi>as many as have Christ, they have put on Chriſt;</hi> and a very learned interpreter hath an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good note upon this text; he ſayes
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102944:52"/>
that this ſpeech of the Apoſtle here, is ſpoken in an alluſion to an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome among the heathens, that when they came to the profeſſion of the Faith, they were wont alwayes between Eaſter and Whitſuntide to put off their old garments, and put on <hi>white rayments;</hi> the end of it was to typifie and note, that when once they were in Chriſt, they muſt leave off their old courſes and converſations, and now labour to walk after a more holy, and blameleſſe, and innocent life, in their carriages towards God: thus (beloved) if you have an intereſt in Chriſt, you have put on Chriſt, walking worthy of him, in a holy, pure, ſpotleſſe, and unblameable life and converſation.</p>

In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle after he had told them, of their being <hi>built upon Chriſt, as lively ſtones upon the foundation;</hi> he concludes, <hi>to you therefore which beleeve Chriſt is precious;</hi> intimating, that whoſoever is founded and bottomed upon Chriſt, Chriſt is very precious to that ſoul, and therefore you (beloved)
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102944:53"/>
that have a ſure teſtimony in your own conſciences, that you doe ſet a high price and value, and eſteem upon Chriſt, above all things in the world, and that you count all other things as <hi>droſſe and dung,</hi> in compariſon of an intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this is a very good and undoubted evidence that you have an intereſt in him. It was an excellent ſpeech of one concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his intereſt in Chriſt; ſayes he, if all the ſtones in my houſe were Diamonds, and all the duſt in my houſe ſhavings of gold, and every peble ſtone, an orient pearl, yet would I not prize nor value theſe in compariſon of my intereſt in Chriſt.</p>

and qualities, ſome are rich, ſome poore, ſome high, ſome low, ſome maſters, ſome ſervants, and the like; now in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, the Church may be compared to a Commonwealth, for in the Church of God ſome are high, ſome low, ſome rich, ſome poore, ſome men grown up to a full ſtature in Chriſt, others are but new begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and babes in Chriſt; ſome men are rich in gifts, when others are but poore and mean; ſome are ſtrong in grace, like the Oak, when others are but like a broken reed.

there be multitudes of people, yet they are all governed by one &amp; the ſame Laws, and are all ſubjects to one and the ſame Rulers: ſo it is in the Church of God, though there be many people in it, yet they are all ſubject to the ſame Laws, and are all to walk by the ſame rule; and in this regard it may be compared to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for there is but one rule, the word of God, that ſwayes the whole Church.</p>

In a Commonwealth it is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed high Treaſon to ſubvert or overthrow any Law by which that Commonwealth is governed; for if it were not ſo, the Laws of a Commonwealth would be of no force, if any man might break them: add to them or take from them at his pleaſure, and therefore a Commonwealth does count the breaking and violation of their Laws to be the greateſt injury and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that can be done to them: and ſo it is in the Church, the word of God is very ſevere in this regard, that if any man ſhall adde or diminiſh any jot or tittle to or <note place="margin">Revel. 22. 18, 19.</note> from the Word, God will blot his name out of the Book of life.</p>

the Church of God is diſtinguiſhed from all other parts, and people of the World, Commonwealths are different one from another in four things. 1. in Laws; 2. in habit; 3. in language; 4. in Government; and ſo is the Church of God.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. There is a difference in the extent of thoſe Laws; the Law of a commonwealth doth onely reach and extend to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, that cannot rule the inward man, therefore we commonly ſay our thoughts are free, God onely can ſearch the heart and try the reins, but now the Law of the Church extends its ſelf, to the ſearching of the ſoul and ſpirit, every thought and imagination of the heart; as the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>the Law is ſpirituall, but</hi>

There is a difference in regard of the power and efficacy of theſe Laws; the Laws of a commonwealth doe onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the outward man, if you do amiſs, but the Law of God in the Church, that cannot onely reſtrain in practiſe, but change the heart, and alter the affections, and make thee a new man.</p>

law grievous or burdenſome to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they may alter it, or take it away, and adde a new Law in the room of it, but this the Church of God cannot doe, the law that the Church hath now, it muſt have to the end of the world, God himſelf gave the Law to his Church, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give a prejudicial or burdenſome law, whereas Rulers of Commonwealths, they are but men, and cannot look into the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of things; and therefore are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant whether this or that law may be good or no, and therefore doe change them at their pleaſure when they ſee a neceſſity; but the rule of the Word of God is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring and unalterable rule, which all muſt follow and practiſe to the end of the World.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. They differ in their cenſure, the cenſure of a Commonwealth may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo far as to confiſcation of goods, to baniſhment, impriſonment, or death, but the cenſure of the Church extends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to excommunication, or throwing the offender out of their ſociety or fellowſhip, they can doe no more, and muſt doe no more, the Church of Chriſt can inflict no cenſure, but onely to excommunicate, and therefore their practiſe that doe impriſon and cenſure and inflict puniſhment upon their people, is not warrantable but does contradict the rule of the Word; and thoſe
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102944:59"/>
likewiſe that doe cry out againſt Church Government, as tyrannicall, do very much miſtake, for the Church of God their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is not corporeall but ſpirituall. But though the Church may not cenſure any man that is an offender, yet ſhe may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the Commonwealth, and they may reſtrain and quell them and keep them under, and inflict puniſhments upon them.</p>
               <p>Thus then you ſee both wherein a Church and a Commonwealth doe agree, and wherein they difler, and if this be ſo that the Church of God is a ſpirituall Commonwealth, then give me leave to draw theſe three Inferences from hence.</p>

I muſt tell you (to the griefe of our hearts be it ſpoken) there were never leſſe unity in the Church of God, ſince the very firſt plantation of it, by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in the Primitive times, then there is at this day, wherein every man almoſt is ſet one againſt another; truly I look upon it, as a very ſad Omen and prediction, that God is bringing in upon us the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall perſecution that ever yet our eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. I have read in the book of Martyrs, that the coming in of the eighth perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was occaſioned by the diviſion &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of Chriſtians one with another; I wiſh it may not be ſo with us (Beloved) it is ordinary amongſt a great many men to cry out &amp; exclaim againſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as if they were the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries and cauſers of diviſions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions amongſt you, but I would have you know that thoſe that preach againſt diviſion, are not dividers, but thoſe that make diviſions they are dividers, as the

Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Mark them that cauſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among you, and avoid them,</hi> thoſe men that have cauſed diviſions, and brought in ſtrange opinions, and Sects, and ſchiſms into the land, they are the make-bates of the Nation; the <hi>ſtaffe of Union</hi> and the <hi>ſtaffe of Beauty,</hi> when one is broken, the other is broken.

               <p n="1">1. You may know whether you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the covenant of grace or no, in caſe you doe partake of the ſpirituall bleſſings of the covenant:</p>

It notes a ſpeciall propriety in God, which none have but the elect. 2. It notes an all-ſufficiency in God for their good. 3. It notes an abſolute authority, that God hath over them.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. For <hi>God to be our God,</hi> it notes that God is yours in a ſpeciall way of <hi>propriety,</hi> which none but thoſe that are the children of God can have, wicked men cannot lay claim to God as their God; as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when he deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for him, ſayes he <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord your God,</hi> he could not ſay <hi>againſt the Lord my God,</hi> you that can upon Scripture grounds, lay claim to God as your God, as having a ſpeciall propriety in him, you have an intereſt in the covenant of grace.</p>

If you finde that God is yours in theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, you may comfort your heart in an unqueſtionable intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, if God be your God, and you his people, that you have given up, and devoted your ſelves wholly to the ſervice of God in every thing that you doe.</p>

2. Another ſpeciall bleſſing of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace is, that God hath promiſed to ſanctifie and renew your natures: as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. ſaies God there, <hi>A new heart</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and will take away the ſtony hearts out of your boſomes, and will give you hearts of fleſh, and I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes, and you ſhall keep my judgments and do them:</hi> God will not onely give us life for our happineſſe, but grace for our holineſſe; he will not only give us imputed righteouſneſſe for our juſtification, but alſo inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for our ſanctification; now therefore examine your ſelves, have your natures ever been ſanctified, and regenerated? have you been ever waſhed with clean water, and thoſe ſtains of ſin and corruption wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away from you? hath the beaſom of ſanctification ever ſwept your inward man, and made it not a cave for every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean bird to lie in, but a habitation fit for the holy Ghoſt to dwell in? if it be ſo, you have a reall right to, and intereſt in the covenant of grace, for no man can have the bleſſings of the covenant, but he muſt have a beeing in the covenant of grace. It is very obſervable, that God is not only, as the covenant repreſents him, <hi>a God gracious and mercifull, ſlow to anger, and full of compaſſion,</hi> &amp;c. but he is a <hi>holy</hi> God as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102944:83"/>
well as a mercifull God; and therefore he will work holineſſe in us and expect holineſſe from us, if ever we expect to have mercy and happineſſe from him; never lay claim to God, nor expect life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe from him, as he is a mercifull God, unleſſe you reſolve to be conformable to him as he is a holy God.</p>

Another bleſſing of the covenant of grace, is Gods writing his Law in our hearts, that we ſhall never depart from him, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people;</hi> that is, God will put into our hearts a ſutable frame and diſpoſition anſwerable to every command of God in his Law, that

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. If you be a man under the covenant of grace, in covenant with God, then you are diſingaged from that league and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which you have made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with your luſts, whoſoever is in covenant with God, he hath broken his league with his luſts; you cannot be in covenant with Chriſt, till you fall off from your luſts, and break off from your ſins, as in <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 25, 26. ſayes the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">Act. 3. 25, 26.</note>

Another concomitant of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, that will accompany you, is this, you will be a people wholly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and given up to the ſervice of God. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>I will be your God and you ſhall be my people,</hi> the covenant of grace is called an <hi>holy covenant, Luk.</hi> 1. 72. not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was made by a holy God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was made for the holy creature, it will make them holy that do enter into it, and therefore thoſe that are in Covenant

Another concomitant is this, that man that hath a ſhare in the bleſſings of the Covenant, he doth make conſcience to walk in the wayes of the Covenant; hee will not only cloſe with the promiſe of the Covenant, but alſo make conſcience of keeping the commands of the Covenant; for the covenant of grace does not onely beſtow bleſſings upon you, but require ſomething of you too, as in <hi>Eſai.</hi> 55. ſayes <note place="margin">Eſai. 55. 3.</note> God, <hi>Incline your ears and come unto me and hear, hearken, and your ſouls ſhall live: and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David: the covenant of grace is a <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>everlaſting covenant,</hi> but ſayes God, <hi>you ſhall come unto me</hi> firſt, and then <hi>I will make with you an everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> God will have you to obey him, if ever you think to have any ſhare in the covenant of grace; thoſe that, let God command what he will, will doe what

they pleaſe; this argues, that they doe not belong to the covenant of grace; but if the bleſſings of the covenant of grace are given by God to you, and the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of it found with you: and laſtly, the conditions of it found in you: which is faith, the only condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, <hi>beleeve and be ſaved;</hi> if God hath brought thee into a believing eſtate, that there is not one promiſe in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, but you do beartily aſſent unto, and cloſe with: if it be thus, then you may conclude, that you do belong to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; And thus I have done with theſe charactars by way of tryall.</p>

have read of ſome Authors that have more wondred, and ſtood amazed at this, then at any thing elſe in the World, that God that is the Soveraign Lord of all the workes of his hands, that he ſhould not rule us and command us by a Law, but deal with us by way of a Covenant, for God is not bound to give us a reward, though we ſhould ſerve him all the dayes of our lives; God might command us as we are his creatures to ſerve and obey him, to pray, read, hear, and walk holily and humbly before him, and when we have done all this, yet he might ſay to us, I will never give you heaven nor happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor any reward at all; he might have ſaid thus to us, but he hath conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended ſo far, as to make a bargain with us; that if we will beleeve in his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and live holily, and walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly before him, then <hi>he will be our God,</hi> and <hi>we ſhall be his people,</hi> he will write his Law in our hearts, and ſanctifie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our natures, and pardon and forgive all our ſins, and give us heaven and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nineſſe when we dye; Oh what an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite condeſcenſion is this in God, and what unſpeakable bounty and free grace; that when he might ſay to us, you are bound to ſerve me, and obey me, and to love and fear me, but I am not bound to make a Covenant with you, and promiſe

Another great happineſſe you doe enjoy under the Covenant of Grace, is this, the Lord will pardon all the great ſinnes you commit againſt him, and accept of all the weak duties and ſervices you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to him; though you commit great and mighty ſins, yet the Lord is gracious and mercifull, and will pardon them; the Covenant of Grace covers great ſins: as the ſea can cover a mountain as wel as a mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; ſo the Covenant of Grace can pardon mountainous ſins as well as ſmall ones. And again, the Covenant of Grace does ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of weak and imperfect duties, nay thoſe very duties which wicked men doe perform, though they be more for the matter of them then ours are, yet by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Covenant of Grace, the Lord does accept of ours, and will not accept of theirs, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. the place that I quoted before, <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an</hi>

Take this concluſion, that this grace of hope may as well be counterfeited as any other grace, there is a lively hope in a Beleever, and a dead hope in a wicked man, there is a faigned hope as well as a true hope, a counterfeit hope as well as a good hope, and therefore it is ſaid in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>The</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Take this concluſion, that thoſe men, that have leaſt grounds to build hopes of heaven upon, doe yet nouriſh moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hopes of heaven in their hearts; I ſhall give you two notable places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102944:93"/>
to prove this, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 16. it is <note place="margin">Prov. 14. 16.</note> ſaid there that <hi>a wiſe man feareth and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from evill,</hi> a wiſe man is jealous over his own heart, what followes? but ſayes he, <hi>A fool,</hi> that is, a wicked man, he <hi>rageth,</hi> and yet is <hi>confident,</hi> he runs on in wicked wayes and practiſes without any remorſe or ſorrow, and yet he is a confident man, that hee ſhall goe to heaven as well as the beſt; A wiſe man feareth and departeth from evill but a wicked man rageth, and yet is confident, thoſe that have leaſt cauſe to hope, doe yet harbour the greateſt hopes for heaven in their hearts.

                  <hi>of the wicked ſayes in his heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes,</hi> and yet the next words are, <hi>he flatters himſelf in his own eyes, though his iniquities are found worthy to be hated;</hi> wicked men are very apt to have good conceits of themſelves, and you ſhall finde it ordinarily, that a poor ſoul that walks conſcionably before God, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects no known duty, and mortifies every known luſt, and walkes humbly before God, this man is full of feares and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and doubts that all things are not well between God and his ſoul; and yet you ſhall finde another ungodly wretch that gives way to all manner of sin and uncleanneſſe, and fulfills the luſts of his fleſh and of his minde, and this man is very
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102944:93"/>
confident of his going to heaven, and that all is well with him when he is running headlong to hell. Here then you ſee the ſecond concluſion that thoſe men that have leaſt grounds to build hopes of heaven upon, doe yet nouriſh ſtrongeſt hopes for heaven in their hearts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another concluſion is this, that a man may live and dye with very ſtrong hopes that he ſhall goe to heaven, till he bee throwne downe into hell; hee may have no other thoughts but that hee ſhall goe to heaven till hee bee caſt head-long into hell. I ſhall give you ſome plain text to prove this, as <hi>Job</hi> 21. 23. <note place="margin">Job 21. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks there of a wicked man, ſayes he, <hi>one dies in his full ſtrength being wholly at eaſe and quiet;</hi> A learned Divine ſayes upon this place, that it is the note of a wicked man, when he lies upon his death bead, if you come to him and ask him if hee hath any hopes that he ſhall goe to heaven, hee will anſwer, that hee hath very ſtrong hopes of it; and if you ask him, whether my ſin troubles him, he will tell you no, bleſſed be God I have no ſin troubles me now, nor ever did all my life time; What, does nothing at all diſquiet you? No, I am wholly at eaſe and quiet; he hath no ſinne troubles him, nor no miſgiving thoughts, but that hee ſhall goe to heaven: But <hi>when a wicked man dies,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prov 11. 7.</note>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:102944:94"/>
                  <hi>then his expectation ſhall periſh,</hi> and not till then: Now Beloved me thinkes this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſhould a little ſtartle you, and make you look about you to take heed leſt you run hoodwinkt to hell, that you doe not live and dye in hopes of heaven, and never think otherwiſe till you drop down into hell.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

whereas indeed it is no ground at all to build hopes for heaven upon: for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are no ſuch words as theſe to be found in the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The place where theſe words are found, it is onely in the <hi>common Liturgie,</hi> which <hi>Liturgie</hi> is but an abſtract of the <hi>Popiſh Maſſe,</hi> for though all that is in the <hi>Popiſh Maſſe</hi> be not in the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> yet all that is in the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> is in the <hi>Popiſh Maſſe;</hi> it may be you will ſcarſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this, but it is very true, as you may ſee, if you look into the ſecond volume of the Book of Martyrs the 667. page, where there is a Letter inſerted of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, ſent to the Papiſts in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> who were riſen up in armes about the tranſlating of the Maſſe into <hi>Englſh,</hi> which they would by no meanes agree to, but roſe up to oppoſe it; King <hi>Edward</hi> to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie them, wrote to them on this manner, <hi>As for the Service-booke, the tranſlating of it may ſeem to you to be ſome new thing, but they are the very ſame words in Engliſh which were before in Latine, and if the Maſſe book which is in Latine be good, then it is as good now, though it be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into Engliſh.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Another Scripture-prop which wicked men build their hopes for heaven upon, but is indeed no prop, is this, that <hi>the righteous man ſinneth ſeven times a day;</hi> this is one of the greateſt props a wicked man hath, ſayes he, what doe you tell me of my ſins, the beſt men have their failings, the righteous ſin ſeven times a day, and why may not I goe to heaven as well as they? wicked men make this a great prop to their hopes, when indeed there is no place of Scripture like this in the whole Bible; that which comes neareſt to it, is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 16. <hi>A juſt man falleth ſeven times and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102944:112"/>
ſin in the text, nor no mention of a day; but only thus, <hi>a juſt man falleth ſeven times, and riſeth again:</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives this ſenſe of the word; a godly man falleth <hi>ſeven times,</hi> that is often times, expounding this place with that in <hi>Job</hi> 5. 19. <hi>The Lord</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe it were ſo, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous did ſin ſeven times a day, yet the text ſayes in the next words, <hi>that as often as he falleth he riſeth again;</hi> now it may be, many of you that make this a prop for your hopes of heaven, doe fall into ſin day after day, and never riſe out of them again by repentance: you leave out theſe words, <hi>and riſeth again,</hi> for many of you live your whole lives long in an evill courſe, you wallow and lye down in ſin, and therefore this can be no prop for your hopes.</p>

3. Another ſentence which they make a Scripture prop, but is not, is this, that <hi>Chriſt died for all</hi> and for every man in the world; This comes within the <hi>Arminian</hi> bounds, but this opinion is taken up by others too as well as them, that hold <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Redemption;</hi> but becauſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready preached two or three Sermons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, I ſhall therefore onely now ſpeak ſo much as is needfull, to ſhew you the rottenneſſe and inſufficiency of this prop; 1. Suppoſe Chriſt did dye for all, yet thoſe men that are of this opinion, that Chriſt did dye for all, they doe not hold that all men are ſaved by Chriſt, but ſome men may fall off from Chriſt; and be damned, notwithſtanding Chriſt dyed for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Take this by way of anſwer, that it is not likely that they ſhould have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by Chriſts bloud, that have no benefit by this death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To you that make this a plea for your hopes of heaven; obſerve this, that where there are theſe generall expreſſions, they are very ill underſtood: if you ſay they ſpeak of univerſal &amp; generall redemption, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. <hi>Becauſe we thus judge,</hi>

If you have an intereſt in Chriſt, you have all the promiſes as it were bound up in a bundle, which you may have recourſe to, and make uſe of when you will.</p>

You muſt know that it is one thing to die ſtupidly, and another thing to die hopefully and peaceably: indeed, the worſt men in the world, may die ſtupidly, their conſciences may not doe its office when they die: they may have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences feared as it were with a hot iron, and think they are going to heaven, and never think otherwiſe till they drop down into hell; but now the godly, they die full of peace and comfort, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 37. <hi>Mark the upright man, and behold the</hi>

You that make this a prop for your hope, becauſe you have ſeen wicked men die peaceably like Lambs; let me tell you thus much, that it is the greateſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, for a wicked man to die peaceably, and quietly, in deluſions, and conceits of going to heaven; when they are tumbling down headlong to hell: it were better for him, that God did let the flaſhings of hell fire to flie in his face: it were better for him that his conſcience
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102944:117"/>
did tell him his danger, and his doom, then thus to die in a ſtupid manner. In <hi>Job</hi> 21. 23. it is ſaid, that <hi>a wicked man dies in his full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet:</hi> no ſin troubles him, nor no danger makes him afraid: ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 4, 5. <hi>they have no bands in their death, but their ſtrength is firm; they are not in trouble, as other men, neither are they plagued as other men;</hi> they have no trouble in their life time, and no bands in their death: now this is rather to be looked upon as a judgement upon them, and not as a mercy.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. If this peace and quietneſſe in a wicked mans conſcience, did ariſe from any grounded aſſurance, or hope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, then it might be lookt upon as a bleſſing; but when it doth ariſe meerly from the deluſions of his own heart, then it is nothing but as it were a golden dore to let him into hell: it ſhall be with him as in <hi>Eſai.</hi> 29. 8. <hi>An hungry man dreameth, and behold, he eateth: but he awaketh, and his ſoul is empty:</hi> ſo a wicked man dreams he is going to heaven, when he is falling down into hell.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. There may be great hopes of heaven expreſt in a dying mans words, when there is not ſo much peace and quietneſſe in his heart, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>In the midſt of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the heart is ſorrowfull.</hi> In the midſt of a wicked mans boaſting, there is a fear of hel.</p>

5. Though you have ſeen ſome men that have dyed with ſtupidity of heart, depart quietly; yet there are other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, whoſe conſciences are awakened, that die full of horror, and terror, and amazement. When their conſciences tell them, they have dyed ſwearers, or lyers, or drunkards, or adulterers, &amp;c. they are filled with horror, and terror of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that though he thought all his life time he ſhould goe to heaven, yet he now fears he is going down into hell.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with the third Queſtion, in ſhewing you the reaſons why, (ſeeing the Scripture ſaies that a wicked man hath no hope) that of all the men in the world, wicked men do nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh greateſt hopes for heaven in their hearts; there are only two queries more to handle, and then come to the fifth branch of mans miſery.</p>

Another thing that makes men live as if there were no God in the World, is the queſtioning of the authority of the Scriptures. I have read of one (a great ſcholar in this kingdome) that the means whereby he came to be an atheiſt was this, he firſt began to queſtion, whether the Bible were the Word of God or no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not know whether <hi>Moſes</hi> that penned the beginning of it were a man of God or no; then he queſtioned how <hi>Moſes</hi> could write of thoſe things that were done before he was born, and then whether the Papiſts might not alter it in the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it; and many others queſtions till by degrees he came to be a very atheiſt, and to queſtion whether there were a God or no: and ſo there are ſome errours now in print, that tend very much to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm; there are ſome that doe affirme,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102944:129"/>
that that Booke or volume of Bookes called the Bible is not the Word of God, and ſuch an opinion as this does very much worke upon mens hearts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, that there is no God, as in i <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>There ſhall</hi>

               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 1. That man is an Atheiſt that does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge and favour himſelf in the practiſe of ſecret ſins; he that does continually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and favour himſelf in the practiſe of ſecret ſins, that man lives as if there were no God in the world: Reverend Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> gives us this badge of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, that that very ſinne which he will not dare to commit in the preſence of a child, yet that ſin will he venture upon when no eye ſees him; thou that canſt venture upon a ſin, in hope of ſecrefie, thinking to hide it from the All-ſeeing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102944:131"/>
Eye of God, thou art a very Atheiſt, thou that dareſt do that in the ſight of God, that thou art afraid to doe in the preſence of a man; this proceeds meerly from a root of Atheiſme that is in the heart, as in <hi>Job</hi> 22. 12, 13, 14. when a <note place="margin">Iob 22. 12, 13, 14.</note> wicked man hath done wickedly, he is ready to ſay. <hi>How doth God know? can he judge through the thick clouds? thick clouds are a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him, that he ſeeth not;</hi> theſe are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of an Atheiſticall heart. An A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt if he can but keep himſelf from the cenſure and reproach of men, he is well enough, if men cannot ſay black to his eye, or there goes a drunkard, a ſwearer, an adulterer, or the like, he is never troubled for his ſins. Oh therefore thou that wouldſt be accounted chaſt, where thou dwelleſt, and yet keepeſt thy <hi>Dalilah</hi> in thy lap: and oh thou debaucht liver, that canſt quietly and ſecurely walk on in wayes of ſin, ſo that thou canſt but keep them from the eyes of men; know thus much, that this proceeds from thy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall heart. When the hope of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie imboldens any man to the practiſe of any ſin, that man is a very Atheiſt: you that can fear the eye of a mortall man, and yet not be afraid of the All-ſeeing Eye of an immortall God, you that were never troubled for your ſinnes, when no body knew them but your ſelves; but now this
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102944:132"/>
is that which troubles you, that your ſins are known to others, if it be thus with thee, thou art a practicall Atheiſt: thoſe that are troubled, not becauſe God ſees their ſins, but becauſe man ſees them, they are very Atheiſts, as in <hi>Job</hi> 24. 13. 15. 17. theſe are they, <hi>that abhorre the light, that</hi>

Such men as indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the practiſe of ſecret ſins, are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall Atheiſts. A godly man will fear to commit a ſecret ſin, as well as a known groſſe and open ſinne; as <hi>Joſeph, How</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 2. Another diſcovery is this, that man 
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102944:132"/>
is a practicall Atheiſt, that does not make conſcience of the performance of ſecret duties: he that never prayes in ſecret, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours this Atheiſticall thought in him, that God doth not hear him; it is very obſervable of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> in Scripture, you ſhall never read of a ſecret faſt they kept, nor of a private prayer they made, but they had publique faſts a great many, they did <hi>faſt twice a week,</hi> and <hi>pray in the corners of the ſtreets,</hi> and <hi>give Almes,</hi> &amp;c. but you never read of any <hi>private</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> duties they did perform; which did proceed meerly from roots of Atheiſme in their hearts: and ſo this is an evidence of the Atheiſticall heart, if thou doſt never make conſcience of going to God in ſecret, and beg for grace and mercy from him; he is a very Atheiſt that lives in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of ſecret duties; for thoſe men that retain in their hearts, an apprehenſion of a Deity, they know that there is no time ſo well ſpent, as that which is imployed in ſecret prayer to God. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Oh my</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 14</note> 
                  <hi>dove</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>that art in the clifts of the rocks, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs: let mee ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voyce, for ſweet is they voice, and thy countenance is comely;</hi> Oh thou poor ſoul (ſaies Chriſt) that doſt pray in ſecret, and weep in ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, let me ſee thy face, and hear thy voice. A man that hath the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102944:133"/>
of a God before him, he knowes, that the Lord ſees and takes notice of the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of his heart before him in ſecret: and therefore they are as much in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet to pray in ſecret, and to powre out their ſouls before God in private, as they are in publique. It is very obſervable that there were very few actions of Chriſt that were recorded by all the four Evangeliſts, and yet this of Chriſts <hi>praying alone,</hi> when no body was with him, is recorded by them all: <note place="margin">Mat 26. 39. Luk. 22. 41. Mar. 14. 35. Ioh. 17.</note> whereas other things, if they be recorded by one, they are left out by another; but this is ſpoken of by all of them. Now the reaſon of it is this, becauſe Chriſt would be an example to us, to teach us to be frequent in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this duty: and therefore it is a ſign of an Atheiſticall heart in any one that does not make conſcience of powring out his heart in ſecret prayer to God.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 3. Another Character is this, that man that doth make impunity to be a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to impiety; my meaning is this, he that makes the patience and for bearance and long-ſuffering of God towards him, to be a provocation to ſinne; that becauſe God doth not preſently puniſh him for his ſin, therefore he will go on in ſin ſtill, ſuch a man is a very Atheiſt: as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done</hi> (ſaies God)

                  <hi>and I held my tongue, therefore thou thoughtſt that I was ſuch a one as thy ſelf.</hi> (Beloved) if any of you harbour ſuch thoughts as thoſe in your hearts, that becauſe God doth not preſently puniſh you for your ſins, therefore you will go on ſtill in ſin: let me tell you, that this is the practiſe of a very Atheiſt. Becauſe the drunkard is not taken away by God, while the wine is in his head; and becauſe the ſwearer is not deſtroyed by God, while the oath is in his mouth; and becauſe the lyer is not cut off by God, while the lie is upon his tongue, therefore they will run on with greedineſſe, and willingneſſe in the ſame ſins, all this flowes from the very root of Atheiſme, that is in thy heart.</p>

the point. I ſhall onely premiſe three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions by way of explanation, to delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidate the point, and ſhew you what I mean by this Doctrine: as</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Take this concluſion, that in ſome ſenſe there is no creature in the world that is without God, though in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards men may be truly ſaid to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God; in ſome ſenſe there are none without God, that is by way of <hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>preſervation,</hi> ſo the worſt Devill in hell may ſay that God is his God: and</p>

A wicked man may have God to be his God by way of <hi>profeſſion,</hi> he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to know God, and profeſſe that God is his God; but now in another ſenſe a wicked man cannot be ſaid to have God for his God, (that is) in a way of <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>reconciliation</hi> for God to be a God in Covenant with him through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Take this concluſion, that though multitudes of people may lay claim to God as their God, yet there are but a few men in the world, that have God to be their God in a Covenant way; as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 8 9. the Lord there lookes upon the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church under a threefold conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe that in all the land (ſaith the Lord) two parts therein ſhall be</hi>

                  <hi>and will refine them as ſilver is refined, and will try them as Gold is tryed; they ſhall call on my name, and I will hear them; I will ſay, it is my people, and they ſhall ſay, the Lord is my God:</hi> though you all lay claime to God, yet there may be but one part in three, that can truly ſay that God is their God in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Take this concluſion, that ſuch is the deceitfulneſſe and deluſion of mens hearts naturally, that the worſt of men are ready to beleive and think that God is their God, when hee is not: as you may read in <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 4, 5. ſayes God there, <hi>they ſhall cry unto me, My Father, thou act the guide of my</hi>

Wicked men cannot lay claim to God as theirs; and therefore when they ſpeak of God, they ſpeak of him as a God to others, and not to them, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 29. when <hi>Laban</hi> ſpake to <hi>Jacob,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>The God of your Fathers:</hi> and ſo <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 25. 28.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſts victory</hi> over <hi>Sin, Death,</hi> and <hi>the Law,</hi> for it muſt be extended to all the things mentioned in the context, they are enemies <hi>by combination,</hi> and knit together in a faſt league; the <hi>Law</hi> giveth <hi>ſtrength</hi> to <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> giveth a <hi>ſting</hi> to <hi>Death;</hi> as long as the <hi>Law</hi> hath power, <hi>ſin</hi> will be <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and as long as <hi>ſin</hi> hath <hi>ſtrength, Death</hi> will bee <hi>terrible:</hi> But <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath overcome <hi>Death,</hi> he foyled it in his own perſon, as I ſhall ſhew you anon fully; and for <hi>Sin,</hi> he hath taken away the <hi>guilt</hi> of it by his <hi>own merit,</hi> and will <hi>deſtroy</hi> it more and more by the <hi>power</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt; when he ſtood before the tribunall of God he ſtood there, as a <hi>ſurety</hi> and undertaker, Heb. 7. 22. <hi>A ſurety of a better reſtament,</hi> now he was a <hi>ſurety</hi> mutually Gods and ours, to work Gods work <hi>in us,</hi> and our work <hi>for us;</hi> among other things which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took there, he undertook the abolition of ſin on <hi>Gods part,</hi> he obliged himſelf that it ſhould be performed by <hi>his Spirit;</hi> on <hi>our part</hi> he obliged us to <hi>endeavours of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> now becauſe Chriſt is an able ſurety, the work is as good as done already,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102944:152"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin;</hi> mark, 'tis <hi>crucified with him,</hi> as implying his undertaking upon the croſſe, <hi>that the body of Death might be deſtroyed:</hi> as noting the Work of Gods Spirit, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged and made ſure by Chriſts death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe, <hi>that we ſhould not ſerve ſin,</hi> as noting the concurrence of our endevours, to which wee are obliged by the ſame ſponſory Act of Chriſt: thus much Chriſt hath done for the abolition of <hi>ſin:</hi> now for <hi>the Law,</hi> that was an enemy that could not be <hi>overcome</hi> but muſt be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> and ſo it was by Chriſt who both <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the duty,</hi> and <hi>ſuſtained the penalty</hi> of it, chiefly the latter, and therefore tis ſaid, <hi>he was made a curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>The ſting</hi> is loſt in Chriſt, and the <hi>honey</hi> left for us. But this is matter of another reſpect and cogniſance.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The next reaſon of the Apoſtles thankſgiving is the <hi>application, he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us victory,</hi> for underſtanding of which you muſt note that 1 <hi>Chriſts victory is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us as if it were done in our own perſons;</hi> when we are actually united to him, wee are poſſeſſed of all his merit, Chriſt fought our war, and joined battell in our ſtead; we have a <hi>myſticall victory</hi> in Chriſt, and are ſaid to overcome, when Chriſt overcame;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102944:153"/>
this is the reaſon why the acts of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are complicated and folded up with Chriſts acts in the expreſſions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Crucified with him, quickened with him,</hi> and <hi>raiſed with him,</hi> and <hi>ſet down with him in, heavenly places,</hi> Epheſ. 2. &amp;c. All which are terms proper to the <hi>Judiciall Vnion</hi> which is different both from the <hi>Morall</hi> and <hi>Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> as I could eaſily ſhew you, were it not a matter of another nature: now this <hi>myſticall victory</hi> is of great uſe to a beleever in time of diſcouragements; if the <hi>Law</hi> challenge, <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſay <hi>thou art a ſinner under a curſe,</hi> thou maiſt anſwer, <hi>I am a ſinner, but I am crucified in Chriſt, in my ſurety, his payment and ſuffering is mine:</hi> if <hi>Death</hi> or the world diſcourage; you may ſay, <hi>This is a beaten ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I foyled it in Chriſt, I aſcended in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The benefit of this victory is imparted and applyed to us,</hi> by which he maketh us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours over ſin and death; all Chriſts worke was not done upon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> there is much to be accompliſhed in our hearts, Rom. 16. 20. <hi>The God of peace ſhall tread Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan under your feet,</hi> &amp;c. not onely under Chriſts feet, but ours: as <hi>Joſhua</hi> called his fellowes to come and tread upon the necks of the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Kings, <note n="*" place="margin">Ioſh. 10. 24.</note>

               <p>One thing I had almoſt forgotten, to preſſe you to thankfulneſſe to Chriſt: Oh bleſſe your Redeemer, that hath delivered you from the fear of death, admire his love and condeſcenſion, that he ſhould come down from heaven and ſubſtitute himſelf into our room and place, and take the horrours of death into his own ſoul; 'tis ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20: 28. <hi>The Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter and to give his life a ranſome for many;</hi> Chriſt was a Prince by birth, <hi>heir of all things,</hi> yet he came not in the pomp and equipage of a Prince, if he had come in ſtate to viſit us, and to deliver comfort to us by <hi>word of mouth,</hi> it had been much; but Chriſt came not in this way, not in the <hi>pomp of a Prince,</hi> but the <hi>form of a ſervant</hi> to miniſter to our neceſſities, and that in the higheſt way of ſelf-deniall, <hi>he gave his life as a ranſome for many;</hi> other Princes are laviſh of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects bloud, and care not how many lay down their lives for them, many give
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102944:165"/>
their lives as a ranſome for the Prince, but here 'tis quite otherwiſe, this Prince lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down his life to redeem the ſubjects, and he ſuffered death that it might not bee terrible and deſtructive to us, Oh bleſſed be the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for this love for evermore.</p>
               <p>Some may expect, that I ſhould ſpeak ſomething concerning the ſervant of God, our dear brother now departed, but I need not ſay any more, then what I have ſpoken already; all along the diſcourſe, I have indeed ſpoken of him, and that in the judgement of your conſciences, the <hi>duties</hi> which I preſſed upon you, he <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> the <hi>comforts</hi> which I have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to you, he <hi>enjoyed.</hi> I ſhall not make any particular rehearſall of the paſſages of his <hi>exemplary life,</hi> I judge it not convenient; only to you of this place I may take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to commend his doctrine, and intreat you to be carefull of thoſe precious truths which he ſowed among you, whileſt the Lord uſed him here as a <hi>skilfull ſeeds man:</hi> God looketh for ſome increaſe, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſpeciall notice of the time, that you have enjoyed his labours, there is an exact account kept in heaven, in that parable, <hi>Theſe three years came I ſeeking fruit,</hi> Luk. 13. 7. probably the <hi>three years</hi> of Chriſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery are intended, for then he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon his laſt half year, God recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
