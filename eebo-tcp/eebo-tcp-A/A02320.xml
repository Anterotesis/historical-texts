            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Here preſent you Mounſieur <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zac's</hi> Letters, which may well bee tearmed new ones, euen after the eighth Edition; for though they haue long ſince beene in poſſeſsion of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fauour, yet may I iuſtly ſay, this is the firſt time their Authour hath auouched them. The aduantagious iudgement you haue deliuered of him, and the ardor wherewith all <hi>France</hi> hath followed your approbation, well deſerueth his beſt endeauours toward the perfectionating ſo excellent things: I haue beene ſolicitous to draw him to this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to the end the world might know, that if I bee not worthy the ſhare I haue in his reſpects, yet that I haue at leaſt beene wiſe enough to make right vſe of my good fortune, and to cauſe it to become ſeruiceable to the glory of my Countrey. But truely, were hee maſter of his body, or did his maladies afford him liberty of ſpirit, hee would not ſuffer any but himſelfe to ſpeake in this cauſe; and
<pb facs="tcp:3669:4"/>
his Pen performing no ſlight acts, would haue conſecrated his owne labours, and the wonders they haue produced. But ſince euills haue no prefixed time of durance, and in that all the good interims which hereafter may befall him, are wholly to be imployed in his Booke, <hi>The Prince;</hi> I eſteemed it to ſmall purpoſe to attend his health in this buſineſſe, and that it was now no longer any time to deferre the purging of theſe curious Letters, from ſuch blemiſhes as ill impreſsions had left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vpon them. They ſhall therefore now appeare in the parity wherein they were conceiued, and with all their naturall ornaments: Beſides, I haue added diuers letters of his, not as yet come to light, which may ſerue as a ſubiect of greater ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to all men, and bee as a recompenſe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour wherewith he hath collected the former. And truly (my Lord) had it beene poſsible to place in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece of this Booke, a more illuſtrious name then yours, or ſhould Mounſieur de <hi>Balzac's</hi> incſination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and mine haue beene farre from any ſuch intention, yet would not the order of things, or the law of decency haue permitted any other reflection, then what I now make: I ſpeake not at this preſent, of that dazeling greatneſſe whereunto you are eleuated, nor of that ſo rare and neceſſary vertue, which rightly to recognize, the greateſt King on earth hath eſteemed himſelfe not to bee ouer able. I will onely ſay, I had reaſon to ſubmit an eloquence produced in the ſhade, and formed in ſolitarineſſe, to this other eloquence quickned both with voyce and action, cauſing you to reigne in ſoueraignety at all aſſemblies. Certainely (my Lord) you are more powerfull by this incomparable quality, then by the authority wherein the King hath
<pb facs="tcp:3669:4"/>
placed you: The onely accent of your voyce hath a hidden property, to charme all ſuch as hearken vnto you; none can bee poſſeſſed with any ſo willfull paſsions, who will not be appeaſed by the reaſons you propound; and after you haue ſpoken, you will at all times remaine maſter of that part of man, no way ſubiect to the worlds order, and which hath not any dependency vpon lawfull power, or tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vſurpation. This is a trueth (my Lord) as well knowne as your name, and which you ſo ſolidly confirmed at the laſt aſſembly of the Notables; as that in the great diuerſity of humours and iudgements, whereof it was compoſed, there was peraduenture this onely point well reſolued on, <hi>That you are the moſt eloquent man liuing.</hi> This being true, I can no way doubt, but the peruſall of this Booke I offer vnto you, will extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily content you, and that you will bee well pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire thither, ſometimes to recreate your ſpirits after agitation, and to ſuſpend thoſe great thoughts, who haue for their obiect the good of all <hi>Europe.</hi> It is a Booke (my Lord) wherein you ſhall find no common thing but the Title; (where entertaining ſome particular perſon) Mounſieur de <hi>Balzac</hi> reades Leſſons to all men; and where amidſt the beauty of Complements and dexterity of Ieaſting, he often teacheth of the moſt ſublime points of Philoſophy: I meane not that wrangling part thereof which reiecteth neceſſary verities, to ſeeke after vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ones, which cannot exerciſe the vnder ſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prouoking paſsions, nor ſpeake of moderation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtemper, and putting the ſoule into diſorder: But of that, whereby <hi>Pericles</hi> heretofore made himſelfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Athens,</hi> and wherewith <hi>Epaminondas</hi> raiſed
<pb facs="tcp:3669:5"/>
himſelfe to the prime place of <hi>Greece:</hi> which tempereth the manners of particulars, regulateth the obligation of Princes, and neceſſarily bringeth with it the felicity of all States where they command. This booke will make it apparent euen to your enemies, that your life hath beene at all times equally admirable, though not alwayes alike glorious: How you haue conſerued the opinion of your vertue, euen in the time of your hardeſt fortunes, and how in the greateſt fury of the tempeſt, and in the moſt extreame violence of your affaires, the integrity of your actions hath neuer beene reduced to the onely teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your conſcience. To conclude, It is in this Booke (my Lord) where I ſuppoſe you will bee well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reade the preſages of your preſent greatneſſe, and what hath beene foretold; not by Aſtrologicall rules, or the aſpect of ſome Conſtellation, but by a true diſcourſe founded vpon the maximes of reaſon, and experience of things paſt; cauſing him to preſume, that God hath not conferred ſuch extraordinary endowments vpon you, to be for euer encloiſtered within your ſelfe: And that he hath loued <hi>France</hi> better, then to depriue her of the good you ought to procure her. But all theſe verities ſhall one day be compriſed in that worke the King, by your mouth, (my Lord) hath commanded Mounſieur de <hi>Balzac</hi> to vndertake, and which one yeere of leiſure will effect. There ſhall it be, where he will cauſe all men to confeſſe, that to haue the pourtraict of a perfect Prince, the reigne of ſo great a Monarch as ours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to bee attended; that the Diuine Prouidence neuer ſhewed it ſelfe more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly, then in the conduct of his deſignes, and in the euent of his enterpriſes; and how Heauen hath ſo farre
<pb facs="tcp:3669:5"/>
declared it ſelfe in his fauour, that were his ſtate aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on all ſides, and all ordinary meanes of defence ſhould faile him; he hath vertue ſufficient to ſaue himſelfe, and performe miracles. Now as you are the prime intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Councill, and your cogitations the firſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the good reſolutions therein taken, you are not to doubt (my Lord) but you likewiſe poſſeſſe the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall place therein, after His Maieſtie; and that you participate more then any other of His triumphs. There ſhall you be reuenged of all thoſe wretched writings you haue formerly ſlighted: There the ſpirits of all men ſhall bee ſatisfied in the iuſtice of your deportments, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny it ſelfe will there bee ſo powerfully conuinced, that to cry downe ſo legall a gouernement as yours, ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected French-men, and thoſe ſtrangers enemies to this Crowne, will finde no further pretext in affaires, nor credulity among men. And truely, when I (on the one ſide) conſider how fat all it is to thoſe who gouerne, to be expoſed to the enuy of great ones, and complaints of meaner perſons, and how Publike affaires haue this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, as how pure ſoeuer the adminiſtration thereof be, they ſtill afford ſufficient colour to calumny, to diſguiſe them and cauſe them to appeare iniuſt. And on the other ſide, when I conſider that to guide this State is no leſſe then to manage a body hauing no one ſound part; and how there is no ſicke perſon who doeth not ſometimes murmure againſt his Phiſitian; I dare bee confident (my Lord) that ſuch a man as Mounſieur de <hi>Balzac</hi> will not prooue vnuſefull vnto you, and that the luſtre of your actions, and glory of your life ſhall receiue no diminution in his hands. I would ſay more, did I not
<pb facs="tcp:3669:6"/>
feare to diſoblige him in commending him, or if I belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to be ſo great a ſelfe admirer as his enemies figure him vnto vs. But I who haue ſufficiently ſtudied him to know him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who am acquainted with his most ſecret Inclinations, and the moſt particular conception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s he hath in his ſoule, and of a farre different opinion to theirs. I will therefore reſt there (my Lord) and not to cauſe you to looſe more time, and to the end you may the ſooner inioy the entertainement, this excellent Booke prepareth for you: I will ſatisfie my ſelfe in letting you know, that I eſteeme not my ſelfe ſo vnfortunate as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I did, ſince I haue happened vpon ſo faire an occaſion, to let you know that I am,</p>

without them: And that it is only allowed to the <hi>Germans</hi> to giue account to the age they liue in, and to poſteritie forſooth, concerning the affaires and fortunes of their particular families, and of the ſilly acts of their Colleagues. Truely it is an errour to beleeue, that graue and ſolemne ſubiects are to bee baniſhed out of all Letters, or that euen eloquence ought but ſlackly therein to appeare; and that the Maieſtie of both theſe is only reſerued for Pulpits and Panegyrick Orations; as though valour neuer appeared ſaue onely in pitcht Battells; and that in ſingle Combats it were lawfull to run away, or that vertue therein were vtterly vnuſefull, becauſe it hath fewer witneſſes, neither is ſo fully regarded: But beſides that, wee are no longer in thoſe times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the State gouernment was publiquely queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where the Oratours forced the Lieutenants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of armies to render accompt of their ſeuerall charges, and that conſequently, there is no more any meanes remaining to become eloquent in that kind: Yet are there reaſons, whereby w<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the merit of Letters to bee of no leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard then that of Orations. Howbeit, if there bee any neceſſitie to find ſome difference betweene theſe; this at leaſt can neither be in regard of the dignitie of the Subiects, the force of Reaſons, the gracefullneſſe of Diſcourſes, nor in the ſublimitie of Conceits.

Thoſe ſmooth Exordiums whereby they prepare, and put themſelues by eaſie acceſſes, as it were into poſſeſſion of the Readers, thoſe ſtraites and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages whereby they conduct the ſpirits of men from pleaſant to painefull, and from grieuous, to graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obiects, to the end, that hauing in a maner ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and caſt them out of their former ſtations, they may afterwards force them to fall on what ſide they pleaſe. Surely all theſe aduantages are ſo peculiar to Orations, as I ingeniouſly confeſſe, Letters doe not ſo much as know what they meane. In theſe, we enter at the firſt daſh vpon the matter, nor doe wee ſcarſe at any time, quit the ſame; the reaſons goe altogether alone without aſſiſtance, and all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament allowed them, is onely freedome of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the fecunditie of language, and that they paſſe not promiſcuouſly. But as concerning the Subiects, they are common to both kinds of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and it is an errour to imagine, there are ſome ſo particular to the one, that the other cannot touch vpon the ſame withont iniurie thereunto.

The latter are no leſſe deepe then the other, they are capable of the like ſhipping; their ebbes, and floods are neither more iuſt, nor leſſe vncertaine; and all the difference diſcouered betweene them is onely this, that the windes toſſe not thoſe in like fort as it doth ours, and in that they are ſeldome or neuer ſubiect either to ſtormes, or tempeſts. In like manner it being within the power and capacitie of Letters to treate of the ſame things, how much more emenent and excellent ſoeuer one may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them to be then any other kind of writings, yet doe they not indeede receiue thoſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

And ſurely, if the ſubiect wee make vſe of be as illuſtrious as the perſon before whom wee are to handle it, were it not as much as to abuſe both the one and the other, to come ſhort in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions: Since the action ought neither to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, nor generall, if you intend to performe it negligently, and not to allow it all the ornaments whereof it is capable. And who can doubt that <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> being to make an Oration before <hi>Caeſar,</hi> after the change of the Common-wealth, had not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter apprehenſion, and prepared not himſelfe with more ſtudious care, then if he had onely ſpoken to that beaſt with an hundred heads, hee had ſo often led after his owne Phantaſie, and whereof hee was in ſo full poſſeſſion ſo long before, as to cauſe them to take the part beſt pleaſing vnto him. In theſe laſt occaſions, and in the preſence of this man alone, he know with whom he had to doe: Now had he beene timerous, or fearefull to faile before his Maſter, yet impute not this apprehenſion of his to proceede ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of conſideration hee had of his greatneſſe, nor from the reflection vpon thoſe things hee came to accompliſh: But it was in that he conſidered him as a man no leſſe verſed in the art of well-ſpeaking then himſelfe, and who had heretofore contributed to the ſtudy of this ſcience, ſo many rare gifts of ſpirit, and ſo many faire indowments of nature,
<pb facs="tcp:3669:9"/>
that had he not afterward eſteemed it more noble to conquer men by armes, then to conuince them by arguments, and if of the two moſt excellent exerciſes of this life, his fortune and the famouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his courage, had not cauſed him to make choyce of the former, hee might eaſily haue diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the glory of the latter with him. Or were it ſo that this excellent Oratour might at this day returne into the world, and were perſonally, or by his Penne to diſcourſe with thoſe two great Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls to whom the moſt part of theſe Letters are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is it not probable, comming to know them as wee doe, that he would imploy, and contribute a a more exact ſtudy and ſolicitude, then when hee was onely to pleaſe a multitude of ignorant <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and to ſpeake to all that rable of ancient <hi>Rome.</hi> Wee ſhall yet againe bee amazed at the perfection of theſe Letters, ſome whereof are written to the King, and appointed to bee read (as in trueth they were) with admiration in full counſell, and a great part of the reſt addreſſed to the moſt eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our age. To ſpeake trueth wee may iuſtly ſay, this is the firſt time any thing of perfection hath appeared in our language; ſo that if of all our ancient eloquence there bee ought worthy of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme in any equalitie with this, it may bee that with much labour you ſhall produce ſome one Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: For of all ſuch who haue hitherto written wee may affirme, that the moſt fortunate among them, when they made choyce of ſubiects able to ſubſiſt of themſelues, haue not beene abſolutely condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb facs="tcp:3669:9"/>
and that amidſt their writings, the ſoliditie of learning, and the ſauageneſſe of language <hi>(to wit)</hi> the good and euill did equally appeare. But when at any time they fell vpon ſubiects where elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence onely ſwayed the Scepter, there truly it was where fortune forſooke them, and where the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their proper forces was manifeſtly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if they were not ſome way aſſiſted by ſtrange tongues. Some of them (to ſay the trueth) haue doubted what way they were to take, and haue ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſhew it to others, though themſelues were not in it. In a word, the greateſt glory thoſe gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned who haue written with moſt perfection and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, is only that which nature hath reſerued for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to which ſex eminent actions being denied, it ſeemeth they performe ſufficient if they abſtaine from euill doing. But to ſay that any hath ioyned Art to aboundance, and mingled mildneſſe with Maieſtie, or hath raiſed his ſtile without either loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe, or ſtraying from his ſubiect, that is it which in trueth we could not ſee till this preſent. And queſtionleſſe theſe braue and generous formes of diſcourſe, and thoſe great and ſtrange concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherewith theſe Letters are ſo curiouſly limed, and ſo plentifully grac'd, haue beene very ſlenderlie known in proceeding ages: This very order, and this number, whereof euery tongue is not capable, and wherein ours owes nothing to the Latine, and which appeares in all his words, though diuerſely, and as their gender requires, do right haply appeare in this place, though the moſt part of writers before him
<pb facs="tcp:3669:10"/>
haue eſteemed theſe perfections of ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet notwithſtanding, without the helpe of theſe two great ſecrets, neither ornaments of Art, nor graces of Nature, can bee but in part pleaſing; nor can all the reaſons the World can alledge per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade a Very woman reſoluing to reſiſt: And to ſpeake ſeriouſly, they are no leſſe neceſſary among excellent diſcourſes, and conceits, then diſcipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Souldiers, without which, courage is of no effect, and valour moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly proueth vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. As for me who haue knowne the Author from both our infancies, and who better then all others, can depoſe in what faſhion he effecteth his labours; beſides, knowing the great aduantage hee hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all thoſe who write at this day: I haue euer thought, that if any were able to raiſe our Language to the merit and reputation of ſuch Eloquence, wherewith the Ancients were adorned, it ſhould bee to him alone to whom our age oweth this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Nor doe I doubt, but the compariſon comming in queſtion at this preſent, betweene theſe his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and thoſe of others; the difference will bee eaſily diſcouered, aſſuring my ſelfe, that all ſpirits will diſpoſe themſelues to be ranged herein to mine opinion, and voluntarily to giue way thereunto. As for my ſelfe, who read the Ancients with all reſpect due vnto them, and the Moderns without any preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate opinion, doe notwithſtanding confeſſe, that all I can conceiue in others is ſo farre ſhort of the merit of theſe Letters, that abſtracting from the paſſion I am poſſeſſed with, both for them, and their
<pb facs="tcp:3669:10"/>
Authour, hardly could I diſpoſe my ſelfe to frame this Preface for them. And who is there will make any difficultie to giue them their due? Since hee whoſe very faults haue beene eſteemed ſo faire, that they cauſed a Sect during his life, which yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues after his death; hauing (at Meats) ſeene certaine diſcourſes this Author compoſed in thoſe miſerable times, and which ſtood in need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther age to be gratefully regarded, was aſtoniſhed at his beginnings, confeſſing it was with vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the onely thing hee ſuppoſed to poſſeſſe by the generall conſent of all, was rauiſhed from him by one who as yet had liued but twenty yeeres. But ſurely, it was in this ſtraine of writing which in that it is not reſtrayned within ſo ſtrict limits as that of Letters, is capable of all the motions, and ornaments of Art; and of the ſame ſort as was the other diſcourſe he addreſſeth to the Pope who now is, vpon the like ſubiect, as that of Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> to <hi>Eugenius:</hi> And as God neuer choſe among men any ſo accompliſhed with all perfections, as this perſon to command all others, ſo can I not conceiue any thing either more great, or extraordinary, then what appeareth in this worke, nor more ſutable to the excellencie of the ſubiect, and to the Maieſtie of him to whom he dedicated his diſcourſe: But if (to returne to the particulars of theſe Letters) it were neceſſary for the deliuering an vnpartiall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to conſider thoſe of the Ancients, I ſhould ſeeme more reſpectfull then were requiſite, if (put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them all together) I ſhould vndertake to make
<pb facs="tcp:3669:11"/>
them ſo much as enter into compariſon with theſe; excepting onely thoſe of <hi>Seneca,</hi> yea euen in thoſe (which in trueth come not nere theſe) there is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite abundance of matter as can hardly bee imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſince all things therein appeare ſo confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, that it ſeemes they were therein couched without choice, and to ſay trueth, as itwere at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſome who will yet further tax his ſtile will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſay, they are rather matters then Workes. But for my part, if there bee any defects therein, I hold they ought well to be borne with, in regard of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rarities therein concurring; and when wee haue ſaid all, what appearance is there to vnderualew any thing we receiue from a man who was worth ſeuen Millions of Gold? And who once in his life had the heart, and ambition to aſpire to the Empire of the whole world? Let vs therefore eſteeme all wee receiue from him, and from thoſe times, yet ſuffer vs to commend our owne, wherein this ſcience which medleth with the commanding of ſpirits, and which was but formerly in it's infancy, is now found to be in his full maturitie, and as it were of ripe yeeres. If therefore you acknowledge any obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due (as in trueth there is) to theſe excellent Letters, you ſhall in ſhort time ſee ſo ſolid, and iuſt a iudgment proceed from this Author, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it ſelfe produceth not any more able; and his ſolitarines will be ſo ſatisfactorie vnto you, that you will make no more difference then I do, to prefer the fame before the magnificence of Princely Courts, and the Pompe of moſt ſtatelyeſt Cities.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout fiue yeeres ſince, I chanced to peruſe Mounſieur <hi>Balzac's</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (they being then as I ſuppoſe) but lately come forth in <hi>French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and as it ſhould ſeeme without the Authours approbation: For of eight Editions in ſeuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſince publiſhed, this onely being the laſt, I was by him auowed. Hauing therefore ſeene this Coppy, was ſo farre from ſuppoſing it vnworthy the reading, as (on the contrary) finding his stile right eloquent, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnafected, his conceptions high, and the whole Booke richly adorned with great varietie of learning, appearing almoſt in euery Page: It raiſed no ſmall deſire in mee to try how his way of writing would ſute with our language: I thought therefore good (as my occaſions would permit, now and then for my priuate recreation) to tranſlate certaine of his Letters, without any the leaſt intention
<pb facs="tcp:3669:12"/>
to put them all into Engliſh, much leſſe to publiſh them: But hauing once begun, I found my ſelfe ſo taken with the freeedome of his diſcourſe, together with the facil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of his expreſsions; and ſo ſurunded with the torrent of his witt, that though I had ſmall hopes of wading ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through, notwithſtanding it ſeemed euen delightfull vnto mee to bee drenched in ſo rich ſo pleaſing, and ſo plentifull a flood, yet after diuers attempts, I at laſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued on drie land, reſoluing to reſt my ſelfe after theſe labours, and in priuate to inioy the content I tooke in hearing Mounſieur <hi>Balzac</hi> ſpeake, though but broken Engliſh. But I was not long left in peace with this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, before certaine my noble friends vnderſtanding I had traualled on this ſubiect; did importunately ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite me to put theſe Letters into Print, perſwading me I ſhould here in performe no vnacceptable ſeruice to my Countrey, eſpecially to ſuch who are vnacquainted with the French Language. Their power therefore ouer-ruling my baſhfullneſſe, though otherwiſe ſeconding my willing deſire to bee vſefull; I held it leſſe faultie to incur the hazard of publike cenſure, then to bee taxed of wilfull inciuillitie. So as (worthy Reader) I haue here expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to thy view; If the courſneſſe of the Engliſh ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit wherein I haue clad them, ſeeme vnſutable to their French attyre, or vnfaſhionable in thy ſight: Conſider I beſeech thee, that beautifull creatures are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blemiſhed, though but plainely attyred.

               </opener>
               <p>I Am as proud of the <hi>Letter</hi> you did me the Honour to <hi>addreſſe</hi> vnto me, as if there were a thouſand <hi>Statues</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for me, or if I were aſſured by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority of my works excellency. Truly, to be commended by that man our Age oppoſeth to all antiquity, and vpon whoſe Wiſedome God might well intruſt the whole earths gouernment, is a fauour I could not wiſh for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſumption, and which I am yet doubtfull whether I haue really receiued, or onely dreamed ſomeſuch matter. But if it be ſo that my eyes haue not deceiued me, and that you are hee who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed that voyce vpon me, which hath bin choſen by all <hi>France</hi> to preſent her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to the King, and by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3669:16"/>
to conuey his Commands into Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Armies: My Lord, I muſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly then acknowledge you haue already payed me before hand, for all the ſeruices I can euer poſſibly performe vnto you: and I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe very vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if I ſhould hereafter complayne of my fortunes: ſince vpon the matter, the goods and honours of this World are moſt ordinarily none other then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Sotts, or rewards of Vice, Eſtimation and Commendation being onely reſerued for Vertue. Ought I not then to reſt highly ſatisfied, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from your Mouth the ſame Prize which Conquerors expect for their Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories? yea, all that your ſelfe could hope for, in lieu of your great and immortall Actions, if there were another Cardinall of <hi>Richelieu</hi> to giue them their due Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations? But truely (my Lord) that is a thing which will alwayes be wanting to your Glory; for when by your onely Preſence you haue appeaſed the ſpirits of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3669:16"/>
an incenſed Multitude; when by your powerfull Reaſons you haue induced Chriſtian Princes to ſet the Natiue Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> at liberty, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the <hi>Holy Warre,</hi> when you haue gayned whole Nations to the Church, as well by the force of your <hi>Example,</hi> as by that of your <hi>Doctrine,</hi> who is of ability to pay you the Reputation which you in all right deſerue? and where ſhall you finde ſo excellent a Witneſſe for all the marueilous Acts of your Life, as I haue of my Watchings and Studies? I cannot chuſe but reiterate this, and my ioy is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer iuſt to be concealed. Is it poſſible this great Wit and high ſpirit, which hath bin imployed euen from his firſt Youth in perſwading Princes, in giuing inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Embaſſadours, and hath beene liſtned vnto by old men, who haue ſeene foure Reignes? Is it poſſible I ſay, this man ſhould valew me; on whoſe Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation all enemies agree? nor is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all men a contrary party, or diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3669:17"/>
of beleefe in this poynt. If I had a purpoſe to diſquiet the repoſe of this Kingdome, I would ſeeke for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of ſlacke ſpirits; and I ſhould ſtand in need of the fauour of all ſorts of men, were I to ſtudy for Reputation in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular State: but truely I neuer affected confuſion, or diſorder, and my deſignes haue euer aimed at the pleaſing of a few. For ſince you haue declared your ſelfe in fauour, as hee likewiſe hath done, for whom <hi>France</hi> at this day enuieth <hi>Italy:</hi> and ſince you carry after you the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid part of the Court, I am content to let the reſt runne aſtray with <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi> who make the greater number of Mankinde. Yet (my Lord) I cannot thinke, that any hereafter will be ſo farre in loue with himſelfe, or ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his owne opinion, as not to be a Convertite by the onely reading the Letter you honour'd me with, and who in concluſion will not ſubſcribe to your great Iudgement? And, if it be certayne
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3669:17"/>
that truth it ſelfe could not be ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt you, there is no queſtion but that ſide whereon you two ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, oughtto be vniuerſally followed. For my part (my Lord) let all men ſay what they will, I fixe my ſelfe with clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eyes there; and what enemies ſoeuer the reputation you haue allowed mee procure me: yet knowing your abilities and what you are, I will be no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolicitus for mine owne Intereſt, or future benefit, ſince it is become your cauſe;</p>

               <p>I Humbly intreate you to be pleaſed by theſe preſents, to permit me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vnto you the aſſurance of my moſt humble Seruice, and that you would allow mee to craue ſome Newes from you: It is the onely thing wherein I am now curious, and which in the very depth of my retiredneſſe, obligeth me to reflect ſometimes vpon worldly Affaires. But happen what can, I am moſt aſſured, you will remayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant euen amidſt publique ruines, and that <hi>Fortune</hi> cannot bereaue you of thoſe aduantages ſhee neuer gaue you. Yet could I wiſh, that your life were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more calme, and leſſe glorious: And that <hi>Artemiza's</hi> goodneſſe hauing

ſo great <hi>Affinity</hi> to what is infinite, and which is of power to procure loue euen amidſt the moſt ſauage beaſts; doth in right deſerue to obtaine truce, and repoſe among reaſonable Creatures.

But ſurely if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Juſtice</hi> in <hi>Heauen,</hi> (whereof there is no doubt) and if <hi>God</hi> haue an Eye to worldly matters: wee muſt beleeue the teares of vpright perſons ſhal not be ſhed in vaine, or that your Queene ſhall waxe old in her Misfortunes: yet at the leaſt, ſince our cogitations be ſtill within our owne compaſſe, and we being not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to hope well, let vs make the beſt vſe we may of this ſmall portion of <hi>Liberty</hi> yet remayning.

But knowing it is no other then a meere fauour you pleaſed to affoord me, I will not flatter my felfe in my good fortune, nor leſſen the Obligation due vnto you, in preſuming to merit the ſame. If <hi>Vertue</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired any Recompence out of her ſelfe, ſhe would not receiue it from other mouth then yours: and your Reputation is at this day ſo <hi>Iuſt</hi> and <hi>Generall,</hi> as it is become a <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erity</hi> wherein the Wiſe agree with the Vulgar. I doe therefore account my ſelfe very happy, to be reputed of, by a Perſon who is able to giue a value to things of themſelues worthleſſe; and I attribute ſo much to your <hi>Iudgement,</hi> that I will no longer hold any meane opinion of my ſelfe, leſt therein I ſhould contradict you. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (my Lord) very difficultly will my parts any way anſwere your Expectation. The time my <hi>Feauer</hi> affoordeth me for reſt is ſo ſhort, I can hardly imploy it to other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then to complaine of its cruelty.

they ſurmount others, to ſee I haue found what they ſeeke for. Whatſoeuer I doe, I will at leaſt haue you at all times preſent to my thoughts, thereby to oblige my ſelfe not to come ſhort before ſo great an example, nor will I forget the place where at this preſent I am, to the end not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing worthy the <hi>Ancient Rome.</hi> It is impoſſible at once to haue ſo glorious obiects, and degenerous thoughts, or not to be tranſported with all thoſe Tryumphs of times paſt, and with the glory of our Age.

vnderſtand that the Pope hath created you a Cardinall; I make no queſtion but you receiued this Newes as a matter indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vnto you: and that your Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed aboue the things of this world, you behold them with one and the ſame Aſpect.

               <p>HAd the wayes beene ſafe, or if the good order you haue taken for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke ſecurity, had not beene ſubiect to the like ſucceſſe as are wholeſome Lawes, which are ſeldome well obſerued, I ſhould not be neceſſitated to take a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time then you allotted me when I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3669:25"/>
parted from <hi>Fountainebleau,</hi> nor had I till now beene conſtrayned to ſpin out the time of my Diſpatch. But though your Commandments are all powerfull in me, yet you know neceſſity will firſtbe obeyed, nor will you (I hope) be diſpleaſed that I haue made choyce of a Priſon whereto I am accuſtomed, to auoide another not ſo commodious for me. This hath not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but to my extreame griefe, ſince I haue not beene able to be a witneſſe of the moſt illuſtrious life of our Age, and haue thereby loſt halfe a Yeare of your <hi>Actions</hi> which (well nigh) fill vp all our <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> For though we are not ſo remote from the World, that no Newes can come to vs, yet they paſſe ſo many places, as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they receiue not diuers Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or that they ſhould arriue here in their purity, ſince they are often altered from the very <hi>Loouer;</hi> yet haue Ivnderſtood, and <hi>Fame</hi> hath publiſhed euen in Deſarts, the great Conflicts by you vndergone, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued for the Honour and Reputation of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3669:26"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> and how you haue ſubdued the ſubtilties of Strangers, being in truth more to be feared then their Forces. I heare how <hi>Italy</hi> hath ſpent all her practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without hurting any, and how thoſe Stateſ-men who made accompt to Seigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize in all Aſſemblies, and to be Maiſters in all Reaſons of State, were vnable to defend themſelues againſt you, but with paſſion, and choller: nor to complaine of any other thing, but that you perſwaded them to whatſoeuer they were before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hand reſolued not to yeeld. So as (my Lord) thoſe who tearmed vs <hi>Barbartans,</hi> and by their treaties commonly tooke reuenge of our Victories, haue in the end found <hi>wiſedome</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and haue well perceiued there is a man who hath abilities to hinder them from deceiuing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They ſtood amazed to ſee a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant who would not ſuffer there ſhould be any Maiſter greater then his Soueraigne. Who was as ſencible of the leaſt Euils of his Countrey, as of his proper ſorrowes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3669:26"/>
ſuppoſing himſelfe to be wounded vpon the leaſt apprehenſion, when any made ſhew of trenching vpon the Dignity of this Crowne. But when they found you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed preſent remedies to all ſuch inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences as they obiected; that you preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the difficulties they offered to propoſe, that you diued into their ſoules, drawing thence their cloſeſt Intentions, and how at the firſt conference you made anſwer to what they reſerued for a ſecond. Then it was indeede, when their <hi>Fleame</hi> was turned into <hi>Choler,</hi> and when you put their hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mane Wiſedomes and politique Maximes to a ſtand. So as we ſee it is ſufficient one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to let <hi>Good</hi> appeare, to cauſe it to be beloued: and truely if <hi>Reaſon</hi> had the like power ouer the <hi>Will,</hi> as it hath ouer the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> all thoſe <hi>Italians</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, who heard you ſpeake, had retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned good <hi>French-men,</hi> and the ſafety of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> together with the ſecurity of her Princes, had beene but one daies worke. Forraigne warres had beene ended in your

chamber; nor ſhould we now haue any more then one buſineſſe vpon vs, and the Kings Forces had at this preſent beene imployed onely in ſuppreſſing the Rebels of his owne Kingdome. My Lord, I hope you are perſwaded (though I could not probably expect any ſlight occurrents from the place where you are) yet that I receiued theſe with much emotion and tranſport, it not being in my power to diſſemble my ioy, when I vnderſtood how their Maieſties are not wearie of your Seruice, and how after hauing try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diuers Councels, it was in concluſion thought fit to follow yours, and that you precede in the affaires of <hi>Europe,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conductor of the Fortune of <hi>France.</hi> Truely, of all exteriour contentments, there is not any whereof I am ſo ſenſible as of that. But on the other ſide, when I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that your Health is dayly aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or threatned by ſome accident, that the Tranquility your Conſcience affords you, hinders you not from hauing ill

Nights: And how amidſt the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes befalling you, life it ſelfe is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſomtimes tedious vnto you; then indeed I muſt confeſſe they touch me in the tendereſt part of my <hi>Soule.</hi> And whilſt the <hi>Court</hi> makes thouſands of feined <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations</hi> vnto you; there is an <hi>Hermite</hi> ſome hundred Leagues from you, who mournes for your maladies with vnfeigned teares. I know not whether or no I may preſume to ſay, <hi>I loue you:</hi> yet is it not probable you will take offence at a Word wherewith, you know <hi>God himſelfe</hi> is well pleaſed. <hi>My Lord;</hi> I do in ſuch manner Loue you, as I am eyther ſicke vpon the Relation of your indiſpoſition; or if the newes be current that you are recouered, yet haue I ſtill an apprehenſion of what alteration each <hi>houre</hi> may bring vpon you. Ought it then to be in the Fits of your <hi>Feauer,</hi> and in your inquietude for want of ſleepe, that you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe publicke <hi>acclamations,</hi> and the due <hi>prayſes</hi> you haue purchaſed: Shall the <hi>Senſes</hi> ſuffer, and the <hi>Spirits</hi> reioyce, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3669:28"/>
they continue tortured amidſt theſe Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, or that you (at once) performe two contrary Actions, and at the ſame time haue neede, as well of Moderation, as Patience: If <hi>Vertue</hi> could be miſerable, or if that Sect which acknowledgeth no other euill, but paine; nor any greater good then pleaſure, had not beene gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally condemned: the Diuine prouidence had receiued complaints from all parts of this Kingdome; nor had there beene an honeſt man knowne, who for your ſake had not found ſomething farther to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in the conduct of this World. But (my Lord) you vnderſtand much better then I doe, that it is only touching the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of beaſts, we are to beleeue the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and not concerning ours, reſiding onely in the ſupreame part of our ſelues, and which is as ſmally ſenſible of thoſe diſorders committed below her, as thoſe in <hi>Heauen</hi> can bee offended by the tempeſts of the <hi>Ayre,</hi> or vapours of the <hi>Earth.</hi> This being true: God forbid, that

by the eſtate of your preſent conſtitution, I ſhould iudge of that of your Condition; or that I ſhould not eſteeme him perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy who is ſuperlatiuely wiſe. You may pleaſe to conſider, that howbeit you haue ſhared with other men the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humane Nature, yet the aduantage reſteth ſoly on your ſide: ſince (vpon the matter) there is onely ſome ſmall paine remayning with you, inſtead of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of errours, paſſions, and faults falling to our lots. Beſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am confident that the terme of your ſufferings is well nigh expired, and that the hereafter prepares right ſolide and pure contentments for you, and a youth after its ſeaſon, as you are become old before your time. The King who hath vſe of your long liuing, makes no vnprofitable wiſhes: <hi>Heauen</hi> beares not the prayers that the Enemies of this State offer. We know no Succeſſor that is able to effect what you haue not yet fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: and it being true, that our Forces are but the Armes of your Head, and that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3669:29"/>
your Councels haue beene choſen by <hi>God</hi> to re-eſtabliſh the Affaires of this Age: we ought not to bee apprehenſiue of a loſſe which ſhould not happen but to our Succeſſors. It ſhall then be in your time (my Lord, I hope) that oppreſſed Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will come from the Worlds end to implore the protection of this Crowne: that by your meanes our Allies will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire their loſſes, and that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhall not be the ſole Conquerour, but that we ſhall prooue the Infrancheſers of the whole Earth. In your time (I truſt) the <hi>Holy Sea</hi> ſhall haue her Opinions free, nor ſhall the inſpirations of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> be oppugned by the artifice of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, reſolutions will be raiſed worthy the ancient <hi>Jtaly</hi> for defence of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe. To conclude, it will bee through your <hi>Prudence</hi> (my Lord) that there ſhall no longer be any Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, or Tyranny among men: that all the Citties of this Kingdome ſhall be ſeates of aſſurance for honeſt men; that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3669:29"/>
nouelties ſhall be no farther in requeſt; ſaue onely for colours and faſhions of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the People will reſigne Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Religion, and the Common-wealth, into the hands of Superiours, and that outof lawfull gouernment, and loyall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, there will ariſe that felicity <hi>Politiſians</hi> ſearch after, as being the end of Ciuile life. My hope is (my Lord) that all this will happen vnder your ſage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and that after you haue ſetled our repoſe, and procured the ſame for our Allies, you ſhall enioy your good deeds in great tranquility, and ſee the eſtate of thoſe things endure, whereof your ſelfe haue beene a principal Author.

               <p>I Am infinitely glad to vnderſtand by your <hi>Letters,</hi> of your ſafe returne into <hi>France,</hi> and that you haue now no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſe of <hi>Cypbers,</hi> for the expreſſion of your minde to my Lord the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Richelieu.</hi> I ſhall at your pleaſure (I hope) vnderſtand the particulars of your <hi>Voyage,</hi> and what you haue ſeene at <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> worthy your content. This is not out of any great curioſity I haue for theſe things, or that I admire dumble Marble, or Pictures being no way ſo beautifull as the <hi>Perſons:</hi> Theſe trifles are to be left for the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> with whom the ſame Obiects limit their imagination and ſight: and who (of all times) reflect, mearely vpon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and (of all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) onely vppon the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3669:37"/>
appearance: but for my part I am of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion. There are not in the whole world any Pallaces ſo ſumptuous, or of ſo high a ſtructure which are not farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my thoughts, and I conceiue in my ſpirit a poore hermitage, to the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof many more materials are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, then were requiſite for eſtabliſhing a <hi>Republicke.</hi> You ſee here my Lord, how in ſome ſort I play the Prince amidſt my <hi>pouerty,</hi> and with what inſolency I ſcorne what the <hi>world</hi> ſo much admireth; I am as haughty, as though I were a Miniſter of State; or as if this laſt change in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had beene made for me alone: yet you know well that I call not my ſelfe <hi>L.

                  </hi> Vertue, it ſtill had continued in the ſame place where it hath beene reuerenced of all men. Each man hath his ſeuerall cenſure concerning this great newes, but whatſoeuer they can ſay, I aſſure my ſelfe there can nothing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3669:38"/>
befall that Lord, whereto hee is not at all times prepared, and that he hath liued too long, not to know that <hi>Fortune</hi> taketh ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall delight in dallying with the affaires of <hi>France,</hi> and hath from all Ages made choyce of our <hi>Court,</hi> as the <hi>Theater</hi> of her follies. If he had not beene prouided of the gouernment of this Citty, and what time the King commanded him to come thence, his fall had beene more fearefull then it was, but it is Gods will that <hi>Augoleſme</hi> ſhould be the fatall retreate of the afflicted, and truely allthings well conſidered, it is no great downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>come to light vpon a Mountaine: Now truely if the e be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing amiſſe in the adminiſtration of the Kings Monies, hee cannot be taxed for introducing this errour; for he found it there: and beſides, the neceſſity of the times haue euer reſiſted his good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and haue hindred the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of what he had in his heart, for the reformation of diſorders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is now neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the King vndertake ſo glorious a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3669:38"/>
and ſet his hand to that part of the State, which hath more neede of redreſſe then all the reſt. But he is firſt to begin by the moderation of his Spirit, and hee ſhall after gaine their loyalty who ſerue him. If thoſe Princes our Elders haue ſeene, had conſidered, that the Coyne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into their <hi>Exchecquers,</hi> was no leſſe then the blood, and teares of their poore Subiects, whom they haue often forced to flye into Forreſts, and paſſe the Seas to ſaue themſelues from taxes and impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: they would haue beene more ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and cautelous how they had tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vpon ſo dreadfull vndertakings: at leaſt they would not haue beene at once both indigent and vniuſt, nor haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> who could neuer conceiue why they borrowed their owne moneyes of their <hi>Treaſurers,</hi> who receiue their revenewes, as they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe their owne ſtrong places from their <hi>Gouernours</hi> who command there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Truely, it is very ſtrange the <hi>Great</hi>

                  <hi>Turke</hi> can intruſt his <hi>Wiues</hi> to the vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of others, and aſſure themſelues their Chaſtity ſhall therby be conſerued; yet that Kings know not to whom they may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encharge their Treaſures. But the true reaſon is, for that an honeſt man is by ſo much more difficultly found, then an <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,</hi> by how much Miracles are more rare then Monſters. Great Fortitude is requiſite for the attayning of Honeſty, but the will onely ſufficeth to become couetous, and the moſt harmeleſſe haue hands, and may happen to haue temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Were it my part to play the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, and to preach before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, I would enlarge my ſelfe vpon this <hi>Subiect;</hi> but in the condition wherein I ſtand, it is ſufficient I approue not the ill, and haue a good Opinion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State: prouided, the report be current, that there is now no obſtacle betweene the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Queene</hi> his <hi>Mother,</hi> likely to hinder them from meeting; and that things are reduced to thoſe tearmes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3669:39"/>
wherein <hi>Nature</hi> hath placed them: Then will the face of the State ſhortly reſume the ſame beauty the late <hi>King</hi> beſtowed thereon, and God will with a full hand powre his <hi>Graces</hi> vpon ſo iuſt a Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Though my Lord the Cardinall of <hi>Richlieu</hi> were onely neare Publique affaires, without touching them, there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but he would bring a bleſſing to all <hi>France,</hi> and though he intimated nothing to the <hi>King,</hi> yet that he would at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire whatſoeuer were neceſſary for the good of his Subiects, and Dignity of his Crowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will reſerue to ſpeake as I ought of this rare <hi>Vertue,</hi> till my great <hi>Worke</hi> come to light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where I will render euery man his right, and condemne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thoſe as culpable, whom the Parliaments crouch vnto; There ſhall it be where I will canuaſſe the Court of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Yet my Lord) euen in this bad ſtate wherin I now ſtand, doe I expect a Miracle from my <hi>Maker,</hi> who is onely able to raiſe Children out of the hardeſt Quarries; nor will I beleeue his Mercy hath finiſhed what hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to effect for the good of Mortals: For ſince hee hath placed Ports vpon the ſhoares of moſt dangerous Seas, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſome kinde of dawning, euen to the darkeſt Nights; it may be there is yet ſomething reſerued for me in the ſecrets of his <hi>Prouidence;</hi> and that if hitherto I haue ranged out of the right way, he will not any longer ſuffer me to ſtray, or tire my ſelfe in the tracke of <hi>vice.</hi> And truely, I muſt here, though much to my ſhame, acknowledge the truth vnto you, with thoſe few drops of corrupt blood (which is all I haue left) I am plunged in all thoſe paſſions, wherewith the foundeſt bodies are preſſed: yea, Tyrants, who burne whole Citties vpon the firſt motion of

So farre as I can learne, or if the report which paſſeth be current, he had a

conceite he might one day proue to be that falſe Prophet, wherewith the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning age of the <hi>Church</hi> is threatned: and though hee be but of meane extraction, and poore fortunes, he was notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo preſumptuous, as to imagine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the man, who is to come with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med forces to diſturbe the quiet of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and for whom the infernall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters keepe all the Treaſures yet hidden in the Earths intrailes. So long as he conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe in committing onely humane faults, writing as yet with an vntainted <hi>Pen,</hi> I often told him, his <hi>Verſes</hi> were not paſſable; and that hee was in the wrong to eſteeme himſelfe an vnderſtanding man. But he perceiuing that the rules I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, for bettering his <hi>abilities,</hi> to be ouer-ſharpe and ſeuere for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmall hope of arriuing whether I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>conduct</hi> him, he perhaps thought beſt to ſeeke out ſome other way to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into credit at <hi>Court,</hi> hoping of a meane <hi>Poet</hi> to become a mighty <hi>Prophet:</hi> So

that (as it is generally reported) after he had peruerted a number of ſilly <hi>Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

confirme my opinion I brought from my Trauailes, that French Flowers are not ſo faire, as thoſe of Forraine Countries. I (ſometimes walke downe into that Vallie, being the ſecret part of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, and which till now) was not knowne to any man: It is a Country to be wiſhed for and painted. I haue made choiſe thereof for my moſt precious oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, there to paſſe the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing houres of my life: The Trees and Water neuer ſuffer this place to want couleneſſe and verdure. The Swans which couered the whole Riuer, are reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this place of ſecurity: liuing in a Channell, which cauſeth the greateſt talkers to take a nappe, ſo ſoone as they come neare; &amp; on whoſe Bankes <hi>I</hi> am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies happy; be I merry or melancholly: How ſhort a time ſoeuer I ſtay there, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe I enter into my firſt innocency: my deſires, my feares and hopes ſtop in a trice: all the motions of my ſoule flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor haue <hi>I</hi> any paſſions remaining,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3669:54"/>
or if I haue any, I gouerne them as tame Beaſts. The Sunne conuayes its light thither, but neuer its heate. The place is ſo low, as it can onely receiue the laſt points of its beames: being therfore the more beautifull, in that they are leſſe burning, and the light thereof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together pure. But as it is my ſelfe who haue diſcouered this new found Land; ſo do I poſſeſſe it without any partner, nor would I ſhare it with my owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But in all other quarters vnder my commaund, there is not a man who courts not his Miſtreſſe without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule, nor ſeruant of mine who is not maſter; each one ſatisfying himſelfe of what he loues, and ſpending the time at pleaſure. And on the other ſide, when I ſee the Graſſe trodden downe; and on the other, the Corne full of Layers: <hi>I</hi> am well aſſured, it is neither Winde nor Haile, hath made this worke, but only a Shepheard and his ſweete-heart. At which doore ſoeuer I goe out of my
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3669:55"/>
houſe, or on what ſide ſoeuer I turne mine eyes, in this pleaſant <hi>Pathmos,</hi> I finde the riuer of <hi>Charauton</hi> wel meriting as much fame, as that of <hi>Tagus,</hi> aud wherein, when Beaſts go to drinke, they ſee the Heauens as cleare as we doe, and enioy the ſame aduantage, which elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where men haue ouer them. Beſides, this pure water is ſo in loue with this petty Prouince, that it diuides it ſelfe into a thouſand branches, and makes an infinite of windings and turnings, as loath to leaue and depriue it ſelfe of ſo pleaſing a lodging; and when at any time it ouer-floweth, it is only to make the yeare more firtile, and to affoord vs meanes to catch Trouts and Pykes, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them vpon the leuill; and which are ſo great and excellent, as they equall the Sea Monſters; the Crocadiles of <hi>Nile,</hi> and all the ſuppoſed Gold rowling in thoſe feigned Riuers ſo much ſpoken of by Poets. The great Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> comes hether ſometimes, for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3669:55"/>
change of felicity, and to lay aſide that auſtere vertue and ſplendor, which daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the eyes of all men, to aſſume milder qualities, and a more accoſtable Maieſty. This Cardinall likewiſe, by whom Heauen intends to act ſo high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and of whom you heare me day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake, after the loſſe of his brother who was ſuch a one, as if he might haue choſen him among all men, hee would not haue taken any other: after (as I ſay) hauing indured that loſſe, well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to draw teares from the Queene, he made choice of this place, here to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his patience, and to receiue from Gods hands who loueth ſilence, and who is found in ſolitary retirements, what Philoſophy affoordeth not, nor is to be practiſed among the throng of people. <hi>I</hi> would enlarge my ſelfe vpon other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, to ſhew you how my Village hath at all times bin frequented by He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical <hi>Hermits,</hi> and how the ſteps of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Siegniors, are (as yet) new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3669:56"/>
trodden in my ordinary pathes. But the more to inuite you to come hither; <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe it ſufficient to ſay, that <hi>Virgil</hi> and myſelfe do here attend you: if therfore you be accompanied in this Voyage with your <hi>Muſes;</hi> and other <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> we ſhall not neede to entertayne the time with Court newes, nor with the <hi>Germaine</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: Let me not liue, if euer I ſaw any thing comparable to your <hi>Spirituall Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> and if the leaſt part of the Worke you ſhewed me, be not of more worth, then all <hi>Frankford Mart,</hi> and all thoſe great Bookes which come to vs from the North, bringing cold weather and froſts along with them. I aſſure you the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>THOV,</hi> who was as worthy a Iudge of <hi>Latine Eloquence,</hi> as of the life and fortunes of men; and who had left an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Hiſtory behind him, had he pleaſed to retract ſome things; made no ſmall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of theſe my Countrey-men: But I cannot as yet conceiue what cauſed him to affect certaine wits ſo contrary to his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3669:56"/>

In a word, beſides the propriety of termes, and chaſtity of Stile, which lendeth a luſter to your elaborate Writings, your conceits are ſo ſublime, and ſo full of courage, that it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the ancient Republicke of <hi>Rome</hi> was adorned with the like, at what time it was victorious ouer the World, and when the <hi>Senate</hi> conceiued inſemblable tearmes, the Commandments they preſcribed to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Princes, and the anſwers it addreſſed to all Nations on earth: I will ſpeake fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when you appeare where I expect you; and where inſtead of <hi>Flowers, Fruites,</hi> and

Since there haue beene found men who haue carped at the Worlds compoſure, and ſpied ſpots in the Sunne, it is very likely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things cannot be more perfect; and that there is nothing ſo abſolutely approued, againſt which there hath not beene ſome thing diſputed, and certayne weake Reaſons alledged. I confeſſe <hi>I</hi> write as men build Temples and Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that I ſometimes fetch my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials a farre oft; as wee are to make a

It is long ſince <hi>I</hi> vnderſtood from him that I exceeded others; not excepting euen thoſe who ſtriue to aſpire to a kind of tyranny, and to vſurpe a more abſolute authority ouer wits, then is either law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or reaſonable.

I would content my ſelfe with my <hi>infant</hi> conceptions, or determined to write as an honeſt Woman ſhould ſpeake, they would happily finde their owne facility in my <hi>Workes:</hi> though truely if I take any paines therein, I aſſure myſelfe they will ſooner ghèſſe at, then gaine my concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But truely, he who purpoſeth to himſelfe the <hi>Idea</hi> of perfection, and who labours for <hi>Eternity,</hi> ought not to let any thing eſcape his <hi>Pen,</hi> till after long and ſerious conſultation with himſelfe. Yet will I tell you, and all the World may eaſily vnderſtand, that my writings ſmel more of <hi>Muske</hi> and <hi>Amber,</hi> then of <hi>Oyle</hi> or <hi>ſweate;</hi> whereas out of that great labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe they ſo much frame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, there will infallibly ariſe obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which none but the <hi>Blind</hi> can taxe me with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as for thoſe fellowes, it is alwayes night with them, and they are rather to accuſe their mothers of their defects, and not colours or the light: I indeauour (in what <hi>I may)</hi> to make all

my conceptions popular, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligable among women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, euen when I ſpeake of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Capacity: but if your friends ſuppoſe certayne of my conceits to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-farre fetcht, let them throughly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, whither they tranſcend my ſubiect, or their conceptions; or whither <hi>I</hi> goea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, or they looſe ſight of me: There are diuers things aboue reaſon, which yet are not contrary thereto. An Heroicall vertue making vſe of exceſſes and highth of paſſions, goeth as farre beyond vulgar <hi>Vertue,</hi> as it ſurmounteth <hi>Vice:</hi> we are not therefore to ſhut vp all <hi>Wits</hi> within the ſame limits, nor preſently to cenſure that as Exorbitant, which is only extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: Otherwiſe we ſhould reſemble that poore <hi>Noruegian,</hi> who the firſt time he ſaw <hi>Roſes,</hi> durſt not touch them for feare of burning his fingers, and was much amazed to ſee (as he ſuppoſed) Trees to beare <hi>fire:</hi> Surely as Nouelty is not of force to make Monſters well featured, ſo ought it not

innocent of all others, had I onely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein; and I may ſafely ſay without vanity, that euen the follies of my <hi>Jnfan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> were more ſerious then thoſe ſweete <hi>Rbetoricall flowers:</hi> when all is ſayd, ſince there is nothing but <hi>Religion</hi> can force vs to belecue what ſhee pleaſeth, and that <hi>Kings</hi> themſelues haue no power ouer Soules, <hi>I</hi> am well ſatisfied with the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my Friends, and doe willingly leaue their iudgements free to themſelues.

Howſoeuer this happens, it ſhall not much trouble me ſince the iſſue cannot be other then aduantagious to this State.

It may be at this very inſtant wherein <hi>I</hi> write, the great <hi>Indian</hi> Fleete ſuffereth ſhipwracke within two Leagues of Land: happily the great <hi>Turke</hi> hath ſurpriſed ſome Prouince from the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and taken thence ſome twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand ſoules, to conuey them to their Citty of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> It may be

I know well that ſome will tell you, you

are created Prince of ſuch an Eſtate, as is bounded neither by Seas nor Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and how the extent of your iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction is ſo illimitable, as were there many worlds, they ought all of them to depend thereon as well as this. But I who ſuffer not mine eyes to be dazeled by any other luſter then that of Vertue, and who doe not ſo much as beſtow the looking on, what moſt men admire; if I ſhould eſteeme you either more great, or happy then you were, I ſhould not haue ſufficiently profited vnder you, in the true vnderſtanding of you. Doubtleſſe in the opinion of the Vulgar, it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Honour to be a prime perſon in a Ceremony, and to weare a Hat of equal eſteeme to Crownes and Diadems. Yet I preſume you will pardon mee if I make bold to tell you, it is an honour can neuer oblige a wiſe man to enuy you. For had you this point onely aboue me, I ſhould ſtill be my owne Maſter: Nor had I for your ſake renounced that liberty,

which was as deare to mee as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Venice.</hi> Vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to haue none other Iudge on Earth ſaue onely your reputation and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to haue a great trayne of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, ſome whereof are imployed in the procuring your ſpirituall pleaſures, others in the conduct of your temporall affaires, all this ſhal be ſtill the ſame with you, and diuers others whom you ſlight; but to performe good and vertuous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when you are aſſured they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come to the worlds eye; to feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diſhoneſt things; to beleeue death to bee neither good nor bad in it ſelfe; but that if the occaſion to imbrace it be honourable, it is alwayes more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable then a long life: to haue the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of integrity in your promiſes, in a time when the moſt credulous haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to doe, to confide on publique faith: This is it which I admire in you my Lord; and not your Red Hat, and your fifty thouſand Crownes Rent; yet
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3669:66"/>
I will ſay, that for the honour of <hi>Rome,</hi> you ought to eſteeme of what ſhe ſends you.

If there were nothing elſe in it, but that it cauſeth you to quit your Mourning-robes, to reueſt your ſelfe with the colour of Roſes, you can doe no leſſe then reioyce at ſuch a change.

it not fit, but hath encharged his owne <hi>Meſsenger</hi> to aduertiſe you of all things, in your Voyage this way, and to giue you accompt of all occurrents.

               <p>YOur Caſh-keeper hath newly brought mee the ſumme you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to deliuer vnto me. <hi>I</hi> would willingly ſhew ſufficient thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for this high fauour: but beſides that your benefits are boundleſſe, and that you are ſo gracious an obliger, that it doth euen augment the value of your Bounty, I ſhould ſeeme ouer preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to thinke any words of mine valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the leaſt of your actions. It ſhall therefore ſuffice me to proteſt vnto you, that the bounty wherewith the Letter I receiued from you, is ſo ſtored; (being of force to infuſe Loue and Fidelity in the hearts of very Barbarians,) ſhall worke no leſſe effect in the ſpirit of a perſon
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3669:70"/>
who hath learned both by Nature and Philoſophy not to be ingratefull. Since I finde my intereſt within my duty, <hi>I</hi> muſt neceſſarily loue you (if I hate not my ſelfe) and be an honeſt man by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Maxime of the wicked. Yet is not this laſt conſideration the cauſe chiefly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging me to your ſeruice: For though <hi>I</hi> acknowledge diuers defects in my ſelfe, yet may I without vanity affirme, <hi>I</hi> was neuer beſotted with ſo baſe an attraction as that of gaine. I therefore reflect vpon your fauours in their naked purity, and the eſteeme you make of me, is to me by ſo much a more ſtrong obligation then all others, in that it regardeth my merit, and not my inſtant pouerty, and proceedeth from your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is farre more excellent, then your fortunes are eminent. Herein (my Lord) it is manifeſt, that all your incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are magnificent: for you know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me neither to be fit to make the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Family, nor to ſolicite cauſes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3669:70"/>
at the Counſell-table, nor well to ride poſt: you make it appeare, you are of the right blood of Kings, who are onely rich in ſuperfluous things. Truely it were a hard matter to gueſſe what in this world is the true vſe of Pearles and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; or why a Picture ſhould coſt more then a Pallace; but onely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: which to ſatisfie the inuentions of Art, are dayly imployed, and Nature to that end produceth whatſoeuer is rare, being indeede a thing more noble then neceſſity, ſhee being contented with ſmall matters, euer preferring profit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore pleaſure. And I will here ſtop, leſt I ſpeake too much to my owne aduantage: And if I haue already incurred that crime, I beſeech you to beleeue it hath not beene with purpoſe to praiſe my ſelfe, but onely to extoll your liberality: Yet will <hi>I</hi> make bold to acquaint you, how I imploy your money, and yeelde you a more particular account of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires I diſpatch for you here at <hi>Rome:</hi>

I ſpend halfe my time vnder wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the reſt on Land: I riſe twice a day, and when I ſtep out of my bed, it is onely to enter into a Groue of Orange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, where I ſlumber with the pleaſant purling of ſome twelue Fountaines: but if occaſion be offered to goe further once in a Weeke, I croſſe not the ſtreet but in Carroach, paſſing ſtill in the ſhade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Heauen and Earth: I leaue the ſmell of ſweeteſt flowers vnto the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, as hauing found the inuention to eate and drinke them. The Spring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>time neuer parts with me all the yeare either in variety of diſtilled Waters, or in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues. I change perfumes according to

that the firſt loſſe we indure in paine, fals vpon our iudgement, and the body hath ſuch a proximity with the ſoule, that the miſeries of the one, doe eaſily ſlide into the other.

The great <hi>V V V.</hi> is newly parted from this Court, where he hath not receiued from his Holineſſe his expected contentment. His deſigne was to breake the Mariage his Brother hath contracted, vpon ſome ſlight appearance of Sorcery, wherewith he deemed to dazle the worlds eye, and ground the nullity of an action, which was by ſo much the more free, in that the parties who performed it, ſought not the conſent of any to approue it. In concluſion after the loſſe of much time, and many words, he is gone without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning any thing, ſaue onely the Popes benediction; and as for me, I remayne much ſatisfied to ſee Iuſtice ſo exact at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they will not condemne the Diuell himſelfe wrongfully. I haue heard how in ſome places halfe houre Mariages are made, the conditions whereof are
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3669:75"/>
neither diſgeſted into writing, nor any memory thereof reſerued; but of theſe ſecret myſteries, there are no other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſaue onely the Night and Silence: And though the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them not, yet doth ſhee ſhut her eyes, fearing to ſee them. I am reſolued not to bee long in the deſcription of <hi>K K K,</hi> whom you know much better then my ſelfe: Yet thus much I will ſay, that ſince <hi>Neroes</hi> death, there neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in <hi>Jtaly</hi> a Comedian of more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable extraction: And ſurely to make the Company at this preſent in <hi>France</hi> compleate; this perſonage were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: He makes Verſes, he hath read <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> and vnderſtands Muſicke, and in a word he hath all the excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties vnneceſſary in a Prince. I know here a <hi>German</hi> called S. to whom hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a annuall penſion of a thouſand Crownes, aſſigned vnto him vpon an Abbey during life; this he hath done, not that he intendeth to vſe his ſeruice in his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3669:75"/>
counſell, or with purpoſe to imploy him in any important negotiation for the good of his affaires: his onely ambition is to haue him make a booke, whereby it might appeare how thoſe of <hi>M M M,</hi> are lineally deſcended from <hi>Iulius Caeſar.</hi> I ſhould be glad he would yet aime at ſome higher, or more eminent race, and that hee would purchaſe a ſecond fable at the like rate he payed for the firſt. I would willingly giue him his choice of the <hi>Medes, Perſians, Greekes,</hi> or <hi>Troians,</hi> which of theſe he would haue of his Kindred, and without the rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the authority of tradition or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Stories: I would draw his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from <hi>Hector,</hi> or <hi>Achilles,</hi> which hee beſt liked. There are certaine Princes who are neceſſarily to be deceiued, if you meane to doe them acceptable ſeruice, being far better pleaſed to bee entertayned with a plauſible lye, then to be aduertiſed of an important truth. <hi>I</hi> hold my ſelfe right happy you are not of this humour: for whatſoeuer I ſay, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe it would bee

You haue ſufficient of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to put off affaires when occaſion is offered: but you haue a courage they come ſhort of, to carry matters by ſtrong hand if neceſſity require. Therefore my Lord, to what part ſoeuer your Opinion ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, you will carry that with you which gaineth victories, and cauſeth the greater party to ſide with the ſounder; yea, if matters ſhould paſſe without conteſtation, yet ſhould you at leaſt take notice that you are intreated to that action, wherein God permits you to ſupply his place, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3669:85"/>
intruſteth to your care the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matter of all his Workes. To ſpeake ſeriouſly, his prouidence is neuer in ſo high imployment, as when hee is to chooſe the man who hath power to vſe well, or abuſe all the Riches of Heauen, and who is to exerciſe a power neareſt approaching to Diuinity. Heretofore God made vſe of Thunder and tempeſts, when he purpoſed to denounce any thing to men, declaring his Will by other then ordinary meanes. But ſince hee hath cauſed Oracles to ceaſe, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the Thunder to worke only natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall effects: It is onely by the voyce of Cardinals hee cauſeth his deſires to bee manifeſted, and ordayneth concerning the worlds Conduct. When you pleaſe (my good Lord) <hi>I</hi> ſhall haue ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe inſpirations hee hath ſent you, and of the election you haue made: For to force me (ſo ſoone) to informe my ſelfe thereof in the place where it was performed, this Kingdome had neede
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3669:85"/>
be ouer hot for me, and that I were not ſo well acquainted as I am with the Sun at <hi>Rome.</hi> That which blackes the Moores, and burnes <hi>Lybia,</hi> is not ſo dangerous at this Seaſon; and were you not ſtored with treaſures of Snow, and prouided of Halls of Marble, to defend you from the ſcorching Ayre, <hi>I</hi> ſhould as ſoone chuſe to be condemned to the fire, as to be forced to reſide where you are at this preſent. But your Grace I know can not be affrighted with all theſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of heate; you are none of thoſe who will finde fault with the Ayre, which all that ancient Republicke brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, or with the Sunne, which hath holpen to make ſo many Conquerours, and giuen light to ſo many glorious Tryumphs.

what common brute beſtoweth in all parts of the World, and which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> may as well know as I.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3669:89"/>
both of men and affaires, thereby to giue you the better inſtructions at your comming. Now to the end to affoord you a taſte of what I know, obſerue what <hi>I</hi> ſay, for I will tell you ſtrange things. There is a certaine Great man here, who entertaineth ſixe Aſtrologers in Penſion, to let him vnderſtand from time to time who ſhall be Pope: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes large fees on both ſides, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the onely way to bring his Clients to compoſition: A third hath the moſt extrauagant vertue you euer heard of, he leades a farre more pleaſant life then the Duke of <hi>Oſsuna;</hi> and hauing read in Holy Writ, how the Wiſedome of the world is folly in Gods ſight, he imagines hee ſhould offend his Conſcience, if he were ouer wiſe. Here are Princes in this place, who in full peace pardon ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Age nor Sexe. There are others who keepe their beds, though they be well able to ride poſt; and who vſe all Phiſicke poſſible to looke pale, to be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3669:89"/>
feaueriſh, and full of Cathars, and who make vſe of all the ſectets in Phiſicke to haue a megar aſpect. In concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the higheſt place in this world, is that, whether the more eaſily to arriue, it is neceſſary to be lame, and take ſhort ſteps; ſo as a ſound Pope is commonly made out of a ſickely Cardinall. At our next meeting, <hi>I</hi> will informe you of the reſt, and will in one halfe houre infuſe into you all the experience I haue hither to gotten: But if I haue not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment ſo ſoone as <hi>I</hi> deſire, faile not I pray you, to let me here newes of your health, and the reſt of our good friends. But eſpecially <hi>I</hi> beſeech you to aſſure <hi>Mounſieur de Mauroy,</hi> that I am paſſionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his ſeruant, and that I finde here much fubtilty and diſſimulation, but not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſo pure and true vertues, as his are</p>

It is now time <hi>(my Lord)</hi> you take notice of thoſe aduantages God hath giuen you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the reſt of men: You ought, at leaſt to remember, how being tryed with Worldly affaires, and retired from Court, publicke neceſſity had not ſought you out in your priuate repoſednes at home, to put the Kings royall Armies into your hands, if you were not the only man from whom all men expect the re-eſtabliſhment of theſe affaires. <hi>I</hi> will not ſo farrerelie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my owne opinion, as to anſwere for the future: Yet when <hi>J</hi> conſider the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your Life, which are ſo <hi>eminent,</hi> that we find difficulty to beleeue them, euen after they haue beene performed; and thoſe in ſuch number, that <hi>Strangers</hi> may well imagine you haue liued from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our <hi>Monarchy: I</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>I</hi> might boldly affirme, that, if there be yet any great matter remaining to be atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the World, there is none but your Selfe muſt attempt it. You haue poſſeſſed
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3669:94"/>
the fauour of Kings, as Fortunes which might faile you, and haue not feared that their paſſions could out-laſt your <hi>innocency.</hi> This Vertue we ſo much admire, hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the ſame authority, our Fathers haue adored. You haue made no vſe of your power in State, which you haue not euer ſince coſerued by the force of your <hi>Courage.</hi> You haue at all times preſerued the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>France</hi> amidſt the miſeries of times, and the vſurpation vpon lawfull power. Who is there can ſay this of himſelfe? where are they that haue ſtood firme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene rebellion and ſeruitude? where was there euer knowne an olde age ſo neceſſary for the world, or ſo much good and bad fortune equally glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? My Lord, you know your ſelfe too well, to ſuſpect me of flattery; and my humour is ſo aliene from any ſeruile actions, as the Court hath not ſufficient hopes to cauſe me to do any thing againſt my conſcience. I then ſpeake as I doe now; for the onely intereſt of Vertue;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3669:95"/>
and if that were not on your ſide, I would ſeeke for it among our enemies to doe it right: None will ſuſpect I haue any pretentions at <hi>Madrill;</hi> or that I intend to make a fortune in <hi>Holland;</hi> yet to heare mee ſpeake of the Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> and the Marqueſſe <hi>Spinola,</hi> one would ſay that <hi>I</hi> did at once expect Abbies from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and were a penſioner to <hi>Spaine.</hi> In ſumme, <hi>I</hi> hold my ſelfe obliged to thoſe, who affoord me matter and meanes to reconcile the two rareſt things in this world, to wit; Vertue and Eloquence. And as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation hath neede of my Pen, to make it immortall; ſo are their liues and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons right vſefull vnto me, when <hi>I</hi> imploy my paines on excellent Subiects. You haue euer done mee the honour to wiſh me well, and I haue receiued innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fauours from my Lord the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall your Sonne; but howſoeuer, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech you to be confident that my affections are abſolutely pure, and that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3669:95"/>
my particular intereſts haue not any alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance therewith.

Herein my Lord, you make it appeare that the meaneſt matters change their nature into more noble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, ſo ſoone as they become yours: and how of all men, you haue conquered part, and acquired the reſt. I am verily perſwaded, it were no leſſe then to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, to deny obedience to a perſon ſo high in his fauour as you are, and that his meaning is, this commanding ſpirit he hath conferred vpon you, ſhould bee maſter of all others.

               <p>IN this generall calme of the State, (wherein the affaires of this Kingdome ſeeme to be aſleepe, and the Worlds
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3669:97"/>
occurrents to be at a ſtand) all <hi>France</hi> expects your preſence at Court, to be the Authour of the deſired Newes, and to draw from the Kings breaſt the good intentions wherewith it is ſo richly ſtored. The reduction of <hi>Bearn</hi> not ſtayned with any drop of bloud: the truth wherein you haue inſtructed all men, concerning the poſſibility of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Rochell,</hi> and the order you haue now lately left in <hi>Guiene,</hi> where you haue reduced the Factions to ſuch a point, as their only power conſiſteth in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe humours; putteth vs in hope, that if God ſhould deferre the ſafety of our State till another Age, it could bee no man (your ſelfe excepted) for whom hee hath reſerued ſo glorious an Enterpriſe. My Lord, it is certaine he neuer ſhewed more miracles in thoſe places himſelfe hath conſecrated to his glory and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Piety, and which he hath choſen on purpoſe there to manifeſt his power, then he hath done in your perſon. And
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3669:97"/>
when I conſider how often he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected you, contrary to all humane ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and the oppoſition you haue encountred, in arriuing to this hight by ſo many rockes and precipices; <hi>I</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conſtantly belecue you haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerpaſſed the time of dying; and that for the Worlds generall good, it is fitting you indure as long as the Sunne or Stars. To ſtop here, were to praiſe you imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and onely to make it appeare you are able to affoord long ſeruices. <hi>I</hi> will therefore ſay more: on which ſide ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I turne mine eyes, be it that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey them beyond the Seas, or make them paſſe thoſe Mountaines which ſeparate vs from our neighbours, I finde not that perſon in any place, who can iuſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for glory with you; or whoſe life is ſo illuſtrious as yours. I haue ſeriouſly conſidered all whatſoeuer might giue value or reputation to the Courts of ſtranger Princes, and there truely <hi>I</hi> find men who are well ſeene in Military
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3669:98"/>
affaires, and who haue gained to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues no ſmall experience by meanes of an infinity of rules and maximes: But the difference betweene thoſe men and your ſelfe, is, that they cannot ſtirre, nor make themſelues awfull without the <hi>Jndies,</hi> Armies, and Cannons; whereas you are redoubtable all alone, and vnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; yea, your very ſtilneſſe terrifieth the greateſt enemies of <hi>France.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely true (as no man can doubt) it is high time the King doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally make vſe of a man whom the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his ſtate requireth of him, and that he no longer imploy thoſe improſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous perſons, vnder whoſe hands op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities waxe old, and his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will faile him. It is ſufficient that the <hi>Rhyne</hi> and <hi>Alpes</hi> haue formerly beene <hi>French,</hi> and that our Language is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in neighbouring Prouinces, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering a ſtrange kind of people ſtil to remaine in the very bowels of our Kingdome, who will not allow of our
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3669:98"/>
ancient Lawes. There is now no longer meanes to couer thisskarre which diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth the face of State, or to ſuffer that Rebellion and loyalty liue together. To ſpeake truth, what kind correſpondency can be expected betweene the Miſtreſle of the houſe, and the Concubine? what a monſtrous production would that proue betweene a Monarchy and a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gouernment? and what kind of Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne ſhould hee be, who were depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on his ſubiects, and his Councell ſubordinate to the Towne-houſe? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if Catholickes ſhould demand Cities of the King, proportionable to their number, as others doe, he ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced hence-forward to remaine all his life time at <hi>Fountaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>bleau</hi> and S. <hi>Germins:</hi> nor would there remaine vnto him any more then the bare title of a King, and the common fields of his Countrey. But it ſhall not alwaies be ſo if predictions proue true: And Reaſon as well as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requireth that things ſhould bee
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3669:99"/>
reduced to their ancient forme. It were no leſſe then to iniure him who hath promiſed to <hi>France</hi> a longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance then to all her diſeaſes, to thinke that hee hauing giuen remedies againſt the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> hee will ſuffer it to dye at this day by the hands of a ſmall packe of Rebels: Prouided, that face which I rather call immortall, then anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, doe ſtill aſſure vs of the great ſource of life you retaine in your coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious heart, and that Heauen pleaſe to preſerue for the worlds benefit, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it conferred vpon vs at your Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; we require not a more certayne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the end of our euils; nor is there any ſo ſicke or far ſtrucken in yeares, who hopeth not to ſuruiue theſe inteſtine troubles: But we are not to imagine that Victory and Peace are two oppoſite things, though they be different; for it is the one which aſſureth the other, and ſetleth it in ſtate not to be any further either troubled or threatned by any.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3669:99"/>
When all is done, I finde it were much to oblige theſe malecontents, to giue a ſure repoſe to their diſtruſtfull ſpirits, and at once to ridde them of all their hopes and feares: when they ſhall no longer need to trouble themſelues with making aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and that their liues ſhalbe free from the feare of puniſhments. When <hi>I</hi> ſay both they and we ſhall enioy common ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is not to be doubted but their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be much bettered, it being a much fairer fortune to be caſt on ſhore by a ſtorme in a craiſed Veſſell, then to be ſtill in the power of Windes and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackes. The word of Kings ought not to contradict the functions of Regality, nor can they oblige themſelues to leaue their Subiects in miſerable eſtate, or to doecontrary to what they ought. And in conſcience ſince the ruine of Rebellion is written in <hi>Heauen,</hi> in the ſame ſort as is the Day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> and the Worlds diſſolution; were it not as much as to reſiſt Gods will, and to oppugne his prouidence,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3669:100"/>
ſhould we ſo ſoone grow weary of well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or refuſe to finiſh a worke, the euent whereof is infalliable? There is nothing ſo eaſie for a great <hi>Prince,</hi> as either to finde or conceiue faults, nor doth any man doubt that diſſimulation is iuſt, when it rends to the aduantage and auayle of the deceiued. If a mad man were capable of remedies, were it not lawfull to cure him without asking his conſent? were it fit a Father ſhould ſuffer his Son to be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for feare of pulling him out by the haire? Are we to ſuffer the State to periſh, for that we cannot preferue it by ordinary wayes? No (my Lord) we ought not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no conſideration can cauſe that thing to change its nature, which of it ſelfe is iuſt; and the Lawes of neceſſity doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with vs for thoſe of formality. Now to returne to my firſt diſcourſe, and to what particularly regardeth your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſeeing your abſence from Court hath at all times threatned more miſeries vnto vs, then the apparition of Comets and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3669:100"/>
other irregularities in Nature, and ſince to be miſerable, it is ſufficient to be at odds with you. There is not any of your enemies can eſcape the <hi>Diuine iuſtice,</hi> nor is there any doubt, but you will generally finde all thoſe ſpirits fauourable vnto you, whom you haue formerly conuinced; or that your propoſitions ſhall not be receiued as aſſured Conqueſts. The beſt is, there are now no more any vſurpers neare the <hi>King,</hi> who ſeeke to ingroſſe his fauours to their owne aduantages, &amp; bereaue men of thoſe benefits which ought to be as common to them as the Fire or Ayre. His Maieſties heart is open to all his Subiects, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues trueth at what hand ſoeuer it comes vnto him. This being ſo (my Lord) may wee not reſt confident you ſhall not loſe one word, and that your Vertue whereof the World is vncapable, ſhall at length be found the onely meanes the King hath to redreſſe and re-eſtabliſh his affaires. Neither time, trauaile, nor coſt, ought diuert him from this deſigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:3669:101"/>
It is a worke will be nothing ſo coſtly as to raiſe a Fauorite, and it being a thing all <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> exacteth of him, as an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary debt the King his Father hath left to be diſcharged. And truely, it is moſt certaine that the face of States hath beene changed, and whole Prouinces conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with leſſe coſt then diuers <hi>Pagan Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> haue imployed in erecting of <hi>Idols<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3669:102"/>
concerning the continuance of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Warres,</hi> you iudge it expedient for the good of your ſeruice, I ſhould not (as yet) leaue this Frontire. Whereunto <hi>Sir, I</hi> can giue your Maieſty no other anſwer, but that hauing at all times gathered out of your commands, what my duty obliged me vnto, and hauing neuer propoſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end to my actions, then the good of your ſtate, I ſhould be carefull of ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that deſigne in an occaſion wherein <hi>J</hi> might imagine your ſeruice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on my obedience. But at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>(Sir)</hi> the tranquility of <hi>France</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be ſo generall, your affaires ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully eſtabliſhed, and the Honour of your <hi>Amity</hi> ſo precious among all your neighbouring Princes; that as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this Kingdome which doth not bend vnder your Authority; ſo is there not any <hi>Prince</hi> abroad, who doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect your power, or who conſerueth not himſelfe by your Iuſtice. And as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the troubles of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> beſides, that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3669:102"/>
time hath euaporated the firſt heat of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and that they begin to retire from thoſe extreamities wherein formerly they inuolued themſelues: the imagined dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is ſo farre remoued hence, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceiue the leaſt apprehenſion, euen for thoſe who are not our next neighbours that way. It is certaine <hi>(Sir)</hi> that on this ſide the <hi>Rhine</hi> all things ſeeme to bee at reſt vnder the ſhade of your State, and the ancient Allies of this Crowne who are neareſt any danger, expect the end of Warre with our fearing it ſhould come any further towards them, or that out of all this noyſe, there will ariſe any more then one Warre.

be ſo impartiall as to be pleaſed to reflect vpon the neceſſity of my particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that ſuffering me to retire my ſelfe to my owne houſe, you will at leaſt permit mee to enioy a fauour, vſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on others as a puniſhment. I doubt not <hi>(Sir)</hi> but you will condiſcend to the deſire I haue to vndertake this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and I preſume you will be pleaſed to conſider, that <hi>I</hi> being ingaged in two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crownes for your ſeruice; after the ſight of your royall bounty in all ſorts of hands, it were ſmall reaſon (I receiuing nothing) ſhould ſtill in this place ſtand as a meere cypher for the honor of <hi>France;</hi> or that I ruine my ſelfe with a rich ſhew, only to continue <hi>ſtrangers</hi> in the opinion they haue of the magnificent greatneſſe of your Crowne. Yet <hi>(Sir)</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neuer beleeued <hi>J</hi> could ſuſtayne any great detriment by the loſſe of a thing <hi>J</hi> ſo ſlightly eſteeme, as <hi>I</hi> do worldly ſubſtance, <hi>I</hi> intend not in this place to complayne of my pouerty: But (to ſpeake truth) ſince all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3669:103"/>
my words and actions are by many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted; and that hauing affoorded my dutifull attendance to the ſeruice of three great <hi>Kings,</hi> I yet find much difficulty to defend my ſo long a loyalty agaynſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny: I am with much ſorrow conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſay, that if <hi>I</hi> ſtood firme in my duty, euen when diſobedience was Crowned with rewards; and haue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned your Authority, when by ſome it was abuſed, by others contemned: It is no ſmall iujury to me, to imagine I wil now begin to fayle in my loyalty at this age wherein I am, or ſuffer my ſelfe to be reproached by poſterity, whereto I ſtudy to annexe the laſt actions of my life. But <hi>I</hi> ſee well (Sir) it is long ſince the hatred of diſhoneſt <hi>French-men</hi> hath beene fatall vnto me, and that it hath beene borne with mee inſeparably. From the firſt houre I appeared in the World, there was neuer either peace or truce vnuiolated to my preiudice; and as though <hi>I</hi> were excepted out of all
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3669:104"/>
treaties, though Warre be ended, yet that made againſt me endureth. At this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (Sir) it ſufficeth not <hi>I</hi> performe my charge without omitting or forgetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing due to your ſeruice; or that the innocency of my actions be generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; but I am driuen to thoſe ſtreights, as to be forced to giue account of my very thoughts, there being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny (my ſelfe excepted) from whom ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is required for the fault hee hath not as yet committed. If wee liued in a Countrey where vertue were auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as not concurrent with the times, or aduerſe to the State, and where a great reputation were more dangerous then an inglorious one, <hi>I</hi> ſhould not neede to make much ſearch for the cauſe of my misfortunes: but I well know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you vſe, hath more honourable and honeſt grounds, and that your Maieſty hath no pretention to reigne with more aſſurance then the King your Father did before you. It is from him (Sir) you

ſuch deſignes, the euent whereof would haue ſufficiently commended the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had they not beene diſaduantagious vnto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I haue contented my ſelfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie to all <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> had reſpect to your authority euen in the hands of mine enemies: whereby <hi>(Sir) I</hi> truſt <hi>I</hi> haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my actions to appeare ſo pure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted before your Maieſty, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine fully ſatisfied; nor will you I hope iudge I haue erred, in following a cauſe <hi>J</hi> might probably ſuppoſe could not be well ſeparated from yours. Now therefore ſince it hath pleaſed your Maieſty to ſupply what ſeemed deficient in the felicity of your Reigne, and to ſettle peace in your State: All your true ſubiects <hi>(Sir)</hi> are by ſo much the more obliged to rely on your Royall word; in that it is the rocke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> reſts confident: And the ſame hauing beene giuen to the <hi>Queene</hi> your Mother, beſides your obligation thereto by <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> your very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation confirmeth the ſame vnto her

propitious to my Lord your Fathers Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. To be diffident the concluſion will not correſpond to theſe faire beginnings: were either to make doubt of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or to diſtruſt his Grace; but it hath pleaſed his <hi>Diuine Maieſty</hi> at all times to take ſo particular care for the conſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Family, that he will as ſoone permit his Altars and Images to be irreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently intreated, as perſons who are ſo high in his fauour as all of you are. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it happen (my Lord) if none but the proſperous can loſe by altorations; you will, I hope, confeſſe no ſuch change can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way happen, whereout wee ſhall not draw ſome aduantage; and what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations ſoeuer they giue to my Lord your Fathers intentions, yet will all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men iudge fauourably thereof, nor will any man apprehend failing after ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent an example. All <hi>France</hi> attends his reſolution to be rightly informed in the truth of the Kings affaires, and all men know he is of ſuch conſideration in this
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3669:111"/>
State, as his leaſt diſcontentments are to bee reckoned among publicke miſeries. I will perſwade my ſelfe they will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to any extreamity, and that there is not impudency enough in our Enemies to tranſport them to ſo dangerous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. If the worſt come, yet muſt this voyage neceſſarily produce the one of two things, equally neceſſary in a troubleſome time, Warre or Liberty. <hi>J</hi> am not ſo cleare ſighted in future euents, as to anſwere for what ſhall happen; yet ſince the order of ſeaſons are framed to facilitate our paſſage, and that all things haue chanſed more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſfully vnto vs then we preſumed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; there is ſmall appearance that <hi>Heauen</hi> will declare it ſelfe in fauour of the leſſe ſupportable cauſe. But that which doth the rather fortifie my confidence, is the vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate wherein I finde my Lord your Father, he hath no ſhew of old age, ſaue onely experience and authority. The late <hi>Ligue,</hi> the Rebels, the Sword, nor Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon haue not beene of power to kill him,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3669:111"/>
nor was there euer man ſo awfull in his aduerſe fortune. As for you (my Lord) who are the obiect of his hopes and feares; &amp; who are to performe one of the principall parts in his deſigned action: remember you haue the command of a<note place="margin">The City of <hi>Mets.</hi>
                  </note> place which hath beene the diſhonour of <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and which affoordeth <hi>France</hi> a reuenge for all the affronts he offered thereto. He who defended it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him had no more then two armes as you haue, and one ſingle life, nor was hee madé of any other matter then other men are. It is true, he fought by the Kings ſuccours, but it ſufficeth you fight for his ſeruice, and that all men know you are reſolued not to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue your fortunes. Were you borne to performe ordinary actions, I ſhould hold it fit to ſpeake vnto you in another ſtraine, but ſince you purpoſe not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any idle dignity in this world, nor are at this preſent in caſe to make vſe of the hands of a great Army, or expect

reputation in your bed; ſpeake as high as you pleaſe, prouided you act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; and that out of your particular forces (ſince thoſe of the State faile you) you make good vnto the King, the laſt conqueſt of his Anceſtors.

               <p>SInce it appeares you haue a will to loſe euery hour what you can in truth ſpend but once, and that you ſo ſlightly eſteeme your life, as though it were another mans; me thinkes the Warre hath dealt very kindly with you, in being contented to leaue you halfe a face, and that you may well account what is left, as gotten goods. The Duke <hi>de Mayne,</hi> and the reſt were not quit at ſo eaſie a rate: and it hath pleaſed God to ſhew examples in this kinde, to make it appeare that he approoueth not vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nor that he needeth the aduiſe of men for the defence of his owne and his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:3669:113"/>
Churches cauſe. Truely, if theſe men had practiſed with the enemy, they could not haue beene more confident; nor haue gone more naked to Warre, had they fought againſt women: And in truth <hi>I</hi> am ſo farre from praiſing their deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate courſes, as <hi>I</hi> doe not ſo much as pardon them their deathes; and if my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion had paſſed, I ſhould haue thought it fit to haue accuſed them as culpable of their owne deathes, and as ſuch who had committed the greateſt Parricides. It becomes mee ill in this place to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe rules to my Maſter; for ſhould <hi>I</hi> attempt to tech your courage how farre it ſhould extend it ſelfe, I might ſeeme to doe no leſſe then preſcribe lawes to what is illimitable. Yet bee pleaſed (I pray you) to be informed, that valour is ſo tender and delicate a vertue, that if it be not ſometimes well ſhielded and conſerued by ſome others, it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more hurtfull to him who hath it, then healthfull for the State, often
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3669:113"/>
endamaged by it, or to the Prince who maketh vſe thereof. And ſurely without the aſſiſtance of Reaſon, which ought to be its Gouernneſſe, and Prudence as a guide vnto it: there is not any paſſion more blinde, nor which doth leſſe differ from the fury of Beaſts, and the bruitiſh ferocity of Barbarians: The latter of theſe thinke it cowardiſe to quit the place, though the breach of a Riuer rowle vpon them; or not to ſtand firme though they ſee a houſe falling on their heads. But theſe wretches, and wee, haue not the ſame pretentions; for as they propound to themſelues, onely to kill, and to die, ſo ſhould we onely aime at victory, and neglect the reſt; otherwiſe to what end is the knowledge of Vertue vnto vs, and of the limits which boundeth it, or to be borne vnder a more happy Climate, then that of <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Muſcouia:</hi> if we draw no aduantage either from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our inſtitutions or extractions; <hi>I</hi> doe not at all wonder, why there are
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3669:114"/>
men who preferre death before indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and who not finding any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their owne Countries, are well pleaſed to paſſe beyond the Ice of their naturall ayre, as willing to forgoe the infelicity of their fortunes. But a man of worth, who at all houres inioyeth both perfect and pure contents, and who hath a great ſhare of this Ages ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to loſe, is a Traytour to the Publick, and a Tyrant to himſelfe, if he forſake all this for a meere fancy, and depriue the world thereof onely for a flaſh of Fame and vaine Glory. You know this better then I can tell it you, and if you ſuppoſe the Philoſophy you haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſo highly eſteemed, be yet wiſe enough to inſtruct you, ſhee will tell you that Life is the ground-worke of all other good that can here befall vs; ſince by meanes therof one may recouer King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes though vtterly loſt, and remaine Victor, after hauing beene defeated in foure battailes. There is no queſtion
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3669:114"/>

Reioyce therefore (good Sir) together with Nature: in that you are as yet in the number of men; and comfort your ſelfe with <hi>Haniball,</hi> and the Father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, for the loſſe you haue receiued: whatſoeuer you can ſay, you haue yet ſight enough to cauſe you to turne loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, and to contemplate the beauties of Heauen and Earth. But ſuppoſe you were wholy blinde, yet is it true, that the Night hath its pleaſures as well as the Day, yea and ſuch as you beſt loue.</p>

               <head type="sub">LETTER III.</head>
               <p>MY deare <hi>Hidaſpe,</hi> thou canſt not imagine the content <hi>I</hi> take in thy Letter, and in the good newes it brings me, it is the onely way to cauſe me to contradict my ſelfe, when <hi>I</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my eſtate miſerable, ſince I heare thou art in health, and loueſt me. Were I not confident thereof, <hi>I</hi> ſhould the next day drinke poyſon; or if not valiant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to attempt ſo hardy an enterpriſe, <hi>I</hi> ſhould dye with ſorrow. Thou art (then) as neceſſary for my liuing as life it ſelfe; ſo as if thou deſireſt my eſtate, thou needeſt not for that any other meanes, then to depriue me of thy good opinion: But truely I neuer had the leaſt apprehenſion of ſuch a loſſe, and <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:3669:115"/>
aſſure my ſelfe if <hi>J</hi> were dead, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be double as rich as thou deſireſt to be. <hi>I</hi> haue long ſince beene aſſured, thy thoughts are not inthralled to the earth, or that thy paſſions onely exceede thoſe of the vulgar. Let me intreat thee to cheriſh them my deare <hi>Hydaſpe;</hi> and though I be continually ſad, and at all times ill affected in my health; yet remember that the very rauings of my <hi>Feauer</hi> are ſometimes more prizeable then <hi>Philoſophicall</hi> meditations; and we ſee beautifull faces often weepe ſo gracefully, that ſome haue beene enamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of their teares. I haue fully acquainted thee with our occurrents here, by my laſt <hi>Letters,</hi> nor will I let any opportunity paſſe without giuing my ſelfe the content of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with thee in that kind; binde me ſo much vnto thee, as to doe the like on thy part: But if thy <hi>Letters</hi> be ſo ſhort, as vſually they are, I will now betimes tell thee, <hi>I</hi> will read them ſo often, as they ſhall become long enough in ſpite of thee. I know well how in the place where thou
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3669:116"/>
art, thou oughteſt not loſe any minute of time; ſince opportunities laſt no longer; and reſolue thy ſelfe to take a thouſand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable iournies to thy <hi>Lords</hi> Chamber, before thou makeſt one to purpoſe. Great men vſe not to keepe Regiſters of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor remembrancers of them they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually forget: but rather to the contrary; they imagining there is no other thing on earth but themſelues, and what concernes them: (prouided, they finde any who looke like men) they neuer trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to enquire for others, ſince with them aſſiduity often workes more then ſeruice; yea, and thoſe whom they would not affect for merit, they will loue by cuſtome: It is therefore neceſſary you be ſtill in ſight, and alwayes at hand for the entertainment of <hi>Fortune:</hi> It is a tradition the ſubtle <hi>Gaſcoynes</hi> at their deathes leaue to their Children: and truely as choler aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth Armes out of whatſoeuer it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters; ſo is it true, that occaſion taketh hold of all ſuch as preſent themſelues. We
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3669:116"/>
ought to contract perfect loue with honeſt men, but yet not to be at oddes with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Poyſons themſelues are neceſſary in ſome caſes; and ſince we are forced to liue among ſauage creatures, wee had neede haue the induſtry either to familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe or force them. I aduiſe thee not to looke before thee, behinde thee, and on euery ſide when thou ſpeakeſt; or to be in ſo great feare to be taken at thy word, as thou dareſt not tell what a Clocke it is if one askes thee. Thou ſhalt gaine much by being ſilent, the dumbe ſhall at all times therein exceede thee: For my part, I neuer make queſtion of ſpeaking, when I haue any thing in my head better then ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>I</hi> doe not hereby meane that wee ought to diſcouer our intentions by our lookes, or that our interiour concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appeare outwardly with all their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, namely, of feare, hatred, or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This were to betray our ſelues, and to giue ill example to others. But herein you are to make election of place, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3669:117"/>
perſons, and not wilfully to depriue thy ſelfe of the moſt pleaſing fruite of mans life, there being not any, in whoſe breaſt we may ſecurely depoſite either our griefes or ioyes. Beſides, I would not haue thee of that <hi>Spaniards</hi> humour, who tooke for his deuice <hi>Que fi que no;</hi> but conſider with thy ſelfe that Reaſon is a ſacred thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereto thou art to yeeld, where euer it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares. I confeſſe that moſt things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolued in vncertainties, and that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Sciences haue very ſlender and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine foundations; yet are there ſome truths ſo perſpicuous, and ſo abſolutely receiued into the Worlds approbation, as it were no leſſe then to lacke common ſenſe, to call them into queſtion; for hee who ſhould ſay, my Lord the Conſtable <hi>d'Eſdiguieres</hi> were not valiant, or my Lord the Cardinall of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> were not a man of able parts: doubtleſſe all men would wonder at him, as at one who ſought to introduce ſome new Sect, or indeauour to ouerthrow the fundamentall <hi>Lawes</hi> of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3669:117"/>
the Kingdome. Nay, I tell you yet more; you are piouſly to beleeue diuers ſots to be ſufficient men, ſince the World will haue it ſo; and that Kings are not the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men who deſire complaſency; ſince if we meane to liue among others, we muſt ſometimes neceſſarily flatter, and frame our ſelues to their opinions Let vs then follow the iudgement of the wiſe, and the cuſtomes of the vulgar; let vs keepe our thoughts to our ſelues, and allow them our actions and out-ſides. As <hi>J</hi> haue adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thee not to be ouer ſilent, ſo would <hi>I</hi> not haue thee ouer talkatiue, nor to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry any one with thy diſcourſe of <hi>Mountau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> or the exploits thou haſt there ſeene performed. I aſſure thee to auoyde the company of theſe boaſting companions; I would take poſte, goe to Sea, or fly to the Worlds end. They ſeeme to me to haue gotten a patent for prating, and that it were no leſſe then to take their purſe, if one ſhould offer to ſpeake a word in their preſence: But aboue all, it is very death
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3669:118"/>
to me, when theſe fellowes come freſh out of <hi>Holland,</hi> or when they begin to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> From <hi>Millan</hi> to <hi>Sienna I</hi> was haunted with one of theſe Chapmen; whoſe company I ſhall ſo long as I haue life, reckon among my greateſt misfortunes. Hee would needes reforme all the fortifications of thoſe ſtrong places wee paſſed by; bee trode on no earth at which he carped not, nor trauailed ouer any Mountaine, on which hee had not ſome deſigne; he ſet vpon all the Citties in the Dukedome of <hi>Florence;</hi> he deſired one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a certaine ſhort prefixed time, to take in all the States of <hi>Medena, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin:</hi> yea, I had much adoe to draw him from caſting his deſignes vpon the lands of the Church, and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony. Theſe be diſeaſes the roots whereof are not to be cut vp, without taking away the tongue withall: Nay, <hi>J</hi> feare when all this is done, there will be yet neede to paſſe further into the cure, and to vſe meanes to bereaue them of voyce, for the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3669:118"/>
generall good of ſuch as can heare. There is yet another ſort of importunate people, whoſe number doth ſo multiply in <hi>France,</hi> it is almoſt arriued to an infinity: Theſe haue not one halfe houres intertainement for thee, without telling thee the King is rayſing puiſſant forces; how ſuch a one is out of credit with his faction; another is a great ſearcher into, and medler in State-matters, and how a third diueth into all the intricacies of Court-buſineſſes. If you can haue the patience to heare them yet a while longer, you ſhall ſtraite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how the Preſident <hi>Iannin</hi> was the man who had the trueſt intentions of all the miniſters of <hi>Juſtice:</hi> That it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to ſhew a Maſter-peece of <hi>State,</hi> to giue reputation to the preſent current of affaires: That the Kings authority was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in this action: and that thoſe who ſought to cry downe the preſent gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rather aimed at their particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages, then redreſſe of diſorders. See here the ſtyle wherewith they perſecute
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3669:119"/>
me euen to my poore Village, and which is a cauſe <hi>I</hi> loath State, and publique af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. Tyre not therefore my eares at thine arriuall, leſt you turne mine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary with intention to aſſault mee with theſe huge words. If you know not that theſe follies haue not alwayes the ſame aſpect, and that there are as well ſerious follies, as ſlight ones, I would admoniſh thee in this place: Now though a man at twenty can haue no great experience of the World, yet haue you a ſufficient cleare iudgement to keepe your ſelfe from being deluded, by the apparance of good, or by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward luſter of euill. I had neede of more time then the bearer allowes mee, and of more words then a Letter is cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of, ſufficiently to inſtruct thee what thou oughteſt to doe, and what to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide; or to learne thee a Science wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelfe doe ſtudy in teaching thee. <hi>I</hi> will therefore onely ſay, ſince I am haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make an end, that before all other
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3669:119"/>
things thou art to offer thy whole will to God, if thou beeſt not able to giue the reſt; and to haue (at leaſt) good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, if it be not as yet in thy power to doe any good deeds. I well know it is no ſlender taske, to vndertake to guard our ſelues from euill, where intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are extraordinary, and the danger extreame, and where (thou wilt tell me) that if God will hinder thee from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beauty, he had neede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> make thee blind. <hi>I</hi> hauing no pleaſing anſwer to make thee hereto my deare <hi>Hydaſpe,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thee to thy Confeſſor: intreating thee to conſider, how if the King in the flower of his age wherein wee ſee him, and in the midſt of an infinity of obiects offering themſelues to giue him content, is yet notwithſtanding ſo firme in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to vertue, that he as eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all voluptuous irregularities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he doth his moſt violent rebels, and is not any way acquainted with forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pleaſures, nor doth glut himſelfe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:3669:120"/>
euen with lawfull ones: If as I ſay, this truth bee generally auowed, I beſeech thee tell me why continency may not be placed among things poſſible? But I much feare, there is no meanes to gaine this for granted at thy hands; ſince thou beleeueſt as others doe, that to be chaſte, were no leſſe then to vſurpe vpon the poſſeſſion of married Wiues. Yet at the leaſt <hi>Hydaſpe,</hi> if this body of thine, being of ſufficient ability to ſend Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies into each corner of the World, and to people the moſt deſart places, will needes be imployed; I intreate thee to ſtay there, without being tranſported with the debauches of the mouth, which haue no other limits then the loſſe of reaſon, and ruine of health. I ſhould be in vtter deſpaire were it told me, that my brother drinkes as much as though hee were in a continuall <hi>Feauer,</hi> and were as great a purueyer for his panch, as if hee were to enter into a beſieged City. <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe thy inclination doth of it ſelfe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3669:120"/>
ſufficiently diuert thee from theſe <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> vertues, and that thou art not much leſſe ſober then my ſelfe, who haue paſſed ouer three yeares without ſuppers, and who would willingly feed onely vpon Fennill and picktoothes, if I thought I could thereby recouer health. Yet truely this doth not hinder me from hauing ſome apprehenſion, when <hi>I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the examples of great ones doth often giue authority to vice: and that to keepe our ſelues vpright in the midſt of corruption, is not an effect of the ordinary force of men: Conſider then once againe <hi>(Hydaſpe)</hi> that we are powerfully to reſiſt temptations. Haue an eye to the intereſt thou haſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneithy ſelfe within the limits of an orderly life; and be well aduiſed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou couldſt be contented to be of the proportion of thoſe good fellowes, whoſe ſpirits are choaked in their owne greaſe, and who become ſuch comely creatures, that if their bodies were
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3669:121"/>
pierced, there would nothing paſſe forth of their wounds but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wine and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge. Beſides, making profeſſion as thou doſt, to be a man of thy word, be not offended if <hi>I</hi> ſummon thee to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue what thou haſt promiſed mee: or that <hi>I</hi> freely tell thee, that if thou fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt againe to the old game, I ſhall haue ſmall ſubiect to aſſure my ſelfe of thy fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in other thy former promiſes. Wert thou the King of the <hi>Indies,</hi> or thy life endleſſe, I would not forbid thee this exerciſe; but ſince wee haue ſcarce leaſure enough in this world to attayne vertue, nor ouer great poſſeſſions to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vs from pouerty; beleeue me <hi>Hydaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi> it is very dangerous to ſuffer ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke on ſhoare; and beſides, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of money, (which wee eſteeme as deare vnto vs as life) to loſe our ſences likewiſe, and our time, the laſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is irrecouerable, is both ſhamefull and ſinfull; hauing here admoniſhed thee well neere, though confuſedly and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3669:121"/>
ſcatteredly of thoſe things thou oughteſt to flye, it were requiſite <hi>I</hi> ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aduiſe thee of what were fit for thee to follow, and to cauſe if <hi>I</hi> could, good lawes to ariſe out of euill manners. But it is fit to take time to deliberate vpon a matter of ſuch importance, and truely to ſpeake herein to purpoſe, all the wit <hi>I</hi> haue, ioyned with that of others, were no more then ſufficient.</p>

               <p>MY deare <hi>Hidaſpe,</hi> if God had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a Kingdome vpon me, with condition not to haue mee ſleepe more then <hi>I</hi> doe: I ſhould prooue the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3669:122"/>
moſt vigilant Prince liuing, nor ſhould I neéde either Guards or Sentinels about my perſon. Surely there is not any (my ſelfe excepted) for whom Night was not made, ſince when the windes are calme, and all Nature quiet, <hi>I</hi> alone watch with the Starres. But I much feare leſt God will not be ſatisfied herewith, ſince <hi>I</hi> fore-ſee ſo many miſeries ready to rowle vpon me, as I haue no ſmall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion to become more wretched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, then I am at this preſent. The onely countenance of <hi>Hydaſpe</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh mee, and cauſe my paine to be in ſome ſort pleaſing. But fince there are now at leaſt a dozen great Cities, and a hundred Leagues of Snow betweene vs, <hi>I</hi> haue much adoe to forbeare dying, and to ſupport my ſelfe vpon my weakeſt part. Yet my meaning is not to haue thee returne hither; for (were it poſſible for me) I had much rather come to thee, and continually to gaze on that face whereof I haue drawne ſo many faire purtraicts.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3669:122"/>
It is true, there are few men liuing, whoſe loue we ſhould preferre before li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But aſſure thy ſelfe thy Maſter is of thoſe; be not therefore more proud then <hi>Henry</hi> the third, who firſt obeyed him. For my part, though <hi>I</hi> be natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refractory, yet haue <hi>I</hi> euer had a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all inclination to his ſeruice, yea, when all things went croſſe with him, and that his beſt Friends forſooke him, I tooke pleaſure in periſhing, on purpoſe to affoord him ſome conſolation in his calamities. Many deſire a dependency on him out of their particular ends but me thinkes we ſhould haue more noble deſignes, ſince his onely vertue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to be followed, and to cauſe a preſſe whereſoeuer it paſſeth. In truth, the ſeruice we yeeld to ſo great a perſon, ought to hold the ranke of the chiefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences we are to expect; vet after this, there followeth another ſeldome fayling any of good parts, yea, or thoſe who haue but patience. If thou beeſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3669:123"/>
of the one, or other ſort of ſuch men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this maxime; and doe not as thoſe honeſt perſons, who thinke they doe good ſeruice to the State, when they betray their Maſters. Beaſts themſelues are capeable of acknowledgement; and that <hi>Italian</hi> had ſome ſmall ſhew of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who called thoſe Diuels, who cured Agues, good Angels. Yet truely it is no leſſe then to be ouer mannerly to goe ſo farre, nor would I thanke Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for thoſe gracious fauours I indeede receiue from him onely. But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſt of worldly affaires, there is no queſtion, but wee are to reflect vpon the neareſt occaſions Fortune affoordeth vs; and thoſe who ſeeke after more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote meanes, ſhall in concluſion finde from one degree to another, that it is to <hi>Hugh Capete</hi> to whom they are obliged. <hi>I</hi> was affraid leſt I ſhould have left my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers vpon this paper, and haue diſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled my ſelfe for euer writing more Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters after this, had <hi>I</hi> any longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

               <p>SInce the dead neuer returne but they affright vs: I was perſwaded I ſhould doe you no ſmall pleaſure, nor a little oblige you, in forbearing to appeare ſo much as on Paper before you, ſuffering you purely to enioy your accuſtomed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, without the mixture of any thing that might be diſtaſtefull vnto you. But ſince at this preſent you come to diſturbe the quiet of Church-yards, and to finde out a man, in affecting whoſe memory you might well be ſatisfied; I am forced to tell you, that the party you ſo highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, is wholy remaining beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and how this is onely his Ghoſt lately returned into <hi>France.</hi> I breake all
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3669:126"/>
the Looking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>glaſſes I meete with, I blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water of all Riuers I croſſe, I auoid the ſight of all Paynters in any place where I come, leſt they ſhew me the patterne of my pale viſage. Yet if in the crazy caſe wherein I am, <hi>J</hi> were any way capeable of conſolation, <hi>I</hi> beſeech you to be aſſured, I ſhould take it as proceeding from the good ſucceſſe of your affaires, nor would I deſire of my diſeaſe any long reſpite, then what were requiſite to reioyce with you. But truely, it is an enemy who knowes not how to admit of conditions of peace or truce, and I am ſo happy as not to be ſuffered to quit my paines to reſume them. The meate I here eate for ſuſtenance, is to me as pleaſing as poyſon, and <hi>I</hi> endure life out of pennance, whereas you (in the place where you liue) ſpend the remainder of the <hi>Golden age,</hi> refuſing nothing to your ſences you lawfully may allow them. Though the Queenes Court be ſo chaſte, as it were eaſier to drinke drunk of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, then to take any diſhoneſt pleaſures
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3669:127"/>
thene; and that to gaine admittance, it is requiſite to be firſt purified at the Porters lodge; yet are you allowed euen there to haue pleaſing temptations, and going elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to ſeeke out more ſolide content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But as for me in the caſe <hi>I</hi> am, I make no difference at all betweene louely creatures, and well limmed pictures: and the miſery <hi>I</hi> endure, hauing bereaued me of action, my wretched vertue is as much conſtrayned, as the ſobriety of the poore is neceſſary. In all this <hi>I</hi> adde not one word to the bare truth; and if the Counte of <hi>Pountgibaut</hi> had his pardon to let you know how it is with me, he would tell you that I am more withered then the laſt yeares Roſes, and how all the Ingeniers in an Army, were no more then ſufficient to remoue me. But my diſcourſe will be more pleaſing, if I ſpeake of that Head which deſerueth to fill a Diadem, then in continuing this wretched complaint. When at the firſt I ſaw concurrent in him ſo much valour, and ſo great beauty, I
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3669:127"/>
neither tooke him for man nor Woman; but after hauing recollected my ſelfe, <hi>J</hi> ſuppoſed him to be the <hi>Amazonian</hi> Queene: and doubtleſle in the worlds infancy, it was to ſuch faces onely, whereto all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple yeelded willing obedience, none quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their ſeruice, euery mans duty being conformable to his inclination; ſo as the onely meanes then to be rebellious, was to beblinde. When this young Lord came to <hi>Rome</hi> at his returne from the battaile of <hi>Prague,</hi> I can well witneſſe the iealouſie he at once afforded both to men and their wiues, and of the great <hi>Prognoſtickes</hi> all ſuch gaue of him, who preſumed to haue any experience in future occurrents, either by the aſpect of Starres, or ſome more ſublime vnderſtanding: beſides, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how at twenty yeares of age, there is ſcarce any corner of the knowne world he hath not traced, to encounter honourable actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor any ſort of combate wherein for the moſt part he hath not beene Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour; that he hath borne Armes againſt
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3669:128"/>
                  <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Jnfidels,</hi> that he hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both in battailes and ſieges of Citties; that he hath giuen life to ſome enemies, and taken it from others. This (to ſpeake truth) is a thing God ſuffereth as rarely to be ſeene as deluges, and other great effects of his power or iuſtice. In a long proceſſe of time the meereſt Cowards may become Maiſters; were it by no other meanes, but that by ſeeing all men dye before them, they may inherit the whole world. Diuers likewiſe haue performed great exploits, who haue begun their actions either with groſſe errours, or meane aduentures. But as there are very few Riuers nauigable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from their firſt fountaines, nor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where the Sun fendeth forth his full heate from the very day-ſpring: ſo are ſuch men (doubtleſſe) very rare and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, who haue not any neede either of growth or yeares; nor are ſubiect either to the order of times, or rules of Nature. But <hi>I</hi> haue no purpoſe to folde vp a booke in a Letter: for though my griefe doe
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3669:128"/>
ſometimes permit mee to ſpend ſome ſmall time vpon pleaſing ſubiects, yet will it not allow me to make thereon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny long ſtay. <hi>I</hi> muſt therefore leaue off, during my ſhort good day, leſt <hi>I</hi> fall ſicke againe in your preſence, and once more clogge you with my complaints, inſteade of thanking you for your kinde remembrance, and aſſuring you of the great deſire <hi>I</hi> haue to remaine ſo long as <hi>I</hi> liue,</p>

confident of your excellent conſtitution, as I cannot imagine it can be endamaged by that contagious ayre: Surely if it be not in ſuch ſort infected, that birds fall downe dead, and that the Springs be not corrupted, you haue ſmall cauſe to feare; and I haue heretofore ſeene you of ſo perfect a compoſition, and ſo ſtrong a ſubſtance, that an ordinary infection <hi>(I</hi> ſuppoſe) is vnable to ſeaze vpon you: And rather then I will haue any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of your being carryed away with the current of thoſe who dye of this great mortality; I ſhall ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God reſerueth you to make the worlds Epitaph, and thoſe laſt Songs appointed for the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of all humane ioyes. Yet ere it come to this point, remember your promiſe, I pray you, and ſend me ſomething to rid me of the <hi>Megreme</hi> I haue taken in reading the ſotteries of theſe times. I cannot counterfeit the matter, but muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I taſte Verſes as I doe Mellons; ſo
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3669:131"/>
as if theſe two ſorts of Fruites haue not a reliſh neare approaching to perfection, I know not how to commend them though on the Kings Table, or in <hi>Homers</hi> workes. Whatſoeuer you doe, yet at the leaſt permit nothing to your ſpirit which may wound your reputation; and aboue all, let me intreate you not to bee the man who may iuſtly be taxed of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing violated the chaſtity of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, or for inſtructing the French in forraigne vices, vtterly vnknowne to their Predeceſſours. Poetry which God hath ſometimes made choice of, for the vttering of Oracles, and to vnfold his ſecrets to Mankinde, ought at the leaſt to be imployed in honeſt vſes: Nor is it a leſſe offence to make vſe thereof in vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters then to violate a Virgin. This I ſpeake vpon the ſubiect of our Friend, whoſe end I feare will hardly be naturall, if hee dye not the ſooner of his fourth Poxe. This is the ſecond time hee hath iſſued out of <hi>Paris</hi> by a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3669:132"/>
breach, hauing eſcaped as furious a flame as that of <hi>Troy.</hi> For my part, <hi>I</hi> cannot conceiue what ſhould be his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. For to warre againſt Heauen; beſides, that he ſhall be but ſlackly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied in ſuch an expedition, nor hath a hundred hands as it is ſayd of Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; he ought to vnderſtand, it was an action they could neuer atchieue: and how in <hi>Cicilia</hi> there are Mountaines yet ſmoaking with their Maſſacre. We come not into this world to preſcribe Lawes, but to ſubmit our ſelues to thoſe we find, and to content ourſelues with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our fore-fathers, as with their Land and Sunne. And truely, ſince in matters indifferent, nouelties are euer reprehenſible, and that our Kings quit not their Lillies to quarter <hi>Tulipans</hi> in their armes: by how much greater right are we obliged to conſerue the ancient, and fundamentall points of Religion, which are by ſo much the more pure in that by their antiquity they approach
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3669:132"/>
nearer to the Origine of things, and for that betweene them, and the beginning of all good, there is the leſſe time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to corruption. To ſpeake plainely, there is ſmall appearance that truth hath from the beginning of the world atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this man, on purpoſe to diſcouer it ſelfe vnto him in a Brothell or Tauerne; and to bee ſent forth of a mouth which comes ſhort in ſobriety to that of a <hi>Suiſse. I</hi> intend not to intermeddle with the Courts of Parliament, nor to preuent their Decrees by mine opinion: And to thinke to make this man more culpable then he is, were as much as to caſt Inke on an <hi>Ethiopians</hi> face; <hi>I</hi> owe ſo much to to the memory of our fore-paſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as I rather pitty him as a diſeaſed perſon, then purſue him as an enemy. I confeſſe he hath parts in him not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ill, nor doe I deny I haue much pleaſed my ſelfe with his freedome of ſpeech, ſo long as hee propoſed onely men for his obiect, and ſpared to ſpeake
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3669:133"/>
of holy things. But when <hi>I</hi> heard ſay, he exceeded the bounds of inferiour matters, and banded himſelfe euen a gainſt what is tranſcendent to Heauen, I inſtantly quitted all acquaintance with him, and thought the onely pleaſure <hi>I</hi> could doe him, was to pray to God to reſtore him to his right ſences, and to take pitty on him as he did of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who crucified our Sauiour. Hereafter <hi>I</hi> will be better aduiſed then to weary you with ſo long a diſcourſe, or to tyre my ſelfe in troubling you: But truely I thought <hi>I</hi> could doe no leſſe after three yeares ſilence, eſteeming this not to be ouer much for a man who is ſo ſlow a pay-maſter, for ſo many Letters hee ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you. Yet cannot I conclude, before I informe you of ſome particulars touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place where <hi>I</hi> am at this preſent, and of my imployments here. Firſt there is no day paſſeth wherein I ſee not the riſing and ſetting of the Sunne, and how during that time, I withdraw my
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3669:133"/>
ſelfe from all other diſtractions, to enioy the purity of that faire light. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here in this preſent ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I am, all the Courtſhip I vſe, and the onely ſubiection I oblige my ſelfe vnto. When I deſire to take the Ayre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>at other houres of the day, I muſt indeede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my eyes haue no obiects ſo vaſt as the Sea, or <hi>Appenines,</hi> nor doe I behold <hi>Rome</hi> vnder my feete as formerly I haue done: Yet doe I on all ſides diſcouer ſo pleaſing a proſpect, as though it fill not the capacity of my ſpirit ſo much as did the other, yet doth it farre more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent me. Painters come forty dayes iourneyes hence, to ſtudy in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and if Nature cauſe her greatneſſe to appeare, euen from the bottome of the deepeſt <hi>Abyſſes,</hi> and darkeſt downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals, ſhe hath no leſſe placed her rareſt perfections vnder my windowes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, I am plunged in abundance vp to the eyes, but my Riches are tacked to the twigs and branches of Trees; for as
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3669:134"/>
Summer hath made mee plentifull, ſo will Winter reduce me to my former pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty. In the meane time, I make Feaſts of <hi>Figges</hi> and <hi>Mellons,</hi> yea, out of the very <hi>Muſeadine</hi> Grapes <hi>I</hi> eate, there iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth liquor enough to make halfe a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome drunke; and the thing whereat happily you will wonder, is, that I put all this into a ſicke mans ſtomacke, to whom well-nigh all good things are forbidden: yet haue I found a meanes to reconcile my ſurfets with my phiſicall receits, and in one and the ſame day I both enioy pleaſure, and endure paine; for I nouriſh my Feauer with excellent fruites, and purge it with <hi>Rubarbe:</hi> but howſoeuer I cannot hazard my health in more innocent debauches, ſince I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them without troubling the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility either of Earth or Ayre, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bereauing any thing of life. The firſt men the world produced, attained to extreame age with ſuch pure cates as mine are; for as of all bloudy meates

they onely vſed <hi>Cherries</hi> and <hi>Mulberries;</hi> ſo was the ſimplicity of their liues accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a perfect repoſedneſſe; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as yet being voide of all Monſters: There was as then no mention either of <hi>Geryon,</hi> or <hi>Minotaure,</hi> nor of φφφφ.

               <p>YOur <hi>Letter</hi> of the fifteenth of the laſt Moneth, came to my hands as <hi>I</hi> was ready to ſeale theſe Preſents. You might haue iuſt cauſe to taxe me, ſhould I

let them goe vnanſwered, or if this dead man appearing in your preſence, did not giue you thankes for the many excellent words you haue vſed in the adorning his Funerall Oration. I ſhould be but too proud if others were of your opinion, or were infected with the like errour you are; but I much feare you will not for the preſent herein finde a party equall to that of the League, and doe much doubt if all of a contrary conceite, ſhould be declared Criminals, there would hardly be any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted in this Kingdome. Howſoeuer, I hold my ſelfe much obliged vnto you, in conferring ſo liberally that vpon me, you ſo well know <hi>I</hi> want, and for beſtowing all your colours and mercuriall mixtures to make mee ſeeme beautifull: I will bee well aduiſed how <hi>I</hi> fall out with him who flatters me, and in the loue I beare my ſelfe, I ſhall at all times ſuffer a riuall with much ſatisfaction. Since a certayne Gentleman in <hi>Germany</hi> pleaſeth himſelfe in being ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led King of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and ſince thoſe
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:3669:135"/>
who haue no reall patrimonies, tickle themſelues with meere Titles and Armes: by the like reaſon may <hi>J</hi> imagine my ſelfe to be the man you will needes haue me, and receiue from your courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie the qualities my Natiuity hath not affoorded me. But to disblame both of vs, <hi>I</hi> beſeech you hereafter to haue more care of my modeſty, and not to put me in danger either to loſe it, or not to beleeue you. It is no leſſe then to wrong the Angels, to call other ſpirits then theirs diuine, yea all the Celeſtiall Court is ſenſible of ſuffering that name to fall to ground. For my part, <hi>I</hi> am ſo farre from freeing my ſelfe of humane defects, as I doe abſolutely auow, there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more imperfect then <hi>J</hi> am, no not ſo much as blinkards and maymed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>I</hi> eſpye faults enough, on which ſide ſoeuer I ſee my ſelfe, and my wit is ſo disfurniſhed of forraine perfections, as I hold no man for learned, if he be not adorned with thoſe abilities whereof I

Spirits, it ſeemed vnto them to be two inſeperable tearmes: But to let ſuch men ſee how ill grounded their Obiection is, (and I ſuppoſe our iudgements will herein agree) it may pleaſe them to remember, that we call Angels Spirits, to diſtinguiſh them from bodies, being a farre different ſignification from what the word <hi>Spirit</hi> importeth, when we take it for that part of the ſoule which vnderſtandeth, reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and imagineth, and which cauſeth ſo different effects in the ſoule of a foole, and that of a diſcreete perſon.

We are therefore to admit of this difference, and ſay, that an Angell is doubtleſſe a Spirit, to wit, he is not a Body: but withall that an Angell hath moreouer a ſpirit, namely, this faculty of knowing, and conceiuing either leſſer, or more large, according to the priuiledge of his Order. So as if a Spirit hath no other ſignification then a ſimple and incompoſed ſubſtance, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality were not to be found among the Angels, being equally ſimple, and farre from all compoſition and mixture. When then <hi>I</hi> ſay it was a wrong done to Angels to call any other Spirits diuine ſaue onely theirs: I take the word <hi>Spirit</hi> in its ſecond ſignification, and thereby ſeperate it from the Angell, and diſtinguiſh the ſimple ſubſtance, and nature Angellicall from that faculty of the Soule tearmed the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But that one may not ſay, the ſpirit of Angels, becauſe they are all ſpirit, is a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3669:138"/>
reaſon very reproueable, and whereto there wanteth nothing but verity to make it no vntruth; for that beſides the ſpirit or vnderſtanding affoording to Angels ſo eminent a knowledge of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine things, they are likewiſe indued with will, cauſing them to loue what they know, and with memory day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adding ſomething to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall intellect. But admitting <hi>I</hi> ſhould yeeld to whatſoeuer theſe my reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors would haue, and that I limit the word Spirit within the bounds of its firſt ſignification, I ſhould ſtill haue the better of it. For in truth our ordinary manner of conception cannot poſſibly repreſent Angels without bodies, yea, and the Church it ſelfe affoordeth them ſo faire, beautifull, and perfect ones, that from thence the beſt Poets ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly picke their Compariſons to pourtraite the rareſt beauties. Beſides, if in holy Writ, mention be often made of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, euen before he aſſumed our
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3669:139"/>
corporall ſubſtance, and in a ſence which could not be vnderſtood of the third perſon in Trinity, why may not <hi>I</hi> as iuſtly ſpeake of the ſpirits of Angels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in compariſon of Gods Spirit, no better then earth, and materiall; and which approacheth not by many degrees vnto the ſimplicity and purity of this maieſteriall cauſe, being as the Mother to all the reſt. You ſee here, that (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer) it is very dangerous to ſtudy by halfe parts, or to vnderſtand ſome ſmall matter more then thoſe who neuer were at Schoole; yet is it out of ſuch men as theſe, that Nouelliſts and ſuperſtitious perſons are raiſed; yea, and all the reſt, who haue reaſon enough to doubt, but not ſcience ſufficiently to determine rightly.</p>

               <p>YOu haue anticipated what I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſay, and haue not left for me in all Rhetoricke, either comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or commendations to returne you. This is to force ingratitude by exceſſe of obligation, and to reduce me to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of being indebted vnto you after I be dead. In truth it were neceſſary I had the power to promiſe you felicity and Paradiſe, in requitall of the vowes and ſacrifices you offer vnto me, and that I were in caſe to be your aduocate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being thus put to a ſtand to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you. It may be you haue a minde in ſuch ſort to diſguiſe me to my ſelfe, as <hi>I</hi> ſhall not hereafter know who <hi>I</hi> am,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3669:140"/>
but be forced to forget my owne name, by cauſing me to imagine I am not the ſame man I was yeſterday. Proceede at your pleaſure to deceiue me in this ſort, for I am reſolued not to conteſt with you in this kind, to the worlds end: nor to arme my ſelfe againſt an enemy, who onely throwes Roſes at my head. I ſhould be very glad all my life would paſſe in ſuch pleaſing Dreames, and that I might neuer awake, for feare of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth to my preiudice. But for the attayning this happineſſe, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary I doe quite contrary to your aduice, and neuer quit my Countrey-houſe, where none comes to enter into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, or conteſt with me, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage <hi>I</hi> haue ouer bruite beaſts, or my Lackeyes. I agree with you that it is the Court-voice which either approueth or condemneth all, and that out of its light, things though neuer ſo perfect, haue no appearance: But <hi>I</hi> know not whether it were my beſt, to make that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3669:140"/>
my owne caſe; ſince I feare leſt my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there, will rather preiudice my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and your iudgement, then make good your poſition. Vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if there be any tollerable parts in me, they appeare ſo little outwardly, as I had neede haue my breaſt opened to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them: And in concluſion you will finde it a ſufficient obligation for me, to haue you thinke my ſoule is more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent then my diſcourſe, and that the better part of my vertue is concealed: Yet ſince my promiſe is paſt, I muſt reſolue for <hi>Paris,</hi> though it prooue as ſtrange a place vnto mee, as if I were out of the World, or as though they ſhould chaſe raw Courtiers thence, as they doe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Stateſ-men. To tell you plainely how the caſe ſtands, J am none of thoſe who ſtudy the ſlighteſt actions of their liues, and who vſe Art in all they doe, or doe not. I cannot light vpon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, wherewith they authoriſe their follies, nor make of euery meane matter a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3669:141"/>
myſtery by whiſpering it in the eare: And leſſe doe I know how to palliate my faults; or make ſhew of an honeſt man, if really I be not ſo: Now though I could make my ſelfe capable of theſe Arts, yet would it anger mee ſhrewdly, if after hauing paſſed nine Ports, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden many backe-caſts to get thither, to be at laſt ſtayed at the Tenth: Nay, ſhould <hi>I</hi> chance to get admittance; what a hell were it for me to come into a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where Hatts are not made to couer heads, and where all men grow crooked with extreame cringeing. Conſider therefore, whether this humour of mine would ſute with the place where you are; or if a man whoſe points and garters ſeeme ponderous vnto him, and who findes it a difficult matter to obey Gods Commandements, and the Kings Edicts, can be drawne to bee obliged to new lawes, or procure to himſelfe a third ſeruitude. In the ſtate wherein <hi>I</hi> now am, all the Princes in the World act
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3669:141"/>
Comedies to make me ſport. I enioy all the riches of Nature, from the Heauens to riuer-waters, and <hi>I</hi> eaſily obtaine of my moderate ſpirit, what I cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto by the liberality of Fortune. This being thus, will you perſwade me to change thoſe benefits none enuy, with your feares, hopes, and ſuſpicions; or not thinke it fit I value liberty, for which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> haue made Warre (now this fifty yeares) againſt the King of <hi>Spaine?</hi> But ſince <hi>I</hi> haue paſſed my word, <hi>I</hi> am not reſolued to reuoke it; yet when I muſt needs bid adieu to my Woods and ſolitary places, which haue taught mee ſo many good things, and quit this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted Palace of mine, where all my thoughts are reall inſpirations; I ſhall haue a great conflict within me, to keepe my word with you. I will beleeue none but your ſelfe, who beſt know whether or no I haue reaſon to loue this priſon my Father builded for me, or this little ſpot of Land, where there is no defect
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3669:142"/>
but a Fountaine of Gold, and other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary things; there being elſe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent here to ſatisfie a ſober perſon; I muſt confeſſe the laſt great raines haue blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all the beauty abroad: And Winter which by right ſhould bee condemned neuer to depart from <hi>Swedland,</hi> is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy come to croſſe the content <hi>I</hi> formerly enioyed: But howſoeuer, there are yet pleaſing remedies to auoyde theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent incommodities. The perfumes I burne, and whereof I am as prodigall, as though I exacted tribute from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries from whence they come, maketh me the leſſe to miſſe the ſweetneſſe of the Spring: And a great fire reſembling the brighteſt beauty, which <hi>I</hi> tearme the Sunne of the night, and darke dayes, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth at all houres in my Chamber, and giueth light to my reſt, as well as to my Studies. Before this witneſſe (which <hi>I</hi> neuer looſe ſight of) all Nature is the ſubiect of my meditation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I conceiue workes, which happily may merit a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3669:142"/>
place in your Library, and to bee choſen Citizens of that diuine Republique. I know not what men doe moſt eſteeme in bookes, but I am confident, that in this <hi>I</hi> compoſe, <hi>Iuſtice</hi> and <hi>Maieſty,</hi> ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare ſo euenly tempered, as none ſhall therein find any thing either ſauoring of cowardize or cruelty. I take and make vſe of the art of Ancients; as they would haue done from me, had I beene the firſt man liuing. But <hi>I</hi> haue no ſeruile depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy vpon their conceptions, nor am I borne their vaſſall, to follow no other lawes or examples, ſaue theirs: To the contrary (if I deceiue not my ſelfe) my inuention is farre more happy then my i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation; and as there haue beene in our age diuers new Stars diſcouered, till this preſent vnperceiued; ſo I in matter of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, ſeeke out ſingularities, hitherto vnknowne to any. It is certaine, and you know it as well as my ſelfe, you who know good things when you ſee them, and who are the Authour of diuers; that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3669:143"/>
there are none ſo ſeuere <hi>Muſes</hi> as the <hi>Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch,</hi> nor any tongue more hating affectation, and bare apparances of things then ours. All kinde of ornaments therefore are not propper for her: and her purity is at ſuch ods with the exorbitant licence of other languages, that a <hi>French</hi> vice in this kind, is often made a forraine vertue. But (in this caſe) we are to take aduice of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and eare; and for my part, I haue for my patterne herein, the <hi>Idea</hi> of the great Cardinall of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> as though he were preſent and priuy to my concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or as if he at all times receiued or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected them, as they happen to bee either good or otherwiſe: But to tell you the truth, I know not well which way I paſſe by this tedious and vntroden path, or what vſe I intend to make of theſe ſo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent ſpeeches. But I am as often out of my way, in the allies of my hermitage, and I haue many times much vſe of a man, to let me know whether it be day or night, and to order my times and actions; yet

The beſt is, the Phiſitians haue not ſo farre exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted you, but there yet remaines bloud ſufficient, to beſtow part thereof in your Miſtreſſes ſeruice, and to fill the world with your offences; ſo long as the ruines of your head may be repaired, and your beauty budde againe with the next Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there is nothing loſt hitherto; but indeede if inſtead of your former head,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3669:148"/>
you carryed the figure of a ruſty Murrion or rotten Pumpian, I ſhould much pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty you in ſuch a plight, and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adde you to the number of decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed buildings. Now when all is done <hi>Philander,</hi> it is but a little water and earth mingled together, wee ſtudy to conſerue with all the maximes of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all the rules of Phiſicke. Let vs reflect I pray you, vpon our better part, and hereafter labour as well to cure our ſelues of Vice, as of the Feauer. It is that image of God wee defaced by our owne hands, we ought to repaire; and our firſt innocency is the thing it behoueth vs to aske at his hands, rather then our former health. For my part, I am abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to lead a new life, and to take no other care but for my ſoules health, and to procure the ſame for others. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it were farre better to conſecrate this great Eloquence of ours to his glory, who gaue it vs, then to imploy it in commending fooles, and in making our
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3669:149"/>
ſelues to be praiſed among children. The P. E. whom happily you know, and who hath one of the beſt, and moſt polite wits of all his company, confirmes mee all he can in this my deſigne, and euery houre of his company is as much to mee, as eight dayes of reformation; yet is hee not a man who profeſſeth that pale ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which affrighteth all men, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with humane infirmities: but quite contrary, he flattereth mee in reprehending my errours, and inſtead of the pennance <hi>I</hi> deſerue, he is contented to enioyne me honeſt recreations. Your brother will tell you more, about eight dayes hence, and will giue you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt both of my actions and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; beleeue him as truth it ſelfe; and beſides, aſſure your ſelfe further vpon my word, he is worth ſome Doctor and an halfe, and hath a good wit, without ſpeaking of his zeale and vertue.</p>

               <p>I Am much troubled to finde the cauſe of your teares; to impute them to the death of your Husband, is happily but the bare pretext. It is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that Death which cauſeth the moſt beautifull things to become offenſiue to the dayes brightneſſe, and affrighteth thoſe who formerly admired them; ſhould make that man pleaſing vnto you, who was neuer ſo to any. Yet you ſeeme with him to haue loſt all, and doe ſo cunningly counterfeit the afflicted, <hi>I</hi> can hardly beleeue what I ſee: Can it be poſſible, you ſhould be thus peſtered to ſupport your good fortune with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or be really ſo ſorrowfull for the loſſe of a poore gouty fellow, whoſe
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3669:150"/>
ouer-long liuing I ſhould rather haue thought it fit to comfort you? But if this be not thus, what doe you with all this great mourning, wherein you plunge your ſelfe, and this mid-night neuer remouing from your Chamber? <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe I was neuer more aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, then to finde ſuch an Equipage of ſadneſſe about you, accompanied with ſuch elaborate actions, and ſo conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned countenances; and without ieſting <hi>Olympia,</hi> (after this <hi>I</hi> haue ſeene) there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth nothing for the full expreſſion of a fained paſſion, but onely to weare blacke ſmockes, and to be attended by <hi>Moores.</hi> Yet is it time, or neuer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to your right ſences, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude your Comedy, let me intreat you to leaue off all theſe ſower faces to fooles. Caſt off this blacke vaile which hinders me from ſeeing you, and conſider that fiue foote of ground, is worth you two thouſand pounds by the yeare. To raiſe ſuch a rent, the reuenewes of halfe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3669:150"/>

Is it not almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, ſo ſmall a corner of earth, ſhould yeeld ſo large a reuenew. I doubt not but diuers will ſuppoſe it beares Pearles or Diamonds.

                  <hi>J</hi> am to impart vnto you, and where upon <hi>I</hi> firſt intended to write.

Herein <hi>Olympa,</hi> you ought not ſuffer the vaine ambition to be wife to a great Signiour to tranſport you, or the aduantage of entring into the <hi>Loouer</hi> in

Firſt, you are to vnderſtand, ſhee is extracted out of her mothers ſinnes, nor was euer any Virginity ſo britle, as that ſhe brought into this world. It is very likely ſhe hath loſt all remembrance of any ſuch matter: But people of thoſe dayes, ſticke not openly to affirme, that the firſt time ſhe had liberty to goe abroade, (at her comming home) ſhe miſt her gloues and Maiden-head. After this, her beauty aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting with riper yeares, ſhee drew the eyes of all <hi>Italy</hi> vpon her; and ſold that fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty times at Court, ſhe had formerly loſt at Schoole: But ſince then, ſhe is arriued to an experience, farre ſurpaſſing that of the

I had farre rather be deceiued, then know the truth to my preiudice: Either my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is troubleſome vnto you, or you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue your fauours for ſome other friend. Howſoeuer, I am contented to beleeue your Mother is ſicke, and that you cannot quit her Chamber: there are no excuſes ſo counterfeit, I accept not for currant, ſo long as they releiue my ſpirits: Conſidering the power you haue ouer me, it is a ſmall

Shew your wit, <hi>I</hi> beſeech you, by

inflicting daily new torments vpon me, and auoyde all occaſions of obliging me, with as much care as <hi>I</hi> ſeeke thoſe to ſerue you. <hi>J</hi> haue prepared my ſpirits againſt all the bad occurrents can happen that way. There is nothing <hi>I</hi> cannot endure, if it comes from you, your ſlighting me one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted: But herein I muſt tell you, I am ſo tender, as <hi>I</hi> am wounded with the leaſt touch. <hi>I</hi> would not purchaſe the Kings fauour, if he affoord it mee in rough tearmes; nor would <hi>I</hi> accept of his Graces, were <hi>J</hi> forced to gaine them with the forgoing the thing I affect more then his Kingdome. You vnderſtand me ſuficiently what <hi>I</hi> meane hereby, and the iuſt occaſion I haue to complaine; but ſtill you will haue me in the wrong, nor doe I doubt, but you will accuſe mee of your crime: But ſpeake truely, haue you no apprehenſion, that he whom you haue ſo often iniured, ſhall at length grow weary of his ſufferings, and leſt he ſhould loſe all feare, together with his

You might conſider <hi>Clorinda,</hi> that I am not poſſeſſed with ſlight paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and how your ſelfe hath told mee ere now; that if God ſhould arme mee with thunder when I am angry, within foure and twenty houres there would be neither Towers nor Pauillions ſtanding in any place: Wherefore to ſecond your conceite; know (if that were) one while the fire ſhould fall vpon all iealous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and by and by burne all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and little Brothers in a whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince.

But I gaine much by theſe glorious brags, or by my ſeeming feuerity: I aſſure my ſelfe, you mocke me and my threats. It is long ſince I haue ſhewed you the way how to catch mee, and you know the meanes how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce mee to my former duty: I muſt confeſſe I am not of ſufficient force to

But the time will come, when your Looking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>glaſſe will more ſcare you, then a Iudge doth a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon: your fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>head will flye to the crowne of your head; your cheekes will fall beneath your chinne, and your eyes of thoſe dayes, ſhall turne of the ſame co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lour your lips are at this houre. I could willingly wiſh out of my loue vnto you, my relation were not ſo true as it is. But ſince <hi>I</hi> haue quitted all complacency, there is no meanes to make mee ſilent. <hi>Glorinda,</hi> the Sunne is ſtill beautifull, though ready to ſet; and the Autumne agreeable, though ſprinkled with ſome
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3669:158"/>
Snow, but wee enioy no happy yeares, but the firſt of youth: And be as carefull of your ſelfe as is poſſible, yet can you not conſerue your complexion, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire experience. Will you haue mee ſay more, and acquaint you with what I vnderſtood by a ſtranger, with whom <hi>I</hi> haue conuerſed all this day? You are to know there is not any part of the world ſo remote, whither his curioſity hath not carried him, nor rarity in Nature, hee hath not carefully obſerued: Hee hath ſeene Mountaines which burne perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally without diminiſhing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee hath lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Ilands, neuer reſting in one place; he hath ſeene naturall Sea-men; but hee ſwore vnto me, how among all theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, he neuer yet ſaw a beautifull old woman. The Morall hereof is, that you muſt make vſe of your youth, and gather Noſe-gayes before the Roſes wither. None knowes better then your ſelfe, that to be faire, is to reigne without hauing neede either of Guards or Forts. You
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:3669:158"/>
ſee you are the worlds ambition, no man deſiring further hapineſſe then <hi>Clorinda:</hi> but thinke not to continue this abſolute authority, or this generall eſteeme, by other meanes then you compaſſed them; and aſſure your ſelfe, that when you haue no further attractions then an eloquent tongue, no man will ſeeke for them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the furrowes of your face. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had neede be perfectly prouided of vertue, to repaire the ruines of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All the wit and experience in the world is fruitleſſe, when ſhee falls into this ſtate, nor can any thing hinder her from being hated, but onely to change Sexe. Remember then <hi>Clorinda,</hi> not to expect to liue, when you are as good as dead; nor doe not ſpend that time in deliberating, which ſhould be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in doing. You are now of yeares both to giue, and receiue contentment, and we are in the Moneth, wherein each crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture turneth amorous; not excepting Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tygers, or Philoſophers. I intreate
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:3669:159"/>
you therefore, not to ſhew your ſelfe the ſole inſenſible creature in the world: ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your ſelfe to be convinced by reaſon, ſince you cannot reſiſt the ſame but to your owne diſaduantage: You haue no ſubiect to be ſuſpicious of what <hi>I</hi> ſay; for <hi>I</hi> aduiſe you to nothing <hi>Clorinda,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>I</hi> would not willingly ioyne with you in the accompliſhment.</p>

                  <hi>CLorinda,</hi> your Religion muſt needes be amiſſe, otherwiſe <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſee you now and then at Church: But <hi>J</hi> thinke it were an eaſier matter to conuert a whole Nation, then to diſpoſe you to giue me content. The cauſe why you perſiſt in your owne opinion, is, becauſe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:3669:159"/>
it is oppoſite to mine. Well then, I muſt depart without ſpeaking with you, and am barred from affoording to my affection, what good manners would haue exacted ofme, though <hi>I</hi> had not loued you: True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I know not in what manner to ſuffer ſo wounding a diſpleaſure, nor am <hi>I</hi> ſo well acquainted with my ſelfe, as to paſſe my word for him I ſpeake of in this occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All I can ſay vnto you <hi>Clorinda,</hi> is, that the onely way to rid me out of my paine, is to performe the thing I haue ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto you, and to make your ſelfe capable of a ſtrong reſolution. Neuer did any Prince enterpriſe a more glorious voyage, then mine ſhall bee, if you will make one: and truely, I ſee not why you ſhould make any difficulty herein, the longer youriourney is, the further ſhall you be remooued from tyranny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is a Monſter you ought to flye from, euen to the worlds end, and with whom to be in peace, is dangerous: Will you feare to come into the Countrey of Comedies,

Painting, and Muſicke; or into a place where women are by many as highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as Saints? with out flattering you, I muſt affirme, you ſhall ſeeme ouer-much to neglect your owne quiet, if you let ſlip ſo fauourable an occaſion to procure it. It is time <hi>Clorinda,</hi> you make it appeare what you are, and that we begin the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of our aduentures. If you loue, all things will be eaſie for you; there is no more difficulty to paſſe the <hi>Alpes,</hi> then to goe vp into your Chamber: Nor doubt you that the Sea-waters will become ſweet, if you be not ſatisfied in that they bee ſmooth. But I am much affraide <hi>I</hi> ſhall not receiue from you the ſatisfaction <hi>I</hi> expect.

               <p>I Attend you here in the ſeaſon of <hi>Jaſmins</hi> and <hi>Roſes,</hi> and do ſend you a taſte of the pleaſures of <hi>Rome,</hi> for feare you be poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therewith, vppon your firſt approach. We are here in the Country of curioſities, and to be happy in this place, it ſufficeth not to be blind. The <hi>Sunne</hi> hath yet heat enough to ripen vs Reaſins, and to afford vs Flowers: all the <hi>Winter</hi> fals vppon the neighbouring Mountaines, to the end we may not want <hi>Snow</hi> in <hi>Auguſt.</hi> But if you deſire I ſhould diuert my Diſcourſe vnto more ſerious matters, &amp; conceale nothing from you: <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, there is no place vnder Heauen, where <hi>Vertue</hi> is ſo neare a Neighbour to <hi>Vice,</hi> or where <hi>Good</hi> is ſo mingled with <hi>Euill:</hi> We here behold miracles on the on ſide, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters on the other; and at the ſame time
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3669:161"/>
when ſome Diſcipline themſelues, others run to debauches of all kinds. Beſides, there is as profound a peace here, as in that part of the Ayre eleuated aboue the <hi>Windes</hi> and <hi>Stormes. Idleneſse</hi> in this place, is an honeſt mans ordinary Vocation; and to ſaue halfe the World, no man will riſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily from Table, for feare of troubling digeſtion. If you chance to ſee any with skars in their faces, do not thereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine they haue purchaſed them eyther in Warres, or in defence of their honour, for theſe are only their Miſtreſſes fauours; but in recompence of ſuch refractory humors, you ſhall ſee that here, the ſanctity whereof doth illuſtrate the whole Church. It is their feruent prayers which impetrate all aduantages ouer <hi>Enemies:</hi> It is their faſtings which cauſe fruitefulneſſe to flow vppon the Earth: It is their innocency which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth the culpable from <hi>Eternall</hi> ruine. In a word, there are here ſuch excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and ſo intiſing allurements to <hi>Vice,</hi> that I will not maruaile if you turn
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3669:162"/>
honeſt man here, and I will likewiſe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly pardon you, if you do not ſo. Truly, as new <hi>Spaine</hi> is the Prouince of gold; and as <hi>Affricke</hi> affords Lyons, and <hi>France</hi> ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; ſo is <hi>Italy</hi> the mother of thoſe things you beſt loue. When you ſhall ſee theſe Female Creatures in their owne Country, and compare their beauty with the bad fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the maſculine <hi>Italians,</hi> I doubt not, but it will ſeeme to you, aſwel as to my ſelfe, theſe diuine Women to haue beene created by themſelues, or to be Queenes who haue married their Groomes. The moſt part of thoſe beyond the Mounts, haue no more beauty then needs muſt, to excuſe them from being eſteemed vgly; and if there be ſome one whoſe face you could fancy, this ſhall happily be ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Palace, or ſome well fauoured beaſt. But here (for the moſt part) they are borne Eloquent; and I will tell you before hand, that in one and the ſame perſon, you ſhal find both your <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Miſtreſse.</hi> For my part, I ingeniouſly confeſſe, I do no
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:3669:162"/>
longer liue vnder <hi>Clorinda's</hi> regency, and all that is permitted mee in this place, is onely ſometimes to honour her memory. I expect you ſhould at this paſſage accuſe me of leuity and diſloyalty, and that you could willingly reuile mee. But doe you not thinke my ſighes muſt needes be ſurbated, in going euery day foure hundred leagues? Beſides, being ſo farre from her as I am, what know I, whether I loue a dead body, or an Infidell. <hi>I</hi> haue not receiued any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours from her, which are not rather markes of her vertues, then demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her loue. And had ſhe loſt all her liberality in that kinde, ſhee could hardly miſſe it. <hi>I</hi> am therefore onely obliged to my word, not to her affection. And as for that, I ſhould ouer-eſteeme her, if I made more reckoning thereof, then ſome <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> doe of theirs, and I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe ouer ſuperſtitious, if <hi>I</hi> valued what I onely whiſpered in her care, to be of greater efficacy then Letters Pattents and Edicts. It is a point decided in <hi>Onids</hi> Theology,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:3669:163"/>
that an hundred falſe Oathes from an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous perſon, amount not to halfe a deadly ſinne, and that it is onely the God of Poets whom wee offend by our periury in that point. Now I will bee iudged by her ſelfe, whether <hi>J</hi> hauing beſtowed my ſeruice vpon her, ſhe ſhould take it ill if another did reward me; or that <hi>I</hi> loue rather to bee happy, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; or deſire rather to poſſeſſe <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia,</hi> then to deſire <hi>Clorinda.</hi> Will ſhe haue her tyranny extend euen to the Churches patrimony, and that the Pope ſhare his temporall authority with her? <hi>J</hi> doe not beleeue ſhe hath any ſuch preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For my part, <hi>I</hi> would ſhee knew I can no longer behold any beauty but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, nor receiue any but warme &amp; moiſt kiſſes. I will tell you the reſt vpon the bankes of <hi>Tyber,</hi> and in theſe precious ruines whither I goe to muſe once a day, and to treade in their ſteps who haue led Kings in triumph. If there were any meanes there to finde a little of <hi>Sylla's</hi>

good fortune, or of <hi>Pompeis</hi> greatneſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Medals we now &amp; then meet with, I ſhould haue a farther ſubiect to inuite you hither. Notwithſtanding, if you be yet your ſelfe, and that by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow you haue forſaken the world, and the vanities thereof, aſſure your ſelfe, that it is in this Countrey where felicity doth attend you: and that being once in this place, you will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme all thoſe as baniſhed perſons, whom you haue left behinde you in <hi>France.</hi>

All men haue wel perceiued, you haue not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed any thing to the adminiſtration of the Kings treaſure, ſaue onely your pure ſpirit, to wit, that part of the ſoule ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the terreſtriall part, being free from paſſions, which reaſoneth without either louing or deſiring; and that you haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the Riches of the State with as great fidelity, as one ought to gouerne another mans goods, with as much care as you conſerue your owne, and with as great ſcruple as wee ought to touch ſacred things. But in truth it is no great glory for that man to haue beene faithfull to his Maſter, who knowes not how to deceiue any: And did <hi>I</hi> beleeue you were onely able to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ill, I would barely commend in you the Commencements of Vertue.

               <p>YOu haue found the place whereat I confeſſe I am the moſt eaſily ſurpriſed, and to oblige mee to yeelde, your Courteſie hath left nothing for your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to performe: ſince therefore you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all your Muſes to require my Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and haue already payed of your owne; I can no longer keepe it to myſelfe, but as another mans goods. But if this were not ſo, my reſentments are not of ſuch value with mee, as not often to beſtow them vpon more ſlender conſiderations then thoſe were which produced them; nor doe my paſſions ſo tranſport me, but that I will at all times remaine in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Hitherto <hi>I</hi> can defend a iuſt cauſe, but in farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting what you deſire, <hi>I</hi> ſhould force right it ſelfe to be in the wrong, were it on

my ſide: And out of bare enmity which in ſome Common-wealthes hath beene tollerated, <hi>I</hi> ſhould euen paſſe to Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, a thing odious to all men. Since our liues are momentary, it is no reaſon our paſſions ſhould be immortall, or that men ſhould glut themſelues with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, whereof God hath as well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden the vſe, as the exceſſe. It is a thing he hath ſoly reſerued to himſelfe; and ſince none but hee, truely knoweth how to vſe this part of Iuſtice, he would no more put it into the hands of men, then hee doth Thunder and Tempeſts. Let vs therefore ſtop in our firſt motions, for it is already too much to haue begun. Let vs not tearme the hardneſſe of our hearts, Courage: and if you haue preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me in the ouerture of the peace wee treate of, repent not your ſelfe, ſince you haue thereby bereaued me of all the honour there had beene in acquiring it. Heretofore Magnanimity and Humility might haue beene eſteemed two contrary
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:3669:171"/>
things, but ſince the maximes of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity haue bin changed by the principles of <hi>Diuinity,</hi> and that Pagan vices are become Chriſtian vertues, there are euen weake actions a man of courage ought to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; nor is true glory any longer due to thoſe who haue triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phed ouer <hi>innocents,</hi> but to thoſe <hi>Martyrs</hi> they haue made, and to ſuch perſons whom they haue oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But to paſſe from generall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to what is particular betweene you and me, it is no way likely, a religious man would diſturbe the tranquility of his thoughts, or quit his conuerſation with God and Angels, to intermeddle with wicked Mortals, and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a party in our diſorders. I ſhould likewiſe haue leſſe reaſon to ſeeke for an enemy out of the World, wherein there are ſo many aduerſaries to diſlike, and ſo many Rebels to ſubdue. Now (Father) whatſoeuer opinion you haue had, and notwithſtanding any thing <hi>I</hi> haue ſaid in the beginning of this Letter. <hi>I</hi> neuer
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3669:171"/>
intended to commence any reall Warre againſt you: I haue not at all felt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion I ſhewed; all my choller being but artificiall, when at any time certaine of my ſpeeches ſeemed diſaduantagious vnto you; ſo as I freely conſent, that what was written to <hi>Hydaſpe,</hi> ſhall paſſe as a flaſh of my braine, and not as any teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of my beleefe, onely to let men know, I had a deſire to ſhew how able <hi>J</hi> was to conteſt with truth, if <hi>I</hi> had no minde to ſide with it. This ſcience ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beene ſufficiently daring to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to perſwade, that a Quartan Ague was better then Health: <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> I ſay, which hath inuented praiſes for <hi>Buſiris,</hi> made Apologies for <hi>Nero,</hi> and obliged all the people of <hi>Rome</hi> to doubt whether Iuſtice were a good, or bad thing, may yet in theſe dayes exerciſe it ſelfe vpon ſubiects wholy ſeparated from common opinions, and by gracefull fictions, rather excite admiration in mens ſpirits, then exact any credence. It rayſeth Fantomes
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3669:172"/>
with purpoſe to deface them. It hath paintings and diſguiſements, to alter the purity of all worldly things: It chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſides without leuity, it accuſeth innocency without calumny: And to ſay truth, Painters and Stage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>players are no way culpable of thoſe murthers wee ſee repreſented in Pictures, or preſented vpon Theaters; ſince therein the moſt cruel is the moſt iuſt. None can iuſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thoſe of falſity, who make certaine glaſſes which ſhew one thing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Errour in ſome caſes being more gracefull then truth. In a word, the life euen of the greateſt Sages, is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerious, all their ſayings are not Sermons, nor is all they write, eyther their laſt Teſtament, or the confeſſion of their Faith. What can I ſay more? Can you imagine me to be ſo curious, as to condemne the guſt of all that great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, who flocke to heare you euery morning? Are you perſwaded that I and the people can neuer be of one minde?
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3669:172"/>
That I will oppoſe my ſelfe to the beleefe of honeſt men? to the approbation of Doctors? and to their authority who are eminent aboue others? No Father; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no ſuch liberty to my ſpirit: aſſure your ſelfe, I eſteeme you as I ought. I commend your zeale and learning, yea, were it truer then euer it was, that to compoſe tedious Volumnes, is no leſſe then to commit great ſinnes: Yet if you oblige me to iudge of yours by that you ſent vnto me, I ſay it is very excellent in its kind, and that I will no way hinder you from obtayning a Ranke among the Fathers of theſe moderne ages. But my teſtimony will not <hi>(I</hi> hope) become the onely fruite of your labours; <hi>I</hi> wiſh with all my heart the conuerſion of <hi>Turkes</hi> and Infidels may crowne your indeauours.

Subiect, nor wrong holy things by profaine praiſes; my intention is onely to let you know, <hi>J</hi> aſſume not ſo poore a part in the Churches intereſt, as not to bee extraordinarily well pleaſed with thoſe who are ſeruiceable thereto, and that <hi>I</hi> am right glad beſides the propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>I</hi> haue to eſteeme your amity, ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull a perſwaſion as Religion is, doth yet further oblige me.</p>

My Lord, I doubt not but your ſpirit though altogether ſtoute and couragious, to ſupport your proper misfortunes, is yet mollified by the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their miſeries who loue you, and where there is queſtion rather of ſhewing your good nature, or your conſtancy, you will quit one vertue to acquire another.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:3669:174"/>
to minde, that it is the Publique to whom you owe your cares and paſſions, and that you are not permitted farther to afflict a ſpirit which is no longer yours. Since the miſery of this age is ſo generall, as it leaueth no one houſe without teares, nor any one part of <hi>Europe</hi> without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and ſince Fortune is not of power to conſerue euen her owne workemanſhips, who are many of them fallen to ground: it muſt needes ſo happen (my Lord) that being of the world, you are to taſte of the fruites it produceth, and that you purchaſe at ſome hard rate, the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes dayly attending you. But truely, the place where you are, and the great deſignes taking you vp, may well furniſh you with ſo ſtrong and ſolide conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they neede leaue no worke for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and my Eloquence would come too late, ſhould I imploy it after your reaſon, which hath formerly perſwaded you, there being now neither precept nor Counſell in all humane wiſedome

If power hath made Princes, and chance Parents, reaſon well deſerues a further kinde of Obedience: It was that which ouercome me vpon the firſt conference <hi>I</hi> had with you, cauſing me to proſtrate all my preſumption at your feete, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing rightly repreſented to my thoughts, how impoſſible it is to eſteeme my ſelfe, and know you: <hi>I</hi> am ſure this Language is no way pleaſing to you; and that you will looke awry at my Letter; but doe what you pleaſe, <hi>I</hi> am more a friend to truth, then to your humour, and my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are ſo repleniſhed with what I haue ſeene, and heard, as I can no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale my thoughts: I muſt tell you (Sir) you are the greateſt Tyrant this day li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing; your authority becomes awfull to

all ſoules, and when you ſpeake, there is no further meanes to retaine priuate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, if they be not conformable to yours. I ſpeake this ſeriouſly, and with my beſt ſence; you haue often reduced me to ſuch extreamities, that comming from you, without knowing what to anſwer you, <hi>I</hi> haue beene ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime and ſay, (in the rapture wherein I was) Reſtore me my opinion which you haue violently forced from me, and take not from mee the liberty of Conſcience the King hath giuen mee. But truely, it is no ſmall pleaſure to be conſtrained to be happy, and to fall into his hands, who vſeth no violence; but to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile who ſuffer. For my part, I haue at all times departed your preſence, fully perſwaded in what <hi>I</hi> ought to beleeue: I neuer gaue you a viſite which cured me not of ſome paſſion: <hi>I</hi> neuer came into your Chamber ſo honeſt a man, as I went foorch: How often with one ſhort ſpeech haue you eleuated me aboue my ſelfe, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:3669:178"/>
bereaued me of whatſoeuer was fleſhly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and prophane in me: How often hearing you diſcourſe of the World to come, and of true felicity, haue I longed after it, and would willingly haue purchaſed it at the price of my life? How often could I haue followed you, (would you haue conducted me) to a higher pitch of perfection, then all ancient <hi>Philoſophers</hi> euer attained? So it is, that you onely haue beſtowed the loue of inuiſible things vpon me, cauſing me to diſtaſte my firſt and moſt violent affections: I ſhould ſtill haue beene buried in fleſh, had not you drawne me forth, nor had my ſpirit beene other then a part of my body, had not you taken the paines to vnlooſe it from ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall obiects, and to ſeuer the eternall from the periſhable part.

Thinke
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:3669:179"/>
not therefore, that either the pompe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, or the glitter of that of <hi>France,</hi> can dazell thoſe eyes of my ſoule, where to you haue ſhewed ſo many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things.

It is no good Argument to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre, that becauſe you are adorned with the vertues of our ſexe, you therefore haue not reſerued thoſe of your owne; or that it is a ſinne for a woman to vnderſtand the Language which heretofore the Veſtals made vſe of. <hi>I</hi> will therefore leaue theſe calumnious perſons, who deſire to bereaue Lillies of their beauty; and Chriſtall of

its cleareneſſe, to returne to the <hi>Letter</hi> I haue receiued from you; where without flattery <hi>I</hi> will affirme, that<note n="*" place="margin">Meaning himſelfe.</note> this man who hath beene diſcribed vnto you, for ſo vaine glorious a perſon; who deſpiſeth times paſt, who mocketh the moderne, and preiudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the future; hath found out diuers things in your workes well pleaſing vnto him: ſo as if my approbation be at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of any weight with you, you may for your owne aduantage, adde this <hi>Encomion</hi> to that of <hi>Lipſius</hi> and <hi>Montagnie,</hi> and boldly affirme you haue this aduantage ouer Kings and Emperours, that the taſtes of two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ages haue agreed in your fauour. Since you were firſt commended, the face of <hi>Christendome</hi> hath changed ten times: Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our manners, attire, or Court, are cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſible to what you haue ſeene them. Men haue made new lawes, yea, and the vertues of our fore-fathers age, are eſteemed the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ours: yet ſhall it appeare, how amidſt ſo many changes and ſtrange reuolutions, you haue brought euen to ourtimes one and the ſame reputation; and that your beauty (I
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3669:187"/>
ſpeake of what enamoreth the <hi>Capucins</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and old Philoſophers) hath not left you, with your youth. <hi>I</hi> ſhall in mine owne regard bee very glad, the world ſhould take notice how much I honour Vertue, by what name ſoeuer it paſſeth, and vnder what ſhape ſoeuer it is ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and <hi>I</hi> eſteeme my party ſtronger by the halfe, then it hath beene, ſince you haue vouchſafed to enter thereinto. But if without offending againſt Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call rules, and thoſe of <hi>Decorum: J</hi> durſt take you for my ſecond, I aſſure my ſelfe if wee were to denounce war againſt theſe petty Authours, who are ingendered by errour, and diſcloſed out of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this age, you ſhould not haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer many in taking halfe a dozen of them to taske for your part. At the leaſt, you would put thoſe Pedants to ſilence, who bragge they haue taught me to ſpeake. Yet will I tell you, before <hi>I</hi> proceede any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to the end they may know as much (if you pleaſe) that my Mother is not reſolued to giue this for granted, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3669:187"/>
how if there be any glory to be gotten in ſo poore an exploite, ſhe is determined to diſpute the matter againſt all theſe booke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers. I haue euer beene hitherto of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that in what concerneth the choice of words, I ought to ſuffer my ſelfe to be gouerned by the common acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, without adhering to any one mans ſingle example; and that inſtead of acknowledging the authority of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, <hi>I</hi> am to follow the publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But howſoeuer, it is not the praiſe of a great Orator to ſpeake our Language well, but rather the marke of a true <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> Nor doe <hi>I</hi> pretend applauſe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for not being borne in <hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> It is true, <hi>I</hi> attibute much to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution, and know that high things ſtand in neede of the helpe of words, and that after thoſe haue bin rightly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they are as happily to bee expreſſed. It onely angers me, that out of the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt part of <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> receiued among the ancients, they will needes extract all ours. And that to pleaſe meane ſpirits, it is

                  <hi>I</hi> aduiſe you for your honours ſake, not to refreſh the memory of what is paſt, nor to ſeeke for examples of your fidelity in our Ciuill warres, ſince you haue not therein conſerued it. You may hereupon ſay what you pleaſe, and try (if you can) to make things ſeeme to vs contrary to what they are; yet am I well aſſured, you were engaged in a faction, wherein you haue not beene vſefull to the King, no, nor where you could ſerue him as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man ought; ſo as if you deſire I ſhould

to doe you a fauour) forget things paſt; or if you will alledge that the tranquility we now enioy, and the good order vſed in mannaging Publique affaires, were the effects of your prudent conduct; beſides, that this glory is not abſolutely due vnto you, and there remaining others who ſuppoſe they haue as large a ſhare therein as your ſelfe. You muſt not take it ill, if I freely tell you, there is not any thing therein worthy of admiration. You entred vpon the State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>gouernment in a peaceable time, you therein found all things ſo wel diſpoſed, as they ſeemed of themſelues to worke the wiſhed effects; and the moſt of the <hi>French</hi> ſo inclined to ſubiection, as it was no hard matter to bring them to due obedience. And herein you are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to confeſſe, you owe much to CCC, and that he paſſed the laſt yeares of his life for your inſtructions, as he ſince then, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the generall good of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If there hath beene any obſtacle to remooue, which at this preſent may be troubleſome vnto you, he hath before his
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:3669:195"/>
death rid his hands thereof, with as much good fortune as reſolution. If it may be eſteemed a benefit, to vnderſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the people, thereby to deale with them according to their humours, he hath made it appeare vnto you, there was not any thing aboue his patience; ſince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſentment, he was able to ſuffer the loſſe of his liberty; and if ſo it were, that he was forced to make vſe of ſome violent act, which neuertheleſſe was neceſſary; neither hatred, nor enuy, haue euer beene of power to hinder his vndertakings. In a word, he hath tamed the moſt ſtubborne ſpirits, he hath left the parties who moſt perplexed this poore Kingdome, either abſolutely ruined, or ſo weakned, as they are vtterly vnable to riſe againe. He hath accuſtomed all men to patience, and hath performed ſo ſtrange things, as wee now finde not any thing extraordinary; and (what <hi>I</hi> moſt eſteeme) hee hath made the world ſee, how great things the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was able to doe, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he did this for the eſtabliſhing his
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:3669:196"/>
owne. <hi>I</hi> therefore doe not at all now wonder, if hauing found affaires diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to receiue ſuch impreſſions, as you pleaſed to put vpon them, you haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto cauſed them to fall out indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well, or if you haue not as yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any confiderable errours in the mannaging of State-affaires, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any matter of difficulty to ouercome, you haue onely herein ſuffered your ſelfe to be guided by common and ordinary preſidents. But what is all this? that your indeauours ſhould deſerue to be preferred before all thoſe ſeruices the <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> with their Predeceſſors haue performed. Had you any imagination, when you ſpake in ſo high tearmes, you could cauſe vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ſo great improbabilities; or had you ſo poore an Opinion of all mens iudgements, as to ſuppoſe wee more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued your feares and continuall diſtruſts, then ſo many generous actions, performed by them in the eye of all Chriſtendome, for the glory and reputation of this Crowne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>I</hi> will not touch vpon the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:3669:196"/>
merits of the liuing, leſt you ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that to a deſire of complacency, or ſome particular obligation, which the onely intereſt of truth exacteth of me. <hi>I</hi> onely require iuſtice for the dead, whom you haue dared to wrong in the Kings preſence, againſt all rules of Piety, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging you to reſpect their memory. Doubt not, but that they are yet ſenſible of things in this world, and that amidſt the glory and contentments they poſſeſſe, their care to liue in the good odour of men, doth yet continue: You may therefore well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, they haue iuſt cauſe to thinke, thoſe liues they haue loſt in their Princes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and for the defence of their Country, had beene ill imployed, and might iuſtly complaine of our ingratitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould we ſuffer before our eyes their reputations to be queſtioned, without teſtifying any diſtaſte. In vaine had they triumphed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the moſt beautifull parts of the earth, and carryed their victorious Armes where the name of <hi>France</hi> was not yet arriued. To ſmall purpoſe had they recluded the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:3669:197"/>
power of ſtrangers, wherein the limits <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> preſcribed vnto them. In vaine likewiſe, euen in our memory had they conſerued <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> when thoſe of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction did diuerſly labour the ruine of both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould you now be ſuffered to enter into compariſon with them; or as though the poſſeſſion of that glory wherein they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies remained, were vniuſtly controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their caſe. But the miſchiefe herein is, that we haue only right on our ſide, and that all things are ſo auerſe vnto vs, as it wil be very hard to cauſe reaſon to be ſo much as regarded, becauſe it fauours vs; ſo as I get nothing by diſputing with a man who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue <hi>Lawes,</hi> and in whoſe behalfe, the King hath receiued ſo aduantagious impreſsions, as he may ſecurely exerciſe his paſsions, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of his <hi>authority,</hi> and confound his particular enmities, togetherwith the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the <hi>Common-wealth. I</hi> ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leath to ſay you are growne to ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or that out of vanity and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, two imperfections purely humane, you ſhould ſo ſuddainly ſtept into <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:3669:197"/>
two Diabolicall <hi>Errors.</hi> Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, if hauing great power in the Kings breaſt, (as indeed you may do much, you cauſe a generall diffidence therein of all things, and indeauour to bring his beſt ſeruants into ſuſpition with him, thereby to make them vnvſefull: if you intend by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary <hi>iealouſies</hi> to diuert his inclination from that goodneſſe, whereto at all times it hath had an extraordinary propention; or if you hinder him from the free vſe of his naturall <hi>debonarity</hi> toward her, who brought him into this World. Do you not thinke men willbeginne to ſay, it is not vanity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hath ſpoyled you? and that it will not be generally wiſhed, that the <hi>Maximes</hi> you make vſe of, were ſomewhat more <hi>Christian,</hi> and leſſe contrary to <hi>Gods Commandments. I</hi> know we haue a <hi>Prince</hi> of ſuch perfection, as <hi>Heauen</hi> it ſelfe cannot without miracle make farther addition, then <hi>Experience.</hi> So time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a wiſe man, hath ſcarce euer bin; all his inclinations do wholy ayme at good, and <hi>Vertue</hi> is to him ſo naturall, as <hi>I</hi> verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue he would be much troubled to do ill.
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:3669:198"/>
But you are not ignorant that one cannot giue poyſon to any man ſo eaſily, as to him who in taking it, ſuppoſeth he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wholeſome Phiſicke, and that ill counſells haue neuer ſo great power ouer our ſpirits, as when wee embrace them without diſtruſt. Surely the vttermoſt of euills is that, whereof we haue neither knowledge nor apprehenſion; nor is there any fault more dangerous, then when we make vſe of reaſon it ſelfe in our errours. I haue no purpoſe to offend any with my diſcourſe, and doe intreate you to beleeue, <hi>I</hi> thinke it very well you make vſe of all the meanes, you ſuppoſe, may conduce to the cauſing the Kings authority to become more awfull to all men, and publicke peace further confirmed. Theſe are two ſo delicate matters, as they cannot be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched without danger, nor conſerued with ouer-much care. Yet muſt you pardon me, if <hi>J</hi> ſay you are to bee very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, leſt in thinking to ſtrengthen this authority, you abuſe it not to the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of your owne Conſcience; and you
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:3669:198"/>
are withall to conſider, that <hi>Peace</hi> cannot be of any long continuance, if it be not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God, who hath neuer ſuffered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſentment, that the Lawes of Nature ſhould be violated. Theſe Lawes the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> themſelues allow of, haue not beene eſtabliſhed either by force, or neceſſity, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are: The firſt thing we can doe, is to follow them, and the obedience wee yeelde them, can neither be milder, nor more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: They are not engrauen vpon Marble, but are borne with vs; they are not peculiar to one people or Countrey, but are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men: They haue not ordayned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny puniſhment for thoſe who will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them, ſo was it not probable, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny could be found ſo much their owne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as to be inclined to ſuch extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. To conclude, they were not made for the meane and vulgar people onely, but for all the world: and thoſe are the more ſtrictly thereto obliged, who owe moſt to their extraction. If this be true (as you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know) ſhould not Heauen be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured? things both <hi>Diuine</hi> and <hi>Morall,</hi> ſhould
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:3669:199"/>
they not be openly diſpiſed, would not Nature her ſelfe cry vengeance againſt you, ſhould you by your crafts and diſguiſements animate a young Prince againſt that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who of all the world, ought to be moſt deare vnto him, and deface out of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſoule by your ſeruile feares (ill founded) his firſt and moſt innocent affections? I will not beleeue for mine owne content, and the honour of our age, that this miſchiefe can happen; but I am much perplexed to know who it is, that cauſeth all honeſt men to ſigh, who hindreth vs the perfect feeling of that felicity <hi>peace</hi> affords, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionateth euen ſtrangers, who are leaſt intereſſed in our affaires. Will you haue ſo ſauage a ſoule, as to dread the faireſt thing the world affoordeth? or can you be ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimous, as to haue any timorous reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon an afflicted perſon? Can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine goodneſſe it ſelfe ſhould doe hurt, or that the Court cannot without danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what it hath heretofore ſeene with ſo great contentment? For my part, if this be thus, I finde no difference betweene a loſt
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:3669:199"/>
ſtate, and one concerning it ſelfe in this ſort; and it muſt needes be, thoſe miſeries you apprehend, are very violent, if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede your remedies. Alas, if we haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten we are Chriſtians, ſhall wee not at leaſt remember we are men? if we be almoſt inſenſible, euen to brutality, ſhall wee not yet affoord ſomething to apparance? Be ſatisfied in being in eſtimation and fauour with the King: Gouerne alone, (if you can) all his affaires; adminiſter <hi>Iuſtice</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſiſtant; take all his authority into your owne hands; yet ſuffer his <hi>Mother</hi> to ſee him, giue way that hee refuſe her not a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, which he cannot hinder, euen his very enemies, ſometimes from enioying. Affoord, ſince it is in your power, this fauour to all <hi>France;</hi> appeaſe in time thoſe publicke complaints ready to riſe againſt you, and ſlackning ſome part of your rigorous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, adde this onely point, deficient in the felicity of this Kings reigne. If you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſo pious a thing, and ſo pleaſing to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> this great reputation of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty</hi> you haue ſhrewdly hazarded, will
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:3669:200"/>
returne with more glitter, and luſter then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it had; wee will not beleeue our owne eyes, if they ſhew vs any thing oppoſite thereunto: Wee will ſuppoſe it is ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who had a deſire to outſtrip the <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>P.</hi> and how there is not any apparance, that a man in whom age ought to finiſh, what the ſtudy of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> had happily left vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, ſhould ſtill be ſubiect to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to errours. But if on the other ſide, you goe on in abuſing our good Kings facility, and vnprofitably to perplexe his ſpirits with perpetuall diſtruſts, if you diſguiſe all things vnto him, on purpoſe to cauſe him to perceiue nothing, but what you pleaſe, not to take notice of ill, being hidden vnder the apparance of its contrary; perſwade not your ſelfe, that <hi>God</hi> will long ſuffer <hi>Truth</hi> to be unknowne. Doe not thinke, but things will ſhortly returne to the ſame tearmes wherein <hi>Nature</hi> placed them; or that the <hi>King</hi> hauing once diſcouered the bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of his Fauousites, will not eaſily be induced once againe to amaze the whole world, by a ſecond example of his <hi>Iuſtice,</hi>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:3669:200"/>
and to ſatisfie his peoples complaints, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning them to Publicke vengeance. Then will you ouer-late reflect vpon this worlds vanity: you will then conſider, that when wee eſteemed you happy, you are mounted to a place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence there is not any, who haue not fallen, and how <hi>Fortune</hi> enuious of your felicity, drew you from that ſweete and peaceable life, wherein you were entred; fearing leſt thereby you might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue your <hi>Vertue,</hi> or therein auoide your ruine.</p>

               <p>A Lame Foote-man would haue made more haſte then the Meſſenger did, who deliuered me your two <hi>Letters,</hi> fifteene dayes after the latter of them was written: Yet notwithſtanding was he very welcome,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:3669:205"/>
and had it beene <hi>Lyſander</hi> himſelfe, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newes from you, hee had beene inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to all my Lackies; and I had receiued him as my Friend. Truely, there is not a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny diſcontent which is not loſt, in the ioy I receiue to be beloued by you, and if the ſmall diſpleaſure they haue done mee, were of power to offend me, <hi>I</hi> ſhould in your fauours finde the remedy others ſeeke for in reuenge. I haue as vnmouedly read the <hi>Satyre</hi> made againſt mee, as I write this <hi>Letter;</hi> and haue onely accuſed my bad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which hath at all times choſen the moſt infamous of all men for mine enemies: you cannot imagine how much I am aſhamed of this vnlucky accident, and of the wrong I ſuppoſe I receiue, when at any time they giue mee the aduantage in a compariſon wherein <hi>Lyſander</hi> cannot enter without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the better of it. Yet <hi>Sir,</hi> I am reſolued to haue patience, prouided, the Warre you raiſe againſt me, be onely feigned, and that you ſpeake not ſeriouſly; for ſurely <hi>I</hi> would burne all my papers, werethey culpable of one ſingle word diſpleaſing vnto you; and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:3669:205"/>
my thoughts ſhould be farre different from my intention, had I done any thing diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto you; howſoeuer, I craue pardon for the fault whereof you accuſe me, though I ſuppoſe <hi>I</hi> haue not done you any ſo ill offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to faire Ladies, as it ſeemes you would perſwade me: On the contrary, if my teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony be ſeconded by their aſcents, there will not be hereafter any among them, who will not looke vpon you, as at one of their chiefeſt felicities; and who will not ſell all her Pearles, to purchaſe one of your Nights.

As for deuoute perſons, <hi>I</hi> doe not thinke they will ranke <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> in the number of <hi>Vices;</hi> for by that reaſon they ſhould hold all thoſe for <hi>Saints,</hi> whom the Courts of <hi>Parliament</hi> haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as impotent, and ſo fill <hi>Heauen</hi> with ſicke folkes.

and I muſt ſay, your viſits will be ſuſpicious to thoſe who know you not: But when they ſhall vnderſtand what I intend to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in all places, that you had rather dye, then violate with ſo much as one ſingle thought, the lawes of true <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> and that your fidelity is irreproueable: Inſteade of auoyding you, as an obiect of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, they will propound you to their Wiues as an example of <hi>Continency.

               <p>THere is no other meanes to exceed the hight of what you haue written, nor to anſwer the ciuilities of your <hi>Letter,</hi> but only by rendring you all your owne words,

I know not your meaning: but to take the moſt vnprofitable of your Friends, for your benefactor, and to thanke me for the ill I doe you, is no leſſe then ſtrangely to abuſe the propriety of words, eſpecially for a man ſo perfectly acquainted with our language, as your ſelfe; or queſtionleſſe it muſt needes be, you ſuffer my perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the like patience, as good men receiue thoſe afflictions God layes vpon them. For as loſſes and diſeaſes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and fauours in tearmes of Deuotion; ſo doe you beſtow pompous names vpon poore matters, and you make your ſelfe beleeue, you ſhall draw ſome aduantage out of my Amity, though in truth you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract nothing thence but charge; nor doth it produce any better effects, then thornes: And vpon the matter, what elſe are the paines and affaires, I perpetually put vpon you; or what difference is there betweene the hatred of an Enemy, and ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome an affection as mine? It is <hi>I</hi> who diſturbe your reſt, who vſurpe your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who will not ſuffer you to haue any

It is no want of good-will in me, that <hi>I</hi> change not all your kindneſſe into choller, and make not a pleader and wrangler of the beſt tempered ſpirit Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy euer receiued from Nature; <hi>I</hi> lay Ambuſhes for you at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Fontaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,</hi> and at St. <hi>Germaines:</hi> Yea, ſhould you thinke to hide your ſelfe at the worlds end, to auoide importunities, <hi>I</hi> would vndertake the voyage of <hi>Magellan,</hi> to ſeeke you out there: yet are you well pleaſed with all this, and <hi>I</hi> receiue thankes inſtead of expecting ill words. The care you haue to oblige me, exceedes all I can deſire: Good offices come thicke vpon me, when they proceede from your ſide; and they are actions it ſeemes you are pleaſed to conuert into habitudes. Without entring into infinities, doe I not of recent memory owe to your teſtimony, all the good opinion your excellent friend can haue of me; and if hee imagine I am worthy any eſtimation, is it not you who ſets a value vpon my defects, and who

But in what ſort ſoeuer you haue procured me theſe fauours, be it that therein you haue either committed theft, or made an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, <hi>I</hi> am ſtill right happy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued by a man, who hath the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to affect ill things, and to pleaſe whom, it is as much as to be reckoned in the number of honeſt men.

I know well, that <hi>French</hi> ſpirits are ſworne Enemies to all ſorts of bondage, and that twelue hundred yeares of Monarchy, hath not beene of power to make them loſe their liberty, it being as naturall to them as life it ſelfe. Whatſoeuer vgly face they frame to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and how full of Tygers and Serpents ſoeuer they paint the ſame, yet do I finde it right neceſſary in this Kingdome: For beſides that, it would cauſe (as in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy)</hi> euen the wicked in ſome ſort, to reſemble the Vpright, and vice not at all to offend the publicke Eye: it would beſides
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:3669:209"/>
hinder Fooles from filling the World with their baſtardly Bookes, and the faults of Schoole maiſters from being as frequent as thoſe are of Magiſtrates, and Generals of Armies. Truly it is a ſhame there are Lawes againſt thoſe who counterfeite Coynes and falſifie Merchandizes; yet that ſuch are freely permitted who corrupt Phyloſophy and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, and who violate thoſe things, the Vulgar ought no more to meddle with, then with State gouernment, or Religious Myſteries. The late great Plague was of ſmall conſideration in compariſon of this, which checkes all the World: and ſurely, if ſpeedy order be not taken, the multiplicity of our Authors, will make a Lybrary as big as <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein there ſhall ſcarcely be found one good word, or reaſonable conceit. Theſe be the fruites ariſing out of inordinate idleneſſe, and the third ſcourge cauſed by Peace, ſent to afflict this poore Realme after Duels, and Law-ſuites. There are hardly any to be found, who are contented to keep their faults and follies to themſelues, or to ſin in ſecret; but are alſo doting vpon their
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:3669:210"/>
owne follies, as they deſire to engraue them in Marble and Braſſe, thereby to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternize their memory, and to make them paſt retracting. Now to returne to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of whom you particularly required my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and who indeede is the firſt ſubiect of this <hi>Letter.</hi> I muſt ingeniouſly confeſſe vnto you, that next to <hi>Beere</hi> and <hi>Pbyſicke,</hi> I neuer found any thing ſo diſtaſtefull as his works: he wanteth (almoſt throughout) euen naturall <hi>Logicke,</hi> yea that part thereof which prooueth men to be reaſonable creatures. In three words hee ſpeakes foure bad ones, and as he alwayes ſtrayeth from the ſubiect whereof he treateth, ſo doth he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily talke in an vnknowne language; though he intend to ſpeake French: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides yce it ſelfe is not more cold then his conceites, and when he deſires to be face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious (as at euery turne hee faine would) he had neede to be in fee with his Reader, to make him laugh, as at Funerals in <hi>Paris,</hi> weepers are vſually hired for money. There is no queſtion but truth were of far more force, and diſarmed, then it can
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:3669:210"/>
be with the aſſiſtance this ſimple Fellow would ſtriue to affoord her: Now ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch men were ingaged in the right, without any treacherous deſigne, yet is it as much as to abandon Gods cauſe, to ſuffer it to be ſupported by ſo weake and vnworthy Pennes. The <hi>Renegadoes</hi> haue not ſo much wronged Chriſtianity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as thoſe who haue not valiantly defended themſelues againſt the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and ſuch who through defect of conduct and skill, though they wanted neither zeale, nor affection, ſuffer themſelues to be ſurpriſed by the ſame aduantages, they otherwiſe might haue had ouer their enemies. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Empire of the wicked doth much more maintaine it ſelfe by our puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, then by its owne power or forces; nor doth any thing cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vertue to be ſo badly followed, as doth the weake and vnskilfull teaching and explanation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. It were therefore requiſite, ſome wiſe man, who had beene in this Countrey, where there is continuall debate, and where there is neuer eyther peace or truce,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:3669:211"/>
(called the Colledge of <hi>Sarbow;)</hi> and who beſides had the art to make good things gratefull, and could bring matters to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement by a ſweete hand; ſhould come to cleanſe the Court from thoſe opinions lately introduced, and cure Soules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of wounding them with iniuries. It was that great Cardinall who triumphed ouer all humane ſpirits, and whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ſhall euer be ſacred, ſo long as there remaine any Alltars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that oblarion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on Earth. It was <hi>I</hi> ſay the Cardinall of <hi>Perron,</hi> who was able to ſhew <hi>Epiourus</hi> himſelfe, ſomething more ſublime and tranſcendent then this life, and cauſe his fleſhy ſoule to be capeable of the greateſt ſecrets of Chriſtian Religion. Though this man had a dignity equall in hight to the greateſt Conquerors and Monarchs: Yet had he (in what concerned Religion) an heart as humble as that of decreped men and Infants. How often hath hee (with thoſe two different qualities) impoſed ſilence vpon all Philoſophyi, and ſpoken of Diuine matters, with as great perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity

But by what I can gather, he is notwithſtanding in good repute in the

Vpon my <hi>Conſcience</hi> it is not out of mine owne ambition that <hi>J</hi> am high-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but out of my Fathers; and if people of his time had not meaſured things by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents, and had not belecued thoſe onely to be wiſe, who are fortunate, I ſhould not haue buſied my ſelfe in ſearching at <hi>Paris,</hi> for
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:3669:219"/>
what I ought to haue found in my ſelfe: But truely I haue ſo great obligation to ſo good a Father, and the care he hath taken to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the good graine he hath caſt into mee, and to finiſh mee after hee had framed me; haue beene ſo great and paſsionate, as there is no reaſon, I ſhould follow my priuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, by reſiſting his intention.
