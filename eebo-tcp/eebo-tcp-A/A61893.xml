            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I was (lately) at Warwick, I purposed to have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you, but <hi>I</hi> was told by a Person of Quality and of your acquaintance that you were gone to Oxford, with a great carriage of Books, to write against the Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and the reason of this enterprize was given to your disswading Friends, that the Society did design to bring in Poperty.</p>
            <p>The accusation (1 confe§) seemed to me very strange, but what was more wonderful, is such mighty Zeal for any one Religion and against That. This calleth to my mind a discourse which you made one day at White-Hall to a Christ-Church Man and my self immediately after your return from Jamaica, where you told us of a Provincial of the Dominicans, who being a Prisoner there, had perswaded you to go and live with him in the Spanish Plantations, as being a place, in wich you might very gainfully practice Physick; and Nothing, as you said, hindred your complyance with his overtures, but only this, that you could not have carried away hereafter the Effects of your estate, but must have left it, if you had left the Country.</p>
            <p>In all which account of the transactions betwixt that Provincial (who was of the Inquisition) and your self, you skewed so much gentle calmne§ of mind in the affair of changing Religion, that I was almost ready to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that some one had stoln your Name and put it to the Censure; till I was better informed that your quarrel to this Assembly is so unappeasable, that you would fall out with any Religion, which they favoured, and that if they had of each kind amongst them, you would entertain no sort at all.</p>
            <p>I must profe§ I always esteemed you (by your Printed Papers) a Man of excellent contradicting parts, and I thought you would in this book have done as good service to Aristotle, as a grave Dignitary of Canterbury hath lately rendred to him, when he very industriously maintains that the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher in his Ethicks did teach, what is the <hi>summum bonum,</hi> as well as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58715:3"/>
David could, when he set himself on purpose to treat of the same Argument in the first Psal. or that you would have repeated some of the least natural experiments, laught at them, and then with very good conduct of stile made all the rest appear ridiculous. But you'l say that may be done hereafter, but a present Religion, Religion is in danger, and therefore you must succour your Dear Mother the Church of England. It is done like a good Child: and further I must commend you as a generous enemy in your censure of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. He is a Clergy-man, and herein you challenge him at his own Weapon: And if you vanquish him in this Encounter, you may expect to make both your Reputation and his lo§ very considerable, being that in England a Church-man suffers more for being Popishly affected, then for being a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the New Philosophy. But i'le tell you what falls out very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily.</p>
            <p>This History was not Licensed (as could have been wisht) by the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Royal Society: For then a Man might have charged every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and pernicious Paragraph upon that large body of Men, but so it is that it comes abroad into the World with an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> from Secretary Morrice, of whom we cannot perswade the people to believe otherwise, but that he stands two or three removes off from Popery. But now at last give me leave as a By-stander to lock over your Game, and privately to advize you where the other side may espy any advantage. As the first instance of a passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in the History Destructive to the Religion and Church of England, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>While the Bishops of Rome did assume an infallibility, and a Sovereign Dominion over our Faith, the reformed Churches did not only justly refuse to grant them that, but some of them thought themselves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to forbear all Communion, and would not give them that respect, which possibly might belong to so Antient, and so Famous a Church, and which might still have been allowed it without any danger of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</hi> If any one should undertake a defence against your censure, it is probable that he would say somewhat to this purpose, that by Communion there mentioned the Author did not mean, that the reformed Churches should joyn with them in all or the most important acts of worship, being that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they must at all adventures yeild to the points of the controversie, wich the Roman infallibility would thrust upon them, for he tells us that our Churches did justly refuse to grant them that, but he explains what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by Communion, when he doth immediately add that they refused to give them that respect, &amp;c. Now who can say that Communion if taken for Divine Worship can be the same with respect that it stewed to a Society of Men; and whereas you seem to argue from the notion of the word Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as if it were the same with the Lords Supper, it may by replyed, that the one sence, wherein it may be understood throughout the whole Scripture is, a friendly and charitable action, and from this we cannot except that verse, which you alledge, and in this sence it is not impious to say that we should not forbear all Communion, or deny to give that respect which possibly might belong to so ancient, and so famous a Church. Nor can I see that these Titles bestowed on Rome are so faulty, since there are methods of speech in our language suitable hereunto, whereby we call that antient and famous, not which is so at present, but what was such a long time ago, and continued the same for a great while. But I will grant that this is not the necessary, but only the possible meaning of this Historian;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58715:3"/>
Yet at least if the contrary intimation be so hainous, good Nature should oblige to understand the phrase in the most favourable manner: but supposing he thought that Rome even at the reformation of others, (though it self was not amended) might neverthele§ be called a Church, he said no more then what the most learned amongst the German Divines, though warm with disputes, did readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It was usual with them to say that the Church of Rome was truly a Church, notwithstanding that it abounded in many and dangerous errours, seeing that they retained the main Doctrines of Christian Religion, and they indeavoured to clear their assertion by comparing it to a diseased body, which yet is as truly a humane body, as it is a diseased one.</p>
            <p>And if it may be termed a Church, it is without doubt very antient and famous too, for what it hath been of old as to the piety and learning of many Inhabitants of that City; and still is Famous for that precedency, which any Herauld would assign to it in a free Assembly of Western Bishops.</p>
            <p>So that from what hath been discoursed in this matter may be inferred, that though the Authour meant not, that we must communicate with them in the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisting Offices of adoration, yet (for any thing I perceive) he needs not to account them of that Church to be unto us as Heathens, or of such a Number of Men with whom we may not so much as eat, but that we may maintain a Communion of friendship with the professed of that Religion, whose morals may afford an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or whose learning might advance our knowledge. And the reformed must still keep the hearty Charity for the Romanist, that after succe§le§ debates, though managed with reason and temper, he should still indeavour to improve him in all the uncontroverted instances of goodne§ and vertue; such an exercise of Friendship and Charity as this is a Noble and Religious Communion, it is an exhorting one another in our most Holy Faith, it is an exact obedience to ihat command; <hi>That as far as we have already attained we should walk by the same rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the next exception which you have against the same passage, <hi>viz.</hi> His mistake in making the Papal Infallibility to be the grand occasion of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt the reformed Religion and Papist, I must tell you that he may well enough defend himself, though indeed you pre§ closer in this then in the former objection against all Communion with Rome. You say that only Parasiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canonists did ascribe to the Pope such a Sovereign Dominion over our Faith: I suppose you mean at the reformation, though you cite many Authours much later, and if so I shall only referr you to the report, which <hi>Cassander</hi> gives of those days, in his Judgement which he passes on the controversies, <hi>viz.</hi> That then they made the Pope but little le§ then God, that they set his Authority not only above the Church, but above the Scriptures to, and made his sentences equal to divine Oracles, and to be an <hi>infallible rule of Faith,</hi> and (as he further proceeds) though there was another sort of people in the Church, yet they were such as were obscure and concealed.</p>
            <p>Again though it were granted that infallibility lay in a Councel, yet the Pope had the executive power of those decrees and Canons, which passed by so high an Authority, and hereupon might be troublesome with an Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity derived from others, and impose little things as absolutely necessary in their own nature: and this practice of the Bishops of Rome (amongst others) caused those of Germany to stand off from the Roman Church.</p>
            <p>But for a fuller proof against the Authour of the History, you alledge, that erronious Doctrine about indulgences was the primary occasion of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58715:4"/>
Protestancy. What you say is so far true, the first occasion of <hi>Luthers</hi> publick invectives against the Court of Rome, but for a good while after he maintained Communion as a member of that Church. This is manifest to any one, that is but in a small measure acquainted with the Histories of those times; but at last when he saw there was no hopes of Reformation in this and other instances of gross abuse, he utterly leaves them as past all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood of recovery.</p>
            <p>So that I have now prepared the cause depending betwixt you and him, and made it ready for a Tryal, and it may be determined by finding out the true account of the Grand hinderance of a Reformation at Rome. Your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary might give a very fair proof, that it was mainly a reputed infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. This is evident in the impartial History of the Councel of Trent, where we read of a consultation held by Pope Advian VI. with some Cardinals for an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what was amiss, more particularly about the matter of Indulgences, after that much had been said by himself and another against the mistakes and ill practices in that affair, and after that he had declared his Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for the regulating thereof, he was soon turned from his Former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by Cardinal <hi>Soderinus</hi> an old Politician, and one who well understood the Frame of that Church. This Man informs the Pope that any Reformation was dangerous for Rome, because that this would implicitely yeild that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what was amiss, and that possibly they might erre in more, whereas the successes of Rome, against such opposers were obtained by vouching for what ever was blamed and by proceeding against them as Hereticks.</p>
            <p>This made Adrian to bewail the unhappy condition of Popes, who might not reform at home, if they would. And now at last you seem to make infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility so small a thing even in their own esteem, that as you cite the words of a late writer amongst them, their Infallibility is limited to Tradition, and is spiritually assisted in the Faithful reporting of what hath been delivered. It is easie to see thorough this harmless pretence of your judicious Authour.</p>
            <p>For to be the sole and undoubted witness in their own cause on which sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence must follow in course is equally advantagious, as if they were taken for infallible judges. Thus the Jews who did so highly advance the credit of their Rabbinical traditions as thereby to make void the Law of God, doe not (as we see in <hi>Abravanel</hi>) own any more then only that they expound and stew the Articles of Faith; yet that Jew, who shall despise or jeer at the Teachers of those traditions, shall not (according to their Fundamentalls) have a part in the life to come. And at the same rate may the Former sort of men denounce <hi>Anathema's</hi> if you believe not their report, though in matters, which are not only, not certain, but withall are unreasonable, ridiculous and impossible.</p>
            <p>Another passage in the History is brought in by you, and deaply charg'd to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Analogy of Faith and Scripture (to wit) <hi>He</hi> (the Natural and Experimental Philosopher) <hi>will be led to admire the wonderful contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the creation, and so to apply and direct his praises aright, which, no doubt, when they are offer'd up to Heaven from the mouth of one that hath well studied what he commends will be more suitable to the Divine nature, than the blind applauses of the ignorant.</hi> This (you say) makes the acceptableness of all mens Prayers to depend more or less on the study of natural Phylosophy. But the Authors words may by asserted by the whole contexture of that Section, that he therein answers an objection, and clearly shews that the study of experimental Phylosophy is not injurious to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58715:4"/>
the worship of God; he supposeth the person already a Christian; and then he praises God more beartily for some examples of power and wisdom, which he by inquiry hath found out, but others have not; for when a man praiseth God with understanding for what he discovers particularly in the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of Gods own hand, his praises must needs be more suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the same subject, then are those general thanksgivings, wherein a man that hath not meditated on the works of Creation, blesses God still for them, but cannot say how far these exceed the utmost productions of art, or the improved power of natural causes. Thus the commendation of any workmanship, if given by a great Master in that Art, is more satisfactory to the Artificer, then the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring noise of the multitude, who probably may misplace their greatest wonder upon that wich is the least thing in it. And now (pray) what harm in all this, and yet the Authour (as far as I can see) speaks no worser, but much very well, in the following clauses, against Atheism. But if I may ask you to what end do you chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge his words <hi>Praises</hi> into <hi>Prayers?</hi> was it, that you might prove (as you do) that Christ is our Mediator? he never did deny it.</p>
            <p>But, methinks, this would be a pritty <hi>Medium</hi> to prove the not-suitableness of experimental Philosophy to a Christian. You then proceed to make an apology for Ignorance, because that of those who were first called, there were not many wise after the flesh. To which may by replyed, that this will avail little, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that by the phrase, <hi>wise after the slesh,</hi> is meant subtle and designing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who by their politick managery of a cause though not good, might propagate and spread it for self ends, so that it should find a general entertainment in the world. There was no such thing as this in the first advancement of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But that the ignorance of the professors hereof was not acceptable to the Authour of our Faith, is manifest; for that he endowed his Scholars with the gift of tongues and such utterance, which their enemies were not able to resist. You add immediately after the Text, that it was intended of the Virtuosi, why so? Is it, because they are wise? I am confident you will not say that this is the reason. They have taken that course, that will scarce ever make them appear wise to the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted World, they are too timerous in what they affirm, they lay by much of that wordy Philosophy, which furnishes men with expressions hard to be understood and therefore is admirable, it makes a brave found to the ear, nay more then all this, it supplies one with such useful distinctions that he may affirm plausibly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he will, but instead hereof they practice a plain Trades-man like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in Philosophy, instead of axiomes and good old sayings concerning nature and matter and substantial Forms, which have salved a thousand difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Nothing will serve them for proof in Physicks, but experiments and some what that is obvious to the sences; they must have new Fashion'd <hi>Telescopes</hi> wherewith to gaze upon the Heavens, and Glasses invented to espy <hi>Atomes,</hi> and Furnaces for dissolution of bodies, and for other unheard of curiosities, and yet though they do dissolve the <hi>compositum</hi> into its constituting parts they would never yet reveal to the Aristotelian what kind of a thing their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Form is, which (they are well assured) is one principle in that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Whereas (Sir) you have a nearer way to learning then that wherein they go on. You became an excellent. Astronomer by reading a Systeme of the <hi>Ptolomaean Hypothesis,</hi> and have no reason to suspect or search further as long as you believe nothing about the Doctrine of the Sphere, out what you have learn'd from those institutions, you need not to pore with a microscope upon those minute figurings of bodies, thereby to guess how they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58715:5"/>
produce such &amp; such effects. You can answer any ordinary question in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the <hi>4.</hi> first qualities &amp; their seconds; by the conjugation &amp; sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicalness of the qualities, by natures abhorrency of a <hi>vacuum,</hi> by the keen Appetite, which the first matter (of which we know very much Negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vely) bears towards a Form. Nay further, if any man should demand a Resolution of the greatest problems, as of the Loadstone or the like, you are not constrained to make such a pittifull Reply, as many others must do, you can readily inform them, that it is either done by Familiarity of substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which causes similar attraction, or by a sympathy, and that the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone and the Iron do earn till they arrive at their mutual embraces; but if any one be so much a Novelist, as to urge, that such affections as these cannot be found, except there be in these bodies at least a sensitive Life, you can bid them then take this answer for your last, I say it is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an occult quality.</p>
            <p>There is yet another piece of learning that is Chymistry, in which with a little adoe you can equal their attainments had through a process and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious course. For the whole of what they pretend in this drudging Art, is no more then the solution and coagulation of bodies: by the first of these they with a great deal of cost indeavour to separate their three Elements, but you (Sir) more cheaply can shew your four Elements parting asunder at the dissolution of the mixt body. It is but laying of a green stick upon the other fuell already inflamed, immediately the Element of Air comes away in smoak, that of fire in the warm blaze, the Elementary water is that hissing juice at the end of the stick, and the Element of the earth is the remaining Askes, which if it be in the Grate will by its own inward propensity (if it can) slide away down to the Hearth, because the Hearth is nearer to the Center of the Earth then the Grate is; for it is well known that every weighty body hath a great affection to that Center. So that I think now you have outdone them at this trick, and you will not be behind them at the other, to wit, Coagulation. They are pleased to say that they Coagulate a body when they bring it from a liquid or humid to a solid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. This fine feat you so well understand and it is so much beneath you that you leave it to the Apothecaries boy, when you prescribe troches for colds, besides Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water and Sugar, &amp;c. to make this solid, you appoint White Starch <hi>q. s.</hi> and then refer it to the discretion of the lad to be made <hi>S. a.</hi> and here is so good a Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that you never desire to learn any other kind of it as long as you live, except it be the secret of making the hard Sea-bisket. No more at present of the comparison betwixt your Philosophy and theirs. As I read on further in your censure I saw you were angry with this Authour, whom you have chosen for an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, because he saith that <hi>Religion ought not to be the subject of dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;</hi> in the sense wherein he speaks it, he is not singular, nor left almost alone, he discourseth of those Divines, who have mixed and kneaded into one lump the Doctrines of Christian Religion, and the Notions of the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick Philosophy, and hereby have twined into a dispute much of that which primitively was matter of practical Holine§: yet on the other side there is a sort of men, who would le§ regard Religion, if it were not the subject of disputation, like Hunts-men who are better pleased in following then in catching the Hare; you further tax him with introducing hereby a Popish implicite faith, whereas a little observation will discover, that this sort of Faith hath grown, and a better hath decayed upon the general respect, which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58715:5"/>
now blamed by him hath found amongst those, whom we call <hi>Divines of the Schools.,</hi> more usually and properly then <hi>Doctors of the Church.</hi> A man doth then implicitely believe, when he doth not cleerly and distinctly apprehend. So that he that speaks not so, as to be plainly understood, causes either that nothing which he saith should be believed, or else that it should be received as true in the Popish fashion, that is he bestows his vote and assent to be disposed on by another at pleasure. So that hence you may judge who it is, who draws on a novice in Religion the nearest towards wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his belief up within the faith of another, whether he who contends for so much plainne§, that the things propounded need not to be the-subject of disputation, or rather he who seems profound and wise in his sentences, yet doth so darken his wisedom with words, that the person to be instructed hath by this means no other way left but to believe that which he cannot understand. You produce some sacred testimonies to evince a necessity of divine illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet do not apply them to the present discourse of the Authour, which is concerning School Divinity; but had you meant it of this, I must have said with you that the obscurity of those writings would have made such a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation necessary, had not the smalne§ of their worth rendred them almost usele§. It seems to me but reasonable, that as all the Books of Christian Religion hope for acceptance, because they profe§ to be agreeable to the truths of Scripture; so further if they design publick benefit, they should imitate the perspicuity and openne§ of the Evangelick Style. There is one argument against the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour not inconsiderable, to which you have some reference, (that is) the study of such controversies, distinctions, and terms are of great use when we have to deal with a Papist disputant. Its very true, yet it proves not any excellency in that knowledge of it self, but meerly in relation to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary; though we have fresh instances of worthy persons amongst us, who have with good advantage managed the debate in behalf of our Church against that of Rome, without much help from those Schools: yet that sort of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even for this reason, may still be maintained, in the same manner as tradesmen who lie on the English borders towards <hi>Wales,</hi> usually keep a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to jabber Welsh (though no learned language) to the <hi>Brittains</hi> their customers. The next words of the History <hi>R. S.</hi> which receive a check are these, <hi>The grounds whereon the Church of England proceeds, are different from those of the Separatists, and also of the Church of Rome: and they are no other but the rights of the Civil power, the imitation of the first uncorrupt Churches, and the Scriptures expounded by reason.</hi> Though I cannot find any such passage in the page to which you send the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet I will take it upon trust, seeing that you have not till now misrecited any thing out of his book, that which offends you is, that he would have the Scripture expounded by reason. This appears to you like Socinianisme, but I remember the Calvinists direct to as much as this implies. They say that we must expound particular passages in Scripture by the main ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the whole discourse, that we must consider the phrase, whether literal or figurative, that we must observe all the circumstances of person, time, place, and what else is of any moment, And now (pray) say whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these directions can be practised but by reason, and if not, whether be who expounds Scripture by these rules, may not be truly said to expound it by reason: he doth not say that a man should not acknowledge Scripture, if it teach any thing more then those sentiments which reason had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58715:6"/>
before it was acquainted with divine writings. You would have them to expound the Scriptures by the authority of the ancient Fathers, when they see why they should do it, they at the same time expound by reason, if without cause given, they take up the Fathers sence in that implicite Faith against which you did lately declaim. The last Objection which you offer against this History, is about what he saith of wit, that it may be borrowed from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that this wit is (as he represents it) magnificent, appears to the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and judicious Reader: and that it may without offence be borrowed is as manifest to him, who gives himself the pleasure to peruse the Greek and Latine Divine Poems both antient and modern, which fetch their or naments as well as materials from the Bible. But you'l say however Scripture-expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions ought not to be applyed (as our authour would) to natural things. I see no reason which binders, especially when natural things become the occasion of divine praises, and furthermore, where as many Scripture expressions were by way of accomodation transferred higher from things natural, they lose not their original suitablene§, and when they are brought back and lower in our discourses, it may rather be said of them, that they are repaid then that they are borrowed; nor doth the meanest of the matter to which any saying is fitted out of Scripture, straightway make it unlawfull to be lent for a while; as for example the primitive <hi>Ignatius</hi> in one of his genuine Epistles, which was written (if I mistake not) to the <hi>Tralliani</hi> applies otherwise these words of our Saviour to his Disciples concerning those extraordinary assistances which they needed to receive from him: <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> And affirms that as our Saviour spake these words to his disciples, so a Bishop may say to his Presbyters, without me ye can do nothing. Yet I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe§ that I am very sensible of the indignities and scorns which the sacred word of God suffers from a sort of persons, whose quality is better then their converse, they are such who are scarce ever guilty of wit or raillery, but when they are ingeniously prophane or blaspemous. The intemperance of these should lay a resiraint upen the sober &amp; discreet least by an innocent use of a little liberty, they should unawares give any countenance to other mens extravagancies. You tell us upon this argument, how severe the jews are in this case. The most that wee meet with neer this purpose concerning them discovers not so much a holy reverence, as a stupid folly. They pronounce (as in a former instance so on this) that no few shall have a part in the world to come, who shall spit out, when he names God, or shall speak the Tetragrammaton in a forreigne tongue out of the Sanctuary. There is one thing at the end of your censure which is very unkind, and contrary to the law of common humanity; I speak of your sharp reflexion on an excellent person deceased Mr. <hi>Cowley,</hi> these younger fancies ought not after death to becomes his reproach, especially since he left a charge, that what was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive in his Poems might be omitted: though it was judged by others, that he had written nothing, but what (with his own sober correction of himself, and an equitable allowance of charity) might well pa§ abroad in publique. You know that those who weeded out the worst of <hi>Beza's</hi> youthful verses, and presented them in one bundle to the world, purchasd more shame to themselves then to the Poet. It is now time that I should put an end to this tedious Letter, and I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest that you would excuse my plain dealing; do not suspect that (upon some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of friendship or acquaintance) I am too inclinable to vindicate the Authour of this History. I dare assure you I know him not otherwise then by face, and

What apprehensions then might you have, least if he should happen to have nothing else to doe, be should write the History of your life, and herein (as is usuall) describe your person, and enquire into Physiognomy, what temper of mind you must profess, and give a Catalogue of Books written by you, and shew in how many press-warrs you have served as a volunteer: But now that I have done, I have time to think, what a deal of needless labour I have bestowed to write, more then what you will have patience to read.

Though none be more communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative naturally them <hi>my self,</hi> yet the R.

               </q>—I never saw any ground for an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion approaching <hi>near to this;</hi> except you make the exposition to be <hi>this,</hi> That if the collection of all that runs in <hi>many Years</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted together, it may amount to so much; which, I believe, <hi>may be true:</hi> but this seems not the Genuine import of <hi>his words:</hi> and in no other sense are they to be verified.

very defective: the time he proposes to draw it, is <hi>about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of March:</hi> but I avow, that who stays so long may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lose his opportunity.

Moreover, when the first <hi>brute</hi> of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to write against the R. S. did reach <hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>R. M.</hi> writ to the Lady <hi>E.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58715:11"/>
excepting this <hi>History:</hi> and if I would civilly represent unto them any defaults therein, they would take it kindly, and amend them. Hereupon I writ unto Him, as a Person whom I greatly honor, and who hath in all his undertakings and employments (which have been neither mean nor facile) expressed a <hi>wit, prudence,</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> that is <hi>uncommon:</hi> to which, if I adde those other Imbellishments, which his Mathematical and other Natural Studies, have qualifyed him with, this Age can hardly equal Him: To Him I writ, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the <hi>Indignities</hi> put upon my faculty by Mr. <hi>Glanvill,</hi> and their <hi>History,</hi> represented the Pernicious tendency of those Books, in reference to the <hi>Monarchy, Religion,</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> of this Kingdom: and DEMANDED that the R.

After that they had denyed me the returns of Common Equity, I proceeded in that manner which I need not relate: The Concerns they all along express'd, were more then a little tenderness for a <hi>Fellow of the R.

The whole effects of the <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> are yielded unto me: for the Design I pursued, and which I said <hi>I would make them to doe,</hi> was the <hi>disclaiming of their History:</hi> and having <hi>done this,</hi> I am sure I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a <hi>considerable service</hi> to my Country; and all other Disputes are but Circumstantial, and such as Conquerors often meet with, after an entire Rout, to be encumbred with some Parties of the <hi>scattered Enemy,</hi> and to be amused with <hi>Retrenchments,</hi> and <hi>Passes.</hi> But this Renunciation contents not me, because it is not <hi>avowed,</hi> nor <hi>solemn,</hi> and in such form as to conclude <hi>them</hi> beyond their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: <hi>I will make them not only to disown the Book, but the Contents thereof,</hi> as not containing <hi>their Sentiments;</hi> and to adde, that they <hi>condemn all such, as under pretence of new and Experimental Philosophy,</hi> or any Mechanical Education, do decry <hi>all Learning, and vary that breeding which is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the welfare of our Monarchy, Religion and Kingdom.</hi> Let <hi>Them</hi> but declare this <hi>effectually,</hi> and I shall impose a Silence upon my self, and willingly sink under their <hi>malice and obloquy</hi> for the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick utility.</hi>

            <p>Having thus acknowledged, that the R.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58715:27"/>
great confidence grounded upon a bare Reference to an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> which he hath not at hand: thus these <hi>Virtuosi</hi> may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess the unwary into an ill Opinion of their <hi>Adversaries,</hi> whereas they that know them <hi>as well as I do,</hi> will suspend their <hi>Assent</hi> till more diligent enquiry convince them. Have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed my Reader that <hi>this Book, Caesalpinus,</hi> Sir <hi>H. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> Lectures, and many others, have no <hi>Index</hi>'s, I proceed to repeat the entire Discourse of Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> out of the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion my Antagonist follows, <hi>pag.</hi> 102, 103. <q>But to say no more of the contingent Observations to be taken notice of in tryals Medical, I could tell you that I have observed even <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical</hi> Writers themselves to deliver such Observations as do not regularly hold true. For although it hath been looked upon as their Priviledge and Glory to affirm nothing but what they can prove by no less than Demonstration; and though they use to be more attentive and exact then most other Men, in making al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most any kind of Philosophical Observations; yet the Certainty and Accurateness which is attributed to what they deliver, must be <hi>restrained to what they teach concerning those purely-Mathematical Disciplines, Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> where the affections of Quantity are Abstractedly considered: But we must not expect from Mathematicians the same accurateness when they deliver Observations concerning such things wherein 'tis not only Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and Figure, but Matter and its other Affections, that must be considered. And yet <hi>less must this be expected,</hi> when they deliver such Observations <hi>as,</hi> being made by the help of material Instruments, framed by the Hands and Tooles of Men, <hi>cannot but in divers cases be subject to some, if not many Imperfections upon their account.</hi> Divers of the Modern Astronomers have so written of the Spots and more shining Parts, or (as they call them) <hi>Faculae,</hi> that appear upon or about the Sun, as to make their Reader, presume, that at least some of them are almost always to be seen there. And I am willing to think, that it was their having so often met with such <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the Sun, that made them to write as they did. And yet, when I first applyed my self to the Contemplation of these late Discoveries, though I wanted neither good Telescopes, nor a dark Room to bring the Species of the Sun into, yet it was not till after a great while, and a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of fruitless Observations made at several times, that I could detect any of those Solar spots, which having dured many Moneths at least, appear'd so much seldomer then it seems they did before, that I remember a most Ingenious Professor of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58715:28"/>
excellently well furnished with Dioptrical Glasses, did about that time complain to me, that for I know not how long he had not been able to see the Sun spotted. And as for the <hi>Faculae,</hi> which are written of as such ordinary <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> I must profess to you, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that a multitude of Observations made with good Telescopes at several places and times, whil'st the Sun was spotted, has scarce made me see above once any of the so look'd for Brightnesses.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>And as the nature of the Material Object wherewith the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician is conversant, may thus deceive the Expectations grounded on what he delivers; so may the like happen by reason of the imperfection of the Instruments, which he must make use of in the sensible Observations whereon the mixt Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, (as Astronomy, Geography, Opticks, &amp;c.) are in great part built. This is but too manifest in the disagreeing Supputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that famous Writers, as well Modern as Ancient, have given us of the circuit of the Terrestrial Globe, of the distance and bigness of the fixed Stars, and some of the Planets, nay and of the heighth of Mountains: which disagreement, as it may oftentimes proceed from the different Method, and unequal skill of the several Observers, so it may in divers cases be imputed to the greater or less exactness and manageableness of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments employed by them. And on this occasion I cannot omit that sober Confession and Advertisement that I met with in the Noble <hi>Tycho,</hi> who having laid out, besides his Time and Industry, much greater sums of Money on Instruments, then any Man we have heard of in latter Times, deserves to be listned to on this Theam; concerning which, he hath (among other things) the following Passage.

Quare magis requiritur in Instrumentis Astronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis quae omni vitio careant construendis, artificium pari judicio conjunctum, quàm hactenùs à quamplurimis animadversum est.

            </q>
            <p>Out of this Discourse of Mr. Boyles, tis evident that He doth believe that Mathematicians when they deale in those Disciplines, which are not purely-Mathematical, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider Matter with its Figure, Quantity, &amp; other Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons', are not so accurate &amp; certain in what they converse with, as in those other parts of pure-Mathematicks: and this is much lesse to be expected, when they deliver such Observations as, being made by the help of Material Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments framed by the hands and Tooles of men, CANNOT but in divers cases be subject unto some, if not many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections upon their account. The Assumption is easy, Viz. But Opticks are a part of the mixt Mathematicks; and the Telescopes are Material Instruments framed by the hands and Tooles of Men, and consequently CANNOT but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cases be subject unto Some, if not Many Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Therfore in Opticks, and about Telescopes, Mr. Boyle doth not believe there is such a certainty as exempts us from Fallacy: which is the thing now in Question. To evince the deceitfulnesse in mixt-Mathematicks, our Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Author proceeds to instance in the Spots and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses related by Scheiner, Galileo, &amp; Zucchius &amp;c. to be in the Sunne: of which those Writers pretend to be so assured by reiterated Experiments, that they have described their Number, Figures, &amp; determinate Motion, which they most regularly observe. Mr. B. finds himself disappointed upon inquiry, though made my good Telescopes, and all other requisite circumstances observ'd. And many fruitlesse Essayes passed, before he effected any part of his designe. He doth not say, THEY WERE NOT THERE: but that Hee could not see them of a long time: nor did the Phaenomenon then agree to the accounts of Scheiner, (Whom Zucchius doth justify by modern observations.) And to what purpose was this discourse with Pyrophilus,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58715:29"/>
about the deceivableness of Opticks, if he supposed his glasses true, and that the spots were absent at that time? I profess I doe not understand the coherence of the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with what follows, if he meant as Mr. Glanvil impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him. What hath the variation of the object to doe with this remarque of his? Are mixt-Mathematicks &amp; Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks deceitful, because the Telescopes shew those <hi>Maeulae &amp; faculae</hi> in the sunne, when they are there, &amp; omit them when they are not there? Are our eyes fallacious when they represent the object accordingly as it alters? or would not any man argue hence for proof of their certainty.</p>
            <p>I have set down the passage faithfully, without chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an expression, as Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> does: and leave it to every mans tryal, if he can impose any other meaning on these words, then that either the Telescopes of those <note place="margin">Vel sola incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia, quae patet in <hi>Schei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neri</hi> experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis <hi>argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae.</hi> Ricciolus Astronom.<hi>l.1.de</hi> sole. <hi>c. 12. § 15.</hi>
               </note> other Astronomers, or those of Mr. B. were fallacious. If none can; then is it true that He as well as Mr. <hi>Crosse</hi> did believe that Opticks might deceive our judgements, &amp; that Telescopes were not so certain as Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> sayes they are: As for what Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> addes that he will shew that most of my objections to argue the fallacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Telescopes prove only the diversity and changes of the Mediums and celestial Phaenomena, not the deceit of those Glasses, tis a vain Rhodomontade, and not to be made good by one that is unacquainted with those studyes. It is undenyably true, that Long Telescopes shew more spots then the shorter: and that some Telescopes doe take of those radiations which others doe continue: and tis no lefse manifest, that the most judicious men doe complain that the Telescopes did deceive their Adversaryes, as not being good, whilest theirs did represent at the same time the same object under a different phasis. I have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated this so largely, that I need not pursue the discourse farther: and whosoever reads what I have written, will see that Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> mistook himself in saying indefinitely, That Telescopes are as certain as our Eyes: And that they alter the objects in nothing but their proportions. For this is false, except you limit the saying to some Telescopes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58715:29"/>
employed upon some objects; and that here on earth. And if the ordinary Telescopes (against which I have alledged so many complaints) were as certain as our eyes, how comes it to passe that so many men differ about the celestial phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena totally, betwixt whom there would be no disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about terrene objects. But if they were as certain as our eyes (which I have demonstrated they are not here on earth) yet the employing of that only sense would never assure us of what we see. I remember not long agoe two miles distant from any town, in a dark night I observed some thing on the ground that very much resembled a glow-worme, but the light was not so pale, and the body seemed a little bigger. Being surprised at this unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual sight, I lighted from my horse, and found the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed glow-worme to be a piece of lighted Touch-wood, which through the bedewed grasse had deluded me, a Baker having sate down there to smoak a pipe. I did then call to mind that saying of Galileo, that notwithstanding all our Telescopes, twill be more easy for us to conceive that which is not in the Moon, then that which is. But I leave the reader to compare both our writings, and judge how satisfactory his Answers are; and how foolishly he now defends the Letter of his <hi>Plus ultra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not anticipate my compleat answer by insisting upon any more passages of this nature: I adde only that I did long agoe request of Mr. <hi>Glanvil,</hi> that he would not give me any trouble by multiplying of lies; for though I knew that the refutation of them would be to my advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, yet I had too much busyness amidst my practice to pursue it. But neither his duty to God, nor regard to the Ministry (which suffers in him) could restrain him from these exorbitances. He hath promised to be my VASSAL <note place="margin">P. 161.</note> and VICTIME, if he doe not prove all he sayes against me: Yet l have demonstrated to the R. S. under a NOTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIES HAND, that my Head is not Red; though he say it. And whereas he abuseth me for styling my self in one book, Physitian to his Majesty in the Island of Jamaica; l was honoured with that Title by the King, and as such receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58715:30"/>
200<hi rend="sup">lb</hi>. at my goeing thither, his Majesty being graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleased to specify in the warrant (preserved in the Signet-office) that HE INTENDED ME FOR HIS PHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SITIAN THERE. I have collected several more untruths in my Answer, &amp; intend to demand the performance of his so solemn promise: If he fail not of his word, I will take care he shall live better, preach better, and write better. One lye I must now take notice of briefly, and tis this, That Mr. <hi>Crosse</hi> did hire me to oppose our Ecebolius; and by treating me at <hi>Bathe,</hi> and entertaining me divers <note place="margin">Pag. 181.190.</note> times at his House with deare welcome, gain'd a person to his rescue, who before contemned him. I doe profess in the first place that my tongue was never guilty of those <note place="margin">I suppose he means <hi>OLD FOOL.</hi>
               </note> expressions he sets down. I never call'd him Old—nor said I would rescue the poor fellow. I did say that I would rescue in great part the poor old man. And that he had been as it were asleep, or buried for these 30 or 40 years in the Country, and knew not the transactions of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world. Neither doth He pretend thereto, as our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Virtuoso</hi> does. But this doth not diminish that respect which is due to him as a Divine, and as such, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. I have heard the B. of <hi>Chester</hi> give him a much greater character then Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> allows him: and tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously known how eminent his repute was at <hi>Lincolne</hi> College, and what esteem many honorable and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing persons have for him. I adde, that He neither hired me, nor treated me at <hi>Bathe,</hi> except with one or two bottles of wine (for I did not dine with him,) nor was I ever but once at his house, where the entertainment was such as the Village affoorded, and my unexpected coming permitted: and then was the Book finished and almost all printed. I never had the least PRESENT from him in my life: nor did I see his Book till mine was all finished, except what relates to the world in the Moon, &amp; a voyage thither, of which Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> writes nothing now, nor informs us where those wings are to be bought that may supply so much as the flying Coaches. I found
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58715:30"/>
that most of Mr. <hi>Crosses</hi> Book was personall, and I did not understand what to conclude about so <hi>different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> as I met with about <hi>that conference,</hi> till Hee, in whose house it was informed me, that all Mr <hi>Glanvill</hi> said was <hi>not true:</hi> and I am not yet convinced by the <hi>certificate,</hi> how it was possible for <hi>those</hi> to warrant the <hi>exactnesse</hi> &amp; <hi>sincerity of the relation,</hi> since that the meeting was <hi>impremeditated;</hi> the <hi>discourse</hi> without <hi>designe,</hi> &amp; <hi>desultory,</hi> &amp; <hi>interrupted</hi> by others that were there, and hath received much of <hi>inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement</hi> in the <hi>writing</hi> beyond what was <hi>there spoken.</hi> But I leave that to <hi>their consciences,</hi> which if they beare any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to that of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Glanvills,</hi> neither shall M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>It may not be amisse here to professe that respect for the <hi>Royall Society</hi> which doth become me: I doe avow all <hi>just esteeme</hi> for the <hi>Institution;</hi> though I cannot rise so high in its commendation, as the <hi>Historian:</hi> I think it might have added to the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and beene of great <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to learning,</hi> had the <hi>designes</hi> of the <hi>Royall Founder,</hi> and those <hi>persons of Honour</hi> which joyn'd with it, been <hi>diligently</hi> &amp; <hi>prudently</hi> pursued. <hi rend="margQuotes">Their purpose being at first, to make faithfull <hi>records</hi> of all the works of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Art,</hi> which can come within their reach: that so the present Age, and posterity, might be able to put a mark on the Errours, which have beene strengthned by long prescription: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Truthes, that have laine neglected; to push on those which are already known, to more various uses: and to make the way more passable to what remaines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed. </hi> It was never my intention to <hi>detract</hi> from the <hi>laudable purposes</hi> of my <hi>Prince,</hi> nor to derogate from those of <hi>Quality</hi> who were <hi>Honorary Members</hi> of it: nor to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with any <hi>Learned men</hi> in it.

The very Word <hi>Mechanism</hi> imports thus much: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an allusion to the <hi>conformation of Machines,</hi> wherein each part contributes to the effect according to its Scituation, Size, and the Geometrical Proportion it bears to the other Parts, of which the <hi>Machine</hi> is composed: And if the <hi>Machine</hi> do not produce its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect entirely, by vertue of such a <hi>Geometrical frame,</hi> we do not say that the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> is <hi>Mechanical.</hi> Thus the Motion of a Water, or Clock, when it ariseth from its Fabrick purely, then it is <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical:</hi> but when a Man <hi>doth winde it up,</hi> 'tis not a <hi>Mechanical</hi> motion, except it do also appear that Man is also a <hi>Machine,</hi> and that what <hi>he</hi> operates at <hi>that time,</hi> is purely <hi>Mechanical.</hi> I would not insist upon this Argument from the <hi>denomination</hi> of the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> if it were not manifest that they that profess it, did not desire to be understood so: for the whole <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the <hi>Cartesians</hi> doth depend hereon: and Sir <hi>K. Digby,</hi> in his <hi>Vegetation of Plants</hi> (a Discourse made in the R.

Thus the <hi>floating Corpuscles</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> or <hi>Nitre,</hi> are <hi>Mechanically,</hi> or by the <hi>Geometrical necessity</hi> of their own Figures and Motions, together with the impulse of other Corpuscles in the Air, Liquor, or Vessel, acting in the same <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical subordination of Causes,</hi> precipitated and sized into their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Crystals of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Nitre:</hi> thus Plants are said to be Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and the actions of <hi>Animals</hi> produced, and all the <hi>vicissitudes of Nature</hi> to be NOTHING ELSE. And I am willing to allow your Quibble, that this is the <hi>Mechanical Belief of credulity;</hi> but you must not go about to perswade me, that <hi>this</hi> is not also that <hi>Philosophy</hi> which is properly <hi>Mechanical,</hi> and which your Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian doth assert: You understand not the <hi>state of the Question,</hi> nor what you have <hi>done,</hi> or you <hi>prevaricate</hi> when you fay, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Philosophy you oppose, is such a Mechanical one as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, <hi>That matter having such a quantity of motion as it has, would contrive it self into all the</hi> Phaenomena <hi>we see in nature.</hi> For these Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers do not ascribe Prudence or Contrivance unto Matter, or say that Matter can Operate upon, or alter it self, being both Agent and Patient, but that God hath so altered the World, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived Matter and its Motions, that it runs into all these <hi>Phanomena</hi>

which we make use of our selves?

And I am the more resolute herein, because I finde you thus interposing in the behalf of <hi>Men</hi> whom no Proposals or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of mine have been able to reduce unto a Declaration, concerning those <hi>controverted Points</hi> in the <hi>History:</hi> and <hi>you</hi> are pleased so to interest your self, as to <hi>maintain Vntruths</hi> concerning <hi>them,</hi> and to inodiate me most <hi>maliciously,</hi> who threw my self upon the action without any other expectation then that of <hi>Certain Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</hi> Had <hi>you</hi> had any sense of <hi>piety;</hi> had the <hi>Divine life</hi> fixed in a <hi>Divine body</hi> (and transcending <hi>dry Reason,</hi> in the guidance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, a Man should either immediatly feel and smell out by an holy sagacity, what is <hi>right</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and what <hi>false</hi> and <hi>perverse;</hi> or at least, he shall use his <hi>reason</hi> aright to discover it:) had this swayed in <hi>you, My Vndertaking</hi> had became Dr. <hi>More:</hi> But since <hi>your</hi> Actions are a greater evidence against <hi>you,</hi> then any <hi>specious Words</hi> can be for <hi>you;</hi> since Mr. <hi>Glanvills</hi> honour is dearer unto <hi>you</hi> then <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Church of England,</hi> I do conclude with this advise, that instead of a new <hi>Enchiridion Metaphysicum,</hi> you would write a <hi>retraction</hi> of your <hi>Printed Works,</hi> and leave off to play, as it were, at <hi>Boe-peep</hi> with Atheism, by defending Christianity with ridiculous Arguments. When the <hi>Manichees,</hi> those <hi>Pythagorick</hi> and <hi>Cabbalisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:58715:40"/>
Christians did arise and oppose <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> even <hi>Diocletian</hi> did make a Law, <hi>Nequis religionem Christianam deterioribus religionibus impugnaret.</hi>
