            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head type="sub">To my Learned Friend Mr. <hi>H. Oldenburg</hi> (Secretary to the Royal Society.)</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>BEing at length come to a Reſolution, I have already done ſomething more than barely entred upon that way of Writing, that you and I have more than once Diſcourſed of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and wherein you <hi>particularly</hi> (tho not you <hi>only)</hi> among my Learned Friends, have wiſh'd to ſee me En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not, that I am inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Prejudice which the things I deliver are like to ſuſtain, by the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
<pb facs="tcp:56407:4"/>
Dreſs wherein they muſt appear, in the way of Writing I have pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which being for the moſt part plainly Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and ſet down in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherein, they chanc'd to come to hand, denies moſt of them, not only the uſual Ornaments of other Books, but the allowable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that Method, elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diſcourſes, neat <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes,</hi> and ſubtil Diſputes, are permitted to bring even to Philoſophical Writings.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Conſiderations were over-ſway'd by a ſad one, founded upon the (yet continuing) condition I was in, when I was Debating this matter in my Thoughts. For it having pleaſed God (to whoſe always moſt juſt
<pb facs="tcp:56407:4"/>
Diſpenſations Men ought entirely to ſubmit) to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict me with the Stone and the Palſy; as on one ſide, theſe, added to a ſufficient number of Avocations, ſcarce permit me any great expectation, of finiſhing in a ſhort time the Tracts I had made a leſſer or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Progreſs in, according to my firſt deſign; ſo on the other ſide, my Friends judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unfit, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials provided for theſe more than begun Treatiſes, ſhould be quite loſt, or kept too long uſeleſs, it ſeemed expedient, that as Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould from time to time ſerve, I ſhould look over my Memorials, and other ſcatter'd Papers, to take notice what Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:56407:5"/>
and Obſervations were to be found in them.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe, and the like inducements, having pick'd up ſeveral of my diſperſed Papers, ſome of them Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten many Years ago, and ſome of a leſs ancient date; I began to refer the moſt part of what I found Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical in them, together with ſome few things that did ſeem neceſſary not to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from them, to certain Heads or Titles which I called Chapters; and made them the more numerous, that they might ſingly be the leſs Prolix: And about theſe I muſt deſire your leave to repreſent ſome things, by way of Preface.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, ſeveral of the enſuing Particulars that I
<pb facs="tcp:56407:5"/>
met with among my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, being parts of Eſſays of other Diſcourſes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for haſt Tranſcribed for the moſt part <hi>Verbatim,</hi> as they were couched there; I dare hope for your excuſe, if among ſuch Tranſcripts you now and then meet with things, which, how pertinent ſoever to the Tracts they firſt belong'd to, might have been ſpared as needleſs, if not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Forein; alſo, in the new Form the Diſcourſes are now put into; ſince I could not leave out ſuch unneceſſary Clauſes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of yet I hope you will not find many) without too much mutilating the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or obſcuring the
<pb facs="tcp:56407:6"/>
ſenſe of what is delivered; and I could not alter them, and adapt others to ſupply their places without ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more time, and taking more Pains, than in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I am now in, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you would be willing to condemn me to.</p>
                  <p>Next, I deſpair not but you will allow me the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty I have taken, to vary the Bulk and Method of particular Chapters, as my occaſions would permit, or the plenty or paucity of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials ſuggeſted; or the Nature of the thing I treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and the Scope I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to my ſelf in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, ſeem'd to require. But ſometimes my want of Health and Leiſure, and
<pb facs="tcp:56407:6"/>
my deſire to haſten to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubjects, that either pleaſed me better, or ſeem'd more conſiderable, made ſome of the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, compared with others, but ſhort; eſpecially, if I were ſupplyed but with a number of things pertinent to that Subject, by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers I had then in hand, how much ſoever I may have Written of it in other Papers, which I hope here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be Maſter of.</p>
                  <p>And this Advertiſement may render you a Reaſon why to the Title of ſome of the Chapters I have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned the firſt Section, tho it be not at preſent follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſecond.</p>
                  <p>And, as for my having
<pb facs="tcp:56407:7"/>
imployed very differing Methods in ſome of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing. Tracts, I did it with deſign, as judging ſuch a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Method more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to my purpoſe, than Uniformity in it would have been. For, beſides that ſome of the Treatiſes, vhence theſe Chapters were taken, did, by the ways wherein they were already Written, oblige me, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate my ſelf to their Method; I thought, that if you ſhould ſhew theſe Papers to any, that are very unacquainted (which I have heard you complain, that too many are) with the way of accommodating in ſome tolerable manner, his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries and his Writings to
<pb facs="tcp:56407:7"/>
the ſeveral Subjects he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelf to, he may be ſomewhat helped, by the differing Examples he may here meet with, to make va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations ſomewhat ſuitable to the differing Natures of the Subjects he deals with.</p>
                  <p>But here I muſt beg you to take notice, That, tho in compliance with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as well as for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons, <hi>I</hi> have in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters given intimations and hints of things, which <hi>I</hi> do not there proſecute; and now and then propoſe ſome Conjectures and Opinions, whoſe proof <hi>I</hi> do not inſiſt on; yet <hi>I</hi> am not willing you ſhould think, that, however ſome of thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb facs="tcp:56407:8"/>
may be but occaſional things, mentioned princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to excite, and give hints to the inquiſitive and ſagacious; yet all, or moſt of them, are of the ſame kind; and that <hi>I</hi> thought not on them, but as ſlightly and tranſiently as <hi>I</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned them; and have no better and other Reaſons to alledg for my ſuſpicions or intimations, or even for my conjectures or my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, than thoſe you will meet with in Papers haſtily drawn up; eſpecially ſince, <hi>I</hi> think, <hi>I</hi> can ſhew you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the things deliver'd in thoſe paſſages, enlarg'd and render'd at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or practicable in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſcourſes, that for
<pb facs="tcp:56407:8"/>
certain Reaſons do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company theſe <hi>I</hi> now ſend you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> expect, that you ſhould think it ſomewhat ſtrange, to find many of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Experiments ſet down much leſs circumſtantially than thoſe that are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the <hi>Phyſico-Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Experiments touching the Air; in the Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Cold, and in ſome other Books of Mine that you have been pleas'd to peruſe. But on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion give me leave to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you, that the nature of divers of the former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, eſpecially Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical ones, and my aims in mentioning them, being
<pb facs="tcp:56407:9"/>
conſidered, it ſeem'd not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite they ſhould be more fully Treated of: And as for others, tho the brevity and diſpatch; which divers reaſons made me propoſe to my ſelf, had not forbidden me to amplify; yet <hi>I</hi> daily feel my leiſure, not to ſay my Life too; ſo torn piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in my preſent condition, that was never a Profeſſor of Philoſophy, nor ſo much as a Gown-man; to have made ſhift to make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and Obſervations he communicates, and ſet them down truly and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, without fraudulently concealing any part of them, for fear they ſhould make againſt him. And tho perhaps you will eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that in divers of the Experiments which I have but briefly mention'd, I have been as diligent an Obſerver of Circumſtances, as I was wont to be when I made thoſe, which have had the luck to be taken notice of for being fully related; and tho it may be alſo, that
<pb facs="tcp:56407:10"/>
ſome Scruples or Objections, which my brevity may in part occaſion, were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen by me, and might have been avoided by a more copious and diffus'd way of Writing; yet I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely decline ſuch a way of delivering things, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the reaſons above mention'd; and becauſe I ſuppoſe them that may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe theſe Papers, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Publiſhed Writings, and to have either from them, or otherwiſe, underſtood the way of making ſuch Experiments as mine; but alſo, becauſe, tho <hi>I</hi> wanted Time and Health, much leſs than <hi>I</hi> do, <hi>I</hi> ſhould not think it fit too much to prevent

                     <hi>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> will quickly diſcern that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapters could not be intended for compleat Tracts, about the Subjects handl'd in them. And indeed they were intended but for ſuch</hi> Memoirs <hi>about the Various particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Subjects they Treat of, as may be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Solid Natural Hiſtory that has been nobly deſign'd and is ſtill proſecuted, by the Royal Society. Wherefore ſince (at leaſt in our Age) no Writer that I know of, has ſo early and ſo well, both urg'd the neceſſity of Natural Hiſtory, and promoted divers Parts of it by Precepts and</hi> Specimens, <hi>as the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Lord</hi> Verulam; <hi>I ſhall not ſcruple in the way or manner of Writing theſe ſhort Collections of mine, to make uſe ſomewhat frequently of his Authority and Examples; but without Confining my ſelf to either.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>Agreeably to this Advertiſement you will find, that ſome of the Particulars that the following Treatiſe conſiſts of, are ſingle and as it were, Independent ones; upon which account they reſemble thoſe which in the</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulamian Sylva, <hi>or Natural Hiſtory, are call'd</hi> Experiments Solitary: <hi>And have for that reaſon induc'd me to give that Title
<pb facs="tcp:56407:12"/>
to each of the ſeveral Chapters that are made up of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Another ſort of Chapters there is, wherein divers Experiments and Obſervations, all of them relating to the ſame Subject or Purpoſe, are ſet down together.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>My haſt, tho not that only, induc'd me to make one ſort of Chapters more, that partly agrees with, and partly differs from each of the two that I come from mentioning: For in every one of theſe Chapters, there are two or three, if not more, ſingle or</hi> Solitary Experiments; <hi>and there are alſo others that have ſome kind of</hi> Connexion <hi>among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as being referable to the ſame Subject or Purpoſe. On that ſcore the Title that is given to each of the Chapters of this Third ſort, is that of</hi> Miſcellaneous Experiments; <hi>and ſometimes (but ſeldomer) of</hi> Promiſcuous Ones. <hi>And all the Particulars that I refer to the three foremention'd Heads, are caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Chapters, <hi>wherein the ſeveral kinds are
<pb facs="tcp:56407:12"/>
diſtinguiſh'd only by their</hi> Titles, <hi>or not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>There is one Advertiſement that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards all the ſorts of Particulars that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to the foremention'd Chapters, which is, that I have uſually comprehended Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as Tryals, nuder the Title of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments; which I have done, not only upon the Authority, and in following the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Judicious Chancellor (as is every where obvious in his</hi> Sylva Sylvarum) <hi>but for other reaſons too. For both the ſorts of Particulars may paſs for matters of Fact, and ſo are Hiſtorical, taking the word in a lax ſenſe, and the imploying it in that ſenſe, makes the Articles or Paſſages, whereof the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and other parts of our Collection conſists, much more commodious for References and Citations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>Beſides the three foremention'd kinds of Chapters, you will meet in the enſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe with another ſort of Writings, whereof ſome are almoſt entire, and others Fragments of larger Diſcourſes. In neither of theſe, I did confine my ſelf ſo much to matters of Fact, as in thoſe Chapters that conſiſt of</hi> Experiments <hi>and</hi> Obſervations; <hi>but took the liberty, as occaſion requir'd, to inlarge in Diſcourſes, and ſometimes to Cite ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages out of other Mens Writings, as I judg'd I could make ſome pertinent Application or uſe of, perhaps unthought of by the Author.
<pb facs="tcp:56407:13"/>
And theſe Papers being moſt, if not all of them Written in a more free and diſcurſive way, I thought fit to ſeparate them from the Sets of Collections that are almoſt merely Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical; and accordingly I have not ſtyl'd them</hi> Chapters, <hi>but</hi> Titles; <hi>and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to aſſign them, as I did the others, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Numbers; which I deſire likewiſe you would not prefix to any of them, becauſe I am not yet reſolv'd how I ſhall diſpoſe of them, either by ſupplying what is wanting to finiſh any one, or more of them, or by taking to pieces, and imploying thoſe pieces as Materials for other Tracts.</hi>

VII. <hi>Among the Experiments our Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſists of, there is here and there one, to which it was thought fit to add ſomething, either by way of Explication, or of Illuſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of Confirmation, or of Anſwer to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, or of Theorical Reflection, or of Practical Application,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And theſe Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Additions it was thought fit to call ſometimes Annotations, but oftner</hi> Scholiums, <hi>becauſe that Term is freely us'd in a very comprehenſive Senſe by Mathematical Writers. But tho I readily acknowledg that this Term has been chiefly imploy'd by Mathematicians, yet the uſe of it has not been ſo confin'd to them, but that good Authors in other parts of Learning have not ſcrupl'd to imploy it, as may appear by the</hi> Scholiums <hi>that ſome Learned Phyſicians have Written upon</hi> Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius, <hi>an eminent Perſon of their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as alſo by the Example of the famous and Experienc'd</hi> Foreſtus, <hi>who has not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſubjoin'd</hi> Scholiums, <hi>even to his own Medicinal</hi> Obſervations.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. <hi>The mention of theſe</hi> Scholia <hi>prompts me to tell you, I had almoſt forgotten, but yet muſt not leave unmention'd, that I thought fit now and then to premiſe to Sets of</hi> Experiments, <hi>and ſometimes (tho more ſeldom) to a ſingle</hi> Obſervation <hi>a ſhort Preamble by way of Introduction, which may often excuſe the need of ſubjoyning a</hi> Scholium; <hi>and may be warranted by the Example of the Lord</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="9">IX. <hi>If among my own Experiments, namely, thoſe that I have made or ſeen, I have ſometimes inſerted</hi> Experiments <hi>or</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations <hi>that are not ſo: I have not done it without reaſon, and am authoris'd in that Practice, by frequent Examples afforded me by the firſt, if not only Author that I know of, that gave us a Set of Precepts of well writing Natural Hiſtory, our often cited</hi> Verulam, <hi>whoſe Centuries do in great part conſist of borrow'd</hi> Experiments <hi>and</hi> Obſervations; <hi>without which, he was ſenſible that his</hi> Sylva <hi>must be of too narrow a compaſs, or too thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtock't with Plants, eſpecially with Trees. And indeed 'tis not to be expected, that, as the Silk-worm draws her whole Manſion alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of her own Bowels, ſo a ſingle man ſhould be able to write a Natural Hiſtory out of his own Experiments and Thoughts. And he that will ſtrictly confine himſelf to thoſe, will be often reduc'd to omit things very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, if not neceſſary, to his Subject, which is of practice ſtudiouſly declin'd by me, who prefer the Readers <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility, to the ambition'd

Glory of being thought to borrow nothing from any Body. And I can add in my Defence, at leaſt my Excuſe, that I have made uſe but of a ſmall part of the Liberty allow'd me by the Example of ſo great a Guide in the way of Writing Natural Hiſtory. For I have very much ſeldomer than he, employ'd the Tryals of others; and have yet ſeldomer mention'd unverifi'd Reports or vulgar Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, being careful that the Bulk of the Matters of Fact I deliver, ſhould conſist of things, whereof I was my ſelf an Actor, or an Eye witneſs; and that the comparatively few borrow'd Experiments that I added, (that I might not deprive my Reader of ſome things very pertinent and uſeful to my Subject) were receiv'd from Perſons of very good credit; beſides that I do not only frequently give ſufficient Intimation in the</hi> Experiment <hi>or</hi> Obſervation <hi>its ſelf, but oftentimes by plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Letter</hi> C <hi>in the Margent, do give notice; nay, and ſometimes to a whole Set, prefix the Title of Communicated</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>or</hi> Obſervations.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56407:16"/>
that I think we muſt want Curioſity or Gratitude, if we neglect either <hi>to</hi> take notice of any Experienc'd <hi>Phoenomena</hi> that directly relate to ſo abſtruſe a Subject, or, by conſigning them to Paper, <hi>to</hi> preſerve them from Oblivion. 'Tis chiefly by this Conſideration, <hi>Pyrophilus,</hi> that I am induc'd to mention to you the following Experiments and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, made moſt of them by the help of the Fire. For, tho ſome of them may ſeem but ſlight; yet they may not prove unuſeful, towards diſcovering the Nature of a Body ſo ſtrange and ſingular, that, for ought is yet manifeſt, any true Magnetical <hi>Phoenomena</hi> may ſomewhat conduce to the knowledg of it, And I was the rather induc'd to make Tryals and Obſervations of this Kind, becauſe moſt of them are ſuch as I have not met with in Authors. And the few that remain, I have not found ſufficiently taken notice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56407:16"/>
of there; Philoſophers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians ayming chiefly, in their Magnetical Writings, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute and apply the Attractive and Directive, and perhaps the Inclinatory, faculty of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. Whereas, throwing into another Paper, what I Obſerv'd, of that kind, I did in the preſent Inquiry mainly intend to make the Loadſtone rather the Object than the Inſtrument of my Tryals: and handling chiefly the very Subſtance of the Stone, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not ſo much to Advance or Apply its Faculties, as to Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and Deſtroy them, tho in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the better knowing of them. Having therefore procured a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of, for the moſt part naked (or uncapt) Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, moſt of them Courſe, but of differing Sizes, Shapes, Colours, and Countries; I made upon them ſeveral Tryals, ſome of which I ſhould immediately proceed to give you a brief Account of, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56407:17"/>
that 'twill be proper to premiſe this ſhort Advertiſement: That, I would not have the Title of theſe Experiments make you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that the Fire ſhould be a main Agent in every one of them, ſince to preſerve ſome few of them, I refer them hither, tho an actual Fire was not Imploy'd to make them: Since the common Rule that <hi>a potiori parte fit denominatio,</hi> will ſuffice to Warrant, or at leaſt excuſe, my giving to this ſmall Collection the Title of <hi>Chymico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Magnetical Experiments;</hi> becauſe the greateſt part were perform'd by the help of the Fire, or Bodies Chymically prepar'd by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it.

And being willing to comply with this Curioſity, I made choice of two ſolid peices of Loadſtone, that were cut almoſt into the form of Cubes; and found that many Colliſions being made between them, eſpecially at the edges; there were produced from Time

                        <p>I have (elſewhere) formerly related, that if an Oblong Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone made glowing hot, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerated Perpendicularly, the lower extream will thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come its Northern Pole.

                           <hi>N. B.</hi> It has been obſerv'd, that if a Loadſtone be made red hot in the Fire, it will ſcarce retain any ſenſible Attractive vertue,

But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that it may be remembred, that I intimated that this is not ſtrictly and univerſally true; for in ſome of our Engliſh Loadſtones, it has been obſerv'd, that Ignition does not only leave them capable of a Directive Vertue, but leaves them alſo a conſiderable Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power, ſo that they will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain a good weight of Steel (as will appear hereafter.)</p>

                        <p>A black Oblong Loadſtone, of a Homogeneous Subſtance, and weighing near three Drams, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been in a Fire of well-kindled Charcoals, Ignited, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo for ſome Minutes, of an Hour; being weighed again as ſoon as it was cool'd, was found to have loſt about ⅝ of a Grain of its firſt Weight, and much of the blackneſs of its Colour.</p>
                        <p>Tho the Affinity between the Loadſtone and Iron, might make one expect that the Fire might have a like Operation upon this Stone, and that out of which Iron is commonly melted, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed Iron-Oars; yet for ſome Reaſons that I cannot now ſtay to mention, I was induc'd to think, that the Effect of Ignition upon thoſe two Bodies might be very differing, as I conceive their Internal and unſeen Texture to

                        <p>We took a [black] Loadſtone, and having by degrees beaten it ſmall, without ſuffering it to touch any Iron or Steel Veſiel or Inſtrument, [which becauſe of the hardneſs of the Stone, was very troubleſome to do;] we ſet aſide the groſſer Grains for other uſes, and upon ſome of the finer Powder we pour'd the Spirit of common Salt, which had at firſt a ſenſible Operation upon it, by producing foetid Fumes, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kind of Ebullition, as that <hi>Menſtruun</hi> is wont to do upon fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Iron or Steel.

judge of the Tincture of its Colour; having formerly found by Tryal, that Spirit of Salt makes a Green Solution of <hi>Mars;</hi> but <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> or Spirit of Nitre, a Reddiſh one. And it was to judge of the Tincture of the Loadſtone, as well as for another purpoſe, that I was ſo careful to keep the Stone from touching Iron, when it was pulveriſing; leaſt by the Hardneſs of it, and the Sharpneſs of its Angles, it ſhould grate off ſome parts of the Metal, and ſo alter the Solution; for want of which Caution, I have known ſome Experiments about Artificial Gems to miſcarry; the Braſs Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein the hard Ingredients were beaten, having communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome Particles to them, that alter'd the Colour which the Maſſe after Vitrification would otherwiſe have been of.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56407:28"/>
I had to the queſtions, I propounded to ſome <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Merchants and Jewellers, that had Opportunity to deal much with thoſe Gems. Part of what I had learn'd about them, I committed from time to time to ſome Papers, which were the main things that ſupply'd me with the following Particulars.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Gems, (to add that upon the by,) may the rather deſerve our Curioſity, becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce they help to maintain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Weſtern and Eaſtern parts of the World, is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. For as ſmall as their Bulk is, their Properties and Mens Opinion, do ſo much recommend them, that I remember one of the moſt famous and intelligent Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of this Nation, (who has been Governor of more than one Trading Company in it,) being enquir'd of by me about the value of the Diamond Trade; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd me, That according to his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56407:29"/>
well-grounded Eſtimate, there came from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> one year with another, to the value of about 350000 <hi>Sterl.</hi> of which about 100000 <hi>l.</hi> came into <hi>England;</hi> which at preſent, becauſe of the prudent Indulgence of the Government, and of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, is become the Mart of Diamonds.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. To prove the great hardneſs of Diamonds, even in compariſon of other Bodies, that are thought wonderfully hard, a famous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt for cutting of Diamonds, in return to ſome queſtions I put him, affirm'd to me, that he could not either Cut or Poliſh Diamonds with any thing but with Diamonds. And he further anſwered me, that if he ſhould employ ſo rough a way, and ſuch forcible Engines to cut Rubies or any other Stones, as he does to cut Diamonds, it would preſently break them in pieces; which the Inſpection of his Engine made very probable to me.</p>

II. A very skilful Cutter and Poliſher of Diamonds (Mr. <hi>L.)</hi> being demanded by me, whether he found that all ſorts of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds were of equal Hardneſs, told me, that having dealt in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds near twenty years in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> and divers years in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> he perceiv'd that there are of later years, brought over worſe and worſe ſorts of Diamonds; ſo that he judges thoſe of the old Rock (as he calls them) either to be quite ſpent in the <hi>Indies</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or at leaſt to be ſeldom or never brought over to us. And he finds ſeveral of recent Diamonds, ſo ſoft and brittle in compariſon of thoſe of the old Rock, that he is oftentimes afraid, or unwilling to meddle with them, leaſt he ſhould ſpoil them in the Cutting or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Notwithſtanding the (late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention'd) wonderful Hardneſs of Diamonds, there is no Truth in the Tradition, as generally as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56407:30"/>
'tis receiv'd, that repreſents Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds as uncapable of being broken by any External force, unleſs they be ſoften'd by being ſteep'd in the Blood of a Goat. For this odd Aſſertion, I find to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by frequent practice of Diamond Cutters: And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly having enquir'd of one of them, to whom abundance of thoſe Gems are brought to be fitted for the Jeweller and Goldſmith, he aſſur'd me, That he makes much of his Powder to Poliſh Diamonds with, only, by beating board Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds (as they call them) in a Steel or Iron Morter, and that he has that way made with eaſe, ſome hundreds of Carrats of Diamond Duſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. 'Tis an Opinion receiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many that deal in Gems, that as Diamonds are the hardeſt of Bodies, ſo the ſame Compactneſs, and their great Solidity, gives them alſo a proportionable Gravity, and makes them extreamly weighty,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56407:30"/>
in reference to their Bulk: And I ſaw in the Hands of a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> a Book (that I could not procure) not long ſince put out by a French Jeweller, who as he affirms, has dealt very much in Diamonds; wherein the Author aſſerts, the great Ponderoſity of theſe Stones, in compariſon of other Bodies. But this Opinion agrees very little with the following Experiment, that I find among others, that I try'd about Gems, Regiſter'd to this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>A rough Diamond ſomewhat dark within, did in a pair of Scales that would turn either way with the 32th part of a Grain, weigh 8 Grains, and eight Sixteenths. This Stone being with care weigh'd in Water, according to the Rules of the Hydroſtaticks; its weight appear'd to be to that of an equal Bulk of that Liquor, as 2 11/23 to 1. So that, as far as can be judg'd by this Tryal, even a Diamond weighs not full thrice as much as Water.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56407:31"/>
V. A famous and experienc'd Cutter of Diamonds, being ask'd by me, whether he did not find ſome rough Diamonds heavier than others of the ſame bigneſs, told me, that he did, eſpecially if ſome of them were Cloudy or foul: Inſomuch that ſhewing me a Diamond that ſeem'd to be about the bigneſs of two ordinary Peaſe or leſs, he affirm'd, That he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found in Diamonds of that bigneſs, compar'd together about a Carrat (or four Grains) diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in point of weight.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. The ſhape or figure of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds is not ſo eaſie to be ſecurely determin'd. For thoſe that are ſeen in Rings and other Jewels, having been by way of Preparation cut and poliſh'd, have chang'd their natural Figures for that which the Artificer thought fit to give them. And rough Diamonds themſelves (which are not obviouſly met with) do oftentimes come to our Hands broken, tho unwillingly, by the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56407:31"/>
Diggers. And thereby unfit to acquaint us with their genuine Shape, which we may alſo miſs of being able to diſcover, on account of the Accidents that the matter they conſiſted of was ſubject to, at their formation in the Mine. For to omit other Proofs, having had a Parcel of between 100 and 150 (if I miſremember not the Number,) put into my Hands at one time in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Houſe to gratifie my Curioſity, I found very few of them compleatly ſhap'd; but moſt of them broken, and of very irregular Figures, like thoſe of ſo much Gravel taken up at adventures upon the Sea-ſhore. But ſome few I ſaw that were pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty regularly figur'd, which proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly were not much hinder'd from ſhooting freely in the Wombs or Cavities, wherein they were Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated or Concreted. And theſe ſeem'd to conſiſt, in my opinion, of ſeveral Triangular Surfaces that were terminated in, or compos'd,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56407:32"/>
diverſe ſolid Angles. And one rough Diamond I had of my own, wherein this Shape was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous than I remember to have ſeen in any other. Beſides having enquir'd of a very experienc'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer, who dealt much in fitting theſe Gems for the Goldſmiths uſe, whether he found rough Diamonds to be of any conſtant Figure, and if he did, what that Figure was? He anſwer'd me, That he always found thoſe that had any conſtant, (or as he meant, regular) Figure, to be in his own Expreſſion ſix corner'd.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Diamonds have in them a Grain (or a determinate tendency of their Fibres, or rather of the thin Plates they are made up. of,) as well as Wood, and may with caſe enough be ſplit along the Grain, tho not againſt it; as I have ſeen a very large Diamond that was cut according to the Grain into three pieces, whereof the middlemoſt, tho large and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56407:32"/>
the thickneſs of a Shilling, was of an even thickneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly flat on both ſides. I have my ſelf a Diamond-Ring, whoſe Stone I would not have poliſh'd, but caus'd it to be ſet rough as Nature produc'd it, becauſe in that ſtate the Grain is manifeſt to the naked Eye, and much more to a Glaſs moderately magnifying the ſeveral Plates it conſiſts of, having their Edges diſtinguiſhable like thoſe of a Book a little open'd. A Cutter of theſe Gems that has had ſtore of them to practiſe his skill on, anſwer'd me, That one good blow may ſplit even great Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, if it be given, as they ſpeak, with the Grain; but againſt the Grain, he affirm'd to me, as dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous and expert an Artificer as he is, that he is not able ſo much as to Cut or Poliſh them.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. The common Colour of Diamond being generally enough known by ſight, 'tis not needful, as it would not be to deſcribe it by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56407:33"/>
Words; but the moſt uſual Colour of theſe Gems is not the only, of which they may ſometimes be found. A great Traveller into the Eaſtern parts of the World aſſur'd me, That he had ſeen ſome of them that were of a pale blewiſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: That famous French Jewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler as well as Traveller, Monſieur <hi>Tavernier,</hi> gives an account of a fair Diamond that he had of a very red colour; and that great. Ornament of our Engliſh Court the D. of <hi>R.</hi> told me, that ſhe was Miſtreſs of a fair one, which tho not of a Ruby, was of a red Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, but not having it at Hand, ſhe could not then ſhew it me: A Relation of mine, in the ſame Court, uſed to wear a Diamond Ring; which tho the Stone was not great, he valu'd at a hundred Pound, becauſe its Colour was of ſo fine a Golden yellow, that I I ſhould have taken it for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Topaz, but that he had ſatisfi'd me 'twas a Diamond to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56407:33"/>
which agreed its great hardneſs, which gave an uncommon Luſter. And I remember, that Surveying attentively a parcel of rough Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds newly brought from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> I perceiv'd among them, beſides ſeveral lighter va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations of Colour. One Stone that was all Green, and that to ſuch a degree, that I doubted not that if it were poliſh'd land ſet, it might paſs for an excellent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merald; and I ſhould have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this Gem to have been really of that kind, but that I found it among Diamonds that belong'd to Merchants too Skilful in thoſe Gems to be impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and which was more, the Stone being yet rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, I found it plainly to have the proper ſhape of a Diamond.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. At the late return of the Ships from <hi>India,</hi> being preſent at the delivery of the Diamonds to the Owners, I obſerv'd one belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant whoſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56407:34"/>
Father was a Cutter of Diamonds, and bred him to the ſame Trade. The Diamond came from the King of <hi>Cholconda,</hi> it was ſhaped (like mine) with fix Triangular ſides, which yet were neither regularly figured nor truly flat, ſome of them being a little Convex, and one of them having a manifeſt and odly-figured Cavity in it. But the Diamond being fair and flawleſs, and ſo thick, that the Merchant told me it would be too deep for one Ring, and that therefore he meant to ſplit it into two. I had it weigh'd, and found it to amount to ten Charats (or 40 Grains). I could eaſily perceive the Grain of this Diamond, which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant alſo acknowledged; who anſwer'd me, that he had never ſeen in Diamonds any Heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous mixture incloſed. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inform'd me, that there was brought him a large Diamond from <hi>Borneo,</hi> that was much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than one I ſhewed him; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56407:34"/>
that he compared it to Soot; but when he had cut and poliſhed it, he and others were much ſurprized to find it a fair and clear Stone, of very great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. The conjecture I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where propos'd, that divers of the real Virtues of Gems may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably deriv'd from the metalline, or mineral tinctures, or other Corpuſeles that were imbody'd with the matter of the Gem, whilſt it was yet fluid, or ſoft, and afterwards concoagulated therewith: This conjecture, I ſay, may be much countenanc'd by the following Relation, which deſerves a place in this Chapter, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its pertinency to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it.</p>
                     <p>I have long ſuſpected that the matter whereof Diamonds mainly conſiſt was, whilſt it was yet <hi>in Solutis Principiis,</hi> impregnated with metalline, and more particularly with martial ones: But by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56407:35"/>
of the dearneſs of thoſe Gems, and ſome other impediments, tho I have ben Maſter of ſeveral Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of differing ſizes, cut, and uncut, yet I could never make a Tryal capable of ſatisfying my curioſity, till having lately met with among other little curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that lay long neglected by me, ſome number of ſmall Diamonds, that I had bought for Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; I conſider'd that their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet rough, and ſo in their Natural State might make them more fit for my purpoſe, and ſo it might that they were not ſo clear as thoſe that we value in Rings, which probably argued their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more of Martial Tincture in them than I ſhould expect in the more Diaphanous: Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I ſay, I took a moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigorous Loadſtone (for 'twas none of the ſtrongeſt I have had) and apply'd it ſucceſſively to five or ſix of theſe ſmall Stones, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving it had any Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56407:35"/>
on them: But when I came to apply it to one more, which look't ſomewhat duller than almoſt any of the reſt, I found that it had in it Particles enough of an Iron nature to make it a Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Body; and obſerv'd without ſurpriſe, that not only it would ſuffer it ſelf to be taken up by the ſtrongeſt Pole of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, but when that Pole was offer'd within a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it would readily leap through the Air to faſten it ſelf to it.</p>
                     <p>I have elſewhere mention'd ſome other Qualities of Diamonds, as beſides their Electrical Vertue, this, That 'tis poſſible that ſome of them may without Fire or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Heat be brought to ſhine; tho among all that I have Try'd, I found but two that I could ſo make Luminous. <hi>One</hi> of theſe belongs to the King, and is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd at the latter end of our <hi>Hiſtory of Colours;</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56407:36"/>
a very ſmall one of my own; which either was quickly loſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other Stones of the ſame ſize, or quickly loſt its Faculty of Shining. But, to avoid Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, I ſhall here only add, that ſome few other Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a more peculiar ſort than thoſe deliver'd in the two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Pentades, may be found in other Writings of ours, to which they ſeem more properly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Many Changes of Colour produc'd by one ſimple Ingredient.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Know not any way more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Convince the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Men (who are wont to be much more impreſs'd on by ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Phenomena than Theories, tho ſolidly Founded) how great an Intereſt the variable Texture of Bodies may have in making them appear of differing Colours, than by ſhewing how the addition of a ſingle Ingredient that either is Colour eſs, or at leaſt is not of any of the Colours to be produced, is capable (and that for the moſt part in a trice) by introducing a ſecret change of the Texture to make
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56407:37"/>
the Body, 'tis put to, appear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of one Colour, ſometimes of another, according as the parts of the Body wrought upon are diſpos'd to receive ſuch a change as Modify's the incident Beams of Light after the manner requiſite to make them exhibit a Blew, a Green, a Red, or ſome other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Colour.</p>
                     <p>Upon this Conſideration I thought of ſeveral Liquors, ſuch as <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> Oyl (as they call it) of Vitriol, or inſtead of it of Sulphur. <hi>Aqua Rezia,</hi> beſides other Saline Liquors that I ſhall not now ſtay to name, becauſe it may here ſuffice to tell you, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all I made choice of the Spirit (not that which Chymiſts call the Oyl) of Salt, as that which is very ſimple, and which if it be not too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegm'd, may be had clear and Colourleſs enough. With this Spirit, I proceeded to make the following Experiments upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56407:37"/>
Bodies, whoſe differing Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made me ſuppoſe they would be fit for my purpoſe. And <hi>tho</hi> I could not, without much diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaging my Deſign, forbear to mention ſome Tryals that may be found elſewhere ſcatterd among my Writings on other occaſions; <hi>yet</hi> the greateſt part by odds of thoſe laid together in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will, I preſume, be found New.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Some drops of well Colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Syrup of Violets being let fall together upon a piece of white Paper, if a third or fourth part ſo much Spirit of Salt be with the tip of one's Finger mix'd with them, the Syrup will preſently become of a Red Colour, uſually ſomewhat inclining to Purple.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. But if the Liquor to be Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, be otherwiſe diſpoſed, 'tis poſſible with Spirit of Salt to turn it from a Blew Colour, not to a Red, but to a Green, as I have ſometimes done by letting fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56407:38"/>
a deep Solution of Filings of Copper made with an Urinous Spirit, as that of <hi>Sal armonia<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> juſt as many drops of Spirit of Salt as were requiſite and ſufficient to produce the change intended. I ſay <hi>juſt ſo many Drops,</hi> becauſe a very ſmall error either in exceſs or defect, may leave the mixture ſtill Blew, or bring it to be all Colourleſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Upon a quantity, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding many Drops of good Syrup of Violets, let fall two or three drops of good Spirit of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Harts-horn, or the like, or of Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deliquium;</hi> and when by mixing them well, the Syrup has acquired a fine Green Colour, then by putting to it a little of the Spirit of Salt, and ſtirring it with the tip of your Finger, you may turn the Green Syrup (as in the firſt Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you did the Blew) into a Red.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56407:38"/>
IV. If you put a quantity of Red Roſe Leaves well dryed into a Glaſs Vial almoſt full of fair Water, and ſoon after put to them as much Spirit of Salt as will make the Water pretty Sharp, you will quickly ſee both that Liquor and the contain'd Leaves brought to a fine and lovely Red, which Scarlet Colour it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for a great while; the like effect Spirit of Salt will have on ſome other Vegetables of a Stip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or of an Aſtringent Nature.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. But if by infuſing Brazil in fair Water, you make a Tincture of it, which you may much deepen by droping into it a little Spirit of Harts-horn, or of Urine; if you then put to it a little Spirit of Salt, it will preſently change it from a deeply reddiſh Colour, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entimes like that of Muskadine, to a Colour far more pale, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yellow, like that of the more dilute Sack; ſo that the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit acting upon two Vegetable
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56407:39"/>
Tinctures differingly diſpos'd, draws out and heightens redneſs in one, and deſtroys it in the other.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. If you make an Infuſion of true <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> in Spring Water, it will appear of a deep Colour, like that of Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, when you place the Vial between the Window and your Eye, and of a fine deep Blew when you look on it with your Eye placed between it and the Window. But if you ſhake into this Liquor a few drops of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt, the Caeruleous Colour will preſently vaniſh and appear no more, in what light ſoever you look upon the Vial, tho the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor will ſtill retain the Orange Colour.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. We took common Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ink, and having let fall ſeveral Drops of it upon a piece of white Paper, ſo that when it grew dry in the Air, ſome parts of the Ink lay thick and ſome thinner upon the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56407:39"/>
Paper whereon it did ſpread it ſelf, we put a few Drops of ſtrong Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt, ſome on one part of the black'd Paper, and ſome (or perhaps a ſmall Drop) on another, and obſerv'd, as we expected, that in theſe places, where the Spirit had been put, or to which it reach'd, the blackneſs was quite deſtroyed, and ſucceeded by an unpleaſant kind of Colour that ſeem'd for the moſt part to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of Yellow and Blew, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them good in its kind.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. If in Spirit of Salt, you diſſolve Filings of Steel, and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evaporate the filtrated Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will ſhoot into a kind of Vitriolum Martis that will be Green as well as that which Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts vulgarly make with Oyl of Vitriol. And to add, That on this occaſion, if you take theſe Chryſtals made with Spirit of Salt, and when they are dry, keep them in a Crucible, you will find that even a moderate Fire if duly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56407:40"/>
apply'd, will make them in a ſhort time exchange their Green Colour for a Red, like that of the finer ſort of Crocus Martis, as indeed this Operation makes them refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that ſort of Medicines.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. We took ſome Mercury precipitated, <hi>per ſe</hi> (that is, by the ſole Action of the Fire, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſaline additaments) and tho crude Mercury is not as far as I have tryed, ſoluble in our Engliſh Spirit of Salt; yet this Red Precipitate (which is ſuppos'd to be meer Mercury) with its own Sulphur extraverted, did readily enough diſſolve in that Liquor, and if I very much miſremember not, did not at all impart its own Colour to it: And I alſo found that Red-Lead or <hi>Minium</hi> being boyl'd a while in good Spirit of Salt, the Redneſs did totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear. So that the ſame Agent that produces Redneſs in divers Bodies, did in thoſe two, I have been mentioning, more than
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56407:40"/>
change it, ſince it quite aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Of which alſo, I can give you an eaſier inſtance, by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Reddeſt Coral being diſſolv'd in our Menſtruum, the Redneſs vaniſhes, and the Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears Colourleſs.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. Take Filings of Copper, (the ſmalleſt are the fitteſt for this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment), and having poured on them good Spirit of Salt till it ſwim, about two fingers breadth over them; keep the Vial in a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrong Heat (in a Sand Furnace) till you perceive the Menſtruum has diſſolv'd a competent part of the Metal: Then warily take out the Vial, and holding it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Eye and the Light, you will perceive the Solution of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be not like that of Steel formerly mentioned, of a Green Colour, but of a dark and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled one, oftentimes inclining to a deep, but muddy Red.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. But if you pour this Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a wide-mouth Glaſs, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56407:41"/>
let it ſtand for a competent time, (which ſometimes amounts but to a few hours, and ſometimes to very many) the expos'd Liquor will appear of a Green, much finer than that of the Chryſtals of Mars.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. Take filtrated and limpid Solution of Silver, or of Mercury made in Aqua fortis, and drop upon it ſome Spirit of Salt, by which you ſhall find the clear Liquor turn'd white as Milk, which after a while will let fall a precipitate of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. And if inſtead of a Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Silver or Quick-ſilver, you take a Red Solution or Tincture of Benjamin, or of the Reſinous part of Jallap Root, or you'le alſo have upon the Affu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Spirit of Salt, a white Liquor and a Precipitate of the ſame Colour.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. Being deſirous to produce two differingColours at once by the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56407:41"/>
ſame Affuſion of Spirit of Salt, I infuſed ſome dryed red Roſe leaves in fair Water, till it had acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a deep Colour from them. To this Infuſion, pour'd off warily, that it might be clear, I added a conſiderable proportion of the ſweet Liquor, made by digeſting Spirit of Vinegar upon red Lead, by which I knew 'twould be turn'd of a Blewiſh Green. Upon this almoſt opacous Liquor, I pour'd Spirit of Salt, which as I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, precipitated the Lead that had been diſſolv'd in the ſweet Liquor, into a very white Powder, and gave the remaining Liquor, well impregnated with particles of the Roſe Leaves, a very fine and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Scarlet Colour. To which Experiment I ſhall add on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that if it had been well made, you may barely by ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well together and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the White Powder with the Red Liquor, make a Carnation Colour, which (when 'tis made as it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56407:42"/>
ſhould be) appear'd very fine and lovely whilſt it laſted, for in no long time the two Subſtances that compos'd it, would by degrees ſeparate, and re-appear each of them in its former place and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. We took ſome Spirit of Salt, that having lain long upon Fylings of Copper, had loſt the muddy Tincture it had firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by being almoſt boil'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. This Liquor, I ſay, that look'd like common Water, we pour'd into a ſmall, but wide-mouth'd Chriſtal-Glaſs, about half an hour after 8 in the Morning, and leaving it in a Window, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd after 40 Minutes to have there acquir'd a Colour, much like that of a German Amethiſt, and ſeem'd to have no tendency to Greenneſs. But being detain'd by the viſit of a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> till ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Clock, I could not ſee what happen'd in the mean time: But then as he was going away, I
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56407:42"/>
invited him to ſee the Liquor, which he (not knowing what it was) told me it look'd of a Graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green Colour, wherein tho I were not altogether of his mind, yet in a ſhort time after, it did to me alſo appear of a lovely Green; in its paſſage to which it had in all been expos'd about 3 hours and a half</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. Precipitate a ſtrong So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Sublimate, (made in fair Water) with a ſ. q.

Then take it out of the Filter, in the form of a groſs Powder, and having put it into a clear Glaſs, let fall on it warily ſome Drops of pretty ſtrong Spirit of Salt, and (if the Experiment ſucceeds with you as it did with me) during the Conflict that will
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56407:43"/>
be made, the little Lumps of the Precipitate will loſe all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Brick-duſt Colour, and turn White, tho afterwards they will appear diſſolv'd into a tranſparent Liquor, wherein the Orange Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is quite aboliſh'd.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. Having calcin'd Copper without any Additament, ſave Fire and Water (by the way we elſewhere mention) we took an Arbitrary quantity of it, and having pour'd on it about 3 or 4 times the quantity of good Spirit of Salt, we obtain'd (what we look'd for) both a Muddy, but manifeſtly <hi>Reddiſh Liquor,</hi> and (ſomewhat to the ſurprize of the Perſons I had a mind to ſatisfy) a white Powder, whoſe <hi>quantity</hi> bore a conſiderable proportion to the Part that was diſſolv'd, (but whoſe <hi>Qualities</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to this place) In which part its ſelf, (to add that upon the by) by the affuſion of common Water, and the action of the Air, we afterwards produc'd more than
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56407:43"/>
one change of Colour.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56407:44"/>
no longer of a Green, but chang'd to a Blew Colour. But the ſame Spirit, (to add that upon the by) preſently turn'd that part of a piece of black Ribband, upon which we put 2 or 3 Drops of it to a Colour not unlike that which they call <hi>Fueille Morte,</hi> or, a fading Leaf.</p>

'Tis uſual in Paper-ſhops, and in divers other places, to meet with Pamphlets and other thin Books that are covered with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that look ſometimes of a Greeniſh Blew Colour, bordering upon Purple, and ſometimes upon that of Violets. Some of the deeper colour'd Papers of this ſort, I have ſeveral times to gratify ſome curious Perſons, eſpecially of the Sex, held in my left hand, and with the other lightly and nimbly toucht them here and there with the end of a feather (cut off from the reſt of the Quill) dipt in Spirit of Salt, which almoſt in the twinkling of an Eye, dy'd

the toucht parts of the Paper with a Lovely Red, that would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continue very Vivid for a good while, and be manifeſt at the end of divers Weeks, if not Months. And if inſtead of the forementioned Quil, I took into my right hand (a Bruſh, or) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that was fit to ſprinkle with, and having dipt it in the Saline Spirit, made many drops at once fall upon the Paper, 'twas plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant enough to behold how ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and prettily it would be Speckled.</p>
                     <p n="21">XXI. VVe took Antimony well powder'd, and pour'd on it 3 or 4 times its weight of good Spirit of Salt; we caus'd it to be boil'd in this Liquor, (and that in a Glaſs Veſſel) wherein a part of it was diſſolv'd, and taken up into the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> where the Antimony quite loſt its blackneſs.

                     <p>To theſe I might add other changes of Colours, that I have made, by the help of Spirit of Salt. But theſe being not of ſo quick and eaſy Tryal, (eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of them require skill in Chymiſtry) I thought it not fit to annex them; ſuppoſing that thoſe already deliver'd, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to above four Pentades, may ſuffice for the purpoſe declar'd at the begining of this Paper. And alſo to afford us this Reflection, That it may not be amiſs, if Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, Chymiſts, and others that are wont to compound Drugs, or other Ingredients; would be leſs forward than they uſually are, to mingle, not to ſay to jumble, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them together, either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, or without due regard to the friendly and incongruous Qualities (in reference to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other) that the ſeparate Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents may have. For moſt of us
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56407:45"/>
are but too lyable to be miſtaken, when we preſume before-hand, what changes the Coalition, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſociations of differing Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may produce; eſpecially if they be either Saline, or plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully partakers of a Saline Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Since Experience frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews, that by the <hi>Action</hi> and <hi>Reaction</hi> that are conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untry'd ways of Compoſition, there Emerge in the mixture new Conſiſtences and other Qualities or Accidents, that were not look'd for, when the Ingredients 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of, were put together. And tho it may ſometimes happen luckily enough, that theſe Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Qualities, whether of Drugs, or other Comparatively ſimple Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, may prove advantagious; yet this may well be look'd upon but as a lucky <hi>chance;</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, but that one may juſtly fear that <hi>ordinarily</hi> the newly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd quality of a Medicine, may prove to be either <hi>worſe</hi> than was

                     <p>THE favourable Reception the Publick was pleas'd to give two Editions ſet forth in one Year of <hi>The Uſefulneſs of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Philoſophy,</hi> having Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd the Stationer to Solicite me for a new Impreſſion, I was on the ſame ground invited to think of making additions to divers
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56407:46"/>
parts of that Treatiſe; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obſerving that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Thanks and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments I had the good fortune to receive from ſeveral Phyſicians (ſome of them of great Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perhaps by that only known to me) yet others were not well pleas'd that a Perſon not of their Profeſſion ſhould offer to meddle with it, tho with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of advancing it: I, whoſe condition exempted me from tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon me their Calling, and who conſequently muſt want many opportunities that others injoy'd of making Obſervations about the Phaenomena of Diſeaſes and of Medicines, ſuffer'd my ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much violence to be diverted to other Studies more ſuitable to my Inclinations, as well as to my Condition, and accordingly I laid aſide the Papers I had Written in reference to the Phyſicians Art, nor were it eaſy, or perhaps poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to retrieve them, after
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56407:47"/>
they have lain ſo many Years diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd and neglected, by which means perchance divers of them have been loſt.</p>
                     <p>But all this could not hinder me from being preſs'd to retrieve and communicate theſe ſcatter'd and duſty Papers by the Secretary of the Royal Society Mr. <hi>H. Olden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh:</hi> For as this Gentleman has been almoſt every where wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſolicitous to preſerve every thing from being loſt, that may any way contribute to increaſe the ſtock of uſeful knowledg. So hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got notice of theſe Papers, and a ſight of ſome of them, his partiality for me made him much over-value them, and perſwaded him that a Collection of them as incoherent and unfiniſht as they were, might be of ſome uſe to the Phyſicians Art. And this ſeem'd the more hopeful, becauſe Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy being a Science of far greater Extent than Phyſick, and ſupplying it, with many of its
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56407:47"/>
Principles and Theories; 'tis very Poſſible that Naturaliſts, tho not Profeſt Phyſicians, may propoſe ſome ſuch comprehenſive Notions and Methods, as may awaken and inlarge the minds of them that are ſo, and at leaſt afford ſome uſeful hints to conſidering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Men. And in effect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Phyſicians, as well as many Patients, have been pleas'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare (ſome in Print, and ſome other ways) that ſometimes they found not uſeleſs aſſiſtances from ſome of thoſe Papers, wherein I occaſionally touch'd on Medicinal things. Such Motives as theſe made Mr. <hi>Oldenburg</hi> ſo earneſt to procure the ſcatter'd Fragments, that I might have yet remaining, about Medicinal Affairs, that tho for the Reaſons mention'd above, I could not think it fit to make a Collection of Papers ſo unlike in their Subjects, ſo diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate in their Bulk, and ſo unfini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſh'd and imperfect on divers ſcores;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56407:48"/>
Yet thus far I was content to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his deſires, that when theſe Trifles came to hand, I would now and then inſert them among my <hi>Experimenta &amp; Obſervationes Phyſicoe.</hi> (Medicine being a <hi>Part,</hi> or an <hi>Application</hi> of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy) eſpecially if there were any great affinity between the Paper I lighted on, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject I was then treating of: Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well that Mr. <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> and perhaps ſome others too, had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould <hi>impart</hi> them at all adventures, than <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> what they judg'd might be uſeful; and that 'twas better to run the hazard of having them <hi>ſlighted,</hi> than <hi>loſt.</hi>

                           <p>A very Tall and well Set Gentleman, Aged about 24 years, by a Fall from his Horſe, had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56407:49"/>
his Skull broken in ſeveral places, and being a Perſon of good Eſtate, had ſeveral Chirurgeons to attend him in the courſe of his Sickneſs; during which he was divers times Trepan'd, and had ſeveral pieces of his Skull taken off, which left great Chaſms (that I have ſeen and felt) between the remaining Parts. Within about three days after his Fall, this Knight (for ſo he now is) was taken with a Dead Palſey on his Right Side, which did not equally affect his Arm and his Leg: The uſe of the latter being ſomtimes ſuddenly Reſtor'd to him in ſome meaſure, and (tho ſeldom) after a while al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſuddenly Loſt: But his Arm and Head were conſtantly Paralytical, being wholly depriv'd of Motion; and having ſo little Senſe, that it would ſometimes lye under his Body without his Feeling it. But if his Hand were prick't with a Pin, he could take notice of it. This Palſey con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56407:49"/>
during almoſt the whole time of the Cure, which laſted 23 or 24 Weeks. And when the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons were going to cloſe up his Head, as having no more to do; one of them who was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Man, and Tenant to this Gentleman, oppos'd all the reſt, alledging, that, if they did no more, the Gentleman would lead an Uſeleſs and very Melancholy Life; and that he was confident, the Palſey was ſome way or other occaſion'd by the Fall, which had left ſomthing in the Head that they had not yet diſcover'd. And the Knight himſelf agreeing to this Man's motion, his Head was further laid open; and at length, under a piece of proud Fleſh, they found, with much ado, a Splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or rather Flake, of a Bone, that bore hard upon the <hi>dura ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and was not pull'd out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great Hemorrhage, and ſuch a ſtretch of the Parts, as made the Patient think his Brain it ſelf
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56407:50"/>
was tearing out. But this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief was ſoon Remedy'd, and his Hurts ſecurely Heal'd up; and he is now a Strong Healthy Man, and finds no Inconvenience by having ſo broad and various a <hi>Callus</hi> inſtead of the Skull; ſave that he is a little obnoxious to take Cold in his Head. But the memorable Circumſtances, for whoſe ſake I mention this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, were theſe: When I ask'd him how big the Bone was, that was laſt taken out? He told me, that it was leſs than half the Nail of one of his Fingers (not his Thumb) and that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as thin, being in ſize and ſhape like the Scale of a Fiſh: But that it did not in his Head lye flat, but bore hard upon the <hi>dura mater.</hi> When I ask'd him how long after it was taken out, he began to feel ſome Relief, as to his Paralytic Diſtemper? He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, That in leſs than five hours he found himſelf, to his great
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56407:50"/>
joy, able to move his little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and (tho this happen'd in the Evening) he was the next morning able to move all his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and within 2 or 3 days after to lift up his Arm: By which it ſeem'd manifeſt, that ſo little a Body as the Splinter lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, produc'd in ſo robuſt a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Palſey of the whole ſide it lay on. For when I particularly ask't him, Whether, after the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the proud Fleſh that encompaſs'd the little Bone, he did not find, if he found none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſome Relief as to his Palſey? He anſwer'd, that he found none at all, till the Bone had been pull'd out, which was not till a good while after the Chirurgeon had been by degrees eating off the proud Fleſh that, grew about it. But there was in this caſe another <hi>Phoenomenon</hi> that I thought little leſs conſiderable than the former. For, remembring the important controverſie, that is agitated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56407:51"/>
modern Phyſicians and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts, about Nutrition by the Nerves, and having thereupon ask'd this Knight, whether he did not find an Atrophy in the Limbs of his Body that were affected? He told me, that when he began to be Paralytic on that ſide, it by degrees much waſted, and the Paralytic Leg was very much Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated: But the Arm and Hand much more, ſeeming nothing but a Syſtem of Bones, with the Skin paſted on them. And when I further ask'd, if upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Bony Splinter above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, the Atrophy of the Parts did not alſo begin to leſſen; he anſwered affirmatively, and told me, that in no very long time his Leg and Arm recover'd their wonted Dimenſions; and in effect I (ſome days ſince) ſaw the reſtor'd Arm well plump'd up with muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Fleſh, tho the Weather were exceeding Cold. And he further told me, that he found
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56407:51"/>
no difference between the Limbs that had been Paralytic, and the others, except that they would grow ſooner and more ſenſibly cold in Sharp or Froſty Weather.</p>
                           <p>This Gentleman anſwer'd me, to add that upon the by, that, during the courſe of his Cure, he was very frequently (almoſt every ſecond day) let Blood; that he wanted not Appetite to his Meat; that for the moſt part he ſlept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different well; and, which was more remarkable, upon ſo great a Hurt of the Head he did not Vomit, not had afterwards any Convulſions.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. Among other Inſtances I have met with, that ſhew the great Power which ſudden Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the mind may have upon the Body, I remember that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of middle Age, complain'd ſadly to me of the miſchief, a Fright had done her; for ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to me, that having taken along with her to a Meadow by a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56407:52"/>
River-ſide, a little Boy that ſhe was dotingly fond of, whilſt ſhe was buſie about the work ſhe came thither for, the Child ſtole away from her, and went along the Bank, to delight himſelf with the View of the Stream; but being heedleſs, it ſeems by Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that he ſet his Foot upon ſome piece of Ground that the Water had made hollow; upon which account, the Earth failing under the weight of the Boy's body preſſing it, that, and he fell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the River: In the mean time the poor Mother caſually miſſing her Child, haſtily caſt her Eyes towards the brink of the River, and not being able to ſee him there, ſhe preſently concluded him to be Drown'd, and was ſtruck with ſo much horrour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſudden accident that tore from her a favorite Son, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other miſchiefs, ſhe fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Dead Palſy of her right Arm and Hand, which continu'd with
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56407:52"/>
her in ſpight of what ſhe had done to remove it, till the time ſhe complain'd of it to me, who had not opportunity to know what became of her afterwards.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. On the other ſide, to ſhow that Violent Paſſions, and even Frights may ſometimes, tho very ſeldom, do good, as well as harm; I ſhall here add a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was circumſtantially made me by the learned Perſon himſelf, to whom the Accident happen'd. I familiarly knew a Gentleman that liv'd to be an Eminent <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo,</hi> and to oblige many by his uſeful Writings, who when he was a Youth, fell into a violent and obſtinate <hi>Sciatica,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd with him ſo long, that it left him little hope of Recovery; but the Devotion of this Young man's Friends invited them to make him be carry'd, ſince he could not go, to Church upon Sundays; and there it happen'd, that the Town being a Frontier
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56407:53"/>
Garriſon, the Guards were ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, that there was occaſion given to a very hot Alarum, that the Enemy was got into the Town, and was advancing towards the Church to Maſſacre all that were in it. This ſo amaz'd and terrifi'd the People, that in very great and diſorderly haſt, they all ran out of the Church, and left my Relator in his Pew upon a Seat that they plac'd him, and whence he could not remove without help: But he being no leſs fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than the reſt, as they forgot him, he forgot his Diſeaſe, and made a ſhift to hamper off the Pew, and follow thoſe that fled; but it quickly appearing, that the Alarum had been a falſe one, his Friends began to think in what a condition they had left him, and haſten'd back to help him out of the Pew, which whilſt they were going to do, they, to their great ſurpriſe found him in the way upon his feet, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56407:53"/>
as freely as other Men. And when he told me this Story, he was above forty years Elder than when he was thus ſtrangely reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu'd, and in all that time, never had one Fit of the <hi>Sciatica.</hi>

                           <p>Upon theſe grounds, I thought my ſelf little leſs than oblig'd, to ſet apart now and then an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment that contain'd ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Preparation, which ſeem'd applicable to Medicine; and to try whether, tho, being in the Country or in ſome other inconvenient Circumſtances, I had not opportunity to prove it my ſelf, the notice given of it, might not happen to be of uſe to a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſician.</p>

                           <p n="4">IV. I know how much Men are prejudic'd in ſome whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, againſt Vomitive Medicines: and I remember we have had here in <hi>London</hi> a Phyſician of great Fame and Practice, that would turn over a Patient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Doctor, if the Caſe were ſuch that the Patient would needs make uſe of Emeticks. And I readily acknowledg that they are edg'd Tools, that require a Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hand, to imploy them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of doing more harm than good: But ſince Experience ſhews that where the Patient can bear them, and the Diſeaſe requires them, they act more ſpeedily and effectually than other evacuating Medicines: And ſince the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Phyſicians, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome that are juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56407:55"/>
very Cautious, do not ſcruple frequently to make uſe of the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> tho it do not ſeldom prove a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy harſh enough; I ſhall ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in compliance with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Phyſicians, and others that have often made uſe of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, that goes under the name of my Emetick Drops, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Preparation of them; without preſſing the uſe any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by confeſſing that divers Practitioners of Phyſick of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sentiments, agree in aſſuring me, that they have not yet found any Emetick to work ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, nor with more eaſe and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than this Liquor; which ſome of them prefer by much to other Antimonial Vomits; and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In preparing my Vomitive Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, I have not always imploy'd the ſame proportion of the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients 'tis made of, nor did I find
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56407:56"/>
it neceſſary to be nice in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But the proportion I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what prefer, is to take two Parts of well choſen and finely powder'd Antimony, and on theſe to pour three Parts of the Menſtruum, <hi>viz.</hi> Sp.; which ought to be rather moderately ſtrong, than too much rectified. Theſe are to be diſtill'd together in a Glaſs Retort fitted with a Receiver not very ſmall, till there come over a great part of the Menſtruum, which will uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally towards the cloſe be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with Red <hi>Flores,</hi> (ſome times copious enough) which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparated by filtration through Cap-paper, the clear tranſmitted Liquor is to be put into a Glaſs, not newly waſh'd, but dry on the inſide, and to be kept cloſe ſtopt from all Intercourſe with the Air.</p>
                           <p>The Doſe is uſually to a Man or Woman, eſpecially at the firſt time, from 4 or 5, to 7 or 8 Drops: But I know an Ingenious Phyſician
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56407:56"/>
that gives to 10 or 12, or a few more Drops, if the Caſe be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; and by that means he told me, that with a ſmall Button-Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that I chanc'd to give him a little before, he did in 2 or 3 hours reſcue three Gentlemen, that by a bad Surfet with very bad Circumſtances, were ſuddenly brought into great danger of ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Death, and carry'd to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Tavern, as being too ill to be carry'd home.</p>
                           <p>The Vehicle may be a Spoonful or two of Wine, or Black-Cherry Water, or (which divers Perſons chuſe rather) of Spring-Water, Drinking up the Liquor immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, becauſe there will ſome Precipitation be made; and then taking 2 or 3 Spoonfuls of the ſame Vehicle to waſh it down. It uſually begins to work early, and does it without cauſing near ſo much ſtraining as vulgar Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and yet makes Copious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations; and ſometimes ſo
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56407:57"/>
Eradicative of the Morbifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Phyſician lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, who Cur'd the three Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, having a poor Patient who had Conflicted for above three Years with an Ague in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Types, but moſt commonly Quartanary, perfectly Cur'd him with two Doſes of theſe Drops, and a Julap made chiefly of the Diſtill'd Water of a common Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolick Mineral. And this Cure ſeem'd therefore to me, when the Phyſician gave me an account of the Drops he had from me, the more conſiderable, becauſe the Patient had made uſe of great Variety of Remedies; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly he devour'd great ſtore of the Jeſuits Bark, or <hi>Cortex Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianus,</hi> (perhaps becauſe it was not well Condition'd, or skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Adminiſter'd) which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alter'd the Type of his Ague, turning it to a ſingle or a double Tertian, and ſometimes kept off the Fits for a while, when
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56407:57"/>
'twas a Quartane, but never Cur'd him quite; and left him in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable eſtate, wherein the Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Drops found him.</p>
                           <p>Tho I ſent this Medicine to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Patients, in whom, thanks be to God, it ſucceeded more than ordinarily well, yet I durſt not venture to give it to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or to very young Perſons; but having gratifi'd an Ingenious Surgeon of good Practice, with a ſtock of it, the Tryals he made upon divers Perſons, with great Succeſs on other Patients, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden'd him to give it to Boys and Girls, and afterwards even to ſeveral Children, whereof he gave me a good Account, only he diſcreetly took care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion his Doſes to the Age and Strength of his Patients, and not to give the whole Doſe at once, but divide it into 2 or 3 parts, that if the firſt ſhould work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half an hour or leſs, the ſecond ſhould not be given, or leſſen'd in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56407:58"/>
quantity. And if neither the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond did work within about an hour, he added the third. And by this Cautious Method, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd me that he had ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd ſeveral Children in bad Caſes, and found not any miſchief or danger enſue upon the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it. But Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tender Creatures, this is to be further and cautiouſly try'd.</p>

like to be innocent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; I had no opportunity to make tryal of them in Phyſick, but finding that ſome Inquiſitive Cultivaters of that Art, valu'd them more than I did, I commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Experiment to Paper, and now ſuffer it to come abroad, that it may be try'd by Phyſicians, and either rejected or made uſe of, as ſucceſs ſhall direct. The Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as I made it, was this.</p>
                           <p>We took one part of very good Fylings of ♂; and ten parts of good Diſtill'd Vinegar. Theſe we put into a Bolt-head, and ſhop'd it well, and then in a mild heat of Sand we digeſted them for about two days, and afterwards aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Heat till the Liquor appear'd of a deep Orange Colour, but yet tranſparent. Part of this Tincture we pour'd off, and kept well ſtop'd by its ſelf, becauſe tho by a longer digeſtion and a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er heat, we obtain'd a very red Tincture, yet we did not ſo much
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56407:59"/>
value it, becauſe when the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum is over Impregnated, the Metal uſually precipitates, and the fine Colour is deſtroy'd. Of the firſt reſerv'd Tincture, we let fall 4 Drops into ℥ VIIIſs, (8 ℥ſs) of clear common Water, whoſe Colour was not thereby ſenſibly alter'd; and the Vial containing this Mixture being well ſhaken, that the Tincture might diffuſe it ſelf the more thorowly, we kept it carefully ſtop'd for uſe, as being our Factitious or Counterfeit Spaw. A Spoonful or ſomewhat more of this, with about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Grain, or leſs, of good freſh Powder of Gauls, would preſently afford a Purpliſh Tinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, like that of Natural Springs impregnated with Mars, ſuch as the Water of the <hi>German</hi> Spaw, or of <hi>Tunbridg</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> if ones Mouth were Waſh'd with it, 'twas found to have like thoſe Natural Chalybeat Waters, a manifeſtly faeruginous taſt.

                              <hi>Acidulae</hi> are to be Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd in no long time after they are made; for Experience has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd me, that (at leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) when I kept them too long, within not many days after they were made, they would loſe much, if not moſt of their Briskneſs and Force. And I ſometimes perceive that there would ſubſide to the bottom a certain red or reddiſh Subſtance, as it were Oker, which was a token of the Degeneracy of the Liquor; and ſome ſuch thing I have obſerv'd in ſome Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Chalybeat Waters too long or negligently kept.

                           <p>Becauſe it may be on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of uſe to a Phyſician, to have ways of Diſcovering the Adulterateneſs of Bezoar Stone, which for its dearneſs is often Counterfeited, and not eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to be ſo by the common ways of Exploring, which uſe to be uncertain enough; it may not be amiſs to Communicate a new way of Tryal, which 'tis unlike that Impoſtors have dream'd of, or if they ſhould know it, can eaſily elude. And this I am the rather willing to do, becauſe the propos'd way may afford an uſeful hint to the Sagacious Inquirers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Nature, and ſome of the Preparations that may be made, of the Bezoar Stone; which tho it be a Drug too much Magnify'd by ſome Phyſicians, eſpecially
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56407:61"/>
thoſe that depend on it, againſt the true Plague; yet a Phyſician of great Experience, and rather a ſevere, than any ways a partial Judg of it, allows it to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Remedy even in Malignant and ill-condition'd Fevers, at leaſt if they be not truly Peſtilential. One of the ways I imploy'd, in treating the Bezoar Stone, may be eaſily gather'd from the enſuing Tranſcript of one of my regiſter'd Experiments.</p>
                           <p>We took 40 or 50 Grains of choice Oriental Bezoar Stone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Powder, and in a Bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs pour'd on it. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>VI of good Spirit of Niter, as well to try whether this Liquor would prove a fit Menſtruum for: this Stone, as we found it to be for the <hi>Calculus Humanus,</hi> as for other purpoſes. And tho this Affuſion being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made in the Cold, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor did not ſeem at firſt to work on the Stone; yet ſoon after it fell violently upon it, and diſſolv'd the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56407:61"/>
greater part of it, not without noiſe and a Notable Efferveſcence. The Solution was almoſt Red, and the Glaſs being put in a digeſtive Furnace, the whole Powder was not only diſſolv'd, but being left a night or two in a North Window, it afforded divers Saline Concreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, much larger than could well have been expected from ſo ſmall a quantity of matter; and theſe Cryſtals, whilſt they were yet in the Glaſs, might eaſily be taken for Cryſtals of Salt-peter, ſo great was their reſemblance.</p>
                           <p>To manifeſt how much the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of looſening and binding, are relative things, and depend upon the Diſpoſition of the Body to be wrought upon, and ſo upon the Congruity betwixt the Agent, and the Patient, I know an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Gentlewoman, on whom Cinnamon, which generally is a conſiderable Aſtringent and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machick Medicine, has a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Operation, and that in a

ſtrange degree, inſomuch that having found by 2 or 3 acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Tryals, that a very little Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon ſeem'd to diſorder her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and prove Laxative, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd once to ſatisfy her ſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Diſcompoſures came by Chance, or no; and having ſtrew'd ſome powder'd Cinnamon upon a Toſt, ſhe was going to put into her Ale, upon eating the Toſt ſhe was copiouſly Purg'd for two days together, and that with ſuch violence, that it put her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Convulſion Fits, and a kind of Spaſmus Cynicus, which ſhe could never be perfectly freed from, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled with from time to time for. 3 Years, as was the other day averr'd to me, and divers others that know her, by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band who is himſelf a Learned Man and a profeſt Phyſician.</p>

                           <p>I have, ſince I came from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> thought of a Method of Curing the aforeſaid Fever, which has not once fail'd me, tho I made of it for 16 or 18 ſeveral Perſons, many of which would certainly Dye, if treated after the uſual manner in this caſe. If I ſhould tell you from what Obſervations and Reaſonings I came to alter the Method of Cure, I ſhould be very tedious. I ſhall therefore at preſent wave that, and proceed to tell you, That when firſt I come
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56407:63"/>
to any Sick of this Diſeaſe, if I find Coſtive (as generally they are) I preſcribe a Gliſter, and after that an Epiſplaſtick Plaiſter 6 or 7 Inches broad, and 8 or 9 Inches Long, to be apply'd between the Shoulders; the Bliſter being well rais'd, I order to be Dreſs'd care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ſtripping off the Cuticula. This continues running till the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is gone off; which is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in 10 or 12 days, if they have not kept up too long with it, and then we cannot certainly foretel the time of the Fever's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; for the whole time till the going off of the Fever, I Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Emulſions of Aq. Aronis, Card. Bened. Citrij totius &amp; Syr. Granatorum cum Aceto; I allow of Orange and Butter-milk Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, of roaſted Apples, Flumme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or any other light and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing they call for.</p>
                           <p>By this Method I keep the Genus Nervoſum and Brain from being Affected, and conſequently
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56407:64"/>
ſecure my Patients; for as many as I have ever known of them Dye, that were troubled with this Diſeaſe, Dy'd of a diſorder of thoſe Parts. I do not defer the Bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plaiſters, as others do, till I find my Patients Delirous, Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, Convulſive, or otherwiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in their Heads and Nerves, finding by the Experience of others that then they moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly prove ineffectual, becauſe of ſome Morbifick Matters being too deeply lodg'd in theſe parts. I do not preſcribe, except upon ſome extraordinary occaſions, any Volatile Salts or Spirits, or any thing too apt to quicken the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready over-brisk Circulation of the Blood, having Experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Learn'd that by theſe often us'd, the Brain and Nerves become ſooner than ordinary affected, for as much as they deeply inſinuate themſelves, and drive with them ſome Morbifick Matter into the Brain and Nerves. I find Bleeding

Theſe we put in a moderately warm place, where the Menſtruum wrought on the Metal for divers hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and Diſſolv'd a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of it.

                           <p>Another Experiment that I made on Steel, was deſign'd to make as much of it Volatile, as I could with a Menſtruum, not ſo Corroſive or Dangerous to the Body as Oyl of Vitriol, or Spirit of Niter, which, eſpecially the former, are imploy'd by divers Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts to make Chalybeat Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that yet are not Volatile. The Medicinal Scope I had in my Eye, for I had alſo a Chymical one (that belongs not to this place) was to try if I could by it obtain any <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> which the Commendations that ſome, even of thoſe Chymiſts, whether <hi>Adepti</hi> or not, whoſe Authority I moſt regard, repreſent
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56407:67"/>
as an excellent Medicine, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Caſes that require Anody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and which the others, or the ſame ſpeak of as a graduatory Subſtance (as to ſome Metals) or both: If you ſhould ask me, why I did not make uſe of the common Vitriolum Martis, which is eaſy to be had in the Shops of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts? I anſwer, That my deſign being to try whether or no I could obtain a Sulphur, that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough (tho not in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rigor) we call <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> that which is made the common way, would not anſwer my end, ſince tho I ſhould be able from this Vitriol to obtain a real <hi>Sulphur;</hi> yet I ſhould not think it ſafe thence to conclude, that it came from the Metal, and not from the Menſtruum; becauſe I have ſeveral times from Oyl of Vitriol it ſelf, obtain'd no contemptible proportion of Yellow and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible <hi>Sulphur.</hi> To which I add, that the acquiſition of a Metalline
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56407:67"/>
                              <hi>Sulphur,</hi> tho it was not the only thing that I aim'd at in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, for I preſum'd, that at leaſt I ſhould make a very great Comminution of the parts of Steel, which is one of the main things aim'd at by the more Rational Phyſicians in the Preparations of that Metal.</p>
                           <p>Upon theſe and the like grounds, I pitcht upon good Spirit of Sea-Salt as a Menſtruum, much fitter for my purpoſe than either Oyl of Vitriol or the Acid part of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur;</hi> and accordingly in a good many Ounces of this Menſtruum, we diſſolv'd as much as we eaſily could of choice Filings of fine Steel, and having filter'd the Green Solution, we very ſlowly Evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it in a Glaſs Veſſel, and took ſuch care not to ſpoil the matter, that we had ſtore of fine Green Cryſtals that were not very ſmall, and lookt prettily; moſt of theſe we put into a ſtrong, but ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, and by degrees of Fire, and a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56407:68"/>
ſtrong one, for the laſt hours; we obtain'd divers Ounces of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor that came over in white Fumes, like Miſts driven by the Wind, and afforded a Sulphureous Smell: This Liquor we rectify'd, and had a Yellow Ponderous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that ſeem'd to be much more of Kin to the Spirit of Sea-Salt, than to the common Oyl of Vitriol; eſpecially ſince being mixt with Aqua-fortis, it would, like Spirit of Salt, make it a Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, that would even in the Cold Diſſolve Gold in thin Leaves. Which laſt words I add, becauſe having put into a little of it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made Yellow, by having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd Leaf-Gold a very thin Plate, but a pretty deal thicker than a Leaf of Hammer'd Gold, the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum made it look all over white, almoſt like Silver, which ſeem'd to argue, that this Vitriolate Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum differ'd from common Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt. And however, it may be worth taking notice of by the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56407:68"/>
By, that not only Vitriols Blue, as is well known to Chymiſts, but that Vitriols of one of thoſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and whereof the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall is the baſeſt, may differ much from one another on the ſcore of the various, and to us perhaps, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Menſtruum that diſſolves the Metal, ſince our Green Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol yeilds Liquors very different from common <hi>Engliſh</hi> Vitriol of <hi>Mars</hi> made with Oyl of Vitriol, tho all the three be green. Which may give us ſome Reaſon of the uncertainty, whereof Vitriol is mainly imploy'd; and 'tis perhaps worth remarking, that tho we did not find the Vitriol of <hi>Mars</hi> made the common way, nor even <hi>Roman</hi> Vitriol to diſſolve in a Vinous Spirit totally Inflammable, yet it would eaſily enough Diſſolve our Saline Vitriol, (if I may ſo call it) which Solution to hint that in <hi>Tranſitu,</hi> you may perhaps ſee cauſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy as a Medicine in ſeveral Caſes, and particularly as a Styptic in

Wounds, ſince its Taſt is very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringent, its Parts very Subti, and made fit by the Vinous Spirit, to prevent Corruption; eſpecially in thoſe Clymates where Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons complain.

                           <p>But that which we chiefly aim'd at in this Operation, was the dry part, of what was Elevated by the force of the Fire. This we found to be diſtinguiſhable, partly by its Situation, and partly by more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Accidents, into three kinds of Subſtance, whereof one was almoſt like a Powder, which after the Contact of Air, did in a while come over to be of a Yellow Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, almoſt like <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but it was not indeed truly Combuſtible <hi>Sulphur.</hi> The other Subſtance conſiſted of larger parts, and was of a deep Colour, between Read and Brown. But the third, which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56407:69"/>
ſeem'd the moſt Copious of all, was made up of fine parts, larger than the former, of a deep Reddiſh Colour, and adorn'd with a fine Gloſs, like that of Scales of Fiſhes, that look'd very prettily.</p>
                           <p>The Caput Mortuum was found to be of a Texture that would have ſurpriz'd moſt Men; for a great part of it appeared to be turn'd into a Talky Subſtance, conſiſting of pretty broad and very thin Plates, ſmooth and gloſſy, that lay upon, and againſt one another, like thoſe that make up Muſcovia-Glaſs, when the pieces are more thick than large.</p>

We took a Grain of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56407:70"/>
Gold, and having diſſolv'd it without heat in a competent quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of good <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> we put to it by gueſs about two Spoonfuls of Water, and then by a Thread we hung in the mixture a little bit of clean metaline Body, and kept it ſuſpended in the Liquor for many hours (or ſome few days.) By this means we obtain'd, as we expected, a Precipitate of a fine and deep Colour, ſo copious and ſo light, that it was a long time before it would all ſettle at the bottom. Then looking upon the remaining part of the Suſpended Metaline Body, we found it ſo very little leſs than when the whole was firſt put in, that the diminution of it was not judg'd to amount to near a Grain. By which Experiment it appear'd, that one Grain of Gold, not ſwiming in parts ſeparately inviſible, as 'tis in Solutions, but reduc'd to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Powder, ſeem'd to make a conſiderable quantity of Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56407:71"/>
at the bottom of the Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical Vial, whoſe Diameter was about an Inch, that we kept it in. And this Glaſs being a little ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, the Precipitate would riſe like a Mud, and be ſo thorowly diſperſt in the form of a Powder, through the whole Body of the Liquor, and a greater quantity of Water added to it, that at firſt it would ſeem Opacous, and after ſome time, it would appear like a high and lovely Purple Solution. So that one Grain of Gold (for the Colour argu'd that there was ſome of that Metal, in every Corpuſcle of the Precipitate) was reduc'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as many Grains of Powder, as ſuffic'd to lodg themſelves in all the Particles of ſpace great enough to be viſible, that were contain'd in a Maſs of ſixteen Drachms (is Two Ounces) of Water.</p>

                           <p>I have elſe where endeavour'd to ſhew that divers, if not moſt, of the real Vertues of ſome Gems, (for there are too many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous ones aſcrib'd to them) may in probability proceed from the Particles of Mineral Juices, that were admitted whilſt the matter was yet in <hi>Solutis Principiis,</hi> or at leaſt ſoft, and afterwards Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the Lapideſcent part of the Stone. In confirmation of this Conjecture, I ſhall now obſerve, that having, upon ſome grounds not neceſſary to be here mention'd, ſuſpected that Granates contain (ſome of them) beſides ſome other Metalline Subſtances, divers Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of a Martial Nature; I made choice of ſome ſmall ones, which by their deep and almoſt dark
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56407:72"/>
Colour, (to name no other Signs) I gueſs'd to contain ſomewhat of Iron or Steel; and apply'd to them a pretty vigorous Loadſtone, which as I expected, readily took them up and to which they conſtantly ſtuck afterward, till I forcibly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them from it.

compleating the Experiment, but did not deter me from making an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Obſervation, which was, that within about a ſingle Minute of an Hour, a portion of the Stone near one part of the Edg, was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly grown Opacous and Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and within not many Minutes after, the whole Stone began to appear in a changing condition, but did not change in every part at once, nor did the alteration make an uniform Progreſſion; but here one might ſucceſſively diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver divers white Arches, or as 'twere Zones, that were parallel enough to one another, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite Opacous, intercepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them other little Zones, which being yet Semi-opacous, appear'd of a Brown Colour, and concurr'd to make the Stone look like a very pretty Agate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Whiteneſs made a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Progreſs as long as the Time permitted me to obſerve it: And the Poſſeſſor aſſur'd me, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

an Hour or or two it would be all of a Cream White (as he expreſs'd himſelf) which I thought the more Credible, becauſe I ſaw one part of it, that was pretty broad, to have obtain'd already a White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, little, if at all inferiour to that of Ivory.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56407:77"/>
provide againſt that diſmal Storm, tho the Sea were then ſmooth enough. Secondly, That the Sea would beat with great Noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Shore, eſpecially the Rocks, tho there appear'd no manifeſt Cauſe, as upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Wind or Tide, why it ſhould do ſo. And this Sign would ſometimes not appear till many Hours, or perhaps a full Day after that foremention'd. And ſometimes 'twas obſerv'd, that the Sea would now and then ſuddenly Invade the Shore, and gain further upon it than could be accounted for by the Wind or Tide, and then quickly Ebb away beyond the uſual Low water-Mark, and after return again with more fury, and fall back further than before. Thirdly, That ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there would be perceiv'd an ungrateful Smell in the Air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Hurricane began to Blow. And Fourthly and Laſtly, My Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator affirm'd to me, both he and

In making choice of which Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, I uſually prefer thoſe Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments that afford the more Light to thoſe that appear with the moſt Luſter, and thoſe that are proper to increaſe the Readers skill, to thoſe that make an Oſtentation of the Writers.

                              <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56407:83"/>
This ſign appearing, I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took it off from the Fire, and whiles it was yet warm, dug it out, as clean as I could, and having ſeaſonably pulveriz'd it, that it might not attract the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Air; I put upon it ſome highly rectify'd Spirit of Wine, which within an hour or leſs time, was enobled with a rich Golden Colour.

with the matter, as when they Sublime it in Glaſſes, or in Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſubliming Pots; and tho they regard not this included Air, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe uſually there is not much of it in the Veſſel, yet it may have a not inconſiderable influence on the effects of the Fires Operation, not only as it contributes to the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuſtentation of diſſipated parts of the Mineral, but as it affords theſe Corpuſcles room to fly to and fro in it, and thereby make Aſſociations or Coalitions and Concretions that otherwiſe would not be produc'd. Upon this account I gueſt that it may be, on divers occaſions, a thing of uſe for Diſcoveries, and perhaps too, for Practice, to imploy a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, that the Body expos'd to the action of the Fire, may be kept from the Contact of the Air, at leaſt as to any ſenſible portions of it, and being as it were included in Bodies almoſt equivalent to Solids; and one may
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56407:87"/>
ſuppreſs the free emiſſion and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of Exhalations, and ſo to make an Operation, not only in Clauſo, but as it were in Solido, and reduce the parts of the Body Expos'd, and perhaps the Igneous Corpuſcles to act reciprocally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another, without any notable Diſſipation, or Avolation of Parts.</p>
                           <p>To apply now what hath been ſaid, to Antimony; I ſhall briefly ſet down an uncommon way that came into my mind of Operating upon it. We took well powder'd ♁, and well dry'd (white) Chalk reduc'd likewiſe to Powder; with theſe in a large Earthen Pot or Crucible, we made SSS. having a care to make the lowermoſt and uppermoſt bed of Chalk, and the laſt thicker than any of the reſt, as alſo that none of the <hi>Antimo-nial</hi> Layers, were but of a moderate thickneſs, that the Heat might pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate them the better; then the Veſſel, being cover'd, was put
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56407:88"/>
among the kindled Coals of a good digeſtive Furnace, (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a one was neceſſary, but becauſe 'twas at hand) where 'twas kept for a competent time, which according to the bigneſs of the Pot, and the ſtrength of the Fire, may be ſometimes 20 or 24 Hours, ſometimes a Day and a Half, and ſometimes two Days or better.</p>

                           <p>'Tis known that moſt Chymiſts, and many Phyſicians, have a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Eſteem for the Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Vertues of Gold, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of it. And upon this ground, divers of them have long been, and ſtill are Solicitous to make <hi>Calces</hi> of Gold by differing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56407:88"/>
ways; moſt of them laborious, and ſome of them ſcarce to be ſafely wrought and us'd in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: Wherefore I ſhall, I preſume, be eaſily Pardon'd, if I here ſet down a way that came into my mind, and that I have ſometimes us'd to make a preparation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Gold is reduc'd to very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Parts, without the help of <hi>Mercury,</hi> or of any Precipitation made by ſharp Salts, whether Acid or Lixivial.</p>
                           <p>We took then refin'd Gold, and diſſolv'd it in clean and Spirituous <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> and inſtead of Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating the clear Solution with Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> as is uſually done, or with Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac,</hi> or other Volatile Urinous Spirits, we firſt with a very modeſt Heat drew off the Superfluous Liquor; whereby the Gold with the remaining part of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> was left in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a thick and Oleous Liquor. This done, we pour'd
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56407:89"/>
upon it a treble weight of Vinous Spirit totally inflammable and in a ſhort time, we had, as we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a very ſubtil Powder, or high colour'd <hi>Calx</hi> of Gold, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at the bottom; the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> being ſtrangely dulcifi'd as to Taſt, and become fragrant in point of Smell When a very few days were paſt, we decanted the Liquor, and put on it freſh ardent Spirit, and leaving them a while together, there ſubſided the like well colour'd <hi>Calx</hi> more plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than the firſt time.</p>
                           <p>I know not, to add that upon the by, whether it may, or may not be worth while to try to Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whether this Dulcifi'd A. R. <hi>Spirituoſa</hi> being drawn off from the ſubſiding Gold, may have acquir'd any Virtue from the open'd Metal. Some Tryals ſeeming to argue that the openneſs of this <hi>Calx</hi> made it fit to be eaſily wrought upon by a <hi>Menſtruum</hi> that would not touch Water-Gold, as they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56407:89"/>
call the common <hi>Calx</hi> made by quartation, nor yet Leaf-Gold, ſuch as the Apothecaries Imploy; but however the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd ſuch qualities as make it ſeem likely to prove an uſeful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which yet I refer to Tryal.</p>
                           <p>By the way we pitch'd upon to make this Powder of Gold, it ſeem'd probable, that it would not (at leaſt) be leſs ſubtil, and yet would be more mild, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Preparations; and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we thought it might, perhaps, make it yet more ſecure, if we ſhould, as we did, put upon it a totally Ardent Vinous Spirit, and burn it off once, twice, or thrice, to carry off with it any little Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive or Saline Particles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that may have ſtill adher'd to the Metalline ones.</p>
                           <p>N. B. The Spirituous <hi>Aqua Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> mention'd in the Proceſs, is ſo call'd by me, partly to diſtinguiſh it from the common <hi>Aqua Regia,</hi> and partly becauſe 'tis indeed of a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56407:90"/>
more Spirituous Nature than the common, being compos'd without any groſs Salt; Such as * but only of Spirits. This <hi>Menſtruum</hi> I made for ſome particular uſes: And tho it works more ſlowly than the common <hi>Chryſulca,</hi> yet I often prefer it to this, as that which I can imploy to ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common purpoſes, and as it may probably be a more innocent <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum</hi> in making Preparations of <hi>Sol,</hi> deſign'd for Medicinal uſes. I make it very eaſily, by mixing one part of good Spirit of Salt, with two parts of ſtrong Spirit of Niter, or (when 'tis not to be us'd for Medicines) of common, but clean <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi>

Diſſolve as much as it could.

By this means we had a little Black Oyl Swimming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spirit, which was alſo dark and muddy, as if incorporated with ſome more Oyl. The weight of both theſe Liquors was 23 Grains, beſides which there ſtuck to almoſt all the upper part of the Retort, a thin film of Oyl, which together with a ſtreak of the like reaching to the bottom of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, we eſtimated at 3 Grains more, and ſo reckon'd 26 Grains for the weight of the whole aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended

The Empyreumatical Liquors that came over, ſmell'd much like thoſe of Harts-horn, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was found to belong, as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, to the Tribe of Urinous ones, or, as many now call them Volatile Alcaly's For it readily hiſs'd and produc'd Bubbles, with good Spirit of Salt turn'd Syrup of Violets Green, and being drop'd into Solution of Sublimate, turn'd that White; to omit another way or two, by which I examin'd it.

Aſhes. In the formation of the Apothecaries Vegetables, he doth not employ any actual Heat, but (which may ſeem more ſtrange) only the ſhaking, of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for upon that Agitation the prepar'd Aſhes or Powder being this'd from the bottom, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd quite through the Liquor, when the Glaſs is ſet by in a quiet place, the ſcatter'd Particles by degrees ſo convene, as to compoſe a Model of the Plant they once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to.

about half a Pound of the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, near <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>III of the Liquor; this he included in a Glaſs with a Bubble, and a ſlender neck like one of my Weather-Glaſſes; but tho the Liquor at firſt reach'd not above the Bubble, but only fill'd it to the bottom of the Pipe; yet as the <hi>Moon</hi> increas'd, this Liquor, as the Doctor expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by degrees expanded it ſelf in the Glaſs, ſo that about the Full-<hi>Moon,</hi> it reach'd about an Inch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pipe, and upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the <hi>Moon,</hi> it ſubſided by degrees to the bottom of the Pipe.

whether he had broken the fluid Maſs into Drops, to obſerve whether the Colour were that only of the Surface, or of the whole Maſs?
