            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

T. I. these faithfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, a farre greater happines then I of late
haue had, either leisure to hope for, or
means to expect; I commend to your
good selfe, &amp; the frends of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Being certified by my affection,
that your gentle nature, doth commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serat
the misfortunes hath befalne me, and therein as a
friend, doth share with mee in sorrow: I shall as soone
as occasion will suffer me, make hast to <hi>London,</hi> to bee
counselled by your aduise, touching those things in
particular, that mainly concerne my estate: Nor make
I any doubt, but before the receipt hereof, you haue
heard of my mishap, from the report of some of my men
who I hope, are ariued by passage, by the way of <hi>Holland:</hi>
therefore I omit herein to trouble you with the maner of
my first taking by the <hi>Turkes,</hi> whose gouernours, I
meane <hi>Masters</hi> &amp; <hi>Pilates,</hi> are all Englishmen, not onely
<hi>Pirates,</hi> but mearely reprobates, and whose successe at
Seas is so great, that it is most lamentable to report, how
many Ships of <hi>London,</hi> and other parts of England haue
beene taken and made prey vnto them: without the help
of which English, the <hi>Turks</hi> by no means could haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
and conducted them through their vnskilfulnes
and insufficiencie in the art of <hi>Nauigation:</hi> yet of late to
my wofull experience, I can witnes, they haue beene so
readied by the instruction of our apostate countrimen,
[I meane of <hi>Ward</hi> and others, who haue beene their
commanders] to tackle their Ships, to man and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
a fight, that if it doe not please God to moue the
heart of his Maiestie, and other Christian Princes, and
<pb facs="tcp:4709:4"/>
states, to ioyne together for their speedy suppression,
and the disiointing of their late strengthned forces,
which continually encreaseth by the Ships of <hi>England,</hi>
and <hi>Holland,</hi> which they daily surprise, It will be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
to the state, and so dangerous to the common
wealth, in succeeding times, that Christendome must
expect no Trafficke at Sea: for they are alreadie grown
to the number of fifteene saile of great ships belonging
to <hi>Tunis,</hi> some bearing 40. some 30. and some 20. pecces
of ordinance, with men accordingly, as 300. 250. and
200. men at the least, in euery Ship, so that I doubt, and
the cause it selfe may breed a generall feare, that if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
be not hastened against them, the state may
heareafter share a part in that sorrow, which wee poore
Sea-faring men haue already suffered. I haue sent you
a note by <hi>Leanard Crowder,</hi> of diuerse ships, both <hi>English</hi>
and <hi>Dutch,</hi> that haue been taken since <hi>Ianuary</hi> last, which
although it be a businesse not much pertinent to gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of your profession; yet I doe assure my selfe, that
you are so faithfull a wel-willer to the good estate and
prosperitie of the common-wealth, of which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
and Marriners are not the least members, that in
pitie of our losses sustained, with vs you could wish, and
expect a reformation, since the infinite wealth that our
nation hath suffered ruine of, by the <hi>Turks</hi> this last yeer
it were without doubt, incredible to report, since hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
you haue heard, and I doubt not to prooue that
<hi>Londons</hi> losses hath amounted to aboue 200000. pound.
Thus hauing presented you at this time, but with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

               <p>This <hi>Ward,</hi> who now hath atchieued to himselfe, the
title of Captaine, whose desperate actions hath caused
terrour to trauellors by Sea, and whose name hath
bred feare in the Marchants at home. In the last yeare
of her late Maiesties raigne, was resident, and had his
dwelling, (as by my own knowledge I can certifie) in the
West countrie at the hauen Towne of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
poore, base, and of no estéeme, one as tattered in
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as he was ragged in conditions, the good past,
that he could boast of himselfe, might bee, that hee was
borne in a Towne called <hi>Feuersham</hi> in Kent, and there
liued as a poore fisherman, and the vertue present, that
he durst talke of was, he had abiding in <hi>Plimouth,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a while kéeping house, although I haue neuer heard
that he paid his rent, all the day you should hardly faile
but finde him in an alehouse: but bee sure to haue him
drunke at home at night. Othes were almost as ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
with him as words, so that hee seldome spake a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb facs="tcp:4709:5"/>
but one was a silable, hee would sit melancholy,
speake doggedly, curse the time, repine at other mens
good fortunes, and complaine of the hard crosses atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his owne. All the vertue that any man could perceiue
might grow out of his whole course, or reckon out of his
whole life was, that hitherto hee loued not to be noted a
quarellor: for rather then he would fight, he would be
beaten by any one, he was commonly called by the name
of <hi>Iack Ward,</hi> one that was welcome into any tap-house,
more for loue of his coyne, then loue of his company, and
all the reputation that his owne crue held of him, was
but this, that he was a mad rascall, would sweare well,
drinke stiffe, stick toot, and like a good cocke, hee would
neuer out of their damnable pit, If there were either
money in his purse, or credible chalke in his hosts hand,
being once in.</p>
               <p>So that continuing thus for a reasonable season, in
the same towne drinking and swearing, the two twins,
that such damnable wombes are euer in labour with,
and not without wonder of a number, by what possible
meanes he could get chinkes, so lewdly to consume his
time withall. It at last so happened, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Kings raigne, hee found meanes to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for seruice, in a small ship of his maiesties, commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
called by the name of the <hi>Lions Whelpe,</hi> in which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
persisting as before, in his melancholy disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not contented, with that good and honest meanes
was allowed him, and satisfied farre better men, to defend
themselues and the necessitie of their charge: But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
new reaches working in his braine, he one day se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
out a choice crew, but of such, whose dispositions
he perceiued were as vntoward as his owne, when the
poison of his heart disgorged it selfe thus.</p>
               <p>My mates, quoth he, whats to be done? heres a scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy

the water, on the Kings salt béefe, without ere a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
to buy vs bissell when we come a shore, heres brine,
<pb facs="tcp:4709:6"/>
but to reuell, suppe, and be mery, euery one at the proper
charge of his owne purse. So that this following night.
when the <hi>Captaine</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> shall coniecture nothing.
but that we are drawing drie the pot, wee'll bee diuing
arme deepe in the <hi>Fugitiues</hi> bagges.</p>
               <p>With which hopefull proiect, their resolutions being
confirmed, and with the former purpose, getting a shore
to their hosts house, (which they chose to be without the
walles of <hi>Portsmouth</hi>) after some halfe a dozen of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
healths tane downe, they agreed amongst them,
that with full cans, for the deuising and foreseeing into
this beneficiall businesse, they fréely, and of their owne
accord would elect <hi>Ward</hi> for their <hi>Captaine,</hi> and which
dignitie accordingly (being downe on their knees) with
drinke they performed, which instalment done, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
with themselues how they might best prouide
themselues of a boat, which the next full Sea should set
them abord the <hi>Barke,</hi> they resolued at a sortable houre
to begin their ransacke.</p>
               <p>But see how it happened: A kinsman of this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
who had intended his departure, and furnished
himselfe to this voyage for <hi>France,</hi> seeing the day before
they attempted this <hi>Piracie,</hi> this <hi>Ward</hi> consorted with a
crue of <hi>Scattergoods</hi> and <hi>swaggering Rascals,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fully of the charge that his friend had aboord, and
withall nothing such a crew of desperates, mustering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Towne, more then in one knot had béene accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and with such vnciuill behauiour, hee began to bee
iealous they had some proiect in hand: whereupon he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
his friend to disbarke his mony againe, till the very
instant that the winde serued, and to lodge it in some
place of more safety, to preuent the danger hee stood in
doubt of: for, quoth he, your selfe may witnesse what a
knot of these knaues are linked together, who hauing
not some intelligence, or but at least suspecting what sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
you beare along with you, they will not sticke to
<pb facs="tcp:4709:6"/>
venture their bodies, I and it were to hazard their soules
for mony wherewithall to maintaine their riot.</p>
               <p>So that I pray you Sir, be aduised by my counsell:
Redeeme your money out of the Barke, and preuent
their purpose, lest your repentance come too late. Which
counsell of his friends, setting some suspition in the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans
head, and being the rather confirmed and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
through the disorders hee beheld them continue in,
and more then they were accustomed to exercise, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
himselfe to his friends aduice, and priuately (either
without knowledge or suspition) landed his money and
most estimable riches, and stored them in the <hi>red Lion,</hi>
(contenting themselues, then suspectlesse, to see what
would be the issue of these fellowes) and vntill the winde
and tide should helpe faire for their departure.</p>
               <p>Which defense of this <hi>gentlemans</hi> this new <hi>Captaine
Ward</hi> nothing at all suspecting, with his Command (as
he before had determined) in the dead of night, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so much experience to know when the tide and time
was best for his aduantage, hee presently came and laid
the <hi>Barke</hi> aboord, and entred his men in the hold of the
Uessell, where he found none to resist him, but only two
poore s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ekes, who belonged to the <hi>Barke,</hi> whom hee
straight shut vnder decke, and commanded them, not to
squeake like <hi>Rats</hi> (in danger of their liues) whereby, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their disturbance, the wach vpon the first <hi>Blockhouse</hi>
might haue warning, and so with their <hi>Pot-guns</hi> disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
their peace. So presently waying <hi>Anchor,</hi> and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his sailes, to Sea goes he. Onely before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
(yet not till he found himselfe out of their reach)
he takes his farewell aloud, and very kindly bids me the
watch good night. So that being now cléere, and out of
danger of their summons, and likewise come forth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> like a <hi>Captaine</hi> indeed, who now
had command, he demands for the two men were lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arke,</hi> and who, according to his call, were
<pb facs="tcp:4709:7"/>
brought to his sight, when most <hi>Commander</hi> like, hee
began to question them, as they loued their safeties, to
deliuer truly vnto him, in what place of the <hi>Barke</hi> was
the <hi>Papists</hi> treasure hid, for that was the chiefe matter
they came for, and that must bee the meanes to make
them merrie withal, when these poore wretches shaking
for feare before this terrible theefe, they replyed, that his
expectation was heerein frustrate, store of riches they
must confesse there was indeed, but vpon what reason
they knew not, it was the day before landed againe.</p>
               <p>At which vnsatisfied newes, and finding by search
their words to be true, the whole <hi>crue</hi> hauing this cake
of Ice for Sunne-shine golde to chaw down, and
comfort their stomacks withall. The <hi>Rogues</hi> all, began
now to be ranck mad, there was then, such <hi>Cursing,</hi> such
<hi>Swearing,</hi> such <hi>Banning:</hi> there was <hi>a pox</hi> of thee, a <hi>pox</hi>
of thee, and a <hi>plague</hi> of vs all, what shall now become of
vs? The <hi>Goldfinches</hi> wee came for, were flowen out
of their nest, little succour is to be found heere, and to go
a shore we shall be sure to be hanged there, heare wee are
fallen desperately into the <hi>pitfall,</hi> and there wee haue
brought our necks iust to the <hi>noose.</hi> Yet at last, when
their furie like an <hi>Hostler,</hi> had walked them awhile, and
the heat of their bloods was growen a little calmer, they
agreed amongst themselues, that since their pretence
was to come for somewhat, they would at last see what
was there to be found. In which search, there was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
laid open to their <hi>Rauening</hi> eies, a couple of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-Pasties,</hi>
diuers <hi>Turkey-pies, Capons, Hens,</hi> and such
other choice <hi>viands,</hi> as the forerecited <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> had
stored in the barke for his own prouision, to conduct him
into <hi>France</hi> and of euerie sort whereof, them was great
store. At the sight of which, <hi>Ward</hi> raps out oathes like

one after another, and cals, come, lets bee merrie my

hearts, although the birds be flowen, we came far, and
we haue found nothing but the emptie nest, come, lets
be merrie, &amp; freely fat our selues with their fodder, here
is good cheare, it was prouided for vs, and weele eat, an
ounce of sorrow will not pay a penny debt. It is boote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
in these daies, to lie in a dich and cry for help, since e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to thrust out his hand to help himself,
and therefore my hearts let vs be frolike with this, and
liue in hope that our fortuns wil be better. At which (as
if they had forgot alreadie what they had done, and not
fering what might follow) with this encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they
fell roundly aboord, when anon <hi>Ward</hi> called to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
what, say you my bloods, who would bee a
boord of the <hi>Lyons whelpe,</hi> with bare and hungrie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance
of cold <hi>fish</hi> and naked <hi>cheese,</hi> and may as we do
thrust vp their armes to the elbow in a <hi>Venison pastie?</hi>
and with that, breaking vp a case of bottles, which were
presented full of wine to his theueships hand, heere my
mates (quoth he) heare is a health to our good fortunes,
and a pox of the <hi>Hang-man,</hi> wee know the worst, and
lets therefore hope for the best, weele be merrie to night
with wine and Uenison, and to morrow take counsell
whats best to be done.</p>
               <p>So that, no man taking care for any thing now, but
that euery one pleaged his partner a ful carouse, they sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
one from the <hi>wight</hi> to the West part of <hi>England,</hi>
where neere vnto <hi>Silly</hi> they met with a French ship, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with marchandise, &amp; who was bound for <hi>Irela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> the
ship being a vessel neare about thréescore and ten Tuns,
and who bare for her <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

This pray, had my Kight like <hi>Ward</hi> no soonner espied,
but calling his companions about him, in this forme
hee began to resolue them: my Comrads quoth hee,
you know wee haue procéeded so far, into the Théeues
path, that to returne backe we shall bee stopped with a
haltar. To trust to the mercie of the law, is as good as
<pb facs="tcp:4709:8"/>
for a man to chops hand vpon a Rasor and see if it will
cut. Therefore since to retire can allow vs no safety, it
will be wisdome heare to prouide for our safegard. Your
selues see, wee haue a <hi>Frenchman</hi> heere a <hi>ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi> of vs
and as I haue done, so I still doe, intreat the most of
you, but to keepe down vnder hatches, and that not pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
some four or fiue, may bee seene aboue, so by the
scantnes of our number seen, &amp; the smalnes of our Ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k
which I know he will take note of (I destring to kéep co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apnie
with him) he shall haue no cause at al to suspect vs:
So that, when I shall finde fit opportunitie to giue him
the graple, &amp; send to your eares the watch word (which
shall be this, <hi>now my masters for vs,</hi> we may on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
board them, and being taken, in the dismay, so
hastily disharten them, that we shal immediatly be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of their goods, and with the helpe of their ship and
inunition, lay a fundation one the ground of which, wee
may raise our good hap: which subtiltie of his, was so
well entertained, that my Captaine had a <hi>Plaudite</hi> for
his paines, and euery mans hand preast to bee ready at
his becke.</p>
               <p>So then, with the hope of this plot, passing side by side
familiarly, and vnsuspected by the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
being but small, and their number in sight so few,
and passing many houres, in courteous discourse, either
seeming glad of the others acquaintance, one the sudden
<hi>Ward,</hi> taking hold of opportunitie, he claps me the <hi>Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
aboord, giues the watch word, and enters his men,
so that in a breath, was my poore <hi>Frentchman</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

                  </gap>prisone, eare that
any had time to thinke how they could bee hurt. All
which discourse the two poore men who were first taken
when <hi>Ward</hi> tooke the Barke, did after their setting a
shore, and returne to <hi>Portesmouth,</hi> relate and constantly
affirme to one <hi>Iohn Rogers,</hi> owner of the Barcke, in
my hearing. So that it is without question, this was
<pb facs="tcp:4709:8"/>
the originall and first beginning of <hi>Wards</hi> piracy, euen so
base, and so low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although it is manifest, he hath aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
it to that height, which hath since beene the vndoing
of some, and the impouerishing of many.</p>
               <p>To proceed then, after as you haue heard, the <hi>French
man</hi> was taken by him, hee repaired into <hi>Causon Bay,</hi>
neare <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where with a long boate going a
shore, and flattring some others whom he met of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
with the newes of his successe, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to come, he their with men much strengthned his
company, and so put on to the coast of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Southern cape,</hi> he tooke also a <hi>Fly boate</hi> laden
with excellent Merchandise, and the ship béing about a
hundred Tuns, with whom entering into the Straights,
he turned away his small Barcke with the <hi>Flemings,</hi>
and presently threupon hee tooke a <hi>Satta,</hi> and withall
which thrée ships, namely, your <hi>Frenchman,</hi> your <hi>Flie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boate,</hi>
and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ta,</hi> he put on, and ariued at <hi>Argier,</hi> where
what was his entertainement, receiue this forcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
               <p>Not long before, one <hi>Captaine Iefferd</hi> had in the seruice
oft he Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> attempted to set the <hi>Gallies</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the King of <hi>Argier</hi> afire, and in which despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
resolution, he had so farre preuailed, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
not thence without performing much harme. In
displeasure of which, the <hi>king</hi> had grounded such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
hate against al <hi>Englishmen</hi> for <hi>Iefferds</hi> treachery,
that he solemnly vowed, that this iniurie should bee a
perfecution to any of the whole nation, that hapned in
his power, and to manifest, that his oath was not triuial
but as violent in performance, as it was forwa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
in reuenge of the former attempt, hee put twelue
<hi>Englishmen,</hi> who were there in <hi>Argier</hi> to a most cruell
and lingring death, so that vpon <hi>Wards</hi> arriuall, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him to haue any succour on his shore, and <hi>Ward</hi> on
the other side hauing heard of his vowe, &amp; not willing to
<pb facs="tcp:4709:9"/>
play with the <hi>Lyons paw,</hi> lest he should but faine himselfe
asleepe, without longer stay, or further suit, he with his
prises made vp for <hi>Tunis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where with small suit to the <hi>King,</hi> in respect hee
brought Marchandise with him, beneficiall to the
state, hee had leaue, their to find safe harbouring for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
his ships and followers, where hauing made sale
of his Commodities, and presented diuerse acceptable
prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to the <hi>King of Tunis,</hi> as also for his gifts, receiued
some outward graces of the <hi>Crossymon,</hi> which is as
much to say, the <hi>Lord Admirall</hi> of the Sea, and the man
that hath euer since, held share with <hi>Ward</hi> in all his <hi>Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
Prises,</hi> and <hi>Shippings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and been his only supporter
in all his disseignes, and vpon whose promised fauour
and furtherance <hi>Ward</hi> growing bould, he was at length
a suter to the <hi>King,</hi> that he might be receiued as his <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi>
or if not so, yet at all times, either in aduersity or
prosperitie, himselfe and what the Sea could yeeld him,
might be euer <hi>sanctuaried</hi> vnder his Princely protection,
and in recompence thereof, he vowed, hee would for euer
after, become a foe to all <hi>Christians,</hi> bee a persecuter to
their <hi>Trafficke,</hi> and an inpouerisher of their <hi>wealth,</hi>
onely (belike the diuell not yet hauing his full gripe one
him) he desired, his owne <hi>Countrey</hi> might be excepted
out of his taske, whom both by <hi>naturall loue</hi> and <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
he was bound to respect: withall that his <hi>Maiestie</hi>
would be pleased, for the better furnishing of those ships,
hee had their taken, their might bee leauied vnder his
command, a conuenient number of <hi>Turks</hi> with whom he

                  </gap>le, that heereafter his name should bee held of
his greatnesse in more regard, and his seruice more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
which sute of his, being granted at full, and
<hi>Croseman,</hi> being an ader and furtherance in all his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditons,</hi>
since as I said before in all his <hi>profits</hi> hee was
a full sharer. He puts forth from <hi>Tunis,</hi> and procéeded
<pb facs="tcp:4709:9"/>
downe to the bottome of the <hi>Straights,</hi> where he houered
not long before hee tooke a small <hi>Argosie,</hi> of the burden
of six hundred <hi>Tunnes.</hi> In the same action also, he tooke
a Ship of two hundred <hi>Tunnes,</hi> which he afterward na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>The little Iohn,</hi> and armed her with foure and
twenty péeces of <hi>Ordinance.</hi> Hee then surprised also the
<hi>Mattalena,</hi> a <hi>French Ship,</hi> who came from <hi>Alexandria</hi>
with rich <hi>Commodities.</hi> In this voyage likewise was
gathered to him one <hi>Abraham Croften,</hi> and many other
worthy spirits, whose <hi>resolutions,</hi> if they had beene ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to honourable <hi>actions,</hi> either a sea or shore, they
might haue béene preferred and commended for seruice
to the greatest <hi>Prince</hi> liuing.</p>
               <p>Now concerning my knowledge in these <hi>Proceedings,</hi>
they were all of them, and each particular deliuered mée
by <hi>Graues,</hi> who tooke mee <hi>Prisoner,</hi> and euery circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereof resolued mee at full, by diuers others,
whom I had seuerall conference withall. As also that
they were aboue two hundred <hi>Englishmen,</hi> good <hi>Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
and expert <hi>Mariners,</hi> when they procéeded forward
to the <hi>Gulfe of Venice.</hi> To the which voyage <hi>incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>
(saies <hi>Graues</hi>) we were foure well <hi>mand,</hi> and well
<hi>appointed</hi> Ships, ouer whom <hi>Captaine Ward</hi> was our
<hi>worthy Generall,</hi> who being seuered from vs by a forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Tempest,</hi> himselfe in his small <hi>Argosie,</hi> hauing none
but his <hi>Fly-boat</hi> with him, he met with a great <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>
of fourtéene or fiftéene hundred <hi>Tunnes,</hi> very richlie
laden with <hi>Venetian</hi> goods, and who, by <hi>Computation,</hi>
was estéemed to be worth <hi>two millions</hi> at the least, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
whom and him was such a <hi>mercilesse</hi> and <hi>incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fight,</hi> as a man may compare is betwéene those two
<hi>Tyrants,</hi> the <hi>remorselesse windes,</hi> and the <hi>resisting wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
It was <hi>long,</hi> and it was <hi>cruell,</hi> it was <hi>forcible,</hi>
and therefore fearefull: but in the end our <hi>Captaine</hi> had
the <hi>Sunshine,</hi> he boorded her, subdued her, <hi>chained</hi> her
men like <hi>slaues,</hi> and ceasd on her <hi>goods,</hi> as his lawfull
<pb facs="tcp:4709:10"/>
                  <hi>prise,</hi> whom the whistling calme made musicke vnto,
vshering her and our Generall into <hi>Tunis,</hi> and whose
bounty with his men, did there <hi>triumph</hi> with her <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which report from <hi>Graues,</hi> I receiuing not without
much wonder: and though I seemed to consent thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
in my iudgement I discredited it, reputing his tale
rather a vaine glorious boast from him, to raise his
<hi>Captaines</hi> fame, and the more to amaze vs, that were
his <hi>Prisoners,</hi> then any discourse of truth that was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the credit: till afterward, falling into conference with
<hi>Wards</hi> man, and who at that time was both in discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and dislike with his <hi>Master:</hi> of him I enquired of
the former relation, whose <hi>approbation</hi> was so much
and so much more highly <hi>aduanced,</hi> that mee thought
now, that <hi>Graues</hi> had but minced him in his discourse:
and where I ghest the spight and difference betwixt him
and <hi>Captaine Ward,</hi> should haue rather whetted his
tongue to disparage his <hi>worth,</hi> then haue stéeled it on to
describe his <hi>worthinesse,</hi> I vtterly found my expectation
frustrate: for demanding in particular of his <hi>Masters</hi>
valour, he did so farre commend his <hi>prouidence</hi> in going
on, and so farther extoll his <hi>manhood</hi> in atchieuing, that
for these last thrée yéeres, quoth he, he is growen the most
absolute, the most resolute, and the most vndauntedst
man in fight, that euer any heart did accompanie at <hi>sea.</hi>
And if his <hi>actions</hi> were as <hi>honest</hi> as his <hi>valour</hi> is <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,</hi>
his <hi>deeds</hi> might be dignified in the <hi>Chronicles</hi>
with the worthiest. As also that in the aforesaid fight,
and taking the <hi>Argosie,</hi> whose oddes was reputed to bée
thrée to one, he did in the deadly conflict so vndauntedly
beare himselfe, as if he had, had <hi>courage</hi> to out-braue
<hi>death,</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> to out-face <hi>danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bastinadoing</hi> the
<hi>Turkes</hi> out of his Ship into theirs, and <hi>pricking</hi> others
on euen with the point of his <hi>poiniard,</hi> that, quoth he, I
could impartially say, his only resolution was cause of
<pb facs="tcp:4709:10"/>
the <hi>victorie,</hi> and that his forwardnesse made <hi>Cowards</hi>
venturous; whereby at last hauing seased her for his
owns, and brought her into the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Tunis:</hi> and when
he had discharged and vnladen her goods, he diuided the
<hi>spoile</hi> as in share with the <hi>Turkes,</hi> to the great inriching
of the whole <hi>Country,</hi> and to the <hi>aduancing</hi> of his owne
<hi>pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as it is certaine, he that doth once accustome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to sinne, is alwaies sitting vpon <hi>Cockatrice</hi> egges,
that bring foorth nothing but poisonous <hi>effects:</hi> so fares
it with this <hi>Ward,</hi> and his whole company; and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue,
that goods ill gotten are most commonlie worse
spent, with this <hi>Treasure,</hi> which thus vniustly they had
inriched themselues withall, they accustome their liues
to all <hi>disorder,</hi> making their habit and carriage a shore,
farre more detestable, and vncomely to be talked of, or by
<hi>Christianity</hi> to be condemned and abhorred, then their
théeuing at Sea, <hi>swearing, drinking, dicing,</hi> and the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
enormities that are attended on by consuming <hi>riot,</hi>
are the least of their <hi>vices,</hi> that can bee recited. Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
are their goods got, and more vngodly are they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
in that they mix themselues like brute beasts
with the enemies of their Sauiour: so that he that was a

Nay sinne is growen to that <hi>ranknesse</hi> amongst them,
through the fatnesse of <hi>Concupiscence</hi> and <hi>Couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
that the <hi>Iewes</hi> hire out their <hi>off-spring</hi> to them as

in a most princely and <hi>magnificent</hi> state. His <hi>apparell</hi>
both curious and costly, his diet sumptuous, and his

that is neere him, which if he list not to regard, they haue
their answer from his man, that his greatnesse is not at

And so being now at the highest, in hope <hi>pride</hi> shall haue

               <p>
                  <hi>Ward</hi> hauing thus taken this great <hi>Argosie,</hi> and (with
her and others) so <hi>inestimable riches,</hi> his minde was so
<hi>inflated</hi> with <hi>pride,</hi> and puft vp with <hi>vaine glorie,</hi> that
he now thought, nay did not spare to speake, he was sole
and onely <hi>Commander</hi> of the <hi>Seas.</hi> And indéed, like the
<hi>Sea,</hi> alwaies <hi>vnsatisfied</hi> (although, as I haue heard, and
by reason did coniecture, his <hi>Treasure</hi> was infinite) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding
himselfe for a fresh encounter, hee placed in this
great <hi>Ship</hi> thréescore péeces of <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and put into
her a hundred and fifty <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and two hundred
and fiftie <hi>Turkes</hi> ouer whom he made <hi>Abraham Croften
Captaine,</hi> and himselfe <hi>Generall,</hi> in his small <hi>Argosie</hi>
the <hi>Mattalena</hi> and the little <hi>Iohn,</hi> with whom lying in
the mouth of the <hi>Gulfe</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> there grew (vpon some
discontents) a muteny betwixt the <hi>English</hi> and the
<hi>Turkes:</hi> which <hi>Ward</hi> hauing intelligence of, hee went
<pb facs="tcp:4709:11"/>
aboord the <hi>Argosie</hi> with his <hi>boate,</hi> and althoug the heat
thereof, were already broke foorth, to a very forceable
<hi>blaste,</hi> he by his <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>perswasion,</hi> did very
worthily allay it, wherin (being people of so differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

a <hi>Villaine,</hi> it was praise worthy in him to effect,
which <hi>discontent</hi> and <hi>heartburning</hi> appeased, hee came
a board his owne <hi>Ship</hi> againe, and lying in waite for
more bootie, it pleased God, now to preuent them a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
by a storme that arose, in which storme, the great <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gosie</hi>
being much disabled with cutting so many holes
out of her sides for the planting of <hi>Ordinance</hi> and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the Sea, the violent split her selfe, and suncke
suddenly, all the men in her being drowned saue onely
foure, who the next day were taken vp floting vpon a
<hi>Raft</hi> of the ship. So that, he who but euen now thought
himself <hi>Commander</hi> and resistles at the <hi>Seas,</hi> found here
a power had Command our him, whereupon, hee now
began to feare the retchlesnes of his estate, and greatly to
complaine of the violence of his losse. Especially, for
<hi>Croston,</hi> who was equall with him in manhood, and
nothing inferiour to him in <hi>Command</hi> and warlike <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
as also of the ruine of so many of his <hi>English,</hi> in
whom, his chiefe hope, stay, strength, and trust, was
built and consisted.</p>
               <p>Beside at his returne to <hi>Tunis,</hi> it was no small dismay
vnto him to heare so loudly the outcries and cursings
blown in his eares, of <hi>wiues, Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Kindred</hi> for
the losse, of so many of their friends at on blow, So that
for certaine, as <hi>Graues</hi> reported vnto me (in <hi>Wards</hi> own
opinion) he went not vp and downe but in feare of his
life, which distaste past, and doubt present, made him the
sooner haste to <hi>Sea</hi> againe, where to make it euident that
one <hi>sorrow</hi> neuer comes without an <hi>heire</hi> to succeede
him, my <hi>Captaine</hi> found that a second mischiefe did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this: for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> hauing sustained excéeding
<pb facs="tcp:4709:12"/>
great losse by his vngodly <hi>proceedings,</hi> the <hi>Segniorie</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> in redresse thereof, had caused to be built a great
Ship called <hi>S. Marke,</hi> of fifteene hundred <hi>Tunnes,</hi> in
manner of a <hi>Gallias,</hi> with fourescore péeces of brasse <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,</hi>
and with her set foorth twenty or thirty saile
of <hi>Gallies:</hi> whose <hi>voyage</hi> and <hi>enterprise</hi> was directed a
purpose to beat him out of the <hi>Gulfe,</hi> and from houering
about their <hi>Coast.</hi> These thus at <hi>Sea</hi> happened vpon
<hi>Wards fly-boat,</hi> and forced her <hi>ashore,</hi> whose men for
safety running on Land, the <hi>Venetians</hi> pursued, slew
many of them, and two and thirty that they tooke, they
hung vp for <hi>carrion</hi> in the Iland of <hi>Corfowe:</hi> another
of his men of <hi>warre</hi> they haue taken since, so that by these

I haue heard of diuers rich prises of the <hi>French</hi>
(which traded for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Cypres,</hi> and other
<hi>Ports</hi> in the <hi>bottome</hi>) which haue by him and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
béene since taken, who, for that I haue not heard

receiue these in good part, which from <hi>William Graues</hi>
his mouth were deliuered me, with the report of incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>wealth</hi> that he and his men of <hi>warre</hi> haue taken since
his first refuge in <hi>Tunis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ward</hi> hauing thus had his <hi>Argosie</hi> shipwrackt, and
after that, two of his best men of warrs taken by the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necians.</hi>
It followeth now that I in order deliuer, what
happened to him <hi>at Tunis.</hi> This last yeere was left him
onely, the halfe of two ships, the <hi>Mattelena,</hi> bearing two
and thirtie péeces of <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and of thrée hundred
<hi>Tuns,</hi> and the little <hi>Iohn</hi> spoken of before, which about
<hi>Christmas</hi> last past, he was minded to come to Sea with
all, and had furnished with victuals, munition, and all
things fitting for the furthering of his <hi>voyage.</hi> But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the last two yéeres past, dealt but grosely and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly
with such <hi>Englishmen,</hi> who were now left with
<pb facs="tcp:4709:12"/>
him, in not yéelding them their due shares, which they
expected their seruice dad deserued, they began now (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
aduantage of his lownesse) to repine and to gather
head against him, and concluded awongst themselues,
that rather then <hi>Ward</hi> should containe them in that <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude,</hi>
which in the time of his height and pride they
supposed they were held, they would now take a course
to proud for redresse, and which was, they would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
run away with the ship, (or at least, the shippe
should run away with them) and with her whole proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
sell her to the <hi>Maltesaies</hi> who were yet Christians,
and so become at their seruice. To which opinion with
a generall consent, they all agreed. And apointed one of
their companie <hi>Captaine</hi> and the same night before the
<hi>Turks</hi> should come a board, they did farewell to <hi>Tunis,</hi>
without taking their leaue, and went for <hi>Malta,</hi> being
in number fortie fiue <hi>English,</hi> and leauing their old <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
but thirtie in company,</p>
               <p>Which sudden alteration and vnexpected newes, the
next day comming to <hi>Crosiman,</hi> hee sent for <hi>Ward,</hi> and
there in very sterne manner, demanded from him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee were consenting to his <hi>Countremens</hi> Treason
namely, to the conueying away of the ship and goods, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
which the <hi>Kings maiestie</hi> his <hi>master</hi> was a party and hee
himselfe had a halfe. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Ward</hi> made answer that he
was no way guiltie of it, neither had he reason to be, since
his owne losse was as great as his. Well replies <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siman,</hi>
be aduised that thou art not, neither let the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
and <hi>wealth,</hi> that thou hast got by our support, bée
an incouragement, shall entise thée to leaue vs, and serue
<hi>Christians,</hi> but beare thy selfe euen, and to preuent thy
escape, I will haue halfe of thy part of the <hi>mattelena,</hi> for
my share of the <hi>Iohn,</hi> which thy <hi>Countrymen</hi> haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
me of, then either resolue me of thy will, or resist
mee as thou thinkest good, but <hi>Ward</hi> finding it no fit
time to replie to the contrary, for feare of his head: made
<pb facs="tcp:4709:13"/>
answer, that both himselfe, seruice, and all his, was at
his pleasure. So that <hi>Ward,</hi> now left shiplesse, almost
frindlesse, and his state declining, since the <hi>Crosiman</hi>
hath left him, he began to leauie his wits together, what
hee were best to resolue vpon, to aduenture to <hi>Sea</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
he thought it not yet fitting, but determined, rather
to send others a fishing for him. In which determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he foorthwith buies him a ship of 80. or 90. <hi>Tuns,</hi>
and appointed one <hi>Captaine Sampson</hi> to bee the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
mans her with a hundred men, of which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the ship were his owne, not many of them were
<hi>English,</hi> but the most of them <hi>Turkes,</hi> who so ouersway
them at <hi>Sea,</hi> that the <hi>Captaine</hi> may bid what hee will,
and they will doe what they list. For this <hi>Sampson</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
foorth of <hi>Tunis</hi> the eighth of <hi>Februarie</hi> last, The first
ship that he tooke was <hi>Captaine Fursman</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> a
<hi>Gentleman</hi> who in former time had béene as <hi>Samsons</hi>
sworne brother, of whom when <hi>Sampson</hi> came to take,
note of, (In this I commend his generous spirit) hee
would by no meenes haue ri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>led him, but earnestly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
in all that he might, to haue frely giuen him his
ship and goods againe. To which request of his the
<hi>Turks</hi> by no meanes would bee brought to consent, but
the more he entreated, the more they denied, till at last
one among the rest, and who it should seeme, was
<hi>Life teant</hi> to <hi>Samspon,</hi> strucke violent at him, whom all
the rest as readily seconded, so that hee was compeld to
looke heauily vpon his friende, and enforced to be silent
while they ceased on the good <hi>Marchant,</hi> Master <hi>William
Fursman</hi> with the ship and goods.</p>
               <p>The very same day, the said <hi>Sampson</hi> in <hi>Wards</hi> ship,

(who was sole brother, to <hi>William Furseman,</hi> who
they had taken not fixe houres before) was master, from
him they tooke likewise both ship and goods, and then
most cruelly, without pitty, and not regarding prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb facs="tcp:4709:13"/>
turned the two <hi>brothers</hi> into their ships <hi>Boate,</hi> and
thrée leagues from land in a very growne Sea, where it
was impossible to recouer the land, but must vnfortunat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haue perished, had not a ship of <hi>Venice</hi> happened by
chance to haue taken them vp. Oh, what <hi>inhumane
crueltie</hi> was this, in them toward two naturall
brothers, and who can expresse: the sorrow and
griefe (their cases being a like) that one had for another
one striuing to helpe the <hi>second</hi> when they saw nothing
but to perish both, hee lending one <hi>hand</hi> to helpe him,
when both would not serue to helpe himself, but leauing
them to their <hi>Comfort,</hi> and the rest to be <hi>damned</hi> who
tooke two prises more though but small Ships, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Tunis</hi> who to their <hi>Captaine Ward</hi> was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
according to the prouerbe, <hi>Somewhat hath some
sauour,</hi> although he séemed wonderous discontent, that
<hi>Sampson</hi> had not brought him a tall Ship, wherein his
<hi>worships Person</hi> might to théeuing himselfe, but conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himselfe in the meane time, and neither lamenting
nor reproouing him for dealing so vnkindly now with his
Countrimen, got away straight, he sends <hi>Sampson</hi> to
Sea againe, who in this action thriued so succesfully,
that he takes for <hi>Ward</hi> a small <hi>Argosie,</hi> or rather a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
of thrée hundred <hi>Tunnes,</hi> with thrée prises more
<hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> which was in <hi>Iune</hi> last, whereby
with the strength that they haue brought him, he is now

found <hi>riding</hi> fourtéene Saile of <hi>great Ships</hi> for men of
<hi>warre</hi> to go toward the <hi>bottome</hi> of the <hi>Gulfe,</hi> and twelue
or thirteene Saile of smaller, with <hi>men of warre</hi> to lie
to the <hi>westward,</hi> and about the <hi>Ilands of Sardmia maiork</hi>
and <hi>miniake,</hi> all which Ships my <hi>men</hi> which were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
taken in a <hi>French ship</hi> in their passage homwards
and carried backe againe to <hi>Tunis,</hi> did see thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>So that I hope since the report holds, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
haue beene in that road, and burnt twenty fiue saile
of Ships, it is infallibly true, that both <hi>Ward</hi> and his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants
are at length <hi>depriued</hi> of most of their <hi>strength,</hi>
or at least so <hi>infeebled,</hi> that they shall neuer bee able to
carrie such sway againe. Further, it is for certaine, that
the said <hi>fleet</hi> is busie in the search of <hi>Danser,</hi> and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
onely in seuerall places to cut him and his <hi>forces</hi> off.
Of all which <hi>proceedings</hi> of <hi>Ward, Danser,</hi> or their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,</hi>
which I haue either séene, or by other mens
knowledge heard, I haue truly giuen you to vnderstand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4709:15"/>
Which paines of mine, if it be either welcome to <hi>you,</hi> or
acceptable to the <hi>world,</hi> your <hi>friend</hi> is satisfied, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
it well bestowed.</p>
               <p>Whereas it was reported in a former booke,
that the <hi>Yorke Bonauenture</hi> (of which I was master)
carried fifteene cast peeces at the time of her ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
she had scarce fiue which shee could vse, or
were fit for seruice.</p>
