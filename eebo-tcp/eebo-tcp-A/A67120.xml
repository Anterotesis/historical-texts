            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>IF all those vertues which the Criticks call</l>
            <l>Vertues Devine, and vertues cardinall,</l>
            <l>If these together mixt with Royall blood</l>
            <l>Can scarcely make a claime to merit good,</l>
            <l>If her great merits could not impetrate,</l>
            <l>So much as not to be unfortunate,</l>
            <l>And in misfortunes to exceed so farre,</l>
            <l>As if the worst of all her sex she were;</l>
            <l>How light will our best worke be in heavens scale</l>
            <l>If Shee thus farre in points of merit faile,</l>
            <l>Had Shee been <hi>Romes</hi> her Superarogation,</l>
            <l>Had been sufficient for the British Nation,</l>
            <l>And would have made the papall Sea as great</l>
            <l>As <hi>Rome</hi> was when it was <hi>Augustus</hi> seat.</l>
            <l>Who would not have a blessed Pilgrim been,</l>
            <l>Had he ever read the Story of this Queen.</l>
            <l>Had not the Romane Doctrine been disputed,</l>
            <l>That others merit cannot be imputed,</l>
            <l>The Antinomists though th'are very loath</l>

In Her rich merits, so even they might hope</l>

            <l>The Character of patience <hi>Iob,</hi> even He</l>

            <l>The Story of thy sufferance, who can tell,</l>
            <l>This I dare say, it hath no paralell.</l>
            <l>Thou wer't the Daughter of a mighty King,</l>
            <l>Great <hi>Charles</hi> His only Sister, and did'st bring</l>
            <l>A portion worthy the Imperiall Crown;</l>
            <l>Besides, the greatest portion was thine own;</l>
            <l>'Twas for thy sake the German Princes did</l>
            <l>Set <hi>Bohems</hi> Crown upon thy Husbands Head:</l>
            <l>They saw (good Queen) thy vertues were so great,</l>
            <l>They would have pla'ct Thee on th'Imperiall Seat.</l>
            <l>All these thou lost at once, that we might see,</l>
            <l>The Gods on Earth have a capacity</l>
            <l>Of fatall change, that Kings and Queens may know</l>
            <l>There are no fixed fortunes here below.</l>
            <l>Lord! What a Sea of Princely Christian blood</l>
            <l>Hath been pour'd out, to make thy Title good.</l>
            <l>Had shee been <hi>Romes,</hi> all these had Sainted been,</l>
            <l>And stil'd, <hi>The blessed Martyrs of this</hi> Queen.</l>
            <l>Thou and thy King with a distracted Train</l>
            <l>Before thy Foes fled, and pursu'd amain.</l>
            <l>Thy Husband banisht from His Native soyl,</l>
            <l>Friends, Cities, Country, made a wofull spoyl</l>
            <l>And sackt. The Plague, the Famine, Fire, and Sword,</l>
            <l>Were glutted all, Nature the sights abhord.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:43155:3"/>
Yet, as enough, thy patience were not tri'd,</l>
            <l>Thy Gould in new fires must be purifi'd:</l>
            <l>Thy first born Son which was the greatest losse,</l>
            <l>With Ayry Nailes was sixt upon the Crosse:</l>
            <l>Twixt Heaven and Water, and the Vessell drownd</l>
            <l>There frozen to the Mast was next Day found.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Sweadens</hi> King that thunderbolt of War,</l>
            <l>Who had He liv'd, had been an Emperor,</l>
            <l>Had rais'd Your Husbands Heart, that He espi'd</l>
            <l>Some glimering hopes, and in that twi-light died.</l>
            <l>Before thou could'st recover such a crosse,</l>
            <l>Sad News was brought thee of another losse,</l>
            <l>That Great <hi>Gustavus</hi> was untimely slain,</l>
            <l>(As t'was suppos'd with Pistols sent from <hi>Spain</hi>)</l>
            <l>Whose Martiall Soul, not us'd to be said nay</l>
            <l>In it's Ascention, got a glorious Day.</l>
            <l>As in His Journey, it the Planets past,</l>
            <l>'Twas so much honored there, great <hi>Mars</hi> at last</l>
            <l>Begun to fear, He could not choose but see,</l>
            <l>His Legions did incline to mutiny,</l>
            <l>And joyn'd together would a Councell call,</l>
            <l>To make that Spirit of His their Generall.</l>
            <l>Never the Soul of any King Ascended,</l>
            <l>Who had from Earth to Heaven been more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended.</l>
            <l>My Muse grows weary with this Tragick Story</l>
            <l>(Nor could I force her) were it not Her glory</l>
            <l>Whom it concerns, (now to the last I come,</l>
            <l>So may it be her brave Heroique Son)</l>

Whose sweetnesse here hath so much honour got,</l>
            <l>Except the Queen, few have so great a stocke</l>
            <l>In Court, and Country both, nor would I see</l>
            <l>A kinder Father saving Majestie</l>
            <l>Then our King was; and seldome have I seen</l>
            <l>A kinder Mother, then our vertuous Queen.</l>
            <l>When this sweet Prince had here tri'd some few freinds</l>
            <l>And had propounded to the King his ends,</l>
            <l>He ships himselfe, needs but to hoise halfe saile</l>
            <l>Least prayers and sighes should raise too great a gale,</l>
            <l>Words are but ayre, and prayers but words in forme,</l>
            <l>'Tis but excesse of Ayre that makes a storme.</l>

               <hi>Austria</hi> too long for Justice hath been suited,</l>
            <l>Their cause must now with sharpe swords be disputed.</l>
            <l>Our King and they with treaties were deluded,</l>
            <l>Both she and hers by Act of State excluded,</l>
            <l>From all their Rights, an Army then they rais'd,</l>
            <l>On such a suddaine, it the world amaz'd;</l>
            <l>He brings them to the field, beseidg'd a Town,</l>
            <l>Which to th'Imperiallists was quickly known;</l>
            <l>Two distant Armies correspondence hold,</l>
            <l>(Which made even both the Armies far more bold)</l>
            <l>The lesser dares him out, keeps him in play,</l>
            <l>Meane while the stronger marches night and day</l>
            <l>And got behinde him, to his passage make,</l>
            <l>Which with their horse, too strong for his they take;</l>
            <l>When the Prince saw his army thus enclos'd,</l>
            <l>He cals a Councell, he himselfe suppos'd</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:43155:4"/>
'Twas best to charge those which the passage kept,</l>
            <l>Which all agreed on, and before they slept,</l>
            <l>They March away, though they were almost tyr'd</l>
            <l>And over Marcht, their Trenches then they Fir'd.</l>
            <l>Into Brigadoes they their strength devide,</l>
            <l>Flanker their foot, with Horse on either side.</l>
            <l>Their strength was Horse, their Baggage they inclose,</l>
            <l>Guarded their Cannon; then He <hi>Craven</hi> chose,</l>
            <l>And to his charge He did commit the Van,</l>
            <l>Who prov'd himselfe that Day, <hi>A Daring Man,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And shewd himself so resolute and bould,</l>
            <l>His name is in the Book of Fame enrould.</l>
            <l>He and His Brother did bring up the Reare,</l>
            <l>Whose high born Spirits did that Day appeare.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Craven</hi> charg'd home and did them sore dismay,</l>
            <l>But for their fresh supplies, He won the Day.</l>
            <l>The Battles joyn, the Imperialists increa'st,</l>
            <l>And as they grew, Death had the greater Feast.</l>
            <l>The Reare came bravely up, the young Prince He,</l>
            <l>In thirst of Honour, sence of injury;</l>
            <l>Himself to such high hazards He expos'd,</l>
            <l>As He was often by His foes enclos'd;</l>
            <l>Yet who enclos'd Him, or enforst His stay,</l>
            <l>He, by their ruines, made himself still way.</l>
            <l>But when Prince <hi>Robert,</hi> Her brave second Son,</l>

Through troops of Horse and Foot He forst His way,</l>
