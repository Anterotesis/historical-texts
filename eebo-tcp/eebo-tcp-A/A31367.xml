            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Friend,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat which I have here published may give thee to understand
(if with a meek spirit thou wilt peruse it) how the Lord several
years ago caused his Light in some measure to shine out of the
darknesse in the hearts of many of these professing Professors,
whereby they came in measure to see the grosse darknesse wherewith
people was then covered, and many of the superstitions that were then
upheld by such as professed godlinesse; And then a zeal for God did stir
in many of them against them, and while they retained their tendernesse
and simplicity, and kept in the fear of the Lord, then was the Lord near
them; but when they begun to seek and set up themselves more then the
Lords glory and his truth, then did the Lord by degrees withdraw from
them; when they exalted themselves and begun to persecute the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and innocent people, that were brought (through mercy) to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of what they saw at a distance; And when they got the power
into their hands, then their Priests with the help of their power begun to
silence others and keep under them, even as they had been silenced and
kept under; And they crept into their parsonage-houses, and benefices, &amp;
in processe of time became highly guilty of their abominations.</p>
            <p>Moreover, by that which here followeth thou may see how many of them
will change their merchandi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to continue their trade &amp; dishonest gain,
&amp; are like unto subtil &amp; cunning merchant-men, who observe what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
is the most commodious, and will vend the best among those they
deal withall, even they will they provide for them, partly for their own
advantage, and partly for pleasing of the people, &amp;c. This following
Treatise also sheweth how they have cryed for help, and how they have
been countenanced, and holpen by the sundry powers that have been in
being for these many years; And particularly, how generally from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every County in the Nation they with others made their deceitfull
Adresses unto <hi>R. Cromwell,</hi> by which thou may see their blasphemies,
and flatteries, their promises and engagements unto him; And do thou
judge how dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tful and hypocritical they have proved; And it also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by what followeth, what hath happened unto, and befallen those
that helped them, who are fallen, split and broken; yet they whom they
combined together against stand in as much power, authority, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in Gods eternal Truth as ever, and the Lord hath appeared to their
<pb facs="tcp:41355:3"/>
joy and honour whom they cast out, but to their shame and confusion who
have dealt deceitfully both with God and man: And if the Lord shall
cause the same measure to be mete to them, which they have measured
unto others, it would but be just with him who will in no wise acquit the
guilty, nor suffer the wicked to go unpunished.</p>
            <p>These things are put forth to publick view, not to add grief unto their
affliction that are already humbled and cast down, but rather to put them
in mind of their former proceedings, which have caused this day of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
and calamity to be hastned upon them, of which they have been often
warned &amp; foretold by us (the Lords Servants) who now rejoyceth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is come upon them, for we have rather desired to have seen them
have forsaken the evil of their doings, &amp; have returned unto the Lord with
all their hearts, that so they might have obtained Mercy from him; neither
is this intended to strengthen the hands of their persecutors, for we are
as absolutely against the spirit of persecution in their adversaries, as we
were against it in them, and our testimony by suffering under it, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and intend to bear against it now, and henceforth, as heretofore if
the Lord permit; And we are now as far from siding with these Priests
who cast them out, as we were from siding with them in their covetous
practises and their abominations which hath long grieved the hearts
and spirits of the faithful; Now if thou be one that art concerned in the
things herein contained, be not offended with my plain and upright deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for a necessity laid upon me to write and publish these things, which
I saw in the light of the Lord to be come and coming to passe; And if I be
accounted their enemy for telling them the Truth, I shall notwithstanding
rest in peace in the Lord, in whose sight I have cleared my conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them in much love and tendernesse towards the witnesse of God
in them, which is now nearer to answer unto the Truth in many of them,
then it was when they were high and lifted up; And oh that they would
yet lay these things to heart, and return unto him that smiteth them, then
should they find favour in his sight, with whom we know there is mercy
that he might be feared.</p>

the Lord now <hi>to pour out contempt upon you</hi> in the sight of those
whom you have contemned, and to make you as contemptible
in the eyes of others, as his despised people have been in yours;
You have had a glorious day of prosperitie, as to the outward,<note place="margin">What a day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors have had.</note>
wherein the Sun of Righteousnesse hath caused his Light to
shine forth gloriously, to the <hi>illuminating</hi> of many of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings

not liked to walk in his Light, nor to <hi>retain</hi> his Counsel, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

under, when you were restrained from having the liberty of

your understanding to be more agreeable to the Scriptures of
Truth, then that publick way of worship which then was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished

remember what a tendernesse there was in those daies in your
hearts towards the Lord and good people; And were not the
meetings that you had in those dayes in your own houses, or in
other private places very comfortable and refreshing, and was
there not more of the presence and power of God felt and
seen amongst you in your meetings in those daies,<note place="margin">1 Cor 14. 30. 31.</note> (when any
man among you that feared God might have had liberty to

in which you found so much of the presence and goodnesse of
God? And could you not in those daies have borne the revilings
of the people much better then you could do now? Could you
not also have suffered better for that which your soules then
thirsted after, then now you could for that which you professe?
And was not your love very large to such as in those daies were
persecuted for conscience sake? did not you then take part with
them (when you durst appear) against such as persecuted them?
And was not that <hi>the light of the Lord</hi> in you, which let you see
in those daies the evil of oppression; and the evil of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherewith you were persecuted for conscience sake? was
not that also the light of the Lord that gave you to see the
emptinesse of that worship which you then liked not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable

you willing to suffer for conscience sake, rather then you would
do that which was contrary to your conscience? And had you
not <hi>peace, joy, comfort,</hi> and <hi>refreshment</hi> in measure, in your suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings

               </gap>h forth such things in your prayers to the
Lord, who was determined <hi>to try you</hi> as he hath done, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
may more fully appear?</p>
            <p>Is it not well known unto many of you, how that when you
<hi>were little in your own eyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">When they were low and tender the Lord had respect to them.</note> and few in number in comparison of
the multitude that was contrary minded, that even then, and
at that time when your hearts were very tender, and you very
low and humble before the Lord, then did he appear for you,
for then he had respect unto you, and his anger that was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
against those that then would not let you have the liberty
of your Consciences, for they sought to quench and extinguish
that which he had kindled in your hearts, and their sins and
abominations were grown to a very great height, and many
things the Lord had against them, so that in processe of time
the fire of his jealousie did wax so hot against them,<note place="margin">Isa. 33. 14.</note> that they
were not able to dwell in it,<note place="margin">Hos. 10. 8.</note> but did begin to fly to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and to the hills, and unto them they cried for help, but
these could not save them from the terrible storm which swept
them away.</p>
            <p>Then did your day begin to dawn, and the visitation of Gods
eternal Love was then unto you, whose cries had (in the daies
of your distresse) entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabboth,
and then was he determined to try you, whom he raised even
as from the dunghill, and put a very excellent opportunity
into your hands; For then many in Authoritie and Power
begun to advise with you, and take counsel at you, and put
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41355:5"/>
you into places of preferment, (which you receiving begun
to alter from the Lord) and some of them you begot into your
own image, and these promoted you, and you flattered them;
And by degrees, in processe of time you came to be invested
with the supream Authoritie in the Nation; And then you
strove to wind out those that were not for your design, though
for your own ends you made use of many that were not of
your mind, but them you kept under, and by guile caught
them in your snare; so that it was so with you for a season, that
you might do what seemed good in your own eyes;<note place="margin">How evill befell them.</note> And then
many begun to sit down at ease, having enriched themselves
with the spoil of their enemies, and were not onely gotten into
their possessions and estates, but were also plunged into their
sins, and were become as proud, as covetous, as self-seeking as
their enemies had been; And this many saw in the light of the
Lord, that had been one with you in your affliction and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
in your sufferings and servitude which you had passed
through before you came into the seats of those that the Lord
drove out before you.</p>
            <p>And when those that feared the Lord amongst you beheld
your degeneration,<note place="margin">Why they that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away from them</note> and saw so little was performed of what

that retained their sinceritie towards God came out volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
from among you, and others that could not bear your
actions, but must reprove you, were turned out by you; And
even at that very time when many of you were in Authoritie,
did the Lord God of heaven and earth <hi>cause his Light to shine out
of the darknesse in the hearts of a remnant,</hi> even more clearly and
more gloriously then it had done in yours; And by this eternal
Light (which was the same that had shined in your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
whereby you had seen the evil of those things which
you had long groaned under) by this Light I say did the Lord
convince many of his everlasting Truth, and of the evil of
destroying and devouring one another, so that many came by
the arme of Gods power to be gathered into the life of those
things which you professed,<note place="margin">How o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were brought to that which they had lost.</note> and came again to be brought into
that tendernesse which you had lost, and came to be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly

you had been before; And though those had been with you,
and had hazarded life, liberty, and estate with you, yet you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41355:5"/>
could not bear them, because they could not bear your hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie
and deceit, nor suffer it to passe unreproved, therefore
did you turn your hand against them that were your dearest
friends; and begun to make Leagues and Covenants with such
as have now proved your enemies indeed;<note place="margin">How they crept into fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been possible) <hi>all men after them</hi> into that Form, in which there
were, (and yet to this day are) some, as bad as those that you
suffered under many years ago, so in processe of time many
came to see by the light of the Lord, that they were not in the
right way; And so left them and went forth from that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by which they had seen their covetousnesse, their rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and the emptinesse of their form, and so went too among
them called Independants, who in some things had a more shew

who were his flock, and where they did feed and rest;<note place="margin">Cant. 1. 7.</note> And
therefore did they run to the Anabaptists (so called) who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
much in judgement from those with whom they had walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but in processe of time the light of the Lord manifested the
emptinesse of their inventions, as it had done the loosenesse of

offended, and your indignation came to be kindled against them,
as the wrath of your adversaries was kindled against you in the

when you had lost the tendernesse that was in your selves you
exalted your selves over them that were tender, and made a

of places of authority, out of power, and out of
your Church fellowships; And then preferred shallow, selfish

to you, nor give you flattering Titles; did you not then and
often upon that very account lay them aside, esteemed them

truest friends, who bore much of the heat of the day, and were
more noble and valiant then your selves, and for whose sakes
(rather then for yours) the Lord often delivered you out of

            <p>But oh let me ask you, are not your promises, ingagements
and Vows, which you made unto the Lord in the dayes past
(which you have not yet faithfully payed and performed) are
not these become a heavy burthen unto many of you, who in
this thing are guilty? Or have you thought that it hath been a
light thing to make a vow unto the Lord (as some of you have
done many) and not to perform it? Surely if you had had so
much tendernesse remaining in you, as <hi>Iephthah</hi> had, <hi>Iudg 11.

you were little in your own eyes; Was not your mouths then
opened unto the Lord? And had you not a testimony in your

it happened unto you, even in the height of your profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>And now O ye Professors, know you what will be the end
of these things that have befallen you, who was once above all
other men, invested with the Authority of the Nation, one
Professor recommending another to them that then were in

got a sword upon his thigh, &amp; who then were accounted of
but professors, or who were to be trusted with places of Office
and trust in the Nation but professors; And in those dayes when
profession was in such great reputation, then crept many into it
hoping thereby to get places of preferment, when they got to Be
in fellowship, and of such a Church, or of such an Assembly, for
then they came to be in esteem with professors, and some then
would speak to their Superior officers who were almost all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors)
in the behalf of such a man who was become a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

of such a Church, and then he was looked upon to be a
worthy man to bear rule, or to be put in authority in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
And thus did many of you get up, until you became too
high for all reproof; And then such as would not joyn with

they little regarded, neither would they at all be perswaded
to make any League or Covenant with you; And when that
you by your fair perswasions and large promises could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail

many of you would chuse rather to strengthen the hands of
the wicked against them, then put forth a hand to help them;

this Nation, which You Professors have run after, much
I have to say concerning them; Oh that You had <hi>an ear open to

and pretences have deceived many of You, they have
had their day of visitation, as well as You, &amp; they have also had
a day of prosperitie, wherein they have promised Peace to
themselves and to You also; several of them have had some ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
in their hearts towards God (I do believe) when they
saw (by the light of the Lord in their own consciences) the
heavy Yoaks and many oppressions that the upright in heart
groaned and traveled under, and then there was a zeal in
them for God and godlinesse, and after that power came
to be overturned, whereby some of them had been
silenced, then did they begin to stir themselves, and night and
day laboured and endeavoured to induce You into Church
Fellowship and so came too get You too under their discipline;<note place="margin">Note here the subtilty of the Priests</note>
And then began to make their party strong, and so came to
prevail against them, that had been authorised by such as had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41355:9"/>
kept them under; And then they began to silence others with
the same power and weapon by which they themselves had
been silenced; And then they begun to turn out others by the
strength of the same arme by which they themselves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

been kept under, and then did they draw many after them;
And then they came to be highly exalted in the Nation, and
began to grow <hi>into arrogancy and covetousnesse,</hi> and several of them
begun then to look after <hi>great benefits;</hi> And they having the
powers of the earth much on their side, could by the help of
their <hi>order</hi> easily get others out that were not of their mind,
and so by degrees could wind themselves in; And when they
were once setled in their places and livings, and got the name
of Parliament-Ministers, few then durst oppose them, or find
fault with them, they being setled by order of Parliament.
Then did they begin to insult over many of their Parishioners,<note place="margin">Mark their authority. How they received the wage, but did not the work.</note>
and proved deceitfull and treacherous to many of them, whose
Tythe of Corn, Hay, Wool, Lamb, Hemp, Geese, Eggs, Pigs,
Apples, Cheries, and Turnups, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these have coveted and
received, and when they have gotten them of poor men, they
have refused to do those things which they were to do, upon
whom these benefits were first conferred, and so the poor
men have been constrained to hire others to do that which
they judged their Priests should have done for them; as bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
their Infants, churched their Wives, and have administred
that they call the Lords Supper to them, which some of your
High-Priests would not do to many of their Parishioners, and
so the poor men have paid double for that which is little
worth; and if any of them desired to have a Funeral Sermon
at their Burial, these Priests would not give it them under ten
shillings at the least, neither would they admit several of their
Congregation into fellowship with them, except they would
take on their form, and comply with them in their Traditions,
which many simple people could not do; And therefore hath
that been with-holden from them by their Priests (that have
exercised Lordship over them) which the people did think they
had as good right unto, as their Teachers had unto their
Tythe, which the poor simple people durst not with-hold from
them, though they did not administer bread and wine, nor
read the Service Book; But in those daies you and your Priests

               <p>And thus (<hi>you Professors</hi>) when you were but few in a Parish,
(while you had <hi>the sword upon your thigh,</hi> &amp; power in your hand)
could keep a number of people under you, who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But in those dayes when profession came in fashion and was
in estimation, many for their own ends crept into it, and these
high professing Priests got many Proselites, and many followed
them in <hi>their pernicious wayes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 2.</note> and upheld them in their covetous

which they are willing to suffer, and in walking answerable to

complying and condescending to that which they have fought
against, prayed against, and strongly contended against, then
they will appear to be unstable and inconstant, and we may
the rather conclude their end was not good, nor single before
the Lord, in their aspiring into profession, if that they renounce
it for fear of persecution; and this may be a <hi>Caracter</hi> for many
whereby many shall be made manifest to the Nation.</p>
               <p>But what have we not already observed that many of you
Professors (with your Teachers) have already brought much
contempt upon your selves,<note place="margin">How they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready brought contempt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> by deviating and falling from your

of <hi>bone-fires,</hi> and your giving money to others for <hi>ringing of

selves) And your drinking of <hi>the Kings health</hi> (till he prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited

it, by his serviceable Proclamation) yea many things were
done by some of you some months ago,<note place="margin">One great evill of theirs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested.</note> whereof severall of you
are now ashamed; and among the rest this was one great evil,
(to wit) your fury and madnesse, rage and persecution which
you run into against us (the people of the Lord) about the time
that the King came into the Nation, when you were afraid
your selves of being called in question; Oh! what <hi>havock</hi> did
you then in some places make of us, to manifest to all that you
were not of us; how then did you side with those that rose up
against us; insomuch that <hi>had not the Lord been on our side,</hi> and
appeared for us, in all likelihood, you with those with whom
you joyned would even have swallowed us up.</p>
               <p>For at that time it was the expectation of many,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that we
should have been given up into the hands of the rude multitude,
and so to have become their prey; but hitherto the Lord hath
not suffered it to come to passe according to the expectations
of many, which the Lord hath frustrated in a great measure,
and marvellously did <hi>he still the raging of the boisterous Sea,</hi> and
after a great storm we beheld a sudden calm, which we look
upon to <hi>be the Lords doing, which indeed was marvellous in our
eyes.</hi>

               <p>Though I have here a little digressed from what I have to
say further concerning the <hi>Caracter of your Teachers,</hi> now I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to come to it again, for my Spirit is grieved with their
treacheries, and the souls of the Righteous are vexed from
day to day with their deceitful dealings, and hypocritical
flatteries and pretences; and if the Lord should give them up
into the hands of their adversaries, as we have been given up
into theirs (by such as should have protected us from their
crueltie) it would be just with the Lord, who hath a controversie
with them, because they have exalted themselves more then
him; And therefore will he in processe of time (I believe)
throw them by, as he hath done <hi>Parliaments, Protectors</hi> and
<hi>Counsels</hi> that upheld them, who are now become as withered
branches, though once they spread themselves as <hi>a green Baytree;</hi>

untill their branches begun to wither, and then they withdrew,
and crept towards those that seemed to flourish the most, but
many of their friends are departed, and scattered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
is powred out upon them, and their strength is departed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41355:11"/>
from them, and the power that they once had in their hands
it is taken from them and given to their neighbours; And
therefore have these Teachers that made so many Addresses
to them (with large promises, that they would stand by them
to assist them with Lives and Estates against all enemies and
disturbers whatsoever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) withdrawn from them, when they
saw they could not save themselves nor help them; to what end
then was their blessings, wherewith they had blessed them, and
their prayers which they had made for them? surely many
were deceived by them, who thought <hi>they had leaued upon the Lord,
and that he had been among them,</hi> and that therefore no evil could
have come upon them; yet even at that time when they cryed
peace,<note place="margin">Jer. 6. 14. 15.</note> came sudden ruine and desolation even in one day upon
many, whose confidence was more in the arme of flesh then in
the Living God.</p>
               <p>Surely had not these Teachers (of whom I write) renounced
them that once were their onely friends, and cryed up those
whom before they had detected, they had fallen with them
that fell, and they had been split when others were broken to
pieces; but what! do they think they stand yet; if so, let them
take heed least they fall, for assuredly they stand upon very
<hi>slippery places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath been observed,<note place="margin">Note.</note> how that their renowned friends by
all their back-sliding, revolting, conforming, submitting and
condescending from one thing to another, could not become
guiltlesse and inexcusable, neither could they thereby keep
their places of preferment, preserve their honour, retain their
reputation, and continue in Authoritie, but were by degrees
wrought out by a generation of men that were as subtil and
politick as themselves, but this was done by degrees, and not
all in one day; now such as perceived what things would tend
to, that begun to break forth among them in Authoritie, who
could not renounce their principles, but would rather throw
in their Commissions, surrender their places,<note place="margin">Wherein some was more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</note> and lay down their
Armes, then they would act contrary to their Consciences,
such got more honour by their so doing (though then it was
contemptible) then they got that continned so long as they
could in power, by their becomming all, almost to any thing,
till that their inconstancy appeared in almost every thing, and
then some would scarce trust them in any thing: And thus it

hath happened unto the <hi>Rock of your</hi> Teachers <hi>(once) defence,</hi>
which is now broken, and breaking down; Let not them think
then totally to escape, for though they may be spared a season
as <hi>Solomon spared Abiathar the Priest, and Shimei that curst his Father,</hi>
1 Kings 2. yet they shall not alwaies go <hi>unpunished,</hi> though for
the present they may yet a little escape that which is decreed
to come upon them, even till their measure of iniquitie be as
full as the <hi>Amorites</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Surely he that executed justice and judgement upon their

even so hath the Counsel of many of the High Priests been

at this time laid aside, and (as it were) are removed out of the
