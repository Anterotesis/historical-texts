            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT in their zealous and cordial affection to the juſt rights and freedome of this Nation, with expence of blood and patrimony, they have faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerved this Common-wealth from the beginning of the late wars until reduced by Order of Parliament, with promiſe of fatisfaction forth with of ſuch Arrears as were due unto them, which may appear by ſeveral Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Ordinances of Parliament, and many of them voluntarily ſince the ſaid reducement, engaged, to the hazard of all that was dear unto them for the Publike good.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe their conſtant expectations (grounded upon the many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and engagements of the then Supreme Authority of this Nation) have been wholly fruſtrated, although they (to their great expence) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attended with many humble Addreſſes during the ſpace of ſeven yeers paſt, for the obtaining of their juſt ſatisfaction; for want of which, divers are brought to extreme penury, many ſtarved, and others in priſon ready to periſh.</p>
            <p>But their long and tedious attendance producing no fruit from the Parliament, after their diſſolution, they then made their humble Addreſſes to his Highneſſe, and Honourable Council, who were pleaſed to refer their Petition to the Council of the Army; who upon mature conſideration and conference had with your Petitioners, returned their ſenſe and reſults thereon to his Highneſſe, and the ſaid Council, by whoſe Order the ſame was tranſmitted (by the hands of Captain <hi>Howard)</hi> to the late Parliament, who after daily ſolicitations, did admit them (for ſatisfaction out of hands in <hi>Ireland)</hi> into an Act, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>An Act for ſatisfaction of Adventurers and Souldiers,</hi> dated the twenty ſixt day of <hi>September,</hi> 1653.</p>
            <p>That after the late Parliament diſſolved themſelves, they then made their humble Addreſſes to his Highneſſe, who was pleaſed to recommend them and their deſires unto the ſpeedy and ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Council ſitting at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> in order to their due relief and ſatisfaction, and perceiving that upon the addreſſes of ſome Officers, (under the ſame qualification with your Petitioners) Lands both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have been obtained for their ſatisfaction; and your Petitioners hitherto (by reaſon of the great and weighty affairs of the Common-wealth) are unſatisfied, ſo that your Petitioners upon this account are without hope of reaping any benefit, or to be enabled to receive ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by that ſecurity in the ſaid Act, according to the purport and meaning thereof.</p>
            <p rend="indent italic">Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray, that your Honours would be pleaſed to take the premiſes into your ſerious conſideration, to the end, that as the ſaid Act of the late Parliament intends a ſecurity unto them, their intereſt may be preſerved therein; And that ſome ſpeedy courſe may be taken for ſtating the Arrears of ſuch Officers and Souldiers, as are not yet ſtated; And that ſuch whoſe Arrears are already ſtated by Committees, or Commiſſioners, or any Anthoriſed by Order or Ordinance of Parliament, having faithfully ſerved this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and no ways forfeited their right to their juſt dues; All of them or their Aſſignes may be enabled by bond or otherwiſe to receive ſatisfaction for their Arrears ſo ſtated, and to be ſtated out of ſuch Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as are yet undiſpoſed of <hi>(viz)</hi> in the Counties of <hi>Dublin, Cork, Kildare,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlagh,</hi> or out of ſuch Lands there belonging to Corporations forfeited, or out of Biſhops, Dean and Chapters Lands there, or out of Forreſts Lands in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> yet unſold, or by ſome ſuch other way as to your grave Judgement ſhall ſeem meet, that ſo your Petitioners may be freed from their tedious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive attendance, receive the price of their blood, and be put into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be more inſtrumentally ſerviceable for this Common-wealth, which is their deſire.</p>
