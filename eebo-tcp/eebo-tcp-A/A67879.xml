            <title>The life and death of VVilliam Lawd, late Archbishop of Canterburie: beheaded on Tower-Hill, Friday the 10. of January. 1644. I. Here is a brief narration of his doings all his life long faithfully given-out, first, that his sayings at his death may not be a snare to the perdition of souls. II. His doings and sayings being compared and weighed together, his sayings are found infinitely too light; yet of weight sufficient to presse every man to make a threefold use from all, of infinite concernment to his eternall soul. By E.W. who was acquainted with his proceedings in Oxford; was an eye and eare witnesse of his doings and sayings in his courts here at London; and other places under his dominion.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Life and Death of <hi>VVilliam Lawd,</hi> late Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury; Briefly related.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Will begin in order, with his Life first, and his Death after: Ile set down faithfully, and as narrowly as I can, his <hi>Doings</hi> all his life long, and his <hi>Sayings</hi> at his death. And this I shall do for two reasons. (1) That every man, who will, may see, That his <hi>Deeds</hi> and his <hi>Words,</hi> do stand at an eternall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and can possibly be reconciled no more than Life and Death can. (2) That he who has read his Death, his Funerall Sermon there (A meer mockery of God, and good men; the Religion of God, and Reformation of men, a meer <hi>scorn</hi> to all these:) And findes it a snare to <hi>his Perdition;</hi> for he blesseth the man, and His <hi>fare-well</hi> to the world; May also read his <hi>life,</hi> and consider well on it, lest <hi>rising early</hi> and <hi>blessing his friend,</hi> because of some light expressions which fell from his mouth at his Death, it proves a snare to his soul now, and it be <hi>counted a curse</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23.</note> 
               <hi>unto him</hi> hereafter.</p>
            <p>I know I shall be envied for this, I know not of how many.


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125451:5"/>
Of none but Malignants sure, whose envie I would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have than their favour.</p>
            <p>Some good men may blame me too.</p>
            <p>I cannot believe that; They will blame them rather, who were so bold; To tell all the world, what he said at the point of his departure out of the World, thereby to argue his <hi>piety</hi> towards God, and his <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> towards men: And hold the world in ignorance of all he did all his <hi>life</hi> long, which argued him a <hi>mighty sinner,</hi> before the Lord, as was the unjust Judge, who neither feared God nor reverenced man.</p>
            <p>I, but I shall be judged very uncharitable now, and censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of a dying mans words.</p>
            <p>A short Apologie for this:</p>
            <p n="1">1 I appeal to God, that, I think, I looked with as pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full an eye upon his departing soul, as the best friend he had upon the Scaffold.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That I shall not judge him, or his dying words; No, I would have the Reader to leave that to God; I would help the Reader, well to understand, what he <hi>said</hi> at his death, by what he <hi>did</hi> all his life long.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To undeceive the ignorant at this high point, That they may not think to live as he did, and so to die, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any confession at all; or the least show of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> so <hi>giving Glory to God;</hi> and yet die in the Lord, the death of the Righteous: For these Reasons I have written the History of his Life, which I shall pen-up into the narrowest compasse, for two reasons also.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the common Reader may be at as little cost of time and purse, in reading the History of his Life, as he he was at, for reading his Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Because all the proceedings throughout his whole


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:125451:5"/>
Arraignment, and in Reference to that <hi>Crime</hi> he pleaded, even to his last, <hi>not Guilty,</hi> shall be clearly and fully set down, to the fullest satisfaction of all the world, even those, that are the most prejudiced Readers.</p>
            <p>The History of his Life begins from that time 1608. whereof I can write what my eyes saw, and what my ears heard concerning him, five years after he was <hi>Proctor</hi> of the Vniversity in Oxford, which was in the same year King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown of England, 1603. Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, and to make the more haste; he went out Doctor of the <hi>Civill Law,</hi> and was chosen President over the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge called <hi>Saint Johns;</hi> I may mistake somewhat in the Account of this time; because I was then yong, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to remember it; and came my selfe in that year unto the same Vniversitie, and to the Colledge, at that time, next adjoyning to his Colledge; I shall note here as an eye, and an ear witnesse: First,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he, Doctor <hi>Lawd</hi> then, Arch-Bishop at last, and Doctor <hi>Howson,</hi> afterward Bishop of Durham, did, as their turnes were to preach in Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Church, and Christ-Church, there scatter the seeds of evill Doctrines; for the suppression whereof, and keeping them from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king root, Doctor <hi>Abbots</hi> both, and other eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines bestirred themselves, and appeared the very next Lords day in opposition to those Doctrines, whereunto they would not <hi>give place for an hour.</hi> He went on, and declared to all the Christian world:</p>
            <p n="1">1. His zeale to <hi>Formes</hi> of Religion, and envy to the <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His love and liking to the <hi>Shadowes;</hi> and hatred to the <hi>Substance;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. His approbation of <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> even that

abomination, the <hi>picture of God the Father;</hi> and furious rage against the <hi>Image of God,</hi> stamped upon, and framed in His holy-ones.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His zeale to builde and beautifie dead Temples made with hands: and even mad with rage, against the Temples of the Holy Ghost, to deface, spoile, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy those living temples.</p>

And indeed it seemed to be a trouble in <hi>vain,</hi> for he had gone against his light so long, that now he was as a man in a Dungeon: And he had <hi>forced</hi> his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science so often, that surely now he had no <hi>conscience</hi> at all: Or if any in his <hi>sense,</hi> then <hi>seared,</hi> and <hi>past feeling</hi> in ours. All this appeared at the hour of his <hi>suffering</hi> for his horrible sins; which he should have confessed there before all the people, so giving <hi>Glory to God,</hi> and taking <hi>shame</hi> to himself: But he did contrary, he took <hi>Glory</hi> to himself, even of <hi>Martyrdome</hi> (which turned to his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shame:) and rising now, when he was falling into the pit, himself had digged, to the height of <hi>arrogancie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie,</hi> &amp;c: He laid the shame upon the <hi>Worthies</hi> of the Lord, whom he calls, the <hi>people,</hi> that he might call them <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and might be believed, That the people hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him into the Red Sea of bloud, as once the Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did, the Israel of God. But I prevent my self; I have concluded too briefly, the History of his Life, what his <hi>Doings</hi> were all along.</p>
            <p>Now I come to his <hi>sayings</hi> at the houre of his Death, which every man has heard, or read; and some are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But I must tell you, as my eares told me, what the simple and ignorant people said, at the hearing of his words; and satisfie them, if I can; They say,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> (1) They will believe a Dying man, addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to give-up his Account to God; He will be serious


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:125451:9"/>
now; and lay-open his conscience before the world, which he must open presently before the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>B.</hi> (1) Probable so, and but probable; for certain it is, some men, not serious, have died, as he died, with an horrible lye on his tongue; It is a serious thing to die; for then the soul lancheth forth into the Ocean of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and, if the <hi>thread</hi> of life be cut off in wrath, life runnes forth into an everlasting <hi>bottome,</hi> there to abide under Wrath for ever: And yet all men are not serious at the point of death; Nor could this man be so, who all his life long, was serious in this, <hi>how he might cast dishonors upon God and good men:</hi> And secondly,</p>
            <p>(2) For his conscience, we heard what that was, <hi>past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling.</hi> But let this be remembred too. (1) That it is the manner of a stout and proud sinner, (such was he) so to tender his honour with men, and his <hi>name</hi> (that it may not Rot, and be left to posteritie for a curse) as to justifie himself to the death; that men may not say he died <hi>as a foole dies:</hi> Though now so they will say indeed, And so I could retort his own words he spake to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>veniunt Romani,</hi> for that, which he feared, and would have prevented, is come upon him. (2) That it is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Divell, to hold fast and full possession of a man, to the last period of his time, and render his faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, as he can himselfe, a seeming <hi>Angell of light at his Death;</hi> Such like proud sinners were <hi>Becket</hi> an Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, or rather, as this was, an Arch-Traitor; And <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> an Arch-Traitor too, against God and His King, for he was a <hi>Iesuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> (2) It is said; The man is <hi>faln now to his own Master;</hi> let the Dead alone, and his words die with him.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:125451:9"/>
               <hi>B.</hi> It were more than <hi>injustice</hi> so to do, it were <hi>impiety;</hi> To let such words die, which <hi>fret</hi> and <hi>corrupt</hi> like a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene.</hi> Besides, it is impossible; for as our <hi>doings,</hi> are as <hi>seeds</hi> cast into the ground, which <hi>dye</hi> not there, but to <hi>live</hi> again, and we must look upon them, and these look us in the face in after time: So our Actions or <hi>doings,</hi> and so our <hi>words</hi> or <hi>sayings</hi> also, these cannot <hi>dye;</hi> specially not the words of a <hi>Dying</hi> man; his Death gives them life, so as they have the quickest touch upon the Ear, and the more quickening power in the heart, because, he that now speakes, shall speak no more for ever.</p>
            <p>And this the <hi>Dying man</hi> knew very well, and, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, had prepared himself, probably more at that time to <hi>preach,</hi> after his manner, than to die. I was an eare witnesse how effectually, That dying mans Sermon, as we call it, wrought upon the hearers; who counted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Discreet men: But sure I am, in such a concourse of people, the greatest number are not so discreet: And for their sakes, as I have set down his <hi>Doings,</hi> so shall I his <hi>sayings,</hi> that the Reader, with me, may ponder them together, and may not be deceived in a matter of so high concernment, relating to an eternall condition, either of happinesse, or woe forever. I know some looked upon upon him, as the saddest object that ever they beheld. And truly, I think, my selfe was one; And some loo ked him, as an <hi>humble penitent,</hi> for no other reason, but because he said so; and so they were infinitely mistaken, as will appear by and by.</p>
            <p>These things premised, I come to his speech, which some mis-call, a sermon; Call it so if they will, a <hi>Bishops sermon,</hi> Such as I have ordinarily heard at the Court, not a word to the Text, but after the old manner turning head
