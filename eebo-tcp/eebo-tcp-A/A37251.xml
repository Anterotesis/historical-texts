            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A great DISCOVERY Of the damnable Gun-powder PLOT, At Rugland Caſtle; in <hi>Hereford ſhire.</hi> Lately found out by John Davis.</head>
            <head type="sub">The chiefe Agent in this Helliſh Plot, is the Earle of <hi>WORCESTER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne John Davis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſervant to Miſtris Lewis, who kéepeth an Inne at the ſigne of the George in Roſſe, in the County of <hi>Hereford,</hi> néere unto Rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land caſtle in Monmouth ſhire, where the Earle of Worceſter now is.</p>
            <p>This John Davis being newly come to London, chanced to be at Alderman Actons, one of the Aldermen of the city of London: and being formerly acquainted with his Coach-man, related unto him the Diſcovery of a dangerous Plot, which the Earle of Worſter hath cunningly contrived at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94570:3"/>
Which when the Coach-man had heard related, he acquainted his Maſter, the ſaid Alderman Acton there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; who cauſed him to be brought in unto him, and asking him further of it, he thought it worthy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the honourable Aſſembly in the high Court of Parliament, and therefore brought the ſaid John Davis before the houſe of Commons on Fryday laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being the 12 day of November. The ſaid John Davis being called into the houſe to relate this diſcovery, was commanded by Mr. Speaker to relate what he knew of it. Alderman Acton being alſo preſent, told him that the thing that the houſe did require of him, was to relate that to them, which before he did to him.</p>
            <p>Then he being a plaine Country-fellow, and not able ſo fully to expreſſe himſelfe: yet ſo well as hee could, ſpake to this effect.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe your honours, to give me leave to ſpeak the truth, ſo neare as I can, as I have formerly done to this Gentleman Mr. Acton: I am, and it pleaſe your honours, a poore man, the ſervant of Miſtris Lewis, ſhe kéepes an Inne at the towne of Roſſe, in <hi>Hereford ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not long ſince, there came two Gentlemen to lodge at my Miſtriſſes houſe; who when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, deſired of my Miſtris a guide to conduct them to the Earle of Worceſter at Rugland Caſtle in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth ſhire. Now my Miſtris kéeping a good Gelden or two alwayes in the ſtable: in caſe any Gueſts ſhould want upon any urgent occaſion, I knowing of the way thither very well, it pleaſed my Miſtris to appoint mée to goe with them, which I did, and returned home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine orderly, as I uſe to doe, receiving ſatisfaction for my paines. Afterwards againe there came a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble gentleman to our Inn himſelf alone, having no company at all: who having layne there all night, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired my Miſtris likewiſe to have ſome man to conduct him to the ſaid Caſtle, to the aforeſaid Earle of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter.
<pb facs="tcp:94570:3"/>
And ſhe ſent me with him alſo, as ſhe did before with the other two.</p>
            <p>So in the next morning wee ſet out, and I rode with him on the way, upon a very good Gelding of my M<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, as I uſed to doe.</p>
            <p>And when we came to the Caſtle, he alighted, and cauſed me to alight alſo: he was a very portly man for perſon; he had a Monteer on his head, with a red feather in it, and very rich in apparell, and going into the houſe he called for ſome water to waſh his hands, which was brought to him in a pewter Baſon, but he refuſed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to waſh in pewter. Then he called for a Uenice Glaſſe, which glaſſe they brought with water, holding about a quart: which glaſſe he tooke, and ſet the bottome of it in the Baſon of water; for the top hée could not, it being about a foote high, there he ſet it, and waſhed his hands in it.</p>
            <p>To what end this Ceremony was uſed, I doe not know, your Honors can better judge of it then I. Then I having conducted this gentleman hither, he paid me, and gave me ſatisfaction, and my horſe was ſet in the Earls ſtable to beat a while, to the end, that afterward I might the better returne home. I being there in the ſtable, ſaw many light Horſes, and falling in diſcourſe with the Groome of the ſtable, hee ſhewed me to the number of about thréeſcore horſes prepared for warre.</p>
            <p>And he ſéemed to me, to go about to entiſe me by many perſwaſions, and entiſements to have an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſtay there.</p>
            <p>After he had ſhewed mé all that was in that ſtable, he led me into a Uault-under the ground, which went round about the Caſtle, where was made an obſcure ſtable: in which I perceived about twelve light Horſes for it was darke I could not well ſée.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94570:4"/>
I was going further into that ſtable under ground to have ſéene the reſt of the houſe there, which was, as he reported, about forty, but it was ſo darke, that I was fearefull to goe any further, for feare of danger.</p>
            <p>In another place under ground, he ſhewed me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture for about ſixe or ſevenſcore of horſe. In which place was furniture alſo, for about two thouſand men, with great ſtore of match and powder, and other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition belonging to war, in abundance: one of theſe ſtabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s I gueſſe to be about ſixeſcore foote in length, and twenty foure foote in breadth.</p>
            <p>Then he was leading me to ſhew me the Uault that went round about the Caſtle: but I was fearfull, partly having regard to my charge, the Gelding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I rode, leſt I ſhould be coſened of him, and partly in regard I was in ſo dangerous a place: therefore I deſired to make the more haſte away.</p>
            <p>Then he returned with me to my horſe againe, and amongſt other diſcourſe, he told me that his maſter the Earle of Worceſter, gave notice privately, that any man who would be entertained, ſhould have ſixtéene pence a day, good pay from him, in caſe they would be true to him.</p>
            <p>And to preſſe me, as I conceive, to have ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſerve him: he told me that his maſter had at this time ſeven hundred men under pay. But I, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all pleaſed with this diſcourſe, haſted away to returne to my own buſineſſe at home, where I returned immediately: and now by Gods providence, am come hither to acquaint your honours with what I know.</p>
            <p>After the houſe, had heard him ſpeake, they tooke notice of it, and appointed him to come againe certaine dayes before them.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, great care is taken, to provide for his ſafety, and great charge given at his lodging, that he ſhall want for nothing.</p>
