            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

This Author then being fallen into my hands, in my voyage into the East Countrey, I caused
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10494:4"/>
the same to be interpreted vnto me by an Arabian, who<note place="margin">The Franke tongue amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the Turkes.</note> did speake Frank (as they terme it) that is to say, Italian, &amp; some time I spent, in associating my selfe so with this man, who commended greatly vnto me the eloquence &amp; grauity of this author, wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering at his digressions, &amp; entring againe into his matter so well to the purpose. It grieued me much that I had not the perfection of this language, to be a helpe vnto the riches of this History, for to deliuer it vnto my Nation with some grace: but I tooke therof as much as I could in his language, which was corrupted, as is the Frank tongue (so they terme it) which is a kind of Italian, mingled with Slauon, Greek, &amp; Spanish, tongs very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantinople, with the Arabian &amp; Turkish tongs: so as I could not gather but only the truth thereof, &amp; not the drifts &amp; grauity of the declaration, wherein the author had collected it for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, (&amp; as he said) by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Prince,<note place="margin">Tamerlan his learning.</note> who was a louer of learning, &amp; excellent in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Astrology &amp; diuinity, as the custome of those Nations is to ioine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordinarily together, studying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vertue of names, &amp; of the turning of letters, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Now then this Prince was endued with such knowledg, as made him admired of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, who are for the most part great wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derers, insomuch as this cau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed him to be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted a Prince acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with the diuine vertue, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering<note place="margin">Italian fables written of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan.</note> the iustice he vsed in all his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

thereof, as of certain kinds of Tents which he caused to be pitched, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he besieged any city; one white, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace, it yelding vnto his mercy; another red, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying cruelty to follow; and the third blacke, signifying mourning to ensue. But I find not this in our Author, &amp; I beleeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be fables, as that of Romans, for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the war are not ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled in this maner, &amp; we find that he was very courteous: onely he desired to abbase<note place="margin">Tamerlan ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friendly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the good, and furious to the bad.</note> the pride of that Turkish Emperor, called <hi>Baiazet,</hi> the thunder of heauen, &amp; would tread vpon his head, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therin the Diuinity, which pulleth down the proud &amp; raiseth vp the humble. Therfore in a word, I say, that which our Historiographers report of him, is very litle after this Author. This is the occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore that I desiring to write, in this solitarines which I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, seing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the miseries wherinto I haue often thrust my selfe with the hazard of my life, as I am bound for my king &amp; countrey; where hauing receiued many wounds, by the fauor of my king, I haue sought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the priuate life, which I had left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I might not be seene in idlenesse at such time as men of worth were busied in sacrificing their liues for preseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their countrey. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I may keepe my self fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> writing any thing of these times, for to say true, it engendreth hatred in many minds, &amp; especially the desire to be flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, &amp; they which cannot do it, are they not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to keepe silence? I must forbeare to collect that which some men of worth hauing both seene &amp; endured, doe leaue, as a monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our follies vnto posterity, which should rather in my opinion be buried, then brought to light, for they be instructions to kindle mens minds for<note place="margin">The discemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities arising from the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of ciuill warres.</note> the trouble of their countries, finding therin colours for destruction of the same. Do you not thinke that the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie of the Romaine ciuill warres, hath beene the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10494:5"/>
occasion of the ouerthrow of many common-wealths? and do not you beleeue, that of the <hi>Grecians</hi> being read by <hi>Cesar,</hi> did harme, by lyfting vp his courage, and making him hope for high matters (as those of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Silla</hi>) to set <hi>Rome</hi> on fire, and their owne Countrie in bloud, saying most truely, (and they of this age shall pardon me) that man is without loue, vnworthy of fire and water, who causeth and loueth ciuill warres. We must needs blame them in recyting those, and take from them the hope of obtayning thereby glorie of the posteritie, but much rather blame &amp; dishonor. What was the cause that parricide was not forbidden by a law written? because this were to instruct that it might be done. Our countrie is another mother, shall we recite vnto posterity the praise of the parricide, which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit against her the true mother? For this occasion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hold my peace, &amp; bury in my self as much as I may, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spiracies which they had made against their king, City, fellow-citizen, the hallowed altars, &amp; against all both diuine and humane right. I will now declare vnto you with my <hi>Arabian,</hi> who this great Prince <hi>Tamerlan</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ofspring and stocke of Tamerlan.</note> was. He was then of the bloud of the Tartarian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and his father <hi>Og</hi> had for his portion the countrey of Sachetay, wherof he was Lord.

therin most happy, although it be a disgrace amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the Tartaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be thrown to the ground in wrastling.

On the other side, the Prince determining to resist him, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled all his forces, &amp; those of his allies <hi>Tamerlans;</hi> &amp; first, he made appeare vnto his soldiers the stoutnesse of his courage; for this day he perfourmed the office both of a souldier &amp; Emperour iointly together. Now the place of fight being disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious for vs by reason of a litle hil which the Moscouits had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wheron they had placed some 6000. me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on foot, who with an infinit nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of arrowes hoped to ouercome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that went to the battaile, who were constrained to passe by that place. Now he being aduertised that the Moscouit would not come to the battail, but only meant to shew himself, &amp; after that to retire 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leagues, as they are accustomed to do: he being desirous to end this war by a battail, did adiudge,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beyond the aduise of his Counsell, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enemy wold not fight, vnlesse by assaulting this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he were vrged therunto against his wil, or els lose those 6000. men which were there placed. Then he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded<note place="margin">A Stratagem.</note> 20000. men of his army, led by <hi>Aly</hi> (Colonel of the footmen) to set vpon them. Now by this aduise he brought to passe two effects: the one whereof was, that he kept his horsmen from being iniured by the arrowes of the Moscouites; the other was to compel them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fight, in case they would not otherwise come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10494:7"/>
thereunto, the which tooke place. For as the Moscouite thought to retire and succour them, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> at that very time caused his army to passe ouer the riuer <hi>Rosna,</hi> which gaue the occasion of battaile. The Moscouite could not retire but in disorder, our Armie hauing passed ouer: nowe the Muscouite had verie great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and men well trained vp in the warres, hauing had alwaies warres with his neighbors, the king of Polonia, with whom he had then friendship, and the ayd of tenne thousand verie good horse. There were also with him many Hungarian Gentlemen, led by <hi>Vdecelaus</hi> a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian<note place="margin">The armie of the Moscouite.</note> Gentleman, who had brought with him more then eight thousand horse; the opinion was that he had in his armie fourscore thousand horse, and a hundred thousand footmen. Our Prince <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie<note place="margin">The armie of Tamerlan.</note> about six-score thousand horse, and a hundred and fiftie thousand men on foot, but not so skilful in points of warre as those of the Moscouite: for our estate had long enioyed peace, and our souldiours were indeed trained vp in the disciplin of warres, but not in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise thereof. For Prince <hi>Og</hi> loued peace and rest from his childhood, and kept himselfe with great mildnesse with all his neighbours, hauing nothing at all increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his borders, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended only for preseruing of them wisely. So these two Armies were the one before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in the meane time the mountaine was forced by the Parthians, and defended by the Moscouites, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one assisting theirs. To conclude, the fight continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two houres, the armies nothing at al medling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but yet euery one did encourage their souldiours, &amp;<note place="margin">The order of Tamerlanes battaile.</note> exhort them vnto the battaile. The order of <hi>Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanes</hi> was this; that is, he caused all his armie to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into squadrons, each consisting of sixe thousand
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10494:7"/>
horse, except his own, which was of ten thousand, so as he made eighteen squadrons, his owne being reckened which made nineteene. The Auantguard was condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>Odmar</hi> who led nine squadrons, flanked with 40. thousand men on foot, deuided both on the right and left sides, who should shoot an infinite number of arrowes. The battaile was conducted by <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who led ten squadrons, his owne being therein closed, and 50. thousand footmen, the best and choisest souldiers of his whole armie. Prince <hi>Thanais,</hi> a kinsman vnto the Prince, led the Arere-ward, with fortie thousand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and sixe squadrons: hee had some three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse aduenturers, whome they call <hi>Oliagues</hi> in their tongue, the same which we tearme the forlorne hope.</p>
            <p>The Moscouite did not obserue that order, but did fight by double ranks with Launces, and there was a space to help themselues therein, and to breake them, notwithstanding those nations doe not breake them at all, and they seemed to be a greater number then wee, making a great noise. The Auantguard of the Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites<note place="margin">The order of the Moscouits battaile.</note> was fullie twentie fiue thousand horse. The Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians and Hungarians were in the Auauntguard, the which was led by the Moscouits sonne, whom they call the Prince of Russia: the battaile consisted of 40. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse, wherein was the king of Moscouie with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his Lords, and all the forces of his Allies, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere-ward was a great squadron squared with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse; the footmen of the Moscouit were between the Battaile &amp; the Arere-ward. Then our Prince seeing<note place="margin">Tamerlan his speech vnto his souldiers, being ranged in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile array.</note> our armie passed ouer, turned himself towards his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, &amp; began in this sort to speake vnto them: It is not for riches (my companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) nor for the enlarging of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10494:8"/>
limits of my empire, that I doe fight this day with your assistance, but it is for a thing more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, seeing the same is to purchase glory &amp; honor vnto the Parthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The same whih was in old time the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the glory of the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> name, who could neuer conquer it, nor plant their Trophees therein. Let vs not then giue place vnto the glory of our auncesters, and make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest this day vnto me, the faithfulnesse that is in you, &amp; let the same be accompanied with your courage, for your king is not accustomed to retire without victory, I haue caused you to passe ouer this riuer, for the trust I haue in the force of your arms: let vs rather dy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repas it without carying a laurel garla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on our head. Whilest this passed thus, the Parthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> soldiers led by <hi>Aly</hi> had won the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain, which was not without great fight: but the victory fel on our side, which gaue great hope vnto our army of more happy successe. This made the Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits to acknowledge the fault they had made, the which was wel taken hold of by vs: so the Prince gaue the signe of battaile, marching forward all along the mountaine which his souldiers had wonne, enflamed with their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to begin the fight. And he placed 6000. fresh sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers vpon this mountain to fauor his armie. At this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant the Moscouite gaue the signe of battaile, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced<note place="margin">Battaile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Moscouite and Tamerlan.</note> forward. Then the Prince <hi>Tamerlan</hi> willed his men likewise to come forward: and sent his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof vnto <hi>Odmar,</hi> who returned answer, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moscouit did with such heat seek to come vnto the fight, he would suffer him to come vnto him, and would attend his comming resolutely in the place of battail. Now <hi>Odmar</hi> alone could by his authority bridle the boldnes of this yong Prince, who desired to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, &amp; maintain in the meane time, like an old soldier, his aduantage, which was of no smal waight for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10494:8"/>
the place being of greater aduantage for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for in assaulting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we lost the force of the fight, &amp; we had also the wind &amp; Sun in our eyes, which raised a great dust made by our horses, which kept the Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beholding the efect of their soldiers in the fight that either as they won or lost they might be succored<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So the fight was begun by the Moscouites, who strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with al the fury that was possible charged <hi>Odmar,</hi> who stifly resisted all this forcible violence, but not without the losse of many of his men, and himself thrown to the ground, al his horse also broken, was fain to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto the left wing of his footmen, where he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain mounted on horseback, whereupon reuniting his men together, whilest the Moscouite did fight with the maine battaile, conducted by the Emperour <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> he ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The fight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured 4. or 5. houres; insomuch as the heaps of men and horse were so many defences against the blowes of the arrowes shot by the Parthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> footmen &amp; by those of the Moscouites. Now the Moscouite horsmen had pierced the maine battaile, the Hungaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fighting so resolutely as the Prince remained seuered with 3000. horse only, &amp; after the Parthian maner began to fight in retiring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherupon the Moscouite thought he had won the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile; then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he being reunited vnto his Arier-ward, led by the Prince of <hi>Tanais,</hi> who had gathered together 14000. horse, and almost all the footmen, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Moscouite to retire backe, notwithstanding before that he made a strong resista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; but at the length multitude &amp; skil ouercam the force &amp; valor of the Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couites, the victorie bending to the Parthians side, the which they did pursue hotly. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was hurt on

The place of their retiring was about ten leagues from our armie, and he passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a riuer, where he reunited together his men during the night. The least losse he had was of his footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who tooke not the course of his horsmen, but rather as soon as they perceiued the victorie encline to the enemie, they retired themselues all along the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains for their better aduantage: a thing which greatlie fauoured the Moscouits. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> employed himself in giuing God<note place="margin">The tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>keful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan vnto God for his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie</note> thanks for this victorie, after he had pursued the enemy three leagues; the next day he reuiewed his armie, and found that he had lost of his side for his part betweene seuen an eight thousand horsmen, and betweene three and foure thousand footmen. The Moscouite lost some seuen and twentie thousand footmen, and between fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene and sixteene thousand horsmen. This same day was <hi>Odmar</hi> the safegard of his Prince; for it is not to be doubted, had not the hindrance bene he gaue, when the Moscouits assaulted <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> setting vpon him with all their forces together, but that they had bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ouerthrow the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour who was reunited vnto him. By the euent of this Battaile we may learne how much aduantage he hath,<note place="margin">A good aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisment for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</note> who attendeth the comming of his enemie with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute mind, in the field which he hath chosen for the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, hauing first caused the same to be well viewed by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10494:9"/>
his men, and especially by his Captaines. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the hurt that commeth in not obseruing the dust which the wind raiseth. Thirdly, that the Arier-ward well led, is the occasion of the victorie, and oftentimes the preseruation of the Prince. Fourthly, how necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it is to haue the chiefest strength of the battaile in going to assault the enemie. Now our <hi>Tamerlan</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had giuen thanks vnto God, caused a view to be made of his Armie, buried the dead, both his owne, and of his enemie, acknowledged the deserts of his sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, yeelding vnto them such houour as they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. In this battaile he lost <hi>Hally,</hi> who was slaine by the blow of an arrow, after he had forced the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, in going to the battaile, being generall of all his footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This Prince was greatly grieuedtherwith, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his bodie alwaies to be laide in his tent vntil his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto Samarcand, where he caused him to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried<note place="margin">Great honour done to Hally after his death for good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice performed by him in his life.</note> verie honourably: hee was the beginning of the greatnesse to Samercand, and of the fame of his name, by making of a stately tombe for <hi>Hally.</hi> The Prince did slacke no time after so great a victorie: for hauing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen such order as was necessarie to a great armie. (I wil not forget to declare, that when as this Prince did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold so many thousands of men lie dead on the ground where the battaile was fought, he turned himselfe vnto one of his familiars, lamenting the condicion of them who command ouer Armies, &amp; commending the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Emperour his father, he counted him happie, for that hee had sought rest, acknowledging<note place="margin">A notable say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan for making of warres.</note> humaine miserie, the which in destroying his owne kind, procured his glorie. That for his part such tokens of victory were sorrowful eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his hart.) He set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and came into the borders of the Moscouite, all

the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try being astonished, &amp; euery one flying before his army, the Moscouite had retired himselfe vpon the losse of the battaile, &amp; had likewise caused al his footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to retire, making a shewe as though he had not lost his courage, &amp; because he had reunited 30000. of his hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men together, he bragged to trie very shortly his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune againe. But for all this seeing his victorious enemy come and enter into his country, he thought he should haue to do with a mighty enemy: and hauing called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether his principal Captaines, he passed ouer the riuer called <hi>Nifort,</hi> &amp; taking their counsell, he did resolue for the preseruation of his subiectes to send vnto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, and once to make trial of his mercie, as he had already of his forces, being informed by the prisoners of the noble mind and mildnesse the which this Prince vouchsafed vnto them, he determined to send Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors<note place="margin">Embassadors from the Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couit to treat of peace with Tamerlan</note> to treat with him, and to assay for to amend that which had bene ill done. The Embassadors being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he receiued curteouslie, bewailing in a maner the fortune of their maister, rather then vaunting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting himself for the victorie: and as it were more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest then the conquered, he asked them how the Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couit did, &amp; for what cause they came vnto him. They gaue him to vnderstand, that they had in charge from their Prince to treat with him, desiring the abstinence of armes, and that they were ready to performe vnto him all things reasonable: they beseeched him moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to vse victorie as a thing which was the gift of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and might at another time change, calling vnto mind the estate of humane things, which are vnstable. Prince <hi>Tamerlan</hi> made them answer, that he had taken armes for the preseruation of his confederates and subiects, from the iniurie done vno them by the Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couite;

and this was the cause of the victorie, for that hee had iustlie enterprised the same. That hee referred the victorie vnto the God of Battailes, &amp; not vnto his own strength, or forces of his souldiers, and for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he was not therby more insolent: for it was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Parthians, retaining the same from the<note place="margin">A notable say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</note> glorie of their ancesters, that in aduersitie their coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges doe nothing at all faile them, and that prosperitie likewise doth in no sort blind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so far, that they shuld not be mindful of iustice as wel in good as bad fortune.

He also required that they should become tributaries of a hundred thousand Duckats, and should pay all the charges of the warre, amounting vnto the sum of three hundred thousand Duckats, he then would send back again all the prisoners, &amp; withdraw his armie; that for security hereof they shuld giue him pledges, which should be changed euery yeare; vnto all which they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed. So was this warre ended to his contentment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with glorie vnto the Prince his father, in whose countenance no bodie could perceiue any ioy for his sonnes prosperitie, as hee whom the care of heauen had so rauished, that hee no longer set his minde on earthly things.

more children. Hereupon he presently tooke his iorney towards him, being in the citie of Quauicay, where he was receiued with all kind of triumph and magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; there did he shew himselfe braue in all maner of gallant shewes and combats, as well in iest as in earnest. And as these nations are full of vanitie, and desirous to make shew of their strength &amp; agility, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> caried away the prize therein, whether it were in shooting neere<note place="margin">The Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans exercises.</note> with his bowe, or in changing horses in the middest of the courses, or in breaking an yron in running at the Quintaine; he made euery one wonder at his dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and was crowned the sixt day after his comming thither with the ioyfull consent of all the subiects of the<note place="margin">Tamerlan his mariage with the great Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s daughter.</note> Emperour his vnkle, and of all the Court. After that he maried the Emperours daughter, desiring first to bee crowned before the marriage, to the intent that none should think that the Crown came vnto him by means of her, but by succession, the daughters not at all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding into Empires. It was also to assure his estate, &amp; hauing remained in that place by the space of two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, he returned from thence with his wife to Samer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand, in which citie he delighted greatly to remaine, because the situation thereof was verie faire; and for<note place="margin">The situation of the city of Samercand.</note> that the citie is accompanied with a faire riuer, which causeth great trafique, and maketh it richer then any citie within that countrey.

Who made their repaire vnto him for his assistance, earnestly desiring his aid; which he would not do; making answer

A Maxime.</note> dearest thing he had in the world, which was his faith. Manie notwithstanding of the Court corrupted by the Embassadors of the king of Polonia, vsed perswasions to mooue him to fauour the Polonians, declaring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that it was a Maxime, that it behooued him not to suffer his neighbour to waxe too strong, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie of so mighty a kingdome as was Polonia; and that this was the means to make the Tartarians and Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans terrible vnto the Moscouites. That it was necessary at the beginning to oppose himselfe against such great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the which being suffered to increase, would in the end prooue hurtfull vnto vs, and then would it be verie hard to ouerthrow the same. The Prince answered, that at what time soeuer the Moscouit would not performe that which he had promised vnto him, he had sufficient means to punish him, seeing he had alreadie ouercome him with the Parthians, which was but a small prouince within Tartaria, and that at this day being increased to so great an estate as the whole Empire of the Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he had occasion to feare him the lesse; he hoped that his of-spring would also adde more Empires if it did maintaine equity; that in the meane time the Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couite should breake his forces in one enterprise, hee would likewise bring to passe his, wherein he should iustlie get honour, and augment the limits of his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion. That the peace betweene him and the Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite was notoriouslie knowne vnto all his neighbours, the breach whereof should not proceed of his part, and that it was beneficiall both for him and his subiectes:<note place="margin">Tamerlan a louer of iustice</note> that God doth punish those who vniustlie enterprise warre against their neighbours; that this hath bene the occasion of the greatnes of our house, that his ancesters

estate, seeing the king of China had much gone beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his ancient bounds. So as our Prince had this iourney in his mind, and prepared himselfe therunto, he had not otherwise refused their counsell, and the wise opinions they propounded vnto him, being alwayes obedient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reason and not to any other passion, and then especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the question was of warre, &amp; for the good of his affaires; a thing for which he was as much to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

where he abounded: but that he found fewe which did beautifie his mind with good precepts &amp; instructions, wherwith to gouerne so manie sundry people whome God had subiected vnder the obedience of his scepter. He had in his Court a Christian whom he loued much, and euerie one greatlie respected, named <hi>Axalla,</hi> a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuois by birth, brought vp from his youth about his person. This man principally did stir him vp vnto great enterprises, and notwithstanding his religion, hee tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him. Now he had all religion in reuerence, so as<note place="margin">The Author saith that this may be praised in a Pagan &amp; infidel, but not in a Christian Prince.</note> it did worship one onelie God, creator of all things. He often said, that the greatnes of Diuinitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisted in the sundry kindes of people which are vnder the coape of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who serued the same diuerslie, nourishing it self with diuersitie, as the nature was diuers where it had printed his image, God remaining notwithstanding one in his essence, not receiuing therin any diuersitie. This was the reason that mooued him to permit and graunt the vse of all religions within the Countries of his obedience, alwayes prouided (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that they worshipped one onely God, detesting the idolatrous and strange goddes, in so much as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not the diuersitie in religion, if they were able to serue him; so as this Christian attained vnto great honors and dignities neere vnto him, as hereafter you shall heare.</p>
            <p>Now to returne from my digression: Our Prince was desirous of warres, knowing that he could verie hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintaine his owne estate and so manie seruantes, whose fingers would tickle if they were not employed in making of warres. So he determined to make warre with the king of China (who is called the Lord of the world, &amp; child of the sun) which was no smal enterprise.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10494:13"/>
But before he would begin the same, he sent vnto the<note place="margin">Embassadors vnto the king of China from Tamerlan.</note> said king of China, for to demand right for some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries (which they cal Hordas) abiding places, &amp; townes, or rather countries fit for the feeding of cattell, the which this Prince of China had vsurped long before, and euen the passages of a riuer called Tachij, which is beyond his limits, which are walles (the which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<note place="margin">A wall builded by the king of China to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from the roades of the Tartarians.</note> the kingdomes of the great <hi>Cham</hi> and of our <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi>) builded of purpose by this king of China to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him from the roades of the Tartarians and forces of our Prince, so as this was begunne with the aduise of the great <hi>Cham,</hi> and for his benefite as well as for the Princes. Therefore to accomplish his enterprise, in the meane time that he attended for the returne of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, he caused his forces to come forwards from all parts, appointing vnto them for the place of mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his owne at the Horda of Baschir, where all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie assembled: and other ayding troopes of the great <hi>Cham</hi> in the deserts of Ergimul at a certaine day, in which place he should ioyne with all his armie.

Before his departure he went to take leaue of his father, who endued with a singular<note place="margin">A kind parting betwene the father and the sonne.</note> &amp; fatherly affection, said he should neuer see him again, and that he hastened vnto his last rest, and hauing made solemne praiers ouer the Prince his sonne for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie, kissing him a thousand times, drew off his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall ring, and gaue it vnto him, not asking whither his iourney tended: and calling <hi>Odmar,</hi> he bad him fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding his faithfulnes vnto his son.

notwithstanding some report that vpon pollicie hee suffered this warre to be moued, wheras he might haue remedied the same, making it as a meanes to win the hearts of his new subiects, who liked well of him alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and also to make himselfe to be feared of those that heaped vp conspiracies against his promoting vnto the new Empire.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his delay it was by sundry diuersly interpreted; some said that he had bene aduertised of some vproare to be attempted, when he should be farre seuered from thence, and had passed ouer the mountains of Pasanfu, and that <hi>Calix</hi> staied vpon nothing else, in so much as the companies of the great <hi>Cham</hi> were gone forwards, euen beyond the mountaines, hauing passed the riuer of Meau, and were encamped at <hi>Bouprou,</hi> the which <hi>Calix</hi> vnderstanding, thought he shold haue the means to worke his enterprise.

forces farre separated from him, that they should soone attaine vnto that they desired: that his enterprise here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was so assured; that so soone as his armie wes assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, he would shew himselfe before Catay, he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that presently there wold be a change in his fauor; that his father had commaunded there; that it is long since he knew the affection of this people, which incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto him; that they had not as yet seene their newe Prince; that they would easily beleeue whatsoeuer he declared vnto them; that the <hi>Zachetay</hi> was farre seuered from them; that they had to do with a great enemie, to whom also he had sent Embassadors to aduertise him of his practise; that he was assured his enterprise would haue happie successe; that they would foorthwith dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch a messenger vnto the great <hi>Cham</hi> their Prince, to<note place="margin">An old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</note> assure him that they bent not their forces against him, but were his faithfull and obedient subiects: but they armed themselues, because they would not be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Parthians their auncient enemies (for these Nations hate one another how neere neighbours so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be, as doth the Spaniard and the Portugall, the English men and the Scot) that they knew this Prince, in respect of his great age, hauing no posteritie was desirous of quiet rest, and desired nothing more then to end his dayes in peace, they would permit him so to do without altering any thing in the same; that they hope the Parthians are so badly entertained by the king of China, that in stead of setting vpon them they shall thinke themselues happie if they may be suffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy peace; that they will march forward towards them at the straites of Tenduict, to hinder their returne. The propositions of <hi>Calix</hi> were great and well practised: for it was a yeare since he had won the peoples good will,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10494:16"/>
and he heaped together whatsoeuer was necessarie for his insurrection: but this was done secretly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing diuerse had giuen aduertisement thereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prince <hi>Tamerlan:</hi> but he despised that practise, or at the least made a shewe so to doe.

And I haue often heard him say, that if it had not beene for feare of offending the great <hi>Cham</hi> his vncle, he had helped the same at the very beginning, without suffering the same to be set on foote: this was the cause that this Prince made so long abode. The Tartarians which were brought vnto him by <hi>Calibes,</hi> were vexed for hauing receiued newes of the preparations made by the king of China; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned that oportunitie and season passed away, so desirous were they to manifest vnto their new Prince their courages, and this was their dayly talke: but some matter of importance happened, and a great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration was found in the Princes disposition, who was forward and diligent for executing of that speedily which he had with ripe deliberation resolued of. The which maketh mee beleeue that he had very good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertisement, and that he waited the oportunitie. Now he gaue order for matters behind him, to the end that no newes might be spread of his armie: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they should thinke that hee had passed the mountaine, and had vppon his necke the armie of the king of China, which was betweene the mountaines &amp; him: thus <hi>Calix</hi> thought greatly to trouble him, when
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10494:16"/>
he rose in armes against him, and did thinke that he had already assaulted the wall which the king of China had made against the Tartarians. But <hi>Calix</hi> was thrust for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rather with a desire of ruling, then beginning the same with any wisedome, making too great hast: &amp; as his enterprise was craftily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted, so was it cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discouered, and all fit remedies prepared therefore whensoeuer the same should happen. As soone then as the Prince was aduertised of the pretences of <hi>Calix</hi> thus discouered, he marched one dayes iourney forward, to the end he might approch vnto <hi>Calibes,</hi> and impart the same vnto him, &amp; assembling all his followers &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell together, he discoursed vnto them in this manner:<note place="margin">Tamerlan his Oration vnto his souldiers vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracie of Calix.</note> I nothing doubt but that all of you wil aduise me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist from this enterprise, considering the armies which be raised vp within the hart of that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, where you all desire I should raigne, &amp; where with the full consent of all the chiefest seruants of the Emperour my Lord &amp; vncle I haue bene receiued: and ought not I then helpe him to punish the rashnes of <hi>Calix,</hi> who alone hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to obey me, &amp; allow of my promotion vnto the Empire of the Tartarians? But it behooueth vs also to make prouision against this enemy which we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, who seemeth to be rather a defender then an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulter, according to the aduertisements we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his preparations. We must also thinke that <hi>Calix</hi> hath not atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted this without hope of being supported by the king of China, against whom he did see that wee did arme our selues, for to require iustly that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth vnto vs. There is good cause therfore we foresee how to hinder him from entring into our kingdome, whilst I shalbe busied in reducing this bold fellow vnto his dutie. We must therefore strengthen our borders,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10494:17"/>
and leaue all my munition and prouision of victuall in this place, the armie which wee shall leaue here will spend them, we will carrie backe with vs all our artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and engins vnto a safe place, we will leaue vpon the borders fiue and twentie thousand Parthian horse, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thousand of those sent by the Emperour my Lord and Vncle, and a hundred thousand footmen vnder the charge of <hi>Calibes,</hi> of whose faithfulnesse I am most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I will likewise aduertise <hi>Samay</hi> to set forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me with fiftie thousand horse as soone as he can, and my self with all diligence, will march forwards with the rest of my armie towards this bold fellow, &amp; when I shall be aduanced, I will attend the counsell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemen of the Emperour. His discourse was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, although <hi>Calibes</hi> was desirous to accompany him, notwithstanding he thought obedience was better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sacrifice. They which had not vnderstood of the doings of <hi>Calix,</hi> thinking this a matter of great importance, there was in the Counsell contrarie opinions; the one saying it was necessarie to assure matters at home, the other party, that it was a great enterprise to seeke to make head with an armie against the king of China, &amp; in the meane while to haue so daungerous a Cancer within his realme, as was the reuolting of the people: but these men entred not into the most secret counsell of the Prince, who had long since foreseene the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Calix,</hi> hauing a great armie most readie to ioyne with him vpon the first commaundement sent vnto the same: neither did they any thing at all perceiue, that the Prince <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> how much disquieted soeuer he made shew to be, was very glad to haue occasion ministred to enter with armes into the state by him newly obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, so as the same might seeme iust in the eyes of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10494:17"/>
Emperour his vncle. For by this meanes he should take possession of his gift, obtaine the good will of his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and be well assured to punish this fellow so tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly,<note place="margin">The wise fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan.</note> as others which might peraduenture be tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the same humor would take therby example, &amp; therefore wisely had he separated the forces of the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians. For what face soeuer <hi>Calibes</hi> set on the matter, he harkened what wold become of <hi>Calix,</hi> that he might likewise make some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion: there was left with him to command ouer the Parthians the Prince of Thanais, without whom he could not doe any thing, for that he led the auantgard. Thus was the army deuided in two parts; the king of China remaining long before he was aduertised of all this, and thought he had all the forces both of the Tartarians &amp; Parthians vpon his armes, so as this was of no small importance to fauor our affaires:<note place="margin">Good directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan.</note> for <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had especially giuen commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the passages which are easily gotten, might as diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be kept, to the end that the king of China should not be aduertised of the tumult.

And surely it was high time for <hi>Tamerlan</hi> to march forward, or else all had beene reuolted, so leauing his footemen he made great iourneyes. Now during the time that hee had bene aduertised, and made his abode to consult, which was the space of two monethes: <hi>Calix</hi> hauing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented himselfe with a hundred thousand fighting men before Cambalu, a very great citie, and chiefe of the Prouince of Catayo, the inhabitants thereof came out to meete him, and did also receiue him with all the ioy

Euen as it is often seene, that when a Schoole-master entreth on a sudden into the schoole, with a rod in his hand, when as the schollers are in disorder, busied in beating one another, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the charge giuen them by the Schoolmaster: in such and the same manner did <hi>Tamerlan</hi> come vnto the Tartarians whom <hi>Calix</hi> raised vp, being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Camba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu whither all the Prouinces came to gratifie him.

They knew him to be of the bloud of so many Emperors, and that he had ruled ouer them with such great iustice, they had therefore their consciences which did accuse them as guiltie, and did see the hand alreadie lifted vp to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their offences.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10494:19"/>
repent, he thought best to withdrawe himselfe out of Cambalu, determining to oppose himselfe against <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan,</hi> and sent for his power from all places, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all vppon the euent and hazard of a battell. Hee had also receiued aduertisement of the small content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Emperour conceiued of his proceedings, and how he had sent for all his forces to march thither, that from thence they might goe and ioyne with his Nephew <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> and how he falling againe into the<note place="margin">The great Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sent his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall ring vnto Tamerlan.</note> extremitie of his sicknesse, had sent his imperiall ring vnto <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> had giuen commaundement that he should be obeyed euen as his owne person, both during his life, and after his death; and therefore knew well, that he must of necessitie aduenture all, seeing <hi>Tamerlan</hi> came towardes him. So hee drewe out of Cambalu full fiftie thousand men, as well Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses, as souldiers which were there in Garrison, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing wonne all the Captaines which the olde Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had placed there in Garrison, amounting to the number of thirtie thousand men, and him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded ouer them, who had consented vnto the reuolt of this great Citie. To make it short, hauing assembled all his forces, he had fourescore thousand horse, and a hundred thousand footemen, the which he had gathered together from all partes. I knowe that the sedition of <hi>Calix</hi> was such, and in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner plotted, that he did euen prouoke the Moscouites, that at the verie same time they might inuade Zache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tay.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10494:19"/>
remembring him many times of this good turne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: for it is very credible, that if the Moscouite had at the very same time entred Zachetay, he had hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the forces of this Prouince, in such sort as it should not haue beene able at all to giue aide vnto the affaires<note place="margin">A good aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement for men in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> of <hi>Cambalu.</hi> Behold how they which guide the sterne of the common-wealthes-barke should in time giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie vnto the discontentments of the mightie. For when they haue attained vnto authoritie, they doe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily trouble all things, hauing therein alwaies very sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious minds, so as they are very willing to shuffle the cardes with them: and therefore such vproares are not to be neglected, but remedied speedily. Our army then marched with all dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in such sort as certain scouts which were two thousand horse, had newes of the army of <hi>Calix,</hi> the which came forwardes directly towardes vs, whereof they caused the Emperour to be certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied speedily, who sent thither two thousand horses more, to the end they should keepe the passage of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer called Brore, by the which our victuals were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed vnto the armie, and also for to win alwaies time, the Prince knowing right well that the motions of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill wars be furious at the beginning, and that it is the best to resist them slowly, drawing them alwaies out at length if it be possible. For the people in the end ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging their faults, their meanes and money fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, and oftentimes victuals also: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie side in a royall army none of all this doth happen, where all things are fauourable, and the souldiers well disciplined, obedience &amp; order being wisely obserued. Then had the Emperour the guiding of his owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, for he had receiued commaundement from the Emperour his vncle, to hazard therin all for all, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10494:20"/>
vp into his hands the safegard of his life and estate, that he might thereby end his dayes in peace, willing him likewise, to punish this arrogant fellowe and his partakers. By this meanes came forces from all parts vnto <hi>Tamerlan;</hi> but on the contrarie part, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies armie was then in his chiefest force, and beganne to feele the want of victuals, by reason of a desert and certaine mountains which it had passed, where there was a Lorde subiect vnto the great <hi>Cham,</hi> who after he had promised him helpe for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting of victuals from Cambalu vnto his armie, as soone as he perceiued him to be farre off, changed his minde, and beganne to withdraw himselfe from his side, and to make warre vppon him: setting vpon his men, hauing gathered souldiers together, which was a great discommoditie vnto him for his armie, in<note place="margin">The procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the two armies.</note> such sort as he must of necessity come vnto a day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell. But <hi>Tamerlan</hi> hauing aduertisement of all his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, found the means to passe ouer foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse to ioyne with <hi>Cangi</hi> (for so was this Lord na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) to giue order thereby for cutting off the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which came from Cambalu: &amp; (as I haue said) the Emperor hauing caused the foords of Brior to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully searched, and occupying all the passages with his armie, he possessed twelue or fourteene leagues of rich ground and good, hauing behind him the salt lake, and before him the riuer of Ostan. And there did he watch aduantage, staying the comming of his enemies, with whom they thought to fight, at the very instant they should arriue; but they were therein deceiued, for they were kept occupied with roades and skirmishes, and the maine battell came not to the fight: so as it was two moones (or rather two monethes) before we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10494:20"/>
aduaunced towards them, in so much as necessitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained them to retire towardes Cambalu. The Prince thereof aduertised, passed ouer the riuer with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which was found to be a hundred and fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse, and two hundred thousand footmen, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ioyne battell, fearing least <hi>Calix</hi> would returne and winter at Cambalu, and should be driuen to fight within the same, where not doubting of the victorie, he feared yet least so great and rich a citie as that, being sacked, would bring vnto him two great discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The first would be, the losse of the citie; the other, hee feared that taking such a citie by force, his armie should be consumed in the spoyle thereof, &amp; vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed: or that his old souldiers made too rich, would no longer follow him. After he had called his principall Captains together, who were much vexed because they fought not, in the end resolued therupon, very sory that there was no remedy but that the possession of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire must be bloudie. Now he had warned <hi>Calix</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, and lay downe his armes, and he would pardon him, but this rash fellow (whose courage was not yet to be despised) made no accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al that: for purposing to commaund, hee could not resolue to obey, which did inuite him vnto a short life with happinesse, rather then vnto a long life honorlesse, euen as they which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake such follies must needes resolue. For it is very hard that the Prince his Lord shold assure himself ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as he doth liue, so ticklish is this desire of raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion. So our army went vnto Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and made seuen leagues; the enemie hauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our passage, turned his face, and they say that<note place="margin">The speech of Calix vnto his companions.</note> 
               <hi>Calix</hi> turned himselfe vnto three or foure of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, lifting his hands vnto heauen and said vnto
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10494:21"/>
them that neuer in his life had he receiued more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table newes. The Parthians (said he) haue at this very instant passed ouer the riuer, and come towards vs, and if <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who bargained so much, will fight at this present, I cannot receiue a greater good turne. For (said he) whatsoeuer shall become of me, it cannot but bring vnto me an immortall glorie; for if I conquer him, who is he in Asia that may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared vnto me? the Empires of the Tartarians &amp; of Sachetay shalbe mine: for I fight against the forces of these two great estates, the which I haue separated thorough my practises: my power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of these two peoples: if I be ouercome, my glorie shall be very great, in that I durst, and vnto this present time we haue gotten this glorie, that the valour &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Sachetay</hi> was two moneths shut vp betwene the riuers of Brior and Ostan for the terror of our armes: therefore the victory which he shall gaine of vs, shalbe vnto vs alwaies glorious. Thus discoursing I haue heard (sayd he) did shew a great stoutnesse of courage. He aduaunced his armie forward, so as the auantcourers of the two armies encountred ech other, and our men were driuen euen into our Camp, a thing which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly displeased <hi>Odmar,</hi> who was in the auauntguard, for the Emperor was very sory that he had not made them stronger when they came neere vnto the enemie, but the excuse was, that they did not imagin the rashnesse of <hi>Calix</hi> to be so great as to set forwards three leagues. The next day was spent in discoursing of battailes, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one for his part, and to exhort the Captaines &amp; soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to deuide the gouernementes vnto Captaines, with the rankes and ordinances. <hi>Calix</hi> was of the age of forty, he was a Captain renowned with the great <hi>Cham,</hi> he was one of the chiefest in dignitie and place, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10494:21"/>
they had alwayes respected him within Tartarie as a person most worthy of the Empire, if the glorie of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan</hi> and his reputation had not so far excelled. The Armies began to be viewed the one of the other about eight of the clocke in the morning, where there were very many skirmishes before they came vnto the main battaile (according to the fights of these nations) it was a great plaine wherein they met at that time, with like aduantage on either part; <hi>Odmar</hi> led the Auauntguard<note place="margin">The order of Tamerlans army ranged against Calix.</note> (as I haue already said) wherin there was forty thousand horse, &amp; three-score thousand footmen; he made three squadrons, wherof he set forward one before him that began the battaile. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> marched in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but his squadrons were much stronger, the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men both of the Auauntgard and of the Battaile were on the right and left wings. <hi>Tamerlan</hi> had drawne out sixe thousand Parthian horse and two thousand Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian for the Arier-ward, &amp; had committed the charge therof vnto a faithful seruant of his called <hi>Axalla</hi> (a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuois borne) who had great credit with him, because he had bene brought vp with him in his youth, and had good triall of his faithfulnesse, valour, and industrie; hauing giuen him in charge not to fight at all but vpon the extremitie; and also to gather together all that should be scattered from the Armie. <hi>Axalla</hi> was a man of great iudgment, his vnderstanding being good and quicke, and a Captaine in great estimation amongst the soldiers, although he worshipped God in another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then we did, and was also a Christian.

You might haue seen in an insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst these great companies thus opened, some fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, some flie, some kill, taking of horses, and men tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling<note place="margin">The battaile between Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan and Calix within the countrie of Cataio.</note> ouer and ouer; they held the victorie sure on our side, when as, behold, a maine force did come vpon vs, conducted by <hi>Calix,</hi> who had gathered them together, and they were between fifteene and sixteene thousand horse, which came &amp; set vpon the Princes maine bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile on the flank, and pierced the same, and ouerthrew them in a maner all.

The Prince was not long in mounting againe on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, looking continually on his Arier-guard, which had not the meanes to ioine with him; and earnestly viewing the countenance of the same. Nowe our footmen at such time as hee went to giue the charge, was open, and after shut againe, and had not bene as yet set vpon by anie, they had bene onely breathed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the charges which had bene giuen; <hi>Axalla</hi> ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with it his troupes reserued for the Arier-ward. During this space <hi>Calix</hi> did hotlie pursue the troupe of<note place="margin">Calix enioyed the victory one houre.</note> 
               <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> who retired, skirmishing continually with his souldiers, being almost all Parthians. The enemies maine battaile did greatly diminish, for his souldiers went a spoyling here and there within the campe of the Battaile, and they could not discerne by reason of the great dust, the Arier-ward which followed in good order after, killing and ouerthrowing all that vvere opposed against them. When as (behold) at the same instant there came a crie euen vnto <hi>Calix,</hi> with Turne, turne: there being a thousand or twelue hundred horse which <hi>Axalla</hi> had seuered from the rest, who hauing already aduanced themselues brauely, were come to handigripes with <hi>Calix,</hi> hauing receiued commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to mingle amongst them, for to redeeme the Princes maine Battaile, which was pursued by them. Then did <hi>Calix</hi> in returning perceiue, that both his Empire and glorie, together with the good fortune which he one houre had fully inioyed, were for euer vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost, &amp; then began he to repent himselfe of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: &amp; after he had commanded a charge to be giuen for the repelling of the auant-currers, hee staid, vniting his men, for he had as yet 11000. horse: but he could not descrie whether those which were with <hi>Axalla</hi> shold be

On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side he did perceiue that at the same instant he left pursuing the Emperours maine battaile, in that very time it had gotten a loofe off, ioyning together such of the men as had bene scattred from the same; attending the successe of this charge, that hee might beginne his fight againe, notwithstanding he being bold and braue had his recourse vnto extremitie by his armes, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing in his face but boldnesse, he exhorted his men to fight valiantly with him, and pursue the good<note place="margin">Calix exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto his men.</note> fortune which the great God had put into his handes this day: that these were scattered men which sought to ioyne with their fellowes, and it was necessary to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from that. In this meane time his Army did stronglie ioyne itselfe together, the which <hi>Axalla</hi> well considering, thought that the good fortune of two great Emperours was this day in his power, and vnder his conduct, and that his life or death could not but prooue most glorious, being for the safetie of his good master, who had put in him so great confidence; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged his souldiers valiantlie, commanding the first charge to be giuen, and brauely assisting his men, hee charged so strongly, that he passed cleane through the squadron of <hi>Calix,</hi> who was hurt in his mouth with the blow of a Lance, after had performed the dutie both of a souldier and Captaine.

It cost our Emperour<note place="margin">Fifty thousand men slaine in the battail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betweene Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan &amp; Calix.</note> deare, who said that he neuer fought with greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ouercome. He honoured greatly <hi>Axalla</hi> for his good endeuour and wise conduct, who brought vnto him <hi>Calix</hi> sore hurt in the mouth with the blow of a Lance, and another blow of an arrow in the body. He spake vnto him, but the other being fierce and bold, answered him nothing at all, making a signe that his mouth did hinder him; he was kept vntill the next day,<note place="margin">Calix behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> and was iudged by all the Counsell worthie of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: whereupon he caused his head to be smitten off, the which he sent to be presented vnto the inhabitants of Cambalu: he caused the like to be done vnto all the chiefe leaders, not for crueltie, but for necessitie, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very wel, that the means to cut off the foot of ciuil warres, is to punish the heades of the same, for they be <hi>Hydras</hi> which grow vp but too fast. After this the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie<note place="margin">A description of Cataio.</note> marched into the kingdome of <hi>Cataio,</hi> a countrie rich in grasse, and in all kinds of pastures, abounding with great quantitie of beasts, and people which knew not what warre meant. The Prince gaue commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that these people should not be accounted as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but his good subiects, that he would vse all the cities well, as Cangi, Sochgi, Gonzae, Tagni, Togara, Congu, which had reuolted, and were come to sue for pardon at his handes, in humbling themselues before him; the which he granted vnto them, enioyning them only to prouide sufficient victuals for his armie: and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to be so ill aduised as to harken vnto those, who for their particular ambition would withdraw them from the obedience due vnto their true and naturall Prince and Emperour. Now this mercifulnesse was presentlie spread abroad, which was of no small importance for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10494:24"/>
the appeasing of others who had put all their hope in extremitie, which is in losing their owne liues to make others doe the like: &amp; especially the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balu had taken this resolution: but being informed of the Emperours clemency, changed their opinions; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding some of them which were the most sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, who thought they should run the same fortune with their leaders, were in despaire, doing as much as in them lay, to draw with them the destruction of their citie, the which this mildnesse had appeased, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into hope of the Princes clemency. In the meane while our army daily aproched, and at such time as we came neerest, the more did the feare of all the citie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, in somuch as the Prince was aduertised daylie from those which fauoured his side, of all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the citie, and he was assured that euerie one deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to obey the Conquerour, and to do whatsoeuer he commanded. The which being knowne vnto the Prince, he left all his armie at Gonsa, and himself went directly vnto the citie of Cambalu, where all thinges<note place="margin">The ordinary garrison at Cambalu of 30000. souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> were made quiet, by the means of thirtie thousand sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, being the ordinarie garrison, whom he caused to enter therinto before him, and two houres after entred into the same himself, being receiued with great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, not yeelding as yet to pronounce the word of pardon, referring all vnto the Emperour, and to the ordinarie course of iustice. Willingly saying that hee pardoned the common people; shewing himself sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times openly gentle and curteous, honoring them greatly amongst others of the citie, which had taken his part. Now he stayed for the returne of one of his fauorites, whom he had sent vnto the Emperour, to carrie him newes of the victorie, and of the death of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10494:24"/>
               <hi>Calix,</hi> and that the chiefe of this faction remained pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners with him; also to know what iustice the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would appoint to be inflicted on those Citizens which were the first beginners of the reuolt of this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for the Prince being desirous to be esteemed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and to win loue within this great citie, would not execute iustice of himselfe, nor in his owne name, but by the Emperor his vnkle, whom he did gratifie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, leauing the authority wholly vnto himselfe, and by this meanes he was not not esteemed cruell. Thus the Prince after he had remayned here eight dayes, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He was not many dayes iourney from the citie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he receiued tydings how the great <hi>Cham</hi> his vnkle willed that iustice should be executed on them which were the first moouers of this reuolt; the which was executed accordinglie in the name of the Emperour, and by his speciall ministers; in such sort, that as the people accused the cruelty of the Emperor, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the mercie of <hi>Tamerlan.</hi> Nowe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was better in health then he had bene, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie desired to see the Prince, who referred the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this, whether he should goe vnto him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee came vnto his Armie, desirous to heare newes thereof, remaining vpon the frontiers of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. In this sort went hee away, separating himselfe as much as hee could from the execution which was in doing at Cambalu, where some two hundred Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses<note place="margin">A terrible exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note> were put to death, for an example vnto the rest, their heades being set vp in the middest of the market place, in signe of a terror vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after rebell against their Prince. Thus was this vvarre brought vnto an end, to the great honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Tamerlan.</hi> And it is also reported for most
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10494:25"/>
certain, that if he had not stopped the way of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, he had vtterly lost this estate, the conspiracie being in a maner generall: but the diligence he vsed in opposing himself against it, caused many to lose their courages. Therefore in such reuoltes it is a speciall point, for a Prince to shewe himselfe, to enter into the field, and passe through his Prouinces, to encourage his owne, and giue terrour vnto others.

You see howe wisely our Prince made vse hereof, for it is not to bee doubted, but he had discouered the conspiracie long afore the execution of the same. This was the occasion that he kept his forces in readinesse within the country of Sachetay, and marched himself forward to minister occasion vnto others, to discouer vnto him their euil

Therefore is it necessarie, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be (though halfe) on horsebacke, as soone as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie shall be discouered to haue a stirring humour and to trouble good order. This must be done, for wordes doe nothing at all satisfie them: you must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie come vnto blowes, for they be ordinarilie rash fellowes, whose eyes ambition blindeth, or else if they be wise (who see great likelihood at such time as they enterprise it) their attempts haue often good successe, when they haue to doe with negligent and carelesse Princes, or effeminate, or of small courage, who giue themselues too much vnto delicacies, and spend their time in pleasure, whereas they ought to haue a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eie to looke to the preseruation of all within their kingdome, &amp; their hand ready to repulse iniuries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from without. You see how well our Prince vseth his mildnesse, care, and watchfulnesse: before this hee was but halfe Emperour of the Tartarians, but hereby assured himself therof with good dexteritie, &amp; die the Emperour neuer so soone, there is no shew that there can happen anie moment of trouble: for he is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced<note place="margin">Tamerlan his mildnesse won the loue and reuerence of all</note> for his great mildnesse and clemencie, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding of the good, &amp; bearing somtimes with a fault (if there be any) and for hauing moreouer a stiffe hand to punish the wicked and sedicious. Nowe to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto our discourse: as soone as our Prince was returned vnto his Army where he found <hi>Odmar,</hi> who
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10494:26"/>
there attended his comming, the which caused all the Armie to march forward and meet him, where hee was receiued of his souldiers, and with a loud voice called by all his Captaines and souldiers; Most great<note place="margin">Tamerlan welcommed vnto his army, with new and strange accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</note> Emperour and most victorious, as they are accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to doe amongst the Tartarians. The Prince af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had long discoursed with his Captaines both of the beauty and greatnesse of the citie of Cambalu, hee arriued at his tent, where after hee had declared vnto <hi>Odmar</hi> in what sort all things had passed at Cambalu: he asked his aduise whether hee should goe and visite the Emperour his vnkle. <hi>Odmar</hi> who well perceiued that the Prince desired it, and called vnto his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the honor which he had receiued when he was at Quinzai, and that he would haue bene very willing to spend the winter with the Empresse, staying for the spring for to returne vnto the enterprise of China. But <hi>Odmar</hi> which was no flatterer, and who was a great Counseller of estate, and faithfull vnto our Emperour <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> spake vnto him in this manner: Inuincible<note place="margin">Odmar his wise speech as answer vnto Tamerlan his question tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

On the other side, doe you nothing consider, that you haue enterprised this warre to augment the glorie of him who hath chosen and called you? Know
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10494:26"/>
you not, that the king of China holdeth a great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie which hee hath giuen you? It behooueth that you manifest vnto him the affection of your seruice. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der also that your glorie and greatnesse will bee more acceptable vnto him farre off then neere at hand. For being farre off, it shineth vnto him for the fauoring of his affaires, but neere, it maketh his owne obscure. Do you not consider the suspitions hee may conceiue of your greatnesse? the repentings which often come to them which haue made men great, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire afterwards to ouerthrowe: for Princes be variable? What glorie can you obtaine by this iourneying? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie constraineth you not thereunto, but your repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will be whollie diminished thereby, and the way of your glorie is altogether contrarie vnto the same. It is better for you to winter gloriously vnder your tentes in the middest of your men of armes then within the statelie pallaces of Quinzai, in the middest of the sweetnesse of an effeminate Court. They which would finde fault with you will demaund the cause wherefore you left your Armie; they will say that you threaten the king of China a farre off: it is to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red also least hee should oppresse your men, from whence will you returne to resist the same, while you bring together againe your men of Armes? The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians would as your selfe returne vnto Sachetay, and the Tartarians vnto their Horda, but if you march forward, you shall prepare vnto your selfe an assured victorie of the king of China, and if you doe deferre it, it shall prooue dangerous vnto you, whereas it is now most assured, in as much as he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth your Armie busied within your owne country,

your forces empaired, the faith of your peopled chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and all your Empire reuolted. He seeth your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie led by <hi>Calibes</hi> to temporize, and being but as it were to defend it selfe, and not to assault any other, he supposeth that all your determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are ouerthrown. Some may thus say vnto him (as some haue suspected, and it is not without reason, but I will not affirme it, being vnwilling to enter any further into your wise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, the which God onely knoweth, who guideth you) that you haue rather left <hi>Calibes</hi> there the chiefe of the Tartarians, to deliuer your selfe from the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you had of him, then for any further desire you had to accomplish your enterprise.

If I haue offended your Maiesty with my bold speech, do with me what it shal please you, I am your slaue, lo here my head. The Prince <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was very sad, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his countenance continuallie, when as <hi>Odmar</hi>
               <note place="margin">The great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of the Tartarians vnto their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> spake once againe vnto him, kissing the hem of his garment in all humilitie, as wee are accustomed vnto our Emperours in signe of subiection and bondage. Then the Emperour answered him, that he had euer<note place="margin">The notable answer of the Emperor vnto Odmar.</note> knowne his fidelitie and loue, and that the cause of his sadnesse was, for that he did not find in himselfe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to recompence the same: and that hee aknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged now in earnest the wisdome of the Emperour his father, in making choise of so worthy a Counseller to assist him, and that hee certainly learned to know, that the greatest seruitude which Princes haue vvith God, was that there was no end of their glorie, seeing their continual doing was their rest, as in the Diuinity; and that when he thought to giue himselfe some ease,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10494:27"/>
then was the time he must in steed of the delicacies and pleasures of Quinzay, make the desertes of Cipri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the resting place from the trauailes of his newe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie: that it was ended, and his purposes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: I haue also heard the Prince say, that <hi>Odmar</hi> did not speake vnto him like an earthly but diuine man, &amp; that he verilie beleeued that God by his meanes did call him backe from some mishap which would haue light vpon him, to make his glorie increase the more. Now the rumour was already spread ouer all, that the Princes determination was to go and visite the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour his vnkle, the which tickled euery man with desire to returne into his countrie, hoping to inioy the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his natiue soyle. When as commandement was giuen for a generall reuiew of the whole armie: where the Emperor spake vnto his soldiers in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: We haue begun (my faithfull souldiers) an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise<note place="margin">Tamerlan his oration vnto his soldiers vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward against the king of China.</note> to go and assault the king of China, who hath of late repulsed euen beyond the mountaines the Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian name; but we were hindered to our great griefe by the foolish rashnesse of <hi>Calix,</hi> and were driuen to turne the bridle for to punish him, wherein you haue all assisted me. It grieueth me that I cannot as well brag of the fresh spoyles of a stranger, as I may vaunt (by the meanes of your weapons) of those our vnfaithfull Citizens; and in times past with your owne selues making triall of my first Armes against the boldnesse of the fierce Moscouite, although for this last ciuill victorie I am further indebted vnto you, for your greater endeuour, and the hazarding of your persons being much greater, so were they our owne people, who would not acknowledge vs, whereof I cannot speake without shedding of teares, desiring
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10494:28"/>
rather to burie such a victorie, what glorie and honour soeuer we haue gotton thereby. Neither do I recount these thinges vnto you, but for to manifest that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not your faithfulnesse, and the great trauaile you haue endured with me. We must not therfore be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but must turne our weapons against those which thinke that we ate greatly troubled, whereas wee are victorious. We haue left our companions, who haue temporized to heare the euent and successe of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, all our munitions be there; wee must in that place (my souldiers and friendly followers) passe ouer the rest of winter; our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions look for vs. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is secure and looketh not for vs at this season of the yeare: for he perceiueth that our Armie which is there is not sufficient for offence, but only for defence. You shall receiue double pay, the better to furnish you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the iniurie of cold: and as we shall be cloathed with double garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, I hope we shal be also apparelled with double glorie. Let vs march on merrily, I my self will go with you, and be companion of your glorie. After he had thus spoken vnto his souldiers, they all cried; One God in heauen, and one Emperour on the<note place="margin">The crie of the souldiers vpon the Emperours oration.</note> earth: and bowing downe al their heads in token of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, they shewed how agreeable they were to obey that which he commanded. Thus euerie one returned into his tent, where they abode yet eight dayes more. The Prince sent back again <hi>Zamai</hi> vnto Sachetay with some fiue and twenty thousand horse and fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand footmen, for the saftie of his estate in those parts. Thus after prayers were sayd, all the Armie being assembled together in the presence of the Prince (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custome of our Emperours) our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie began to march forward. He forgat not likewise
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10494:28"/>
to dispatch one vnto the Emperour his vnkle, to giue him vnderstanding of all this resolution, the which he verie well liked of. The Prince by the same messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger did beseech him to send vnto him in the spring of the yeare some fiftie thousand men to repaire his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and certaine money also for the payment of his men of warre: which he graunted him. Moreouer the conducting of good store of warlike munition, &amp; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of victuals for to renew ours: for this war was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally enterprised for the profit and greatnesse of the Tartarians, &amp; for the importance which the losse of the Lordships of Paguin &amp; Quifu was vnto them, wherby the king of China had greatly stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthened and assured his estate, in so much as he might at his pleasure enter vpon the Tartarians, and the Tartarians could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise against him without great forces, for that hee had caused a wall to be made between the spaces of the<note place="margin">A wall buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the king of China forty leagues long.</note> mountains, which was fortie leagues long, so as they were defended hereby fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ordinary incursions, the which continually did greatly enrich the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because they brought much cattel through the same, wherin the cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So we began to march, and in eight &amp; thirty dayes we arriued at Cipribit, the Army hauing found great disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities: there had we newes of <hi>Clibes,</hi> who was very glad to vnderstand how the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayrs had passed: he came to visite the Prince, who she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vnto him a very good countenance, and gaue him particular vnderstanding of his determination, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10494:29"/>
vnderstood at large of <hi>Calibes,</hi> al that had passed within the kingdom of China. The next day the Prince moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on horsebacke, and came vnto Pazanfou, where the forces commaunded by <hi>Calibes</hi> were at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the which had often fought with and tried the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Chinois:</hi> but found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much inferiour vnto their owne. The Emperour caused a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiewe to bee made of all the forces which were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Calibes,</hi> and after hee beheld the countenances of these soldiers throughout all their ranks, he caused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to muster, &amp; to receiue money, euery one crying, God saue the victorious &amp; inuincible Emperour, according to their custome. I had forgotten to declare vnto you how the Prince of Thanais, who was left to command ouer the Parthian nation by the Prince, at such time as <hi>Calibes</hi> went to meet him, was left in the army to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, where being desirous to shew his courage, had made warre, and meeting with foure thousand horse of China, led by the king of China his brother, he so allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him, that hauing entrapped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he fought with and ouerthew them, bringing a great number of<note place="margin">The Prince of Thanais ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw a troupe of horsmen, led by the king of Chinas brother</note> horse and spoiles away and there remained dead vpon the ground fiue or sixe hundred, the enemies being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in disorder, if the night had not bene hee had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a most notable victorie. He had for this good fortune much honour at the arriuall of his Prince, and he had also daylie greatlie wearied the Chinois with ordinarie incursions: hee was sonne vnto one of the Princes sisters, &amp; they greatlie honored him, as wel for his vertues, as the place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he was desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10494:29"/>
who was notwithstanding a most sufficient &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Captaine. Now he was desirous of glorie during the abode which he had made, being the formost on the enemies fide, and with great diligence had marked the wall and the places by the which he might enter by force, and sent many spies into the countrey of China, by certain litle wayes that were within the mountains, who aduertised him of all. He had also gained through his courtesie a Lord of the same mountaines (called the<note place="margin">The Prince of Thanais gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a Lord of the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10494:30"/>
Prince vnto him for his greatnesse and quiet, he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto him a passage, by the which hee assured him of entrance into the kingdom of China, &amp; with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility to set vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forces of the king of China, which were appointed for safegard of the wall, the which as I haue said, contained fortie leagues; a matter which gaue cause of good aduisement vnto the Prince: for <hi>Calibes</hi> who was an old Captaine, found it a matter of great difficultie to go through this passage by force, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the view he had taken thereof, and had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the same to be reuiewed by others. For it was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept by the kings forces, who was not wearie to be mounted on horsebacke, assuring himselfe that fiftie thousand men the which he had placed for the guarde of the wall, were sufficient to stoppe all that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise to force the same. So this Lord (much made of and gayned thorough the good countenance of the Prince) was a great furtherance vnto the good successe of this enterprise. Then the Prince after he had hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vpon him gifts of faire horses, rich furres, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rare things, he willed him to vtter that which he had to say vnto him. This Lord spake then in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Know my Lord, that it is but losse of time to thinke<note place="margin">The speech of the mountaine Lord vnto Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan.</note> that with your armes you shold be able to force the wall which the Chinois haue built against the incursions of your subiects, the defendants haue too much aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage therein. I doubt not of your souldiers stoutnesse &amp; of their courage, I know you haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with them, and that whatsoeuer you commaund the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they will die or do the same. I know you haue great and wise Captaines with you, that your person is only of all the world worthie to commaund them: but all this will be but in vaine against the wall of the Chinois,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10494:30"/>
where I assure you there are fifty thousand men to keep it, and you cannot stay there so short a time, but there will come thither fiftie thousand more, led by the <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anxi</hi> who hath such a commaundement. The king of China will himselfe march forward also, who will giue you battell with two hundred thousand horse and as many footemen. After you haue fought, I beleeue that the fortune and valour of your men may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the victorie, the which will cost you deare: but for to shew vnto you how much the reputation and mildnesse of your men hath bound me vnto them, I will shew you a meanes by the which you may cause fiftie thousand men to enter into the kingdome of China, whom I my selfe will conduct; and they shall be on them which keepe the wall, in a manner as soone as they shall perceiue it. In the meane time you shall cause your men to go vnto a place that I will tell you, which will be very discommodious vnto the Chinois, by reason of a mountaine ouer against them, which you must cause them to win: for I assure my selfe, that when they shall perceiue your souldiers to be passed, they will loose their courage, and you may easily win the passage for to fauour those men of yours which shall be passed ouer with me. And for to shew vnto you the affection &amp; fidelitie of that I speake, I will deliuer into your hands<note place="margin">Hostages offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the mountaine Lord vnto the Emperour.</note> an only sonne I haue, and two little daughters with my wife: I haue also one brother, who I am assured will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to do you seruice. The Prince hauing heard this Lord speake, receiued great ioy thereof, hoping that his affaires should happily succeede, and this he kept ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry secret, for euen the Prince of Thanais knew not the meanes that this Lord had; seeing there was onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Prince &amp; an interpreter, and the Prince after he
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10494:31"/>
had thus spoken vnto him, gratifying him with all hee could possibly, this Lord retyred himselfe, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Prince of Thanais, who conducted him backe againe with all the honour that might be. So the Emperour returned from thence into his quarter, and the next day after he had imparted the whole vnto <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> and heard <hi>Calibes</hi> concerning that which he had learned of the departing of the king of China, and of his preparation, which was great. This enterprise see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hard vnto him, after due reuerence yeelded vnto the Prince, he spake vnto him in this manner: Know my<note place="margin">Calibes oration vnto Prince Tamerlan.</note> Lord, that I am your slaue for to obey you: but seeing you require me to giue you an accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of all that I know of the estate of the kingdome of China, for that I haue remained these sixe moneths vpon the borders by your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, to hinder them from passing the same, wherby they might hurt your enterprises, I can affirme vnto you that the king of China, who raigneth at this present is of great reputation, and hath increased the limits of his kingdome more then any of his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, he is proud and bold, he causeth himselfe to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his people, Lord of the world. All his strength consisteth in this wall opposed against vs, the which he hath caused to bee made by reason of the ordinarie roades of our Nation. I am of opinion that there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fiftie and threescore thousand men at the guard of that wall, men for the most part trained vp in the garrisons of the king of China, and his best souldiers, &amp; I know no good means to force this wall without great hazard and much losse of your men. I haue vnderstood that towards the lake Hogeen you may find more easie entrance into the kingdome: but this will be 7. or eight daies iourney for your army, and there are many straite
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10494:31"/>
places, where your army (which is great) will be long time a passing: on the other side, this will be a space of time wherein the king of China may giue order for his affaires, who supposeth that hee hath not to deale but with me, whom you haue left with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement only of defence. Yet I thinke this to be most for your aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for that victuals will be more easily conducted vnto your armie: you know that this is the principall sinew to bring forth a strong and furious combat. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnder correction of your graue and more wise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, this is as much as I know hereof, leauing vnto your selfe for to discourse of the inner parts of the countrey, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shall haue set foot thereinto, we will talke with you of the same. The Prince hard him very attentiuely, but he knew not at all that which the Prince had further learned, insomuch as the Prince, who would that his reputation and glorie should be attributed vnto his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and vnto those of his army, what practise soeuer he had in hand, and after euerie one had declared his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he saied; that he hoped the great God the vnitie of whom he would maintaine against such idolaters, and his iust right should answere the reasons which do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict his purpose, and the valiant arme of his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers shall quite ouerthrow whatsoeuer opposeth it self against the same. Behold how Princes make themselues wondered at for their forces, whereas oftentimes they vse more the Foxes craft, then the Lions strength. Our Prince would wisely attribute vnto himselfe the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ouercomming by open warre, and concealed from his souldiers that which he held as assured to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, to the end the honour of a happie conducting might be ascribed vnto him onely. Now our Prince ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing satisfied euery one of the Kings and Lords that did
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10494:32"/>
accompanie him, he appointed the meeting place for his armie to be at a certaine place, where he meant to chuse fiftie thousand fighting men, and deliuer them vnto the commandement of the Prince of Thanais, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom he ioyned the Lord <hi>Axalla</hi> a Geneuois (for that he knew him to be discreete) for to accompanie him, commaunding him to giue credite vnto him, for his experience and fidelitie. The day appointed being come, the Lord with his brother came to the Emperor, hauing viewed the place againe, &amp; found it to be force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able &amp; fit to passe, assuring the Prince once again of the happy successe of their enterprise, &amp; the Prince being assembled with them to conferre together, resolued in the end, that his person with al the army shold approch vnto the walles directly ouer against Quaguifou, in<note place="margin">Fiftie thousand men sent into China by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret passage, vnder the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Prince of Th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais and Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla.</note> which meane space the 50000. men should march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vnto the place appointed, and where they were assured to passe, conducted by the Chinois Lord, vnder the charge of the Prince of Thanais &amp; <hi>Axalla</hi> Geneuois. The Emperor hauing not failed to deliuer vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the best souldiers of his armie, &amp; hauing set downe the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by them to be obserued, hee willed that the Lord <hi>Axalla</hi> should leade twentie thousand of them, &amp; shold march the first, the rest led by the Prince of Thanais, and that euery one should haue one of those Lords to guide them, that by their meanes the enterprise might be more safely directed. So hauing marched x. leagues, they arriued at the passage, the which was won not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any man there to resist them: and hauing taken a<note place="margin">A secret way found into Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the mountaine Lord.</note> light repast, they beganne to march forward other ten leagues which yet remained, where the Chinois were, who suspected no such thing, hauing only an eye vnto them which marched for to force their walles, assuring
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10494:32"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to haue the maistry, considering their aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But it fell out much otherwise, for euen at the very same time the Chinois did perceiue the Princes armie to approch vnto their wall, as soone did they dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> with twenty thousand men, who aduanced forward being followed by the Prince of Thanais with thirtie thousand souldiers chosen out of the whole army, who without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municacion set vpon the Chinois, who came presently vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing left a certaine number of their campe for the guard of the wall: but they were presently won by the footemen led this day by <hi>Odmar,</hi> who passed ouer so as the Chinois were cut off between<note place="margin">Axalla ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois that kept the wall of partition.</note> our armies. When <hi>Axalla</hi> beganne the battell he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw them in a manner all, the Prince of Thanais not hazarding himselfe therin: there was great riches got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this day, the king of China his cosin (whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led king) was taken prisoner: there was a great quantity of gold amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well on their armes as on their horse and furniture: they shewed no great stoutnesse. The newes hereof being come vnto the king of China, who at that present time was at Quantiou, brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him great astonishment, for that he iudged it a thing that could not possibly come to passe, you might haue seene euery one filled with fright, teares &amp; cries, bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the losse of their friends. The king although he had not beene vsed but to see Fortune alwaies friendly with a mild countenance, &amp; now to see her turned backward with her haire brisseling, he made thereof notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no great shew, but gathering together souldiers from all partes (as the custome is of these people)<note place="margin">The custome of the Chinois.</note> he caused all the Priestes and such as had the charge of holie thinges to come vnto him, and after exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations vsed, he (as their head) commaunded them to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10494:33"/>
offer sacrifice vnto their Gods, of whom the Sunne is the principall commaunding in heauen, whom they hold opinion to be the chiefest cause of their being, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it immortall and impassible, mouing it selfe onely for the benefit of liuing creatures, this did he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to be obserued thorough out all his Cities; and the second thing was, that euery one able to beare armes should mount on horsebacke, and come vnto the king at Paguinfou, whither he doubted that we would go, because it was one of the neerest townes vpon the borders. I haue forgotten to declare that this Lord who had the charge to conduct fiftie thousand men vnto the fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiers at such time as they which were there had need thereof, was soone in a readinesse, and came to oppose himselfe against the Princes armie which entred, and beeing skilfull in the wayes of the countrey, troubled<note place="margin">The Emperour wonne the wals of China.</note> much the armie: for a great number of his men were on horsebacke. The Prince determined to beate downe all the wals the better to assure his returne, as also all the fortresses which were there vpon all the passages, all of them hauing yeelded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues after his victorie, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe very courteous vnto the people of these mountaines, he gaue vnto this Lord a small portion of<note place="margin">The mountain Lord rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with great gouernement.</note> land, wherein there be seuen or eight good townes, Archij, Ymulij, Faliquien, Fulij, Cohensen, Quialij, Pulij, Quianlu, who came and deliuered vp their keyes vnto him, being neighbours vnto this Lord, and gaue him the gouernment of the frontier prouince of Xian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xij, shewing himselfe to be a Prince of his word, and acknowledging the notable seruices the which this Lord had done him. He referred the honouring of his brother vntill he had meanes to doe the same: all which mildenesse was of no small importance to fauour the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10494:33"/>
conquest of this countrie: for the people thereof are great wonderers, especially when as they see the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie of the men of warre, a thing which is altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their custome: for they are very cruell vnto their<note place="margin">The Chinois cruell vnto their enemies.</note> enemies ouer whom they haue the victorie, holding that of the Indians, who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e often entercourse with them. Now in our Prince there was not any thing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but curtesie vnto the conquered, insomuch as this made him admired and honoured. Now the question being after all the fortes of the borders were beaten downe, to knowe what course the armie should take, the Prince had receiued newes, how that the king of China assembled his forces and marched forwardes, and that he was there in his owne person, and that he strengthened also his Cities which are sufficiently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and more then in any countrey adioyning vnto him, so as this caused the Prince to determine not to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault any strong citie, and to leaue any of them behinde him, this were a great discommoditie vnto him for the victualing of his armie: for to leaue the enemie behind him, being assured to haue him on his front, this see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him nigh. Therfore vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these doubts he thoght good to haue the aduise of his Captaines, &amp; hauing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together, he propounded all these difficulties vnto them: in the end after sundry opinions, his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, to leaue nothing behind him, and to assault some famous citie, &amp; take it, by meanes wherof he may nourish his armie, and secondarily call the enemie vnto battell. The which the conqueror should alwayes seeke,<note place="margin">A good aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement for Generals.</note> and the defender the latest he can hazard the same. For that it is a very doubtfull thing to commit themselues vnto a battell, his dutie being rather to delay, vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the conquerour by length, and by wearinesse, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10494:34"/>
light skirmishes, then to sight in open field. For when a Generall hath wisely set his men in order, and hath exhorted them to performe their duties, what can hee do more then commit all vnto Fortune, and to the will of the Lord of Hosts? And it seemeth vnto me, that in no feates of armes doth fortune shew her trickes more often, then in the successe of battels, fauouring often the weakest, and deceiuing them sooner which trust in their skill of ouercomming. The examples thereof are verie common in the historie of the affaires of the world, where small armies haue ouercome innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble numbers. I speake here by way of a preamble of things which you shall hereafter heare: and of the euill councell which the king of China receiued. Now for to returne againe vnto my historie, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,<note place="margin">Warres in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na made by Tamerlan with his wise proceedings therein.</note> and the aduise of euerie one was, to conquer the countrie by litle and litle, so as their enterprise was to draw directly vnto <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> which as it was a great Citie and one of the chiefest, so is it also strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified and well replenished with people: but the Prince made account that the king of China would hazard a battell. Now the Prince before hee would cause the same to be summoned, had informed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe well of the situation thereof, and causing all the countrie which is champion to be represented vnto his view, which are for the most part plaines, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the more his hope of bringing to good end his enterprise: the riches on the other side gaue cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vnto the souldiers, and principally vnto the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians desirous of spoyle, who carried with them cartes to conuey away their spoyles, <hi>Paguinfou</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted an exceeding rich and wealthie Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Then he dispatched <hi>Odmar</hi> with fourteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

horse, to aduance forward and summon the same, as for to hinder victuals from being conueyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into out of the champion countrey: to the end that the cattell remayning in the fieldes, shoulde bee a meanes to maintaine and nourish his armie. I had forgotten to tell you, that for the acknowledging of the Lord <hi>Axalla</hi> his seruices, the Prince had made him Captaine generall of all his footemen, which<note place="margin">Axalla made Captaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of all the footmen.</note> was one of the principall honours of the armie. He caused the sayd Lord <hi>Axalla</hi> to march after <hi>Odmar,</hi> with all the footmen, which was verie neere a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie thousand men, well trayned vp in the warres, and good expert fighters. Hee marched himselfe immediatly after with all his horsemen, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilleries, engines, and other munitions belonging vnto warre, directly vnto <hi>Paguinfou. Odmar</hi> did ride twentie leagues this day, so as he arriued there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to their expectation, looking rather for the king then for the enemie, and hauing taken much cattell, wherewith the countrie greatly aboundeth, he pitched his tents, leauing the citie betweene him and vs, and stayed for his footmen, who marched forwards in the meane space, sending continually vnto the warre, for to wearie the enemie. This endured three or foure dayes, vntill our footemen ledde by this braue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Geneuois, shewed themselues in the plaine of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinfou.</hi> Then the Citie was summoned to yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience vnto the Emperour, or else they should receiue the law of the conquerour. They made answere, that they were determined to liue and die in the seruice of their Prince. Now you must vnderstand that it was fortie yeares or thereabouts, since the Father of the king which raigneth at this present ouer the Chinois,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10494:35"/>
had conquered it from the Empire of the Tartarians, and hauing driuen out all the inhabitants, they had planted therein newe Colonies, so thoroughly, that there were but few of the first remembrance, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they of the flat country and small walled townes, who came from all partes and brought their keyes, most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly submitting themselues vnto the obedience of the Prince: so as there was great aboundance of victuals within our armie: and if we had beene within our owne countrie, there could not haue come greater store; a thing which made our Prince hope for a happie suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, there beeing no other difficultie which for the most part can ouerthrow a great armie as ours was, and withdraw them from their enterprise. And thus the Citie of Paguinfou is besieged, and our footemen camped round about within an arrowes shot of all the walles. They within the citie did vse great endeuor for<note place="margin">The siege of the citie of Paguinfou.</note> their defence, and our Prince omitted nothing for their offence. <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing viewed a great and strong suburbe, which was in length almost halfe a league, supposed that those of the Citie kept no watch there: that this must needes be, for that they would not make him obstinate; hee had a determination to winne it in the night, and hauing imparted it vnto the Prince, vpon the first watch all his men were readie, all of them hauing made prouision of ladders, and of such things as are necessary for winning thereof with hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blowes, and hauing assaulted it on sundrie partes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fight had continued two houres, <hi>Axalla</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained<note place="margin">A great sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbe wonne by Axalla in the night.</note> the conquerour, and cut in peeces eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men at the least which were within the same: the spoile was great, there were many of <hi>Axalla</hi> his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> slain of one side, which was that by the which they doubted
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10494:35"/>
to be assaulted. But on the other side, by the which it was taken, there was scarce any one slaine. The taking of this suburbe did greatly astonish those of the Citie, who had marked the lustinesse of our men, and beganne to enter into doubt of their safetie, which vnto this day they accounted as most assured. On the other side they did see that the Princes promises to be there within fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene daies fayled, they did see this great army which daily wanne footing, the engines and artillerie readie to offer violence on one side by them commaunded, the which did greatly annoy them, so as diuerse princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall men of the Citie, desired rather to make triall of the conquerors clemencie, then of his rigor. But hee<note place="margin">The Gouernors speech vnto those of the city to stay them from yeelding.</note> which commaunded within, who was one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Lords of the countrey, and one of the best beloued with the king, assured them of the kings approch, so as they should not want succour in time of necessitie: that there was no neede therof at this present, and although they had lost a suburbe, it should be great folly not to be willing to defend a citie, and their fortresses being as yet entire, that for his part, hee would make proofe of his fidelitie vnto his Prince, with the hazard of his life and goods. These words were of no small importance, and being vttered in the assembly of the people, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their courages for to change, in such sort as euery one retired into his quarter, beeing resolued with the losse of their citie, to lose also their liues. Now you must vnderstand that the situation of the citie was of hard<note place="margin">The situation of the citie of Paguinfou.</note> accesse, being seated vpon a plaine, the which was enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned round about with mountaines, one of them only approching the citie, which ouerlooked it on front vpon the North side, where was a valley by the which they passed, and there did runne a riuer: on this side was the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10494:36"/>
suburbe situated which had beene taken, so as the meanes to succour the Citie was stopped, our soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers keeping the passages of these Mountaines, the which were in the old time the borders of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: for Paguinfou was once gouerned by the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians, which kept it for a defence against the Chinois, but had lost the same, and these mountaines were the limits of China against the foresaid Tartarians, who gouerned Paguinfou at that time, so as these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were of hard accesse, and there remained no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way but on the side of the suburbe, the which a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer compasseth about, running all along the side of a bordering mountaine, vpon the which we caused many bridges to be built, for to haue thereby a way for to succour our souldiers, which kept the passages of the mountaines on the enemies side: so as it could not be but hardly succoured, or else by a battell the which the Prince did earnestly desire, as all conquerors should do. I will declare also that during this time <hi>Odmar, Calibes</hi> and the Prince of Thanais were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded often by the Prince to make warre, as well for to heare certaine newes of the enemie, as also for to maintaine his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to keepe the place the which he had chosen as the field for the battell, to the end that he might liue there with his horsemen. He gaue also commandement vnto his men to gather together great store of victuals, so as they sacked many small townes, out of the which they brought a great quantitie. In this meane time the king of Chinaes armie approched (euen like faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the which was very great, as they brought vs word dayly, the Prince determining to go in person &amp; meete with the enemy, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with his principall horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to leaue the greatest part of his footmen at the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10494:36"/>
siege, wherunto he had a great desire, omitting nothing that might wearie the besieged, who defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues couragiously. So the Prince began to batter, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing<note place="margin">The siege of Paguinfou.</note> his engines to approch, as rammes and other mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, the which he had made for to come neere vnto the walles, to the end they might come to hand-blowes with the enemies: insomuch as the Citie was assaulted on two sides very coragiously. They within began to be more affeard then before, there beeing set vp for the safegard of the munitions, and of a wall which was fallen down, a Caualier raised vp very high within an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowshot, which did greatly annoy them, so as they were constrained to forsake the wall in the day, and this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to begin a trench for to couer themselues, the which was 22. foote in height, and as much in depth, and fiftie foot in bredth; the which being declared vnto our men, they determined to trie their fortunes, and to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an assault before they had ended the same, or at the least to win the wall, &amp; lodge there at the instant. So the Prince sent for <hi>Axalla,</hi> who was in his own quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this affaire depending vpon his charge, and hauing by his industrie ordered in a manner all the siege, and hauing acquainted him with his pleasure, commanded him to execute it. The next day putting his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in order they assalted the wall, the which was valiantly defended: but in the end through the valor of <hi>Axalla</hi> who gaue an assalt with 20000. of his best souldiers, he won the wall, &amp; lodged there, the Prince hauing so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded him to do, to stop the heat of the soldiers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going any further. Now the Princes purpose was to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound for the citie, &amp; not to force it, for two reasons. The first was, for that he feared, the citie being great and rich, that when the souldiers should sacke it, the enemie who was but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10494:37"/>
thirtie leagues from thence, should come vpon them, and by this meanes his army should be found in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, also rich souldiers neuer serue well: The other was, for that he would draw out of that citie which was rich and wealthie, those commodities which were necessary for the sure accomplishing of his enterprise, seeing it was necessarie to haue such a citie for to make a store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of necessarie things for the army. Thus although the wall was won, the enemies wanted not courage yet to defend themselues valiantly, looking for aide accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the newes they had receiued, that the kings ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marched forward. Whilest these things were in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one of our engines shooting a bullet, and hauing ouerthrowen a peece of Anuber, the same did hurt the Gouernour, who at the end of three or foure houres yeelded vp the ghost, the which caused the souldiers to change their resolution, there being none which made them obstinate but he, so as they determined before the Prince should be aduertised of the losse of their head, &amp; especially of the great slaughter of men which they had lost in the fight of the wall, all of them with one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent<note place="margin">The citie of Paguinfou yeelded vnto Tamerlan vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of their Gouernor</note> did resolue for to yeelde themselues vnto the Princes mercie, sauing their liues, and the souldiers enioying their horse and weapons. Now I haue forgotten to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how this assault had alreadie endured the space of eight dayes; such delay did greatly vexe the Prince, and on the other side, the king of China made no great hast, but at such time as he vnderstood of the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his death, doubting of that which happened. The Prince then who was aduertised that the enimies army marched vnto a batel, was very glad of these news, the which <hi>Axalla,</hi> who was aduanced vpon the walles, had declared vnto him, and brought the Embassadors
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10494:37"/>
vnto the Prince, who receiued them verie curteouslie, assuring them on the one side of his gentlenesse, and on the other of the power he had to punish their diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. The conditions were agreed vpon, and there came out of the citie eighteen thousand souldiers, the inhabitants remaining in a maner all: there were ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thirtie thousand soldiers at the beginning: the siege co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued two moneths. Now the king of China in his marching receiued newes of the yeelding vp thereof: he caused the Lieutenant of the late Gouernor to be punished, and many of the Captaines, but pardoned the souldiers: he stayed in that place atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for our marching forward, which could not bee before eight daies after he had taken order about this new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quest, the which was necessarie for him to settle before hee proceeded any further. Our Prince caused a muster to be made of his soldiers hauing encreased their payes, and contented euery one according to his desertes.<note place="margin">Reward for deserts.</note> The honour of taking the citie and the happie successe therein was attributed vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> to whom was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the gouernment of the citie with the country al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conquered. But he beseeched the Prince that it would please him to bestow it vpon some other, and for himself he reserued the hope of his maister, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he should haue part. This answere did greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Prince, for he greatly desired the seruice of <hi>Axalla,</hi> for that he was a Captaine, who besides his valour, had great practise in the knowledge of Armes, and full of inuention, but principallie at such time as<note place="margin">Axalla skilfull in besieging of Cities.</note> the question was for the besieging of any place. The Prince offering it vnto him rather to acknowledge his seruice done vnto him, then for any desire hee had to employ him in any other place then about his person.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10494:38"/>
Vpon his refusall this charge was bestowed vpon the Prince of Thanais, with the title of Viceroy. Now as I haue already told you, our Prince after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen such order as was necessarie, and aduertised his friendes in all partes, and aboue all the Emperour, he marched forward, hauing contented his souldiers, and made a generall muster of his Armie, as well of the horse as footmen, the which hee found to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished of tenne thousand men onely. Nowe our Prince after he had solemnlie called vpon the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,<note place="margin">Tamerlan his godlines.</note> inuincible, and incomprehensible God, and spent one whole day in prayer, we enterprised to goe on forward, and to go directlie vnto the enemie, who was at <hi>Sintehu,</hi> with all his owne forces, and of all his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. As soone as he receiued newes that our Armie was passed ouer the riuer of <hi>Chulifu,</hi> it is reported that barbarouslie he caused to be published through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Campe, that euerie one should prepare himselfe vnto the Battaile, for that he was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to stay no longer for the enemie within his owne countrie, because hee could not endure to see his subiectes spoyled any longer. But certainlie he made it manifestlie appeare, how his mischiefe and euill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune followed him too neare, euen at the verie heeles: for if that hee had drawne out the warre in length, he had gotten a great aduantage of vs, hauing manie strong Cities, the which we must needes haue assaulted, and had bene sufficient to ouerthrow vs vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie, and after he might haue had a good bargaine of vs. For the wisedome of our Prince would not endure to leaue any thing behind him which might hinder vs from victuals: for great Armies cannot otherwise be maintained. Our Prince was wont to say vnto his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10494:38"/>
famiars (for he neuer boasted himself, and at such time as fortune was most fauourable vnto him, then had he most doubt) that if the king of China were so euill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised as to offer him battaile, hee should commit a follie whereof he would repent him, being well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he had braue Captaines, and souldiers well experienced in the warres, who knewe well what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto battailes. Now the king of China mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched directlie vnto vs with great magnificence: there<note place="margin">The king of China his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.</note> was nothing to be seene but gold and precious stones in his Armie: he himselfe was commonlie in a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, wherein there was such a quantitie of golde and rich stones, that euerie part was full of Diamonds, Rubies, and Pearles. The king of China was of the age of three and thirtie yeares, vvho for the most part had bene brought vp in pleasures, and not in militarie exercises, nor vnder the bloudy ensigne of <hi>Mars,</hi> loaden with yron, boisterous and furious, not with gold, precions stones, and with such kinde ofri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: so as he was very insole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in thretnings, brauadoes, and in defying vnto the battaile. He often said that we had surprised him, and had not warned him to prepare himself, and that we had stroken him without speaking<note place="margin">The customi of the Chin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He had two or three kings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so with him, his neighbours and Allies, who marched with the same preparation. The rumour of these riches gaue great courage to the soldiers, for they were coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of iust gain, as is that gotten by a battaile. So both our armies went forward each to approch the other, &amp; there was a city yeelded vnto the Prince called <hi>Tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheuoy,</hi> the which helped our Armie greatly, so as the Prince hauing well marked the situation of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10494:39"/>
Camp, found it to be much for his aduantage, and the waters and pastures in great aboundance, in so much as we determined abiding in that place to behold the enemies countenance, who if he were so rash as to set vpon him at all aduenture, this place seemed vnto him verie conuenient to teach him a newe lesson in. The next day to the end we might giue occasion vnto the enemie for to approch nearer, we sent to summon, and at the same time to take possession of the citie of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihu,</hi> the which in aduancing forward we left a litle behind vs. The king of China had put manie men thereinto, and it was a citie sufficiently well fortified: from <hi>Tiaucheuoy</hi> to <hi>Paguinuhu</hi> there were ten leagues. It vexed the Prince greatlie, that in returning directlie vnto <hi>Pannihu</hi> he should turne his backe vnto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. This was the occasion he went to content himself with this inuesting onely, for two reasons; the one to cause the enemie the sooner to approch: the other for<note place="margin">The procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlans army towards the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</note> to hinder the incursions which the might make: but it fell out much otherwise, for this matter was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner put in deliberation, but that <hi>Odmar</hi> who had bene at the warre brought certaine newes that the enemies Armie was within a dayes iourney of vs, and that the battaile in his opinion would bee the next day. The Prince foorthwith dispatched one vnto <hi>Calibes,</hi> who was gone thither with 10000. horse, that hee should come vnto him, and in the meane time made proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all thinges necessarie wherewith he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile for obtaining of the victorie. So he aduaunced his Army within a league of the citie <hi>Tiaucheuoy,</hi> about noone the next day they had more certaine aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the enemies comming. The Prince who had as merrie a countenance as might bee, after he had
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10494:39"/>
commanded his Armie to take the place for the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, which he had chosen in his iudgement with most aduantage, and hauing set downe vnto <hi>Odmar</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he would haue to be obserued, hee desired to see the comming of this Armie: so sending before him fiue or sixe thousand horse as scouts, he aduanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and <hi>Calibes</hi> with him. Now there were two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses wherefore hee marched the foremost; the one was, for that he wold iudge of his enemies countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; the other, he hoped to draw him to fight in his place of battaile the which he had chosen, and to deale in such sort as the enemie might be the assailant. So after he had seene this great confused Armie which continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came forward, he commanded <hi>Calibes</hi> to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as soone as they drew neere vnto him, and bring vnto him this great cloud, the which he hoped soon to disperse. So the Prince returned backe vnto his men for to assure them of the battaile: he caused all his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be placed all along by a great mountaine, so as they had but one head for to doubt. And hee planted great store of Artillerie for the guard of his footmen. I am of opinion, that the Prince had about sixe score<note place="margin">The order of the Princes battaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the king of China.</note> thousand footmen, whereof many w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> armed after the Christian maner, and all they were commanded by sundry Captaines; but all obeyed <hi>Axalla,</hi> who comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them as Generall. Our horsmen were in battaile array in a great leuell plaine, hauing the footmen on the left hand, and on the right was the comming of the enemie, so as vpon the least disfauour that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, he would retire to be assisted by his footmen. We had foure-score thousand horse: <hi>Calibes</hi> with the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians were in the Auantguard, and had the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of thirtie thousand horse, who should receiue
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10494:40"/>
him at such time as he did drawe on the enemie, as he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded. It was deuided into three troups, each one consisting of 10000. <hi>Odmar</hi> had also 30000. horse who should assist him. The Prince remained in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier-ward at the one of the wings of his footmen, which held one of his principall forces, his purpose was to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the three-score and sixe thousand horse to maintain the fight against the Barbaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, being led by two good Captaines, and if any of them remained the Emperor hoped after of them to haue a good market, by causing his footmen to march forward, and himselfe with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there abode twenty thousand of the best horse, which were sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without hazarding his person for to giue a new battaile, if so be that any disfauor should happen vnto them: for he had vnderstood that this was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the kings of China, to enclose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the middest of their chariots with their footmen, and not to hazard themselues but vpon the extremity: so the enemie failed nothing at all to march directlie vnto <hi>Calibes,</hi> and all the Army marched after following of him and setting vpon him, and he euen as the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians are alwayes accustomed to do, with his 6000. horse in retiring gaue manie charges, killing some of them, and they likewise killing some of his men.

The Prince who with a troupe of horse did see the Armie march after <hi>Calibes,</hi> commended greatly the maner of casting their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10494:40"/>
men out of the rankes, for to compell this troupe vnto fight, &amp; did see this Armie come in good order, &amp; he tried with his eye to note the place wher the kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was, hauing near him the Chinois Lord to instruct him, who knew well their maner of fighting. Nowe they had neither auant-guard nor battaile, but only an Arier-ward commanded by the king, and inclosed (as I haue said) with his chariots: the which being shewed vnto him by this Lord, the Prince turned himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">Tamerlan his speach of the king of China.</note> vs, and in our language said: Yet must wee this day disperse this cloud here so gilded, &amp; the king of China and my selfe must make a partition thereof. Now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing seene the enemie sufficiently aduanced, &amp; iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had had seene them march a good league, he thought it not conuenient to suffer them for to take breath, nor for to put themselues againe into their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; he sent vnto <hi>Calibes</hi> for to wil him to set forward the fight, and that if those whom he had led with him should be weary, they should come vnto him; but it was not in <hi>Calibes</hi> power to haue this commandement ouer them. For as soone as they heard this word of fighting vttered, they required the first charge, with a young Lord, who commanded ouer them called <hi>Zioc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanes,</hi> who made appeare vnto the Chinois to what end their flight was, charging verie stiffely vpon the foremost of the enemies, the which was an occasion to to begin the first fight. And I assure you there could not be seene a more furious thing, nor any for to fight with more desire to manifest the valor of his nation, &amp; for to procure honor vnto his Prince.

Now his thirtie thousand horse were all Scithians, who obserue not the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Parthians doe. Now before the Prince retired with his men, he did see the first charge giuen. <hi>Calibes</hi> being wounded, retired himself neere vnto the Prince, hauing with him two thousand horse ioyned together againe, and many more ioyning themselues together neere vnto the Prince, who commaunded that they should cure <hi>Calibes,</hi> viewing the place of his wound, he caused him to be conducted behind his footmen, and the other which were hurt with him also. Now <hi>Calibes</hi> was not able to pierce through this Armie, being bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten back; but <hi>Odmar</hi> with almost all the Parthian hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did handle them more roughly, for he ran cleane through them, and returned by one of the right wings of the Armie, where he fought most valiantlie, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beaten them back eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within the kings chariots, hee thought that hee should not doe wisely to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to breake such forces.

The Prince who had already set forward, kept aloofe off, and sent vnto him fiftie thousand footmen, with a part of the artillerie, giuing charge therof vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> who forthwith set forward, hauing commandement to set vpon the chariots, and to make an entrance: hee set forward the artillerie before him, the which did
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10494:41"/>
greatlie astonish the enemies: for the gouernors of the horses belonging to the kinges chariots could not hold them; it made also a great spoile. As soone as hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued this disorder, he set forward, and came to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blowes; there were a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred &amp; fifty thousand me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet about the kings person. <hi>Axalla</hi> full of courage fought so valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that they neuer beheld any do more braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Odmar</hi> during this fight charged again the horsmen who were retired vnto the kings aide, whom he put to flight. Then the Prince aduanced forward with the rest of his footmen, gaue aide vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> and came euen vnto the person of the king of China, who was as yet enclosed within a second ranke of Chariots with thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or fortie thousand men: and after hee had fought two or three houres, the horsmen assisting the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and they principally whom the Prince had reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the king remained wounded within the power of<note place="margin">The king of China woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and taken prisoner.</note> the Prince, the battaile being won, and all the enemies Campe forced; the fight indured eight houres, and it was euen night which saued the liues of many of the enemies.

It was a strange thing to behold the enemies weapons, and the diuersity of streamers wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were decked, the which seemed vnto vs a far off as beautifull, as the diuersitie of colours plentifull. But to say the truth, the multitude was great which this king had, notwithstanding there was much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene their valour and ours: and it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he had ranged in battaile this verie day three hundred and fiftie thousand men, whereof there were an hundred and fiftie thousand horsmen, the rest on foote: the greatest part of them were rude and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, which suffered themselues to bee slaine one vpon another, not marking their aduantage, nor hauing anie warlike knowledge, as our men haue:<note place="margin">A great slaugh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ter of the Chinois.

Now the next day after the buriall of the dead, the Prince hauing giuen thankes vnto God for his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, caused the wounded to be cured, and amongst the others <hi>Calibes,</hi> who by reason of the vntemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the aire, rather then by the blow of the wound<note place="margin">Calibes woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> he had receiued, found himselfe verie ill, yet would he not omit his dutie, to commaund alwaies his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant-guard, the which was a great pleasure vnto the Prince, for he alone had commandement ouer the Emperours forces, being a Scithian, and greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of his nation. The Prince dispatched away thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thousand horse in the pursuit of one of the king of Chinas brothers, who was fled away, hauing ioyned together againe some twelue or fifteene thousand horse. The Prince sent to summon <hi>Pannihu,</hi> the which did yeeld it selfe vnto him: whereupon our Armie approched neare vnto it, for to aduance our selues the further into the countrie.

howe the Prince hauing the next day caused his tentes to bee pitched most stately, and his guardes ordered according to his greatnesse, the principall of his Armie being also neare his person, for all the night he had remained continually on horsebacke, vntill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two of the clocke, when as they brought him a tart and his water, for he neuer dranke wine, and lay downe vpon a carpet, where he passed the rest of the the night, I was neere vnto him and neuer left him: but I neuer heard anie vaunting or boasting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of his mouth, but much bewailed the follie of this king, which would not deliuer vp that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto him, and said vnto <hi>Odmar,</hi> who was neare<note place="margin">Tamerlan his speech vnto Odmar of the goodnesse of God.</note> vnto him, that his God had led him by the hand, and had giuen vnto him a great victorie, without the losse of anie of his seruants, at the least of them which were of marke: that hee could not but lament for all those whom hee had lost, accounting them notwithstanding most happie and blessed, dying in the seruice of their king, against such cruell and barbarous people. So then hee sent a commaundement vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> for to bring vnto him the imprisoned king: who being come,<note place="margin">The comming of the king of China prisoner vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Tamerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> the Emperour issued out of his tents, and went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him. This king of China came with a verie proud and haughtie countenance, and like a coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man, approching neare vnto the Emperour, hee demaunded of <hi>Axalla</hi> by an interpreter, which was the Emperour, and being shewed him, hee spake fiercely vnto him after this manner: The goddes whom I worship, being prouoked against my nation &amp; people, and conspired against my good fortune, haue made mee at this day thy prisoner: but for as much as it is reported ouer all the worlde, that <hi>Tamerlan</hi>

The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour on the other side hauing saluted him verie curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie, led him into his tent, &amp; willed his interpreter to say vnto him; that euerie diuiniyt fained or true, which<note place="margin">Tamerlan his prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So hauing made a signe that hee allowed of that the Prince said, with tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks vnto him, the Prince remained a certaine space after without speaking, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing placed him neare vnto himselfe, not contenting himselfe in beholding this Princes behauiour. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his interpreter to dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of him, what he did think of the fashion obserued by his people in fighting.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the great Army that hee had; but that the gods had otherwise disposed thereof.

he fetched a great sigh, and being demanded wherfore he was sorie that his brother should bee with him and run the same fortune: he answered that all his hope of comforting himselfe in this mishap was placed in his brother, and all the good happe also of the Chinois name, therefore he greatlie lamented him, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much the courage of his brother. Now the Prince knew of certaine that he was escaped away, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I haue said) was <hi>Odmar</hi> gone to hinder his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting together.

               </gap>e forgotten to declare how the riches which were gotten were innumerable: for the meanest amongst them had much gold about him, &amp; vpon the trappings of their horse. The Lords had such store of precious stones, as of nothing more. They did bring all the prisoners before the Prince, and when the two Allies of the king of China did come, the king rose vp and did them great reuerence. Then the Prince demanded of him by an interpreter, who they were. He answered him, that they were his Allies, and that he lamented more their fortune the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his owne, and that he would die with them. Now this barbarous king<note place="margin">The cruell cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Chinois.</note> thought the matter should be handled after their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when as they put to death their prisoners, and feed of meat made of them, as some of those countries are accustomed to doe. Nowe the Prince hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them curteouslie, did assure them of good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taiment: for the which the king of China did shewe himselfe greatly contented. The one of them was the king of Chiampa, the other of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There bee in like maner within the kingdome of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na fifteene verie large Prouinces, the which haue Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerners. It is reported that he hath threesore and ten kings wearing crownes, tributaries vnto him. We call this region China, the which they in their language name <hi>Tamé,</hi> and the people Tangis, the which we call Chinois. This kingdome doth abound in fish, and in great numbers of wilde-foule, by reason of the great aboundance of running waters which doe ouerflowe the countrie, the which is reasonable temperate: they abound greatly in silkes, and the meanest are apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therewith, hauing small quantitie of woll, and not vsing the same: they haue much cotten and linnen in steed thereof. The men do weare their haire long, the women combe them: they haue as many wiues as they are able to maintaine. Next vnto the king, there is a Gouernor generall whom they call Tutan, the which was the brother vnto the imprisoned king. This is the cause wherefore he must not forsake the countrie: but he requested his brother to accompanie him vnto this Battaile, where they thought assuredlie to ouercome, and was so wilfull, that he did appoint a Lord in his place, vpon whom the king of China did not relie so much as vpon his brother: in so much as this made him sad, considering the follie which he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10494:44"/>
in suffering him to come with him, and to be both of them at one battaile. Now for to returne vnto the king of China: the Prince hauing assembled his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, to the end he might be aduised how he should vse his prisoners and the rest of the victorie: hee receiued newes by <hi>Odmar,</hi> how that the kings brother was arriued at <hi>Quantou,</hi> the which hee had fortified, and that great store of forces did ioyne themselues vnto him. This was the cause that the Prince hauing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rested his forces, commaunded two thousand Parthian horse to conuey the prisoners vnto <hi>Paguin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou,</hi> and from thence after they had made abode there, to passe ouer the mountaines, and to remaine at <hi>

                  </gap>ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> (a Citie of olde time faithfull vnto the Emperors of Scithia) and there to keepe them faithfully. This charge was giuen vnto <hi>Malaxen</hi> Lieutenant generall in the charge of <hi>Axalla.</hi> Then the Prince made dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches vnto the Emperour, and to his Lieutenant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Parthians, and made them partakers of this great and happie victorie, wherein had bene slaine so manie thousandes of the enemies, and hee had lost so fewe of his owne. I returne vnto the delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Prince tooke (after that hee had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged himselfe of much carriages, the which hee had sent with the king of China,) before hee would goe anie further forward. Nowe hee had also sent to hasten the fortie thousand footmen which should come from <hi>Sachetay,</hi> and thirtie thousand Scithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an horse, making his account that they should haue come vnto him, before the forces of the king of China could oppose themselues against him. So the purpose and resolution of the Prince was, that it behooued to assault <hi>Quantou,</hi> and to shut vp, if it were
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10494:45"/>
possible, the kinges brother within the same, being<note place="margin">The procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Emperors Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie after the victory, &amp; his resolution in the same.</note> one of the principall seates belonging vnto the king of China, and a citie greatly peopled and strong: it was fortie leagues from the place where the battaile was fought. But <hi>Odmar</hi> being aduanced thither, would not retire before hee had expresse commandement from the Prince, who hauing sent thither, pitched his tentes round about the said Citie: hauing summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many small cities, the which yeelded themselues wholly vnto the Princes mercie, making great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for their king taken, and for the estate of their affaires, the abasement being verie great throughout all the kingdome, for all the diligence the king of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas brother could vse for the quieting of their astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed mindes, and to exhort euerie one to take new courage. Notwithstanding the gentlenesse vsed by the Conquerour made them to take all their losses with patience: and because it was also reported, that hee had vsed the king most friendlie, and all the prisoners: for the Prince cause his clemencie to bee published vnto all that would vouchsafe to cast themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his armes, as he would also shewe his sharpnesse vnto all those which disobeyed him, and would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his commandementes. For it was the Princes custome to pardon the humble, and to punish the proud throughlie, knowing that reward and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the thinges which doe greatlie increase e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states.<note place="margin">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10494:45"/>
to be a iust iudge and moderatour of euerie ones de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts. Now our Prince had besides another maxime,<note place="margin">Tamerlan straitely obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and kept his word truly.</note> that is, he straightly kept that which hee promised, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his estate depended therupon, if his word were once passed. And you must beleeue, that none of his seruants durst be so bold, as to make request and speake to the contrarie, so as this same being spread amongst the barbarous people, they were assured when they had once his word: now you must know that this is of no small importance vnto a victorious Prince, to make his victorie perfect. But to returne vnto my purpose, our Prince hauing caused praiers to be celebrated, and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thanks vnto God for his victory, as his custom was, he caused money to be distributed vnto the Captaines for the cure of them which were wounded. He went directly vnto Quantou, hauing giuen commandement vnto <hi>Odmar</hi> to go euen beyond Quantou, to the end that the kings brother should not put any greater for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereinto; and if it fell out so, he should not faile to fight with them and hinder them from the same, for his purpose was to besiege it. I will not forget to declare<note place="margin">Embassadours sent from the kings brother of China, vnto Tamerlan to visite the king.</note> how the kings brother had sent Embassadors to obtain leaue for to know of the kings health, and for to see him, the which the Prince did willingly suffer, to the end this other should not declare himselfe king, who would haue brought him more trouble then the other. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the euent of Quantou, and had his eye vpon the successe of this siege. Now the kings brother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing receiued newes of the affaires of the besieged, he determined (hauing receiued aide from some of his confederates, and also as soone as he had ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his forces) either to succour it, or to fight a battell, and came straight vnto Porchio, hoping he might make
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10494:46"/>
a bridge of boates whereof there be great store in these same countries. The Prince vnderstanding this, caused a trench to be made at the ende of the bridge, for to keepe it against the enemies: there did he place three or foure thousand men, to the end the bridge might alwaies be at his commaundement, and as he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the enemie approch, hee shewed himselfe in battell ray all along the riuer. This passe-time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued tenne or twelue dayes, vntill such time as the kings brother hauing caused a great number of boates to be gathered together, had made a bridge in a verie narrowe place of the riuer: whereof the Prince being aduertised, he made no shew he knewe it, keeping himselfe within his Campe, from whence the said place was some tenne leagues from vs, called Cambin. Then our scoutes brought vs word that the bridge was made, presently thereupon the Prince commaunded <hi>Odmar</hi> to mount on horsebacke with fifteene thousand horsemen, and that he should sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly set vpon all those that were passed ouer, and sent all his footemen after him; we set forward all our horsemen after, the which the Emperour himselfe did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct, hauing left a sufficient strength within Rochio. The Prince hauing considered the time of the diligence the which the kings brother might vse in passing ouer his armie, together with the aduertisement which he had receiued, made him accordingly adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce his army, so as we departing at midnight came thither by noone, and <hi>Odmar</hi> halfe an houre before vs, in so much as he hauing marked that there were no more of them passed ouer then he was appointed to charge, he staied in hope that halfe of them would passe ouer, and also he looked for the Prince, who did set forward, being
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10494:46"/>
behind the mountaines, which were within a league of that place, causing some to descrie from houre to houre what the enemie did. Now beeing enformed that the halfe part were passed, the which was fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thousand men good, he aduertised the Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and went himselfe vnto the fight, and finding them in very ill order, and nothing at all aduertised<note place="margin">Odmar set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the kings brother at the passing of ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and slue fiftie thousand of his men.</note> of the enemies nearenesse, he gaue the charge, and vtterly ouerthrew them; there remained dead vpon the ground some fiftie thousand men, but it was not without great fight, strengthened with the fauour of the water, and a great Marrish wherein they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped. Notwithstanding our footemen hauing wonne the banke of the riuer, beganne also to winne the boates and to seuer them by the meanes of a great boate the which wee with diligence caused to runne downe being full of artificiall fire, so as at the same<note place="margin">A stratagem.</note> very time that they which were within the boate did drawe neare, they retired out of the same, hauing first kindled the fire within the boate, the which with a great force rushed against the bridge of boates and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw it, and where it was resisted did burne. This did greatly astonish them that were passed, to see their returne cut off.

This second ouerthrow was of no small importance, although it was but the third part of the kings brothers armie, and that there remained vnto him as yet a hundred thousand fighting men: but there was no great hope that hee durst

The newes hereof being reported at Quantioufou, the Prince was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that one should carrie thither the king of Cauchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas head, for he was one of the kings greatest vassals, thereby to assure them of the victorie, and that they should not hope for any succor.

Answere was made vnto them, that they had better occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to trust vnto the Princes mercie at this present, then vnto their owne forces: and hauing by interpreters long time discoursed with <hi>Axalla,</hi> they demanded eight daies respit, wherin they might aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise the kings brother of the estate of their affaires: and that if they were not succoured within fifteene dayes, they promised to yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, so as it would please the Prince, to keepe them in the same fidelitie that the kings of China had kept and maintained them. <hi>Axalla</hi> made answere, that he had charge from the Prince to receiue them vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>position, and to make them proue all gentlenesse as soone as they had yeelded vnto his mercie: but for preuenting of so long delay, for that the Prince was in person within the countrie, he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>end and impart this vnto him, and beseech him for the same: and attending therfore, they should in the mean time deliuer hostages for this purpose, and that from this time forward he did graunt them truce, vntill the Prince had signified therein his pleasure. Thereupon
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10494:47"/>
               <hi>Axalla</hi> dispatched one of his faithfull friends of his countrie vnto the Prince, to carrie vnto him these good newes: the which was more welcome vnto the Prince, then the ouerthrow he had giuen vnto the enemie, and agreed vnto all that <hi>Axalla</hi> demaunded, referring all vnto his sufficiencie and fidelitie, and relying thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he would marke what the kings brother meant to do. After this last disgrace he was determined, if the enemie did not retire, to passe ouer the riuer, and to pursue him euen vnto the sea coastes. Three or foure dayes being spent the Prince tooke aduise for to passe ouer the riuer with his horsemen, but not to aduance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further then 3. or 4. leagues beyond the water: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he meant to hinder the kings brother from attayning vnto the riuers foord, hauing receiued aduertisement that he would passe ouer for to succour <hi>Quantoufou.</hi> As soone as the enemie vnderstood newes of the passing ouer of our army, it did greatly astonish him, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon retired ten great leagues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, bending towards the sea side into a hillie countrie, and vneasie for our horsemen, where he thought to find place of securitie for his armie, and where the same might be intrenched within the mountaines. And there at leasure he tooke aduise of the greatest about him, to determine what offers they might make vnto the Emperour, as well for the kings ransome, as also for to assure that which yet remained, &amp; for to make a peace, the which must needs be had, were it by gold or siluer, seeing that bloud could doe no good therein, which had not beene spared: that there was no more to be done, and that the goddes were offended. Therefore it behooued with them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> they for to fauour him, and we to serue him: and hauing sent to demaund safetie for to

He caused 30000. men of war to enter thereinto vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was money de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered for to maintain the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there, vntill such time as all the footmen shold receiue pay for 3. moneths due vnto them, whereof the inhabitants of <hi>Quantoufou</hi> did fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the Prince, to the summe of eight hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Tentins, the which do amount vnto foure hundred and fifty thousand crownes or therabout. The Prince at this present sent me vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> whom I found feasting of his Captaines and souldiers, staying for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement that I brought vnto him, the which was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine within <hi>Quantoufou,</hi> and to cause all his footmen to set forward directly vnto him, the which was done by the Prince, to the end it should strike a greater terror into the minds of the enemies, who seeing all his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men arriued, he supposed they would nothing doubt (<hi>Quantoufou</hi> being taken) but that he would march forward, insomuch as he hoped this would greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his affaires, considering the estate they were in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I returned from <hi>Quantoufou</hi> vnto the Emperour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing seene a beautifull and great Citie, well fortified, and wonderfully peopled, and round about it there was a fruitfull countrey. Our armie had beene two monethes and a halfe before it, and I thinke we should haue continued there one monethes longer: for therein
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10494:48"/>
was no want of any thing but of men, because many of them had beene slaine since the siege beganne. This was the cause wherefore the Princes brother would haue conducted some thither, &amp; was the occasion that made him aduance forward. Many of our men were also dead by reason of the intemperatenesse of the aire, and the heat of sommer the which we had passed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our men had not bin accustomed: so as those soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which we looked for were necessarie for vs to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance forward, if wee purposed to attempt any other thing. <hi>Axalla</hi> who remained therein, emploied all the paines he possibly could, to repaire the walles, and to winne the inhabitants good will vnto the Prince: for not one of them was departed with the Gouernour for to serue the king of China, he leading with him out of the citie, but thirteene thousand, of thirtie thousand souldiers, some beeing dead, the other remaining with the inh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bitants vnarmed, for to receiue the law of the conquerour. It was a thing very worthie the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their new Lord, who was to commaund them, to marke so great lightnesse and inconstancie in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting so soone him which had maintayned them, he and his auncestors by the space of two hundred yeares with great pacience and quiet, and preserued their wealth in great prosperitie. This is the cause that they which gouerne common-wealthes ought to thinke, that the peoples good will is certainely to be esteemed: but withall, they must not too much trust therunto. This was the cause that <hi>Axalla</hi> marked that, saying that hee was troubled to deuise how this great multitude might be contained in their fidelitie, if wee should receiue any disfauour, and commanded me to speake vnto the Prince, for to treat before his Armie
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10494:49"/>
were any more decayed, and after that it was very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie his wisdome should consider how to assure this citie in his absence, the which was so peopled, and the people thereof being so light and inconstant. Now as I haue said, there was almost a yeare spent since we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan this enterprise, and our men were greatly dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: the fall of the leafe also drawing neere, the which for the most part doth yeeld euill fruit vnto armies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their trauels, by the changing of humors, the which engender sicknesse. And this appeared alreadie within our armie, which caused the Prince to consider of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things; and not without cause, he doubted also some change within his owne countrie, the which long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences do often cause, the honour being no lesse in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing of that alreadie gotten, then in conquering of the same. Our Prince also did neuer refuse honourable conditions, the which he did more esteeme being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by peace then warre. He thought that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest consisting of almost halfe the kingdome, and in making the king tributarie for the rest, he should haue sufficient wherewith to bridle him, if at any time hee should deale badly, and would thereof be well aduised: and especially he hoped to assure the same so well, as their lightnesse should be throughly punished, at what time soeuer they would vse it. He did thinke it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient if they came vnto profitable conditions for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, euen as the conquered doe yeeld vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, for to resolue himselfe to border his conquests on this side. Thus the Embassadors being arriued, who were of the kings chiefest vassals, <hi>Tamerlan</hi> receiued them with all human<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tie, causing his greatnesse to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto them, and therewithall the agilitie of his horsemen, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> see with their eyes, that it would
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:10494:49"/>
be the destruction of the <hi>Chinois</hi> name if he proceeded<note place="margin">An Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from the king of Chinas brother vnto Tamerlan, to treat for peace &amp; the kings deliuerance.</note> any further. So hauing saluted the Emperor with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, they vttered their Embassage vnto him, which was that the kings brother had sent them vnto him to treat for two causes: the one, was for the liberty of their king, the other, for preseruation of their country; that he had vnderstood of his accustomed humanity; that themselues would make triall thereof, rather then to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the Gods of their ingratitude towards the <hi>Chinois,</hi> repenting themselues that they did not satisfie our iust demands at the first comming of our army; that they wold pay for it, the which was reasonable, and therfore, they came to receiue the law of him, seeing he was the conquerour, and that nothing they should opposse against him, could cut off his good happe, they must needs be one of his limits vnto posterity. The Prince ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard them, the same being declared vnto him by Interpreters, hee answered them, that they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to trust vnto his mildnesse, because that was alwaies<note place="margin">The answer of Tamerlan vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors.</note> more for the benefit of them that would trie it, then were his armes, and that the same was before any force offered vnto them, the vse of the one being more agreeable vnto him, then the other; but the endes of the warres, were for the most part enterprises for to come vnto peace, and to make those vnderstand reason, that refused the same: but seeing at this present, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it, he would yeeld thereunto. And this was the first word of curtesie he wold pronounce at their first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: it belonged now vnto them to offer the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wherewith he would acquaint his counsell. Thereupon the Prince rose vp, &amp; caused to be sayd vnto them, that they shold deliuer their offers in writing, &amp; that present answer should be made thereunto. Thus went they out
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10494:50"/>
of the Princes presence with great ioy, and as it were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of peace, and to recouer their former prosperities. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions which they offered were, to leaue <hi>Paguin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou</hi> &amp; all the country beyond it, with all the fortresses of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains; that they wold pay al the charges of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, since the day of answer made vnto his Embassadors; that they wold giue two millions of gold, for their king. This being prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto the Lord, he made answer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,<note place="margin">Conditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan &amp; the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois.</note> which was; that he wold keep that which he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered within the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, the which was his owne iustly, seeing his arms had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it vnto him; that he wold haue the riuer where he was now encamped to be his frontier, stretched vnto <hi>Hochioy, Tahaucezug, Cauchio, Lulun,</hi> euen vnto <hi>Poschio</hi> bordering vpon the sea; that the king of <hi>China</hi> should pay vnto him yearly three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand crowns, the which shold be deliuered at <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> for acknowledgment of submission vnto the Empire, as well for his successors as himselfe; that they should pay fiue hundred thousand crownes in ready mony for the charge of the army; that the king of <hi>China</hi> should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, and all the <hi>Chinois</hi> prisoners shold pay ransome vnto particular men that took them, except those which caried the name of kings, who should pay one hundred thousand crowns for peace with his armes; that no <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> should be kept as slaue, nor sold for such hereafter, being vnder the Princes obedience, that trafique and entercourse of Marchantes should be free betweene both the nations; that the king of <hi>China</hi> should deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his brother as prisoner, and two kings named, with twelue principall men of the countrie for assurance, who should come yearely with money for assurance of the peace. Behold the Emperors answer &amp; his resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but alas the armes of the <hi>Chinois,</hi> and their forces, were
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10494:50"/>
so weakened, that they were yet glad to heare that they should be suffered to inioy that which yet remained, they accounted al things so certaine by lost, considering the ill haps which on euery side did ouerwhelme them: their best men were dead, and they which remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished. The flower of their best me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of war, with their king taken, two battels lost, and the two principall Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis of the kingdome taken, and the hardest passages wonne: so as they did see nothing but a certaine destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the conntry, if they came againe vnto the triall of armes. The king whose captiuity did greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them, could not be recouered but by peace, they were also aduertised, that great store of new forces mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forward to refresh our army, so as they did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect nothing but their certaine destruction. Therefore they accepted of such conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of peace as pleased the conqueror, hoping that time would bring againe vnto them their auncient liberty, and that for a time it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed them to beare with patience the yoke of their bondage. Now the Prince had sent two thousand horse, to fetch the king of <hi>China,</hi> to the end that being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, he might sweare to the peace solemnly, the which hee hauing performed at <hi>Quantoufou,</hi> whither the Prince caused him for to come, he brought with him vnto <hi>Paguin</hi> all the pledges, and amongst the rest, the kings eldest sonne, and his brother. The king being departed for to performe his promise, according to the treatie by him confirmed, hee was receiued, and as it were worshipped within his countrie, with all the ioy that might bee. In the meane time the Emperour, after he had prouided for the assurance of his newe conquest, hee left <hi>Odmar</hi> there to gouerne them, and gaue vnto him an estate of thirtie thousand
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10494:51"/>
horse and fifty thousand footemen, to furnish all the fortresses and strong places, the Prince hauing led with him, many of the new conquered people, desiring to haue them for to dwell within his country, and to send other Colonies in their places, to assure himselfe the better of the lightnesse of this people, hauing noted them to be inclined vnto nouelties. He gaue in charge vnto <hi>Odmar</hi> to make his principall abode at <hi>Quantou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fou,</hi> and to fortifie well the passage: and also comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a fortresse to be made at <hi>Dermio,</hi> the better to strengthen his borders: and after he had left him all thinges necessary, he recommended vnto him the<note place="margin">Odmar left Gouerner of China for Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan.</note> seruices of that Lord, who had manifested vnto him his great affection. The Emperour hauing well tried his faithfulnesse in his affaires as they fell out, he cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him a brother of his, vnto whom he gaue great gifts within <hi>Sachetay.</hi> Then we turned our faces straight vnto <hi>Cambalu,</hi> hauing aduertized the great <hi>Cham</hi> of the happie successe of our affaires, wherof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sayd, he had lost the oportunity of vtterly rooting out the <hi>Chinois:</hi> but they do nothing consider, the difficulties therein as yet remaining, and that we must sometimes content our selues with the meane,<note place="margin">A good aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisment vnto Conque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Prince remained in deed king of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> holding in his possession, two of the fairest and greatest Cities of all the whole Countrie, hauing an hundred good leagues thereof vnto himselfe, and many
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10494:51"/>
lesser Cities, hauing extended his borders vnto a riuer, by which he might go vnto the enemy, but they could not come vnto him without passing ouer the same: hauing good meanes to keep it and with aduantage. The king of<note place="margin">The tribute paid by the king of China vnto Tamerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fiue hundred thousand crownes year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> 
               <hi>China</hi> moreouer was his tributary of fiue hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand crownes yearely, and hauing the meanes at such time as he would not performe it, to be within the space of foure and twenty houres within his country, and he could not come into his: so as it was much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to make this honourable treatie, then tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously to seeke for to subdue all, &amp; to put vnto fire and sword a whole natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who willingly cast themselues into his armes as tributaries. Now the Prince desired aboue all that the idols which were within his conquest, should<note place="margin">Tamerlan cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all the idols within his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to be beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of one God.</note> be beaten downe, and commanded the worship of one God, establishing the same after the forme of his owne country, for he made account that in short time all wold be reduced vnto our customes. But the <hi>Chinois</hi> were not of that mind, &amp; their patience was founded vpon hope of recouering by that meanes their former liberty: but they did not weigh, that the Princes foresight had bene such, that he had left there the most wise and sufficient Captaine that was in his kingdome, who wold not lose any occasion by his watchfulnesse to assure his affaires. When <hi>Odmar</hi> left the Prince, as the custome is, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himselfe too much. The Prince in lifting of him vp, sayd vnto him; I see well now that thou art a <hi>Chinois,</hi> seeing thou wilt worship me euen as they do their king: the worship I require of thee, is the remembrance thou shalt continually haue to do my commaundements, desiring thee to establish in my newe conquest, the honour of God, and after that, my authoritie through your faithfulnesse: you knowe this estate

better then I, call to thy rememberance that the sword hath conquered them, and not loue or good will: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hope not to haue them assured, whom feare retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and not any loue, I recommend my seruice vnto thee. I did neuer see the Prince in greater griefe then now at his departure: but he was driuen of necessity to employ the faithfulnesse and wisedome of <hi>Odmar.</hi> So our army wherein was much sicknesse, began to march, and on the third daie hauing newes of forces which came towards vs, the Prince sent them a commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not to come any further forward, and that they should march straight vnto <hi>Cambalu,</hi> where the Prince did sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to find the Emperor his vnkle, who had set forward towards that place to haue the good hap for to see him, being determined to receiue him at <hi>Cambula</hi> with mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence &amp; triumphs, as he wel deserued. Now I wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by the way, how <hi>Odmar</hi> being seuered from vs, all<note place="margin">Tamerlan turned his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vnto Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla.</note> the Princes fauour was turned vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> vnto whom he committed the whole charge of his army, in so much as <hi>Axalla</hi> although he was alwaies in great reputation, notwithstanding the same was much increased by the Prince at <hi>Quantoufou,</hi> where the Prince did trust him with the army, in so waightie an enterprise as that was, and the which he so gloriously atchieued: likewise the maner of entring into the kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences he had: so as the report of his valour did flye throughout all the Empire. <hi>Calibes</hi> led the vantgard, and <hi>Axalla</hi> was in the battell neare vnto the Emperour, who gaue him the chiefest place, bestowing vpon him<note place="margin">Two hundred thousand crownes of yearely rent giuen vnto Axalla by Tamerlan.</note> two hundred thousand crownes yearely, for to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his ordinarie expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. Now he for his part had no desire to leaue his maister at quiet, being desirous to draw him backe againe into his countrie, to the ende
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10494:52"/>
he might afterwards moue him to enterprise some great matter, the which might redound as well vnto the glorie of his maister, as the quiet of the Christians, of whom hee was verie carefull, whatsoeuer was the cause thereof. Thus after certaine dayes iourney, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued newes, of the Emperours ariuall at <hi>Cambula,</hi> the Prince hauing left his army in a faire countrie for to winter, where he dismissing many of our souldiers, we arriued within foure leagues of <hi>Cambala,</hi> whither all the Princes of the Emperours Court, came for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him, together with al the principal inhabitants, for to gratifie our Prince for his happie voyage.

He gaue a present vnto the Emperour his vnkle, of all the richest cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and fayrest horses he had wonne.

The Emperour was verie desirous to see his daughter: he caused her chariot to be vncouered, and caused her to enter into his: but the Prince remained on horsebacke, whom the eyes of all the people could not be satisfied with admiring. The Prince presented <hi>Calibes</hi> vnto the Emperour, and

But on the other side also, the Prince vnto whom rest and ease was already become tedious, egged forward also by <hi>Axalla,</hi> with the increase of his glorie &amp; name, being desirous of this enterprise, did not cease vntill the Prince did send him vnto <hi>Sachetay,</hi> for to giue beginning vnto the assembling of forces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all parts, to the end that about the spring time he might march forward.

Neither will I here omit a dreame, which our Prince had the night before he<note place="margin">Tamerlan his dreame.</note> departed from <hi>Cambalu,</hi> which was, that he did see as he thought, a great multitude of reuerent men, who put forth their hands vnto him, requiring his succour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the violence of certaine tyrants, who did afflict them with sundry kindes of tormentes: he sayd, that he did neuer see more reuerent countenances, and that some of them were apparelled in white, and others in cloth of gold, some hauing as it were crownes of gold vpon their heads, and it seemed vnto the Prince, that he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hand, &amp; lift them very high.

commaundement to leade his auantguard, and <hi>Calibes</hi> the ariere-ward, being accompanied with farre greater forces then euer he had in any of his armies: for they came vnto him from all parts. The <hi>Chinois</hi> Lord was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced by <hi>Odmar</hi> to go with 20000. men of the subiects newly conquered, being desirous to shew him self vnto the Emperour, as also for to learne our maners &amp; fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The absence &amp; separation of our maister was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto none but <hi>Odmar,</hi> not for the feare of the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> his neighbours, but verily for the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of fortune. The Prince hauing sent him word of his purpose, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the same, &amp; amongst other things, he sent word vnto the Emperour, that he should hope for all good successe therin, seeing he was created by God for to cast down the proude &amp; raise vp the humble: the Prince also did mislike of nothing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cruelty.

Now this was the verie reason that moued the Emperour to oppose him selfe against the same, thinking it much better to go and set vpon them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their new conquestes, then for to stay vntill they were come nearer vnto him, and should come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate their quarrell within his Empire vnto his domage:<note place="margin">A sound deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration.</note> a sound deliberation; for the same tendeth vnto two ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, the one is that it destroyeth the enemies countrey, and the other, that any disfauour comming vnto him, his countrey receiueth not thereby any astonishment, so as this enterprise was greatly for his aduantage.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10494:55"/>
vnto the old Emperour then vnto his maister, who did often reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the daungers &amp; the braue enterprises he had executed in the affaires his maister had, as well against the <hi>Moscouites,</hi> as at the rebellion of <hi>Cambalu</hi> &amp; <hi>Catayo,</hi> &amp; in the last conquest of the kingdome of <hi>China:</hi> so as his authoritie was great, with this, that he was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and humaine, and friendly towards euery one, and who spake dayly vnto his maister of great matters, and alwayes propounded vnto him honorable enterprises, whereunto he would be the first to set his hands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sparing the hazard of his life at all. And although our Emperour was accompanied with great renowmed Princes, yet were they no bodie in comparison of the vertues and the greatnesse the which <hi>Axalla</hi> had gotten with his maister, whether it were in pompe, in libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and in furniture of slaues and horses: for hauing a a great mind &amp; sharpe wit, he made vse thereof politike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maintaine him self. Moreouer he neuer gaue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell the which he did not offer to execute, and he was happy for that they had successe according to his desire, which procured him great authority; but he had a grace<note place="margin">The comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prince Axalla.</note> beyond all this: for he was humble vnto euery body, the which made him well beloued, in humbling him selfe (in such greatnesse) euen vnto the smallest. I was one day in a place when the Prince did reprehend him for this so great mildenesse. He answered him, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed vnto his maister to be stately, but for me it is my trade to play the slaue and seruaunt, and as greatnesse doth well beseeme you, so doth humilitie me, for I am not about you but for to honour you: for if you be honored I shalbe also. Also how humbly soeuer I carrie my selfe, what neede you to care so as I serue you well? if I should be stately, I should be odious vnto the great

men of your Court, and I should seuer them from you. I will haue them honor me, for seruing well of you, &amp; not for my countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. This answere did greatly please the Emperour, &amp; it was a cunning to cause him to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the which fel out happily for him: for they honored him more then he would. Now for to come againe vnto the Princes purpose, we will for this time leaue <hi>Axalla,</hi> whose nature I was willing to expresse vnto you, the which shall serue to giue you vnderstanding of manie things, that shalbe declared of him within this historie. So the Emperour sent vnto <hi>Axalla</hi> to come vnto him at <hi>Samarcand,</hi> for to receiue directions from him for the setting forward of his armie. Now hauing left by the Emperors commaundement the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> to commaund, he came vnto him, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sulted with him of the order for his army: and hauing resolued that it was best to passe by the borders of the <hi>Moscouite,</hi> to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly vnto <hi>Constantinople</hi> the seate of the Greeke Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, whither they sayd the armie of <hi>Baiazet</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the Turkes did march, being alreadie come downe into <hi>Asia Minor,</hi> there was a kinsman of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xallas</hi> dispatched, for to assure the Emperour of Greece of our armies comming forward, and that great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of victuals was made from all parts for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the same.

There did the Emperour cause all his armie to be payed, and a generall muster was made. He had newes also there of the forces that the <hi>Moscouite</hi> did send vnto him: he likewise caused an infinite quantitie of victuals and the most part of his furniture to be conueyed by the sea of <hi>Bachu,</hi> there being some twentie leagues where was<note place="margin">Bachu.</note> want of water and victuals, through the which our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie must needes passe, causing all things necessarie to be caried by water, the which was a great commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto vs: and there was a commaundement giuen at all the shoares of the sea, that they should bring all the vessels for to carrie the munition of the armie: so as this foresight did greatly ease our army.

Vnto this place came the Embassadors of <hi>Guines,</hi> vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:10494:58"/>
whom the Prince did greatly reuerence for his holinesse. The saide Embassadors offered on the behalfe of their maister, all assistance and ayde vnto this enterprise, and brought faire horses vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour the which their maister had sent vnto him, with assurance of good successe in his enterprise: for<note place="margin">Guines a great Astrologian.</note> this foresaid <hi>Guines</hi> did prophesie, and was a great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologian. The Emperour seemed greatly to honour this Embassage, and sent vnto the saide <hi>Guines</hi> great store of rich furres, and vessell of gold, &amp; whilest we soiourned in that place, the armie made a generall mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and were payed, as well the horsemen as the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Prince hauing made an oration vnto them) as his custome was, at such time as his souldiers made their generall muster) and informed them the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he would haue obserued in the fight, to the end they might obserue the military discipline, whereof he was verie curious with his Captaines. And also vpon this same day it was permitted vnto euerie souldier<note place="margin">The custome of the Tartarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans towards their Emperor.</note> for to behold him with more boldnesse then on other dayes, for as much as he doth for that time lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his Imperiall Maiestie, to humble himselfe, and become familiar, so farre foorth as to exhort his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers vnto vertue. So the Emperour after he had caused generall prayers to be published, wee departed from <hi>Bachichich,</hi> and they reckened that there was in our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my three hundred thousand horsemen, &amp; fiue hundred thousand footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of all kinds of Nations. The Emperor was aduertised that the <hi>Ottomans</hi> were become masters of all <hi>Greece,</hi> in so much as the Emperor was of opinion, that <hi>Baiazet</hi> would passe ouer into <hi>Europe,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shold perceiue that he approched: at the least wise the reason of war made him iudge that he wold do so: but it fel out
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:10494:59"/>
farre otherwise: for as soone as we had gone beyond the <hi>Georgians,</hi> and were come vnto <hi>Buisabuiche, Axalla</hi> whom the Prince had not seene in eight dayes, because he ledde the head of the armie, came vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, knowing verie well, that he could not bring vnto him more acceptable newes then hee did bring, the which was that <hi>Baiazet</hi> had raised his siege for to come and defend his new conquest, and that it was a most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thing, that he was resolued to come vnto a day of battell: that he had caused all his forces to come out of Greece, as many of them as he could drawe from all partes, trusting not vppon the multitude, but rather in the boldnesse and experience of his souldiers, who were well trayned vp in the warres. This did greatlie reioyce the Emperour, but yet it was not with insolencie of vaunting, but rather with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a personage, who iudged the euentes of battels to be ordinarily doubtfull. And hee sayd, that<note place="margin">Tamerlan his saying of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels.</note> a small number well conducted, is oftentimes victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. We soiourned three dayes at this <hi>Buisabuiche,</hi> and we caused our souldiers continually to aduance forward, and to passe ouer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> for to find bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes to maintaine our armie vppon the spoyle of the enemie in attending their comming, rather then vppon our owne selues, or on our Allies. From that place the Emperour did dispatch vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour his vnkle one of the greatest fauourites he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, for to certifie vnto him of the deliuerie of this noble Citie of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and how the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> came fully resolued to giue battell; and for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent dangers, he gaue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement that they should keepe the borders strong, &amp; all his forces on horseback vpon the enemies side: for often times as in prosperitie

all your neighbours do smile vpon you, and encline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you: so whensoeuer an ouerthrow happeneth, euery one setteth vpon you, &amp; do help to spoile you. For<note place="margin">A good aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement for Princes.</note> this cause shold wise Princes assure well that which they do alreadie possesse, least the victorious enemie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing his good fortune, take from you the meanes to raise your selfe vp againe. Our Emperour had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes this wisedome, when such blowes happened, for to aduertise his countries to stand vppon their guard, rather then to publish vnto them his victorie. So wee departed from thence after the Prince had assembled all the principall men of his armie, to impart vnto them his purpose, and for to receiue counsell of them, the which his courtesie did vse of custome, that made him to be beloued. For the farther you were from him then did hee most honour you: there were so manie seuerall Nations within our armie, so many Captaines sent vnto him for his succour, and then was the time when he principally was humble, and layd aside his grauitie, feasting them for the aide and succour they gaue vnto our armie. Amongest the straungers this Chinois Lord did ordinarily receiue great honour of the Prince, who was alwayes wont to say, that the vertue of <hi>Axalla,</hi> and the loue of this Lord towards him, had made him Lord of the fairest kingdome of Asia. The Emperour was verie desirous to acquaint and instruct this Lord with the manners and fashions of those people by whom we passed, for he was alwayes neere vnto the Emperours person; and all the forces he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted vnto our armie, wherein the Prince made shew to put great confidence; they had marched with vs these two monethes, and carried themselues very well, as all our other forces did, victuals being there in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10494:60"/>
great plentie, that which gaue vs so much thereof, was the great iustice therein obserued. So our armie came vnto <hi>Garga,</hi> where it passed the riuer <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> the auantgard at <hi>Chinserig;</hi> and the generall mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the armie was appointed to be at <hi>Gianich,</hi> the which did yeeld it selfe: and there had wee newes that <hi>Baiazet</hi> his armie was neare vnto vs, within some thirty leagues, which caused vs to march more close. All the cities yeelded, the Emperor receiuing them graciously, and those which refused obedience, were cruelly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, especially such inhabitants as were Turkes, but the Christians set in full libertie, vnder the name of the Greeke Emperour <hi>Emanuell,</hi> whom the Emperour would wholly gratifie, <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing receiued this commaundement from the Prince: so he caused them<note place="margin">The causes of Tamerlans warre against the Turkes.</note> to sweare fidelitie vnto <hi>Emanuell,</hi> his purpose beeing to set him againe into his Empire, and to punish this <hi>Baiazet</hi> for being so rash, as to enterprise to destroy so flourishing an Empire, as that of the Greekes his Allies. Now the Emperours quarrell was iust against this proud lightning from heauen, especially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his execrable cruelties hee vsed against all sexes and ages, vsurping an Empire the which had sought all possible meanes to make peace with his Armes: but he soone broke it, and falsified his faith vnto this poore Emperour, according as he found the meanes by litle and litle, to vsurpe almost all from him, there remaining no more vnto him, but some small townes belonging vnto his Metropolitan Citie, the which he had also besieged. It was then an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, for the Emperour to deliuer this noble Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from such great tyrannie, an Empire so famous in the world, and a citie so auncient, out of the hands
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10494:60"/>
of so wicked and accursed an off-spring. This was the cause that made the Emperor to hope for to haue God, his great God for an helper in this enterprise. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beginne, I am desirous to speake a word of the vprightnesse of the Princes cause, and also for to note the worthinesse of his courage, in giuing helpe vnto the weake, and punishing of the proud, representing by such deedes, the image of the diuinitie, the which should be marked in Princes, in vpholding the weake ones, and those that require succour against such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. So God being with vs, the armie fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with ioy and hope, we departed from <hi>Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich. Axalla</hi> who was in the auantguard, hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded foure thousand Parthian horse for to get<note place="margin">Foure thousand Parthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> horse sent to descrie.</note> knowledge of the armie, vnder the charge of <hi>Chianson</hi> Prince of <hi>Ciarcian,</hi> commaunding him to put all vnto fire and sword, and also to bring word vnto him of the place where <hi>Baiazet</hi> was, and what countrie that was beyonde <hi>Sennas;</hi> and if hee could learne anie thing thereof, he should make relation thereof vnto him. This Captaine was of great reputation, and next vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> he had the commanding of the auantgard in his absence: this man sent before him a Parthian light-horseman with fiue hundred horse. So hee had not ridden tenne leagues, but they heard newes of the armie, and hauing surprised <hi>Sennas,</hi> they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood there the estate of the Turkes armie, the which was at <hi>Tataya,</hi> and marched forward. The which being certified vnto the Emperour, commandement was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them, not to retire from that place, vntill they did see the arriuall of the enemie, and thereof to giue aduertisement euerie houre: the Prince deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to passe on no further, hauing seene a faire
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:10494:61"/>
plaine, and a countrie of aduantage for the order of his battell: for he knew that he had to deale with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expert in warres, and which were accustomed to fight against the Christians, who are verie actiue and war-like people, who wanted not the knowledge of war-like stratagemes. They knewe also, that his armie was greater then <hi>Baiazets:</hi> but it was yet of diuerse parts, so as it behooued to be well aduised, for it was not against the Chinois soft and effeminate people, but against souldiers, well acquainted with all manner of fights that are to be fought. Then the Emperour did not omit any vigilancie for to keepe his aduantage, <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> was sent for by the Emperour to come and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie him for to view the said place, and to consider whether it would be for his aduantage, and to haue his aduise. This place is between the sea &amp; <hi>Gianche</hi> on the side of <hi>Se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nas</hi> bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of one side with a litle riuer which runneth into <hi>Euphrates.</hi> And he was aduised to keepe <hi>Sennas</hi> as long as he could possibly, and sent word vnto those which were within the same, to set it on fire when as they shold withdraw themselues from thence, to the end that the enemie shold not haue a desire to encamp therein: but should come forward nearer vnto our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into these plaines, the place which we desired to fight in, because wee were stronger in horsemen then the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> Thus behold this great armie of <hi>Baia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> encouraged vnto the battell, who thought to haue surprised our men within <hi>Sennas,</hi> but as soone as they drewe neare, our men set it on fire, and the greatest part retiring, there remained some hundred horse to performe the same, who retyred themselues in verie<note place="margin">A stratageme.</note> great disorder. Now the Prince of <hi>Ciarcan</hi> had deuided his men into two troupes, &amp; giuen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement vnto
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10494:61"/>
the first troupe, that as soone as they perceiued the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to pursue the hundred horse, they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, and retire iointly together. Now hee had the rest of his power in a valley neere vnto a wood, and hauing suffered some two thousand of the enemies horse, Turks auant-currers to passe by him, he charged them behind, and fought with them, they not fighting but flying as soone as they did see themselues pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: many were slaine, and manie were taken prisoners. This was the first time we fought, and carried away the victorie: all the prisoners were sent vnto the Prince, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest the Bassa of Natolia, who led this troupe, of whom the Emperour earnestlie demanded, what caused <hi>Baiazet</hi> so litle to esteeme him, as to shew so great contempt of his Armie, and that hee should find that he was well able to punish his pride. The other answered, that his Lord was the Son of the earth, that<note place="margin">A proud an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a Bassa made vnto Tamerlan.</note> he could not indure a companion, that hee surely was astonished, how he from so far had enterprised so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a iourney, to hinder the fortune of his Lord, in whose fauour the heauens did bend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, because they were not able to withstand him, that all the rouud world did subiect themselues vnto him, and that hee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted great folly in going about to resist the same.<note place="margin">Tamerlans reply vnto the Bassa.</note> The Emperour answered, I am sent from heauen for to punish his rashnesse, and to teach him that the proud are punished of God, whose principall action is to cast downe high things, &amp; to raise vp the lowly: at the least yet I haue already constrained thy maister to raise his siege from before <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And moreouer, thou hast already felt (although I lament thy mishap) what the valour of my Parthian horse is against thy Turkish. Doest thou think (changing of his speech) that thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10494:62"/>
doth come to bid me battaile? The Passa answered, yea, assuring you that there is nothing hee more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: and I beseech you that I may acknowledge your greatnesse in giuing me leaue to assist my Lord at this Battaile. The Emperor said vnto him; I giue thee leaue, go and tell thy Lord that thou hast seene me, and that I will fight on horseback in the place where he shal see a greene ensigne. The Bassa did sweare, that next vnto his Lord he vowed his seruice vnto him. Then hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and declared vnto <hi>Baiazet</hi> how hee had seene <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> reciting vnto him all that he was willed to declare. Of this (said hee) I will make triall, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue he will acknowledge his follie before the match be ended. The Bassa did not forget to publish ouer all, the mildnesse of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> his greatnesse, and curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, declaring that he did so farre extend his curtesie, as to giue vnto him a verie faire horse, although he might well thinke that it was to fight against himselfe. So the next day <hi>Baiazet</hi> his Armie drew neare vnto the sight of ours, the which marched two leagues: and wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped within a league the one of the other. All the night long you might haue heard such noise of horses,<note place="margin">How Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans army pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the night before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Turke.</note> as it seemed the heauens were ful of voices, the aire did so resound, and euery one was desirous to haue the night passed, for to come each one vnto the triall of his valor. Vnto the Scithian nation, the which is desirous of goods, they propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the great riches they should get by the victory ouer the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> Vnto the Parthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nation ambitious of rule, the honor and glory of their nation, being conquerets of them, who only were able to take from them the Empire of Asia. The Christians who made the fourth part there of, assured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to conquer their greatest enemie. Behold how euery one
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10494:62"/>
spake during the night time, according to his humour. The Prince this night went through his Camp hearing all this, &amp; was very glad to see the hope that euery one of his soldiers did conceiue already of the victorie; &amp; I being neere him, and he did me the honor to tell mee, that at the time he fought the battaile against the Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couit, he did heare all the night long all kinds of songs, the which resounded in his Campe, seeing in a maner no bodie sleepe: I hoped then (said he) to haue some good hap, and I trust to receiue the like nowe. Now after the second watch the Prince returned vnto his lodging, and casting himselfe vpon a carpet, he meant to sleepe: but the desire of day would not suffer him for to sleepe; hee then commaunded me to giue him a booke, wherin he did reade: therin was contained the the liues of his fathers and grandfathers, and of other valiant knights, the which he did ordinarilie reade: he called me, hauing light vpon (in reading) the discourse of a battaile that his grandfather had lost against the Persians, the which he had thought to haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (very vndiscreetly) hauing assaulted his enemie, many aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages being propounded vnto him, whereof he might haue made good vse, all which he neglected, trusting vnto his owne valor and that of his souldiers. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ended his speech, he commanded me to reade the same before him, and said vnto me, I alwaies reade this<note place="margin">Tamerlan his custome before a battaile.</note> before I begin a battaile, to the end I shold not so much trust vnto the Lyons skin, wherin I wrap my arme, that I shold not serue my self with the Foxes, to wrap ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with my head: for thus (said he) my gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather was in a place of adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, &amp; he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out of it to seek his enemy, who was lodged stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly, &amp; what soeuer his men said to him, he went on headlong, shutting his eares against
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10494:63"/>
all the counsell and aduise of his seruants, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of me whether it were day, hee caused the great Chamberlaine to be called, and commanded him to to cause his trumpet to be sounded, and that his horse should be ready: and hauing a litle slumbred, he gaue commandement that <hi>Axalla</hi> should be sent for, who came vnto him with other Lords and Captaines, the chiefest of the Armie, with whom after he had consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the order of his battaile. Hee mounted on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and sent euerie one for to make themselues rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to do the like: at the same instant he receiued newes that the enemies Armie marched forward, and came to take his ground for the battaile. The Emperour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see him march, that according to his order hee might marshall his owne: and hauing caused three thousand horse to aduance forward, vnto whom he had giuen in charge to beginne the skirmish, himselfe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced forward to lodge euerie man in such places as he had fore seene to be most for his aduantage. Now he seeing the Turkish footmen march, whom they do call<note place="margin">The maner of the march of the Turkish footmen.</note> Ianizaries, the which were placed in the middest, and vpon the two fronts, two great squadrons of horsmen, the which seemed to be thirtie thousand horse, &amp; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which aduanced and couered the batallion of the the Ianizaries. He thought this order to be verie good, and hard to breake, and turning himselfe vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> who was neare vnto him, hee said, I had thought to haue fought on foote, but it behooueth me this day to fight on horsebacke, for to giue courage vnto my sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to open the great Batallion: and my will is, that<note place="margin">The order of Tamerlan his battaile.</note> they come forward vnto me as soone as they may: for I will aduance forward an hundred thousand footmen, fifty thousand vpon each of my two wings, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10494:63"/>
of them forty thousand of my best horse. My plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is, that after they haue tried the force of those me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they come vnto my auantguard, of whom I will dispose (&amp; fiftie thousand horse more) in three bodies, whom thou shalt command, the which I will assist with foure-score thousand horse, wherein shal be mine own person, hauing an hundred thousand footmen behind me, who shall march in two troupes; and for my Arier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fortie thousand horse, and fiftie thousand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who shall not march but vnto my aide. I will make choise of ten thousand of the best horse, whom I will send into euerie part where I shall thinke need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full within my Armie, for to impart my comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Ouer the first fortie thousand the Prince <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arcian</hi> commanded: ouer the formost footmen was the Lord <hi>Synopes,</hi> a Geneuois, kinsman vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> and he which was his Lieutenant ouer the footmen, a Captaine of great estimation. That ouer which the Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> commanded, consisted of fiue squadrons of horsmen. <hi>Baiazet</hi> his Armie seemed faire and great, which was aduanced continuallie forward towards vs, who stirred not one whit from the place of the battaile. There were indeed many light horsmen, as wel Scithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Parthians, as Moscouites, who left their ranks, and shot arrowes, and brake lances betweene the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. There was a spie who brought word that <hi>Baiazet</hi> was on foot in the middest of his Ianizaries, where he meant to fight, that hee did not forget to mount on horsebacke, giuing order ouer all for the wants of his Armie: but purposed to fight in the middest of those Ianizaries, who are a number of trustie men, brought<note place="margin">What the Turks I ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries be.</note> vp in exercises from their youth to all maner of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and chosen out of all nations, the fairest and stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:10494:64"/>
men, so as they are inuincible. By this bringing vp the which they haue had together, they do fight with a great force and courage for their Prince and Lord, who being in the middest of them, they are as in a halfe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle within the Armie. Now they were thirtie thousand men in this order, wherein <hi>Baiazet</hi> put his principall hope: he had many other footmen, but gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all sorts. His battaile of horse was verie faire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting vnto the number of an hundred and fortie thousand horse, well exercised in all maner of fightes. The Soldan of Egypt hauing aided him with thirtie thousand <hi>Mammelues,</hi> very good horsmen, and with thirtie thousand footmen. Their Armie in that order seemed almost as great as ours: for they were not so knit together as we were, our forces being directlie one after the other, and theirs all in a front. So the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Armie aduanced forward continually with an infinite number of cries, and ours was in great silence. After that common prayer was ended, the Emperour himselfe aduanced continually forward, beholding the first charge giuen, and caused <hi>Axalla</hi> to set forward after he returned into his order, continually exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his men before he left them. There could not be seene a more furious charge giuen, then was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the <hi>Ottomans</hi> vpon the Prince of <hi>Ciarcian,</hi> who had commandement not to fight before they came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: there could not haue bene chosen a fairer plain, and where the skilfull choise of the place was of lesse aduantage for the one then for the other, but that we had the riuer on our left hand, the which was some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage for the Emperour, hauing giuen commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in any case they should not lose the same, &amp; that the enemies, whatsoeuer came thereof, should
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:10494:64"/>
not win it: this he did for to haue the aduantage of the hand in fight. The Emperor, who aboue all Maximes<note place="margin">Tamerlan his principall Maxime of warre.</note> of warre, did vse to deale in such maner, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie might be the first assaulter; he had straightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were appointed for the first charge, to suffer the enemie for to giue the onset. Nowe (as I haue already declared) this young Prince of <hi>Ciarcian</hi> with his fortie thousand horse was almost wholly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, hauing fought as much as he could, but he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred<note place="margin">The battaile betweene Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iazet.</note> euen into the middest of the Ianizaries, where the person of <hi>Baiazet</hi> was, putting them in disorder, where he was slaine. About this time <hi>Axalla</hi> set vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the Aua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tgard, where as he was not in any such danger; for hauing surprised one of the enemies wings, he cut it all in peeces, &amp; his footmen comming to ioine with him, as they had bene commanded, he faced the Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the Ianizaries. The Prince seeing the charge <hi>Axalla</hi> had vpon his arme, sent ten thousand horse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his battaile for to succour him, and knit together the maine battaile of <hi>Axalla,</hi> and to giue once againe a charge vpon another Batallion of footmen, the which did shew it selfe, and came toioine with and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that of the Ianizaries, who behaued themselues valiantlie for the safetie of their Prince. This fight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued one houre, and yet you could not haue seene anie scattered, fighting resolutely the one against the other. You might haue seene the mountaines of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses rush one against another, the men die, crie, lament, and threaten at one yerie time. The Prince had patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to see this fight ended, &amp; when he did perceiue that his men did giue place, he sent ten thousand of his horse to ioyne againe with the ten thousand appointed for the Arierward, and commaunded them to assist him,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:10494:65"/>
at such time as hee should haue need thereof. At this verie time the Emperour chargeth, and made them giue him roome, causing the footmen to assault, ouer whom the Prince of Thanais commanded; who gaue a furious onset vpon the batallion of the Ianizaries, wherein was yet the person of <hi>Baiazet,</hi> who had sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a great burthen. But the multitude, and not valor, did preuaile; for as much as might bee done in fight, was by the Ianizaries performed, for to preserue the person of their Prince. But in the end the horsemen, wherein was the Emperors person, gaue a new charge, and his Auantguard was whollie knit againe vnto him, he renewed another forcing, and was fullie victorious.<note place="margin">Tamerlan his notable victory obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Baiazet wherin he was taken prisoner.</note> 
               <hi>Baiazet</hi> hauing retired on horsebacke out of the troupe of Ianizaries wounded, fell aliue into the hands of <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla,</hi> vnto whom he yeelded himselfe, supposing it had bene <hi>Tamerlan:</hi> then <hi>Axalla</hi> seeing him so followed, (being for a time not knowne but for some great Lord of the <hi>Ottomans</hi>) twentie thousand horse did not fight at all, but only in pursuing the victorie, and they made a great slaughter. The Prince had his horse slaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him with the blow of a lance, but he was soone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted againe on horsebacke. This day the wisedom of the Emperor gaue the victorie vnto his souldiers:<note place="margin">Tamerlan his wisdom the cause of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in performed.</note> for the iudgement which he had in tyring of the strong forces of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> was the safegard of his. For if all had gone vnto the battaile in one front, surely the mutitude had put it selfe into a confusion: but this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of aiding his men made euerie one profitable. The Emperor iudging (like a great Captaine) of the need that euerie one of his souldiers had, so that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding was the getting of the victory. They accounted threescore thousand men slain of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:10494:65"/>
and twentie thousand of ours. The Prince of <hi>Tirzis</hi> was slaine as I haue said: the head of the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians slaine, <hi>Calibes</hi> was verie sorrie hee had so easie a reckening in his Arier-ward, being very couragious, and a gentle knight: the Despote of <hi>Seruia</hi> was taken prisonerer, who did accompanie <hi>Baiazet,</hi> and was a Christian: they gaue him this day of battaile much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. The Emperour gaue vnto him verie good entertainment, reproouing him, for that he did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie <hi>Baiazet</hi> against him, who did come in fauour of his Emperour. He answered him, that it was not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his dutie, but the prosperitie of <hi>Baiazet,</hi> vnto whome it seemed, that all the world did bend for to subiect it selfe vnto him, and that his safetie had caused him to set forward. The Emperor presentlie therupon gaue him leaue to depart at his pleasure. He tooke care to get into his hands <hi>Baiazet</hi> his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that <hi>Baiazet</hi> should bee cured, and after brought before him: who at such time as he was there,<note place="margin">Baiazet brought before Tamerlan, with his pride.</note> neuer made any shewe of humility. The Emperour saying vnto him, that it lay in him to cause him to lose his life; he answered: Do it, that losse shall bee my happinesse. And demanding of him what made him so rash, for to enterprise to bring into subiection so noble a Prince as was the Emperour of the Greekes. He answered him, the desire of glorie and rule. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doest thou (said the Emperour vnto him) vse so great crueltie towards men, so farre foorth that neither thou nor thine do pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either sex or age? This do I (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered he) to giue the greater terrour to my enemies. Then said the Emperour, so shalt thou receiue the like reward: and causing him to bee conueyed againe out of his presence, he turned vnto his followers, and said,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10494:66"/>
behold a proud and fierce countenance, hee deserueth<note place="margin">Tamerlan his saying of Baiazet.</note> to be punished with crueltie, and it is necessarie that hee bee made an exemplarie punishment to all the cruell of the world, of the iust wrath of God against them. I acknowledge that God hath this day deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into my hands a great enemy, we must giue thanks vnto God for the same: the which was performed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet day: for the battaile was wonne at foure of the clocke, and there was as yet fiue houres of day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. The children of <hi>Baiazet</hi> were brought before him: he caused them to be vsed curteouslie, and as the children of an Emperour. The next day he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the dead to bee buried: they found the Prince of <hi>Tirzis</hi> dead in the middest of the Ianizaries, where he remained enclosed. The Emperour did greatly lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t this young Prince, who was his kinseman, and would haue bene one day worthie for to do him great seruice. In that battaile there-died manie Captaines, &amp; almost all the chiefe of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> This was a great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, the which was fought from seuen vnto foure of the clocke, in such sort that they knew not vnto whom the victorie did incline. Our Armie stayed vntill the next day, euery one causing his friends to be buried. The Prince of <hi>Tirzis</hi> was embalmed, and conueyed with two thousand horse vnto <hi>Samarcand</hi> vntil the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour returned. All the other dead bodies were buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Sanas</hi> with all the honour that might be. <hi>Axalla</hi> was much grieued for his kinsman, because hee was verie well beloued of the Prince: his charge was giuen vnto one of his brethren who was verie famous; in fighting this same day, wee might iudge the euents of the matters of the world. Behold this Emperour <hi>Baiazet,</hi> who was, as he thought, superior to fortune,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:10494:66"/>
which in an instant found himselfe and his estate by one battaile onlie ouerthrowne euen vnto the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est place, and at such time as he thought least there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. He vsed to say, that he was iustly punished, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising the multitude we had, for the assurance that hee had in the valour of his horsmen, and especially of his Ianizaries. Hee was three dayes (as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port)<note place="margin">The despaire of Baiazet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner.</note> before he could be pacified, as a desperate man, seeking after death, and calling for it. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did not vse him at all curteouslie, but caused small account to bee made of him: and for to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that he knew how to punish the proud; vpon fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiuall dayes, when as he mounted on horseback, they brought this proud man vnto him, and hee serued<note place="margin">Baiazet Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlans foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoole to mount on horsebacke.</note> him in steed of a foot-stoole: this did hee for to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the follie and arrogancie of men, and how iustlie God had humbled him. The next day the Prince marched directlie towardes <hi>Bursia,</hi> whither all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of <hi>Baiazet</hi> his Armie was retired, with the Bassa <hi>Mustapha.</hi> All the countrie yeelded vnto vs, and the Prince caused all the holdes and fortresses to be ouerthrowne and destroyed, and punished all those which were so euill aduised as to stay vntill they were besieged. I had forgotten to declare, how hee caused the Prince of <hi>Tirzis</hi> bodie to be accompanied with diuers prisoners chained &amp; tied together, whom he did send vnto <hi>Samarcand,</hi> the which the Prince had determined to make great, for a perpetuall memorie of his greatnesse. Euen so had hee greatlie peopled it<note place="margin">Tamerlan his pollicie for to encrease his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Samercand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> with people of China, which had bene taken in the Battailes, and of those likewise which were taken out of the two great Cities, <hi>Paguinfou,</hi> and <hi>Quantoufou.</hi> Nowe this battaile did bring great astonishment
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10494:67"/>
vnto all the countries possessed by <hi>Baiazet,</hi> and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die resisted vs, euen vnto <hi>Bursia,</hi> whither this armie was fled, and therein were also two sonnes of <hi>Baiazet</hi> verie young. <hi>Axalla</hi> being alwaies aduanced forward before our Armie, with fortie thousand horse, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand footmen without anie carriages, who hindred the enemies from ioyning themselues againe together: and he made a cruell warre vpon the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> deliuering the Grecians from the tyrannie of<note place="margin">Axalla cruell against the Ottomans for the deliuery of Greece.</note> 
               <hi>Baiazet.</hi> He approched neare vnto <hi>Bursia,</hi> where the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomans</hi> did not stay the comming of <hi>Axallas</hi> Armie, but only they which could not run remayned behind. <hi>Baiazet</hi> his two sonnes were sent vnto the Greekish Emperor for to bring them vp, &amp; to haue mercie vpon them; the rest went vnto <hi>Gallipoli,</hi> for to go vnto <hi>Andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoli,</hi> the which they held, hauing conquered it from the Grecians. Now the Prince (for to returne vnto my purpose) dispatched towards the Emperour his vnkle, and vnto the Empresse his wife one of his familiars, called <hi>Lieban,</hi> Captaine of his chamber, for to carrie<note place="margin">Presents sent by Tamerlan vnto the great Cham his vnkle</note> him newes of this victorie, and to ioyne it also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the rest. Hee sent vnto him <hi>Baiazet</hi> his sword and bowe, and the caparisons of his horse, the which was esteemed to be worth aboue two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand duckats. You may easilie thinke that Prince <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eban</hi> was well entertained of the olde Emperour, and of the young Princesse, bringing word vnto them, that all the world did bend it selfe to make our Prince victorious, who surely receiued these victories from God without insolencie, &amp; at such time as he sent him most glory, then did his men note him to bee least puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp. Hee was neuer bolde, but in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and on the eeue for to commaund seuerelie, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10494:67"/>
with greater maiestie. To tell you what hee was in aduersitie, I did neuer see him in that estate: but it is to be thought, that they which be not insolent in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, are not faint-hearted in aduersitie. So our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Prince marched directlie vnto <hi>Bursia,</hi> loaden with spoiles and Trophees which he daylie got, departing from the Cities which did come and yeeld themselues vnto him; therein obseruing the same manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the which we did in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quest of China; they which did yeeld vnto him without fighting, were well vsed, and the obstinate well punished, the Prince know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that reward and punishment are the moderators of common-wealthes, the one to be vsed towards the good, and the other towards the euill. In the end we receiued newes by <hi>Axalla,</hi> that hee had receiued <hi>Bursia</hi> in the Emperors name, and how the inhabitants therof had punished the garrisons of <hi>Baiazet,</hi> hauing driuen them away, and slaine manie. He sent word also vnto the Prince, that the Embassadors of the Greekish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Emanuel</hi> were come vnto him, the most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable persons of his Court, and that he had staied them from passing any further. The Prince sent word, that they should stay for him in that Citie: so we arriued in short time, and all the inhabitants of the Citie came to meete the Emperour bare-headed, in token of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: and the Prince entered into <hi>Bursia</hi> with great magnificence. <hi>Axalla</hi> with the Embassadors came to meete him, whom the Emperor receiued with all the honor that might be, and shewed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, and the order of his Armie, whereat they wondered: for our Armie resembled a Citie, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that was therin, the which did bring vnto vs plenty of all kind of victuals &amp; marchandize. The Embassage
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10494:68"/>
of the Greeke Emperour was, that he submitted all his<note place="margin">The effect of the Greek Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Emb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Besides, the so many vertues &amp; rare gifts, which made his name famous throughout all the world inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, did bind him vnto the same; that he would attend him in his chief citie, for to deliuer it into his hands as his owne, and all the Empire of Greece, ouer which he commanded, to cause the same for to obey him. Nowe the Greek Embassadors looked for no lesse then to fall into bondage, thinking that to be so great which they did offer, &amp; a morsell so delicate, that it would not bee refused, especially of a conquering Prince, as was <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan;</hi> &amp; that accepting therof in mildnesse &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, was the best bargaine they could make therin: but they receiued answer far otherwise: for the Prince with<note place="margin">Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> worthy answer of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan vnto the Greek Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.</note> a mild countenance answered them; that hee was not come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so far a cuntrie, nor had taken so much paines to conquer countries; that it was too base a thing for him to put himselfe into so great trauaile and dangers, but rather to win honor, and thereby for to make his name famous and glorious vnto all the world: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10494:68"/>
would hee make it well appeare, that hee was come to aide him, being requested as a friend and allie, the which had happie successe. That his vpright mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therein was the greatest cause that God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from aboue his power, by the which he bruised the head of the most fierce enemie vnto mankind that was vnder heauen: &amp; for to get him now an immortall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and eternall name, he would make free so great and flourishing a citie, gouerned by so noble and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent a house; that with his courage he had alwaies faith ioined, the which wold neuer make so great a breach in his reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it shold be reported of him, he came<note place="margin">The worthy mind of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan.</note> to help as a friend vnder the pretence to inuade the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of his Allie; that he would haue the seruice he had done ot the Greek Emperors engrauen in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the posterity, to the end they might wish well vnto him and his successors, by remembring that he had done good vnto them; that he contented himselfe to carrie away the honor and glorie thereof; that long might he liue to gouerne his estate; and that before his departure he should consider so well to establish him, as that hee should not fall againe into so great ieopardie, that hee deliuered into his handes the two sonnes of <hi>Baiazet,</hi> to do with them as he should thinke good; that he should be wise and prouident in well aduising himselfe hereafter; that his good will should be alwayes most fauourable towards him. You may easily iudge what ioy these Greekish Princes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, hearing the Emperor pronounce these words, full of so great clemencie, who for that he would not be seene to breake his faith, refused an Empire offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, and the most stately and magnificent Citie of the world. I do thinke there bee few Princes
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10494:69"/>
that would performe such a part, so bee there likewise but few <hi>Tamerlans</hi> in the world. <hi>Axalla</hi> had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from the Prince to feast these Embassadors, and to do them all the honor that might be: one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was sent vnto the Emperour to carrie him these newes, who looked for some cleane contrarie: but hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued word thereof, then was the time to make bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires<note place="margin">Bonfires made in Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople for the worthy answer receiued from Tamerlan.</note> within <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the oportunitie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce with all kind of pleasures. The Greekish Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour hauing assembled his Counsell, to know whether hee should not go vnto him and giue him thankes, it was so resolued on by all the Princes of the Court. So the Emperour was aduertised of his iourney, who was verie glad thereof, and euen vpon the first dayes iourney <hi>Axalla</hi> was sent by the Emperour for to certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him of the ioy that he conceiued to haue the good hap for to see him, as also for to conduct him euen vnto <hi>Bursia,</hi> whither the Emperor vnderstanding the Greek<note place="margin">The meeting of Tamerlan and the Greek Emperor at Bursia.</note> came, went to meet him, and with all kinds of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificences, they were one whole day together. The next day the Greekish Emperour tooke his leaue of the Prince, who did accompanie him out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Nowe the Emperour had as great a desire as might be, to see this so famous a Citie, as was <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> but he would not goe thither but as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate person; the which <hi>Axalla</hi> handled without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king anie shew thereof, desiring to be receiued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into priuately by the Greekish Emperour. The which<note place="margin">Tamerlan his secret going to Constantinople</note> was accomplished with all the familiarity possible, and therein was no rare and excellent thing which was not shewed vnto the Emperour. The Greekish Prince ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aduised himselfe of all the meanes to doe him pleasure, &amp; vnto all them which did accompanie him,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:10494:69"/>
who were in a manner all apparelled after the Greeke fashion, insomuch as they were greatly astonished to vnderstand that we had bene there. The Greeke Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was curious to shew vnto our Emperour all the faire gardens, the which be all along the sea coast, a league or two from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and hee conducted him in priuate companie, so as fiue or sixe dayes were spent with all the mirth that might be possible. The Prince would often say, he had neuer seene a fairer ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; that this was indeede the citie (considering his faire and rich situation) which ought to commaund all the world. He wondered at the costly buildings of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">The rare things in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</note> the faire engrauen pillers, the faire Pirimades of wonderfull height, the which the Emperour <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> had caused to be brought thither out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the making of the faire gardens: and he was wont to say, that he did nothing repent him of his voiage, for that he had preserued from fire and bloud, so noble a Citie as that was: he greatly commended the mildnesse and courtesie of the Greeke Emperour. Now the Greeke Emperour knowing the Prince very curious for faire<note place="margin">The Greeke Emperor gaue vnto Tamerlan faire horses.</note> horses, he gaue vnto him thirtie of the fairest, strongest, and readiest that might be gotten, with the most rich cloth of gold, and excellent silke that could be seene. The Greeke sent likewise to gratifie all the Princes and Lords of the armie with presents, and caused all things to be deliuered vnto them, the which he thought to be necessarie for the armie. So as hauing rested almost fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes, we beganne to thinke vppon the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of our purposes: and after a straight friendship was sworne betweene the two Princes, our Emperour determined before he returned, to make the <hi>Soldan</hi> of Egypt know his power, who had giuen ayde vnto <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iazet</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:10494:70"/>
against him, to the end that all the world should know, that he was milde and courteous vnto his friends, and vnto his enemies terrible and fearefull. So we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Bursia,</hi> hauing deliuered the same into the handes of the Greeke Emperour, and hauing driuen out all the <hi>Ottomans</hi> out of all the fortresses, and hauing left the Greeke Emperour in the same liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hee was before our armie came, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now in Asia that tooke the <hi>Ottomans</hi> part, vnlesse he had gotten vnto the mountaines or passed ouer into <hi>Europe,</hi> so fearefull was our armie become by the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie obtained against <hi>Baiazet. Andronicus Paleologus,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew vnto the Greeke Emperour, followed our Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror with ten thousand horse, the which the Greeke Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror deliuered vnto him, for the warre which he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised against the <hi>Soldan</hi> of Egypt, with whom he had often fought. Now for to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish the Emperors good hap, he receiued newes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his court, that the Empresse<note place="margin">The Empresse deliuered of a goodly boy.</note> was deliuered of a goodly boy: for the which were made bonfires, and great reioycing in the Army. He had also newes how all was quiet in his estate, and the old Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror his vnkle in good health, the which was one of the things did most comfort him: for he feared especially least the old Prince should die in his absence, &amp; by this meanes some trouble might arise within his estate, by some great men, and certaine fauourites which were neare vnto the old Emperour. Notwithstanding they which had played the fooles in his absence, were so well punished, that (as I thinke) others should take thereby example, &amp; it is a generall rule, that after a Prince hath once his weapons in his hands, there will be no great reuolting in his absence, nor nouelties within his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, how farre soeuer he be seuered. For first and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

all the seditious and ambitious fellowes, do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily follow him vnto the warre, and moreouer he that is on horsebacke is feared. On the contrarie part, whensoeuer a Prince is softly and effemenate, his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which are not employed, do go vnto him that hath any discontentment, or rather who is desirous of raigning: so as the Prince being found vnarmed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath made an Armie, and gathered together his garrisons, the seditious haue alreadie plaied well their parts, and the mischiefe hath entred very farre. There were sixe moneths passed since we departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Samarcand,</hi> and it grieued many that the Emperour would not returne into his countrie: insomuch as this being declared vnto the Prince by <hi>Axalla,</hi> it was thoght conuenient the Prince should againe reuiew the order of his armie, and should speake vnto his souldiers, causing a generall reuiew to be made of his armie, and that this same might giue them the greater cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for to endure all discommodities for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Prince. So being come vnto <hi>Calestria,</hi> a generall reuiew was commaunded, the Prince being himselfe there in person, where hee spake first vnto the Parthians in this manner: I can not beleeue my<note place="margin">Tamerlan his oration vnto his souldiers at Calestria per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If you be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in following my glorious ensignes, remember your selues, how it may be reported, that <hi>Tamerlan</hi> your
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10494:71"/>
Emperour hath finished his victories through the valor of another Nation, &amp; not by his own: &amp; consider what reproch you shall bring vnto ours, renowmed by so great successe obtained against so many and sundrie warlike people. You my souldiers, whose reputation flieth through all the world, shall I beleeue this of you? I will not, neither ought I to beleeue it: therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and let vs go and assault the <hi>Mamelues,</hi> who you know of long time haue opposed themselues (how farre soeuer from vs) against our happinesse, hauing ioyned themselues vnto the <hi>Ottomans</hi> for our destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Would you that I should punish their rashnesse without you? Would you that the Scithians and my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, should haue part in my victories, and in the meane time, you should go rest your selues, and lose the glorie alreadie gotten? The Prince had no sooner made an end, but they all cryed with a loud voice, that they wold liue and die with him, and as they followed him into China, so would they also follow him throughout all the world: but they besought him to haue regard vnto their woundes, to comfort their old age, and that he would giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hope of rest: the which the Prince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised vnto them. Vnto the others the Emperour spake nothing at all, for they were very glad to haue this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer the Parthians, in perceiuing them willing to returne, insomuch as when the Prince came to passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scithian horsemen, they all cryed in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: Victorious Emperour what doest thou? march forward, for we will follow thee. The which did greatly content the Emperour. Now the Parthians and Scithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<note place="margin">Tamerlan his care of his sicke soldiers verie commendable and imitable.</note> were the principall forces the Prince had in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: now the Emperour did nourish wisely emulation betweene them, which of them should best manifest his
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10494:71"/>
faithfull affection. The Pince commanded that the sick and wounded should be viewed throughout all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and that the Treasurer of the wars should distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute money among the companies, ouer and aboue the ordinarie pay due vnto euery souldier: so our armie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and in the auantguard with <hi>Axalla</hi> was placed <hi>Andronicus</hi> together with him, for to leade the head of the armie: and it was reported vnto the Emperour, that the <hi>Soldan</hi> of Egypt prepared forces from all parts, for to resist the power which came against him, but hee knew that he should haue much to doe, and that it was very hard to stoppe a victorious armie, wherein there were such a multitude of men, who had ouerthrowen the strongest and most warlike Monarch that was in all Asia. Insomuch as this gaue a great terror vnto the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melues.</hi> But the <hi>Soldan,</hi> who commanded ouer them at that present was a young Prince, who had bene chosen for the great vertue and courage which was in him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then for his great experience in war like affaires, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as he had not as yet since his election shewed his affection, and as litle his valour vnto his subiects: he had indeede his courage puffed vp, by seeing himselfe through this choise Lord of many great cities well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,<note place="margin">The Soldan his braue reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> so as he resolued to be ouerthrowen brauely. In such sort as he put his hope in the winning of a battell, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which what chance soeuer did happen, he might retire himself at any time into a place of such adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, that he might haue the means to hazard again another, and hope thereby for a reuenge. Whereof the Emperor was aduertised, &amp; after he had conferred with <hi>Axalla &amp; Andronicus,</hi> for to be aduised whither he should direct the head of his army, for to constraine the enemie the sooner to come vnto battel: it was in the end concluded
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10494:72"/>
that he should passe by <hi>Caramania,</hi> directly vnto <hi>Geuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lache,</hi> the which was the first citie of the <hi>Mamelues</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, being one of the <hi>Soldans</hi> frontier townes which did separate him from the Turke, euen there where the peace was sworne betwixt them, the which <hi>Baiazet</hi> had sought, to the end he might haue aide fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then himselfe thereby against the army which came vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. So this place was well defended by the <hi>Soldan,</hi> and it was well fortified: <hi>Axalla</hi> aduancing forward his auantgard did summon the same to yeeld, or else they shold receiue the iust reward of their rashnesse &amp; folly. They made answere, that they were children of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; had commandement to die therein. And that willingly they would there endure vntill death for their Prince &amp; country. This wilfulnesse put the Prince into great choler (who since he departed from his kingdom, had not seene any one place which brought not to him their keies twentie leagues off before he came vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to see a meane citie dare to stay his comming, &amp; for to prepare to let his army. The which the Emperour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, he commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to march on, &amp; to lodge neare <hi>Aleppo:</hi> the which he summoning, did yeeld it self, hauing no other then the inhabitants within the same. The Prince in the mean time, prepared himself vnto the siege, whereto hauing caused his footmen to march, &amp; his artillery to bee planted, there was an assault giuen, which was brauely defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> within, &amp; there were of our men slaine to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of 1200. The Emperour greatly stirred, determined to assault the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once againe, &amp; hauing giuen a fresh assalt, wherin the Prince of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi> was wounded, our men lodged vpon the wall, and leauing no respite vnto them within, they killed a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Prince vnderstanding that the <hi>Soldan</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:10494:72"/>
had promised the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aide, whereof he was well aduertised, and did certainely know that he marched forward, he supposed that he had committed a fault, in causing <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> to aduance so farre, so as he determined to set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ouertake him, hoping by that meanes to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the enemie, who came directly towards <hi>Axalla</hi> for to fight with him. But the enemie did not looke for him so soone: so hauing left all his cariages behind at the siege, where the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> remained with thirtie thousand men only, the rest he caused to march with him without any baggage vnto <hi>Bogras;</hi> thither did <hi>Axalla</hi> send him word that the <hi>Soldan</hi> had passed the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at <hi>Confincan,</hi> and that he came for to aide the besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and it was reported that hee had 74000. horse, and an hundred thousand footmen. Now the Emperor being arriued at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> vnderstood where the enemie was, &amp; determining with himselfe to surprise him, he caused <hi>Axalla</hi> to aduance forward with his auantgard, himselfe staying halfe a day, and then presently he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his auantguard. <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing set forward some fifteene hundred horse, they were encountred and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all slaine, he not being able to aide them as he desired, by reason of the vnfitnesse of the countrie, and iudging that they were compassed about, he did not assist them. Now the enemies thinking to deale with none but those which were at <hi>Aleppo</hi> led by <hi>Axalla,</hi> they came forward vnto the fight ill aduised: so as <hi>Axalla</hi> had them vpon him before he supposed; he aduertised the Emperor to come forward, &amp; sent him word that he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto the battaile, but that he would dally with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie as long as hee could, to the end hee might haue leasure to draw neare and assist him, and that he would not faile to chuse his place of battel as much as he could
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10494:73"/>
for his aduantage, whilest he looked for him, he set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward presently twenty thousand horse with speed vnder the leading of <hi>Calibes.</hi> In the meane time the enemie by reason of the place which was narrow, &amp; a valley wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his men could not march, but in single ranke, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced not so soone: the which <hi>Axalla</hi> supposed, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he would haue retired, but in the best manner he might vnto the Emperor. So he determined to chuse a place for the battell, &amp; to make his men for to fight in small troups, to entertaine the enemy in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming down the mountaine, perceiuing that his purpose was to take his place for the battell at the foot of the same mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain. This sport endured 2. or 3. houres, vntill <hi>Calibes</hi> came with 20000. horse for the assistance of <hi>Axalla,</hi> who had also full 30000. more, <hi>Andronicus</hi> betweene 8. and 10. thousand, the most part Albanois, who were good hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: he requested the first charge, the which <hi>Axalla</hi> did grant vnto him, being loath to discontent him; in the which hauing fought valiantly, &amp; ouerthrowen &amp; slaine many of the enemies, hee was one of the first that was slain, for want of being aided by his men. A Prince sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of such a courage, as did much grace him, and who verily in this his youth, did follow the honour &amp; nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the bloud of them from whom he was descended. <hi>Axalla</hi> assisted him with all his power, who were in a manner all Parthians or Christians in the Princes pay, who gaue a great shocke vpon the <hi>Soldans</hi> troupes, and passing through them, he found directly before him all their footmen, he busied himselfe in fighting with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: in the meane time a troupe of fiue &amp; twentie thousand<note place="margin">A battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan of Egypt and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror Tamerlan.</note> horse did set vpon Prince <hi>Calibes,</hi> they say, that therein was the <hi>Soldan</hi> himselfe, who fought the one against the other very obstinately, and in this meane space
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10494:73"/>
               <hi>Axalla</hi> fought with these footmen, which hee leauing halfe ouerthrowne sounded a retrait, and seeing Prince <hi>Calibes</hi> hardly beset, he went directly towards him, and perceiuing the place where the enemies had the greatest aduantage &amp; his men the worst, he charged this maine power on the flanke; which 15000. horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seeing, who were behind these footmen, whom the <hi>Soldan</hi> had commanded that they should not fight but vpon need, they came vpon <hi>Axalla</hi> on that side he had giuen his charge, &amp; setting furiously vpon him, they fought a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time, so as he was wounded, his horse slaine vnder him, &amp; himself taken prisoner. Which being reported<note place="margin">Axalla taken prisoner.</note> vnto the Emperor by one that fled; he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming forward with as much speede as he could, was greatly vexed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his chiefe confidence in this Captaine. This caused the Emperor to make the more hast, who if he had not come in so good time, that day had made an ende of his good fortune: but hauing commanded 10000. horse to aduance before him &amp; giue an onset, he assisted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with 25000. of his most faithfull horsemen, hauing vpon his wings 20000. horse of his aiders. The <hi>Soldan</hi> did not see this maine power, by reason of the valley they came in, &amp; he was greatly astonished for to behold the rest, during the time that Prince <hi>Calibes</hi> &amp; <hi>Axallas</hi> men did fight. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in an instant 10000 horse which set vpon the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melus,</hi> who were almost maisters of the field. The Prince also aduanced forward with all his footmen &amp; horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The <hi>Soldan</hi> not being able to resist so great a force, he sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded a retrait, finding the falt he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, seeing all the whole army vpon him. Now <hi>Axalla,</hi> being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by him who held him prisoner, was on foot, &amp;<note place="margin">Tamerlan his victorie ouer the Soldan.</note> he was mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted againe on horseback: his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was but a small matter: the Emperour followed the victory three

leagues. It is reported, that the <hi>Soldan</hi> had bene thrise mounted on horseback during the battell, so well did he performe the duty of a good souldier &amp; captaine, but the fault he had committed was great, for he did not marke that all our army did not follow. We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mited another fault also, in so much aduancing forward our auantgard, which was like to haue cost vs deare: for had it not bene for the art <hi>Axalla</hi> vsed, the Emperor had neuer come in time to assist him: but we may say that fortune the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris of all did bring to passe, that our faults were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten turned into stratagems of war, so great hap did acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany our Prince: so his comming was the victory of his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Behold how this war was much shortned against the opinion of many: for it was knowne how the <hi>Soldan</hi> was counselled (&amp; wisely) to draw this war into length, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he could not shun his ill hap. Our Armie could not lie in one place for the great multitude, &amp; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try being also in many places vnfruitful. These newes being come to the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> at <hi>Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach,</hi> and he making the same knowne vnto the enemies, they were greatly astonished, as soone had he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Prince to punish the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well for their rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to put all vnto the sword, without any mercy, to giue terror vnto those which would wilfully resist his forces, and also he wold haue it to be an example vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others: which was done, being won by assault, their courage failing them, by reason of the losse their men had receiued, as also for that the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of their souldiers was much diminished by the fight giuen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> night &amp; day. The Prince wold not returne back againe, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> came &amp; ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him, not hindring <hi>Axalla</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing forward with the horsemen of the auantgard, to the end that the

               </hi> Captaines of great estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the <hi>Soldans</hi> cariages were the next day taken, wherein was great riches.

He sent also some for to carrie newes of his victory into all his kingdoms.

army. He trusted also that by this hauen victuals should come vnto him from all the parts of Greece, according as the Emperour <hi>Emanuell</hi> had promised him, and wherein he nothing failed him: vnto the which the Prince hauing made his entrie, there were left in garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son two thousand souldiers of the Emperour <hi>Emanuell</hi> his forces, and there he placed a Gouernour, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to take an oth of obedience, the Prince desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to become maister thereof, for to hold the <hi>Soldan</hi> thereby the more short.

The Prince hauing remained a space at <hi>Damieta,</hi> he caused his auantguard to march towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and hauing passed ouer the riuer, euen in an instant, he went directly vnto <hi>Caire,</hi> a thing which did greatly astonish the <hi>Soldan,</hi> who made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision for the defence of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> as soone as he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood these newes, he vsed so great diligence, that he entered thereinto euen as we approached the same, and he himselfe in person determined for to defend it, and for to keepe vs from passing ouer the riuer of <hi>Nilus</hi> for to go vnto <hi>Alexandria;</hi> they reported that the <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> entred thereinto with fortie thousand horse, and threescore thousand foot-men.

the same without doubt, the which was very euill newes for the aduancement of our affaires: for to remaine<note place="margin">The Sige of Caire.</note> long time before it was impossible for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vs to do, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the want of victuals: yet the Prince notwithstanding all this did not leaue to draw neare vnto it, and encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with all his army neare vnto the same, hauing cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a great trench to be made for to couer his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and thereby for to lodge his army the more safely. So the Prince during that time, caused diuerse onsets to be made, the which he did, both to know the enemies countenance, as also for to cause thereby slaues to issue out, who did bring vs newes in what estate they were, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom we alwayes had the better, and shut the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the city. Now it happened that the Emperor one day thought good to shew his army before the city, for to trie whether the enemiy had a desire to come vnto a day of battell, and to view what forces he had, and indeed to seeke occasion for to fight: he hoped also that if the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies did put out all their army, some reuolt would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen within the citie, as well by the slaues vnto whom li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was promised, as of many discontented with the insolencies of the <hi>Mamelus</hi> whom the <hi>Soldan</hi> had caused to enter with him. So the Emperour was betimes in battell array, but no body issued out, contrary to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. The Emperour in the meane while viewed the situation of the city, and shewed vnto them his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hauing certified the inhabitants that he sought not their destruction, but only of the <hi>Mamelus</hi> his enemies: so as the same being declared by certain slaues of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who fained to fly from our army, he be thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the meanes how to driue out the <hi>Mamelues:</hi> the which being made knowne vnto the Emperor by the slaues, he determined to aduance forward his foot-men within halfe a league of the city, and there to encampe the same
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10494:78"/>
determining so thereby the more to fauour the <hi>Mores</hi> enemies vnto the <hi>Mamelues,</hi> who promised to take arms in his behalfe. The Emperour hauing sent for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall leaders of his army, he propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnto them that which he had determined for to do, the which he did as well for to haue their aduise, as also if the same were concluded vpon, for to make them know his pleasure, and the order wherein they should march: and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto his Captains how he was come on a sudden before this city, not imagining the <hi>Mamulus</hi> shold enter into the same, knowing there being none but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants he might easily haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, &amp; out of the same draw co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities for the maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his army: but the sudden arriual of such an army did put great difficulties before his eyes. The first was that he could not long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine before the City, for the want of victuals, and the season by reason of the excessiue heat was very hurtfull vnto his men, for that they had not bene there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto accustomed; that he doubted least he going about to famish others, mortality should ioyne it selfe vnto the famine, &amp; so come into his army; that he had boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his enterprises vpon that part betweene the Cities of <hi>Caire</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and this being taken he would returne victorious into his countrie, and loaden with the spoyles of all <hi>Asia;</hi> that it were dishonourable for him to recoile before the enemies Armie with that victorie which he had obtained, a victorious Armie<note place="margin">Perswasiue reasons of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan for to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10494:78"/>
therin they had a great aduantage. But on the other side in number of souldiers he was much their superior, so as the forces being greater which he had, did counteruaile the enemies wals; and that he did not doubt but our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious arms already ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wold be a terror to make them fly before vs, as soone as we came to hand-blowes with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; that it was a thing whereon the enemy did not depend, in thinking himself inuincible by meanes of the tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches they had made within their streets, who do you thinke will arme themselues when as they shall see vs to set vpon them vnlooked for. I hold opinion we shall haue a happie ende: for it is a more honourable thing then shamefully to retire and shew our backes vnto the enemie, who haue so often seene our faces vnto their hurt. A thing which the great God hath granted vs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene these twentie years passed in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual warres against so many warlike nations, notwithstanding by you euen the Parthian name hath bene victorious. To be short, in doing of this we must by that meanes bury our reputation and all our victories, if we should retire this day shamefully from before this Citie, the which will come out after vs, hindring vs from victuals on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie side, and spreade a rumour of our disgrace, so as they which do now incline vnto vs, will make head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs, and they which do obey wil rebell against vs: &amp; if we hauing lost this occasion, wold bend our selues against them, they will presently run into their dennes, so as on euerie part we shall haue great difficulties. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise your selues herein, for there are but two waies; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raise the siege and retire before their armie, or else to assault them. The Prince by his speech made all the Captaines astonished, not knowing well which of the matches for to take, considering the waightinesse of the matter. This was also a fight which they had not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10494:79"/>
tried for to force an army within their wals, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they must preferre their reputation before death, and run into all hazardes. At the last the Prince seeing that none did speake, he commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> for to begin and to declare his aduise, who did rise vp, and<note place="margin">Consultation.</note> after he had taken leaue of the Emperour to shew his<note place="margin">Axalla his worthy speeche vnto Tamerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereupon.</note> opinion, he sayd aloude. My Lord, what is this thou dost of vs demand, hast not thou alwayes tried the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of thy Captaines and souldiers, prefering the honour of thy reputation, before their owne liues? What is it then thou requirest at our handes? leade vs against the <hi>Mamelues,</hi> &amp; thou shalt see whether the loue and true affection to thy seruice, and desire of the immortality of thy name be any thing diminished? Dost thou thinke (according to thy speech vnto vs) that the wals do hinder our valour, &amp; the force of our horses? The first horse of ours that shall put his head within <hi>Caire</hi> will giue entrance for all the Army <hi>Axalla</hi> had no sooner made an end of speaking, but all the Captaines cried that they might be led vnto the fight, &amp; that they were ready to die for the greatnesse and glory of their Prince. The Emperor hauing thanked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the maner of the order he would his army should march in: he deuided his footmen into three parts, the Lieutenant generall of the footmen marched with 30000. me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> had the head assisting him with 50000 footmen about his person, and all his horsemen after him, this day all the horsemen being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon his person, hauing giuen vnto <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> in whom he had his chiefest trust, the charge of the whole army, who was on foot. Now the Princes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was to take one of the Cities of <hi>Caire,</hi> &amp; there to encampe himselfe, &amp; so to aduance forward by litle and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10494:79"/>
litle fighting with the enemy. Now within the city the which was ouer against vs, was the <hi>Soldan</hi> encamped &amp; all his forces: he had 60000. footmen &amp; 50000. horse, wherof there were 30000 <hi>Mamelues,</hi> braue men, &amp; exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in warlike affaires, &amp; of whose arms we made tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the last war; as for the footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they were gathered together out of <hi>Arabia, Persia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Libia,</hi> with many slaues<note place="margin">The siege of Caire in Egypt by Tamerlan.</note> vnto whom he had giuen freedom, his experienced sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being ouerthrown in the last battell. The Emperor who had not declared any thing of the hope he had in the slaues &amp; <hi>Mores,</hi> did now vtter the same vnto <hi>Axalla.</hi> So after this conclusion was taken, the Emperor deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to giue an assault, &amp; hauing brought his footmen vnto the place where he would haue them giue the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, euen vpon the face of their enemies, as soone as he did see that they had set lustily vpon their trenches, hee commanded the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> to assault them with 50000 men: this was a furious fight. In the meane time <hi>Axalla</hi> went along by certaine palme trees, for that he iudged the enemy had forsaken that place, to go &amp; assist their owne men, as soone as they perceiued the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> to enter, wherein he was not deceiued: for hauing found but small resistance, he passed ouer the tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and hauing receiued co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prince that they should presently make rome for the horsemen to passe, whither (during the time he employed himself therein) the enemy sent 20000 men for to stop him; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did <hi>Axalla</hi> aduance forward, leauing 3000. of his men to make an end of filling vp the ditches, &amp; himself went to the fight; he found the <hi>Mamelues</hi> who fought on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, &amp; had almost beaten backe the Prince of <hi>Thanais.</hi> As soone as the way was made plaine, the 10000 horse set forward, who charged the <hi>Mamelues</hi> behind, where. the <hi>Solda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> himself was. Now the Emperor caused 10000
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10494:80"/>
more to aduance forward, after them he followed with all his power: then did the enemies retire vnto a second trench the which they had made in another City. The fight had continued ful the space of seauen houres, and it could not be iudged to which side the victory encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for they did couragiously defend their aduantages. But the Prince hauing in the end caused a retraite to be sounded, contented himselfe in hauing driuen the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies out of their trenches and won their lodging from them, hoping the next day to win all the rest: we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed a third part of the Citie, all the footmen lodging vpon the enemies trench, and there were continuall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults giuen, so desirous were our men to ouercome. There were slaine this day of the enemies, sixteene thousand men at the least, and of ours, betweene seuen and eight thousand. <hi>Draguen</hi> Lieutenant generall of the footmen was slaine with manie of his souldiers, for he sustained all the brunt of the fight, the strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme of warre vsed by <hi>Axalla,</hi> and his iudgement was for vs a great aduantage. The Prince about night ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aduertisment that the <hi>Soldan</hi> would retire, &amp; passe ouer the riuer, he foorthwith commanded ten thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d horse to lodge themselues that night for garding of the riuer bankes. But the <hi>Soldan</hi> thinking those to be all, the horsemen durst not passe ouer, hauing bene informed that the whole army was there. The break of day being come, the Prince caused them to begin to fill vp the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, &amp; to set his army in batel aray. The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> did once againe begin it, &amp; <hi>Axalla</hi> vpon an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side; but after they had fought, the <hi>Soldan</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for to make a retraite &amp; so to go out of the city. For these footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did so obstinatly presse on vnto the battell, and after he had performed his indeuor seeing our men
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:10494:80"/>
already maisters of the trenches, doubting lest he shold haue our horsemen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him likewise, he determined to go out and encamp himselfe all along the riuer, and to accomplish the purpose he had failed in the night. They determined to retire vnto <hi>Alexandria</hi> if he could passe ouer the water, and hauing withdrawne his men from the fight, as well as he could, he encamped him between the water and the City, for to passe ouer the same. As the Prince had passed ouer the tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, the souldiers kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and sacked all the whole city as conquerers. The<note place="margin">Great Caire won by Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Prince hauing present knowledge of the <hi>Soldans</hi> flight, setled himselfe to follow him with his horsemen, who onely were in order, and hauing knit together as he might, some of his footmen busied in the spoyle of the city, and being informed that the enemy passed the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with great diligence, he set forward directly towards him, for to stop him vpon a narrow cawsey, where were certaine marishes made for to stay the ouer flowing of <hi>Nilus:</hi> but the <hi>Soldan</hi> had opposed 12. of 15. thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men whom he called his slaues, to fauour his passage, who were his best souldiers, &amp; stood firmely, the place being greatly for their aduantage. Now our footmen with whom it be hooued vs to fight, were busied in pillage, and did come forward softly and vnwillingly, leauing the city the which others did spoile: so as the Prince was driuen to promise to regard especially and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their good seruice. Now as soone as they were come, they forced the enemies, but not without great<note place="margin">The courage of the Soldans men swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming euer the riuer of Nilus, with one hand, &amp; their weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the other.</note> losse, they seeing that they could not resist so gret a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and such a force, they cast themselues to swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and made an honourable retraite: for euery man had his weapons in one of his hands, and with the other hand swimming, did arriue vpon the other banke,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10494:81"/>
one part of the horsemen were cut in peeces, and the other drowned. This was the ende of the <hi>Soldan,</hi> who staying a long time (as it is reported) did busie himselfe in beholding from farre, how they did spoile this great city. Now when the night came vpon vs, hee thought our men should be sufficiently troubled in enioying of the victorie, without following of him. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,<note place="margin">The Soldan his speech vnto those about him after his ouer throw at Caire.</note> he sayd vnto his souldiers, in comforting of them, that they were not men which had conquered them, but rather some God, so great wisedome, force, and valour, did hee obserue in our souldiers.

And this was in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one of the chiefest occasions, that made the <hi>Soldan</hi> come thither with such diligence as he did.

Now the Prince after he had certified <hi>Calibes</hi> of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, who was all along by the riuer of <hi>Euphrates</hi> with his army, which daily increased, hauing taken many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it was a great astonishment vnto all Persia, &amp; there rained at that present time ouer those Nations a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of small kings, some of them obseruing the law of the Prophet, the other being Christians.

And referring the disposing of the affaires of Egypt vntil his returne from <hi>Alexandria</hi> vnto <hi>Caire,</hi> his owne person went vpon the riuer of <hi>Nilus</hi> for his pleasure, hauing caused all his armie to passe ouer vnder the conduct of the Prince of <hi>Thanais:</hi> and himselfe with a part of his<note place="margin">Tamerlan went by the riuer of Nilus vnto Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria.</note> souldiers determined to go by water, and causing an infinite number of boates to be prepared for himselfe, and those he caried with him, the Prince tooke great pleasure in beholding this faire riuer, and his swift course sometimes, and in an instant to become so calme.

vnto him, that he would only preserue his person. The <hi>Soldan</hi> who did see all things desperate, determined for to retire, hoping that time would bring vnto him some change, as also that our army would not remaine there, and that in the meane time he should haue oportunitie to attempt some thing, he went out of the citie of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>

These words were declared vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> being the most aduanced, who sent them vnto the Prince: he sent him word also, that vnto <hi>Alexandria</hi> came much people to obey his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, &amp; that for the space of more then fiftie leagues, all came for to submit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto his obedience. So the Prince, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued these newes, he was verie glad: and seeing his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses so to prosper, he conceaued hope of a happie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. But notwithstanding he was greatly vexed, that he could not get the <hi>Soldan</hi> into his hands: this caused the Prince for to vse crueltie towardes them which tooke his part, and caried them with him, doubting some alteration in his absence. Now as we approched within a dayes iourney vnto <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Prince sent word vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> that hee should bring with him the chiefest that came, promising vnto him obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and fidelitie. The Prince hauing made his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie into <hi>Alexandria</hi> with all his armie, hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped the same neare vnto the Citie, and for

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how there needed no mediation with the Prince; he remembring in the absence of his seruants, their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor &amp; deserts, and the honor wherof they were worthy; one of the parts that did so much reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

Now the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise was appointed in the morning when the Prince shold giue audience to euerie one (according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom) hauing of his guard only 1200. souldiers, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euery day out of 10000. ordained for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Princes person: he had also imparted this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise vnto diuerse of the inhabitants, who shold haue taken armes as soone as the same should be executed.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10494:84"/>
Now as the enterprise was dangerous, so seemed it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie as he thereof perswaded himselfe, hauing caused all his men to enter one by one into the armie, whither they had yeelded themselues: and it was three weekes since he deuised this enterprise. So the day came when he should do this execution, the Prince hauing the day before made him a present of one of the most coragious horses of his stable, and hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his men to shew all curtesie and good entertainement vnto him and his company. Now in the morning he drew neare vnto the Emperour, who was in his tent, whither euerie one repaired that had any businesse with him. Now you must vnderstand, that <hi>Alexandria</hi> is builded in such a fashion, that they go vpon the tops of the houses, the which are in maner of vaultes, where the traitor had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly placed those who should assist him after the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. He came then &amp; shewed himselfe a far off; the Prince (full of gentlenesse) asked him what he desired, astonished notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that he came into that place which was not fit for his dignity, the Prince only ministring iustice for those which had not accesse vnto his perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as were the poore people &amp; soldiers: but he knew not yet that custome: so as the Prince percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him change colour in holding some petition, the Prince had alwaies an eye to that he did; on a suddaine hee drew neare vnto the Prince, with his sword in his<note place="margin">Tamerlan his great daunger and valiant defence of him selfe, to the mischiefe of the traitor.</note> hand: the Prince hauing his ready assoone as he, missed not him as he had done; the Prince retired back one pase for to auoide the thrust he cast at him: the Emperor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing striken him, did almost cut off one of his armes, the which he put forward for to strike him. In this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant they ran vnto the Princes succour, and one of his seruants comming, did giue him another blow vpon
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10494:85"/>
the head: but a small matter wherewith he fell downe. The Prince hauing stayed them from killing of him, to the end he might know his companions, then cried he out, &amp; with great lamentations bewailed his good mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, sending vnto him this his deed, as the last witnesse of his fidelitie. The Prince demanded of him, wherefore he did not kill him in the battell, but would traiterously at this present vnder the pretence of friendship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice take his life from him? The other answered onely; let me die, let me die. The chiefe Iudge of the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Iustice tooke and examined him, together with the Princes most priuie Councell. In the meane time they caused euery man to take armes, the Princes horsemen mounted on horsebacke, the gards were increased, they made the hauen sure, the Prince withdrew himself into his lodging, being happie that he had saued his life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this blow. You might haue seene both Captains &amp; soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers run vnto the Emperors lodging, &amp; wold haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the guards for to see whether the Prince were well, who was desirous to take rest: he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to shew himselfe vnto his Captains &amp; souldiers, for to assure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his health: yea he was constrained to mount on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, and to go euery where euen into the campe. And at such time as they did see the Prince, you would haue said, that the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did breake with cries, through the ioy they made ouer all for the health of their Prince, so great Idolaters were the souldiers of their Emperour. The other was presently put to the torture, who coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously confessed all the enterprise requiring death. Some we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto the place where the named were; there were three hundred yet shut vp, who were all tyed and put in prison, the others sought out here and there. He missed not to accuse those of the citie, vnto whom he
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10494:85"/>
had deliuered letters of credit from the Soldan. The Prince who was an enemie vnto crueltie, perceiuing that the end of this businesse would prooue long, hee went out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for that he knew the discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of all the partakers, &amp; to the end execution might be made of those of the enterprise. It was a miserable spectacle to behold all these thinges thus perfourmed within the Citie, at such time as they apprehended the conspirators, who being conuinced, were put to death openly: and the game began at <hi>Arzambei,</hi> who being<note place="margin">Arzambei be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for treason against Tamerla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the verie same punishment was taken of all the conspired inhabitants of the citie, or any others. Those which were suspected, and might anie wayes be detected, were led away prisoners, and made slaues, being changed from that place. Beholde the end of this conspiracie, the which the valorand maiestie of the Prince alone did defend, and no other force at all: but as I haue often heard the Prince say, he had an imagination, that this mad fellow wold do him some mischiefe, aud if it had not bene for feare of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any thing vnworthy his greatnesse and faith giuen, he would haue caused him to be apprehended, but he had good regard vnto his practises. The Prince was often wont to say, that he did not feare such wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<note place="margin">A resolute say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tamerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Asia, and his owne to be planted there. Now <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing passed further, and made the Princes armes to be felt ouer all, hauing also brought all the neather <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> to be subiect vnto <hi>Alexandria:</hi> the Prince finding this countrie to be verie faire and pleasant, he looked daily for the comming of <hi>Calibes,</hi> and he in the meane time ordered the affaires of his new estate, causing his Armie to refresh it selfe, the which was spread ouer all: he suffered none but <hi>Axalla</hi> to keepe the order of an armie before him. The heate was very great at that present, the which our souldiers did endure with great discommoditie: the Parthians especially whose tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate climate doth incline more vnto cold then heate.

Our Prince had so good condicions &amp; so agreeable vnto euerie one, that it shall bee hard for me to vtter and declare them vnto posteritie, neither can I sufficiently commend them, nor liuelie represent them in that perfection I desire, as I haue vndertaken for to do. Now for to returne againe vnto our historie, the Emperor receiued newes of <hi>Calibes</hi> marching for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and of receiuing his great Chamberlain into his Armie.

that had passed, and not thinking of the enemies rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, could not imagin they would come &amp; assault him within his trenches; but being growne vainglorious by repulsing of him from before the Citie, they did attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vnto themselues therefore a great glorie, and vnto vs a great disgrace: so as they desired when their soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers had this adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, to win a greater for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they could.

He answered, that he liked better to leaue their limits founded vpon his vertue, then increased to his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by infidelitie. Whensoeuer the Greeke Emperor
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:10494:90"/>
shall giue me any other occasion, then as a friend and good neighbour, then shall he feele my power, &amp; God will assist my good cause. I thinke (my friend) that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did any thing more of the honour and glorie of my Empire, and vnto the Parthian nation, then for to leaue a memoriall vnto posteritie, that a Parthian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did come so long a iourney, for to minister iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice vpon such a tyrant dogge as <hi>Baiazet:</hi> and for to set at libertie this worthie nobilitie, whom he would bring into bondage. And hauing power to performe it, I haue not done the same, but haue in such sort bounded my ambition, as to abstaine from commanding ouer the fairest and richest Empire, and for to gouerne the most beautifull Citie in the world. I will reason with you (my friend) and say, that I haue not obtained anie such victorie as that is, although I be the Conqueror of so manie seuerall people and nations so farre off, and that my Armes, euen vnto this present, through the almightie fauour of the great God my God, haue alwayes bene victorious. It is an ordinarie matter to winne battailes, to conquer kingdomes, and for to prescribe lawes vnto Empires, manie haue done the same: but there be fewe to be found amongst the great Princes and Potentates, who haue ballanced iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and equitie with their ambition: but putting themselues by right or wrong into the middest of the worlde, haue held onely force for iustice, the which some haue vsed, not hauing regard either vnto equitie or faith. I will at the least wise leaue this example vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to posteritie. Do you not see how this faith which I keepe with mine enemies, maketh them become my faithfull friends? What force and vertue (think you) wil it haue with them which be my friends already? And
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:10494:91"/>
how greatly shall my honour and reputation bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased? Commend me then I pray you, and leaue to blame me. The Chanceller being returned from him, who was verie wise, declared this discourse vnto mee, the which I would not omit, to make the good nature of my Prince the better knowne, whose historie I do set foorth. As also that his conditions should bee the better represented before the eyes of those which haue not diligently considered the same: or rather for such as heare speach of the blessing that God hath bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon him in so manie happie conquestes, to the end his goodnesse should bee acknowledged, and not attributed vnto fortune or blinde chaunce, the which raiseth vp the vicious as soone as the vertuous. So the Prince came vnto <hi>Damasco,</hi> where hee found <hi>Axalla,</hi> who stayed his comming with the Auaunt-guard, who had made an end of vtterly destroying it, for that hee<note place="margin">Damasco de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan.</note> knew the same to be euill affected. His Armie encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped eight dayes therein, Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued commandement to send sixe thousand horse vnto the great Chamberlaine, to the end that hee might passe ouer the riuer of <hi>Euphrates</hi> with safetie: and he went to besiege <hi>Mebeg</hi> againe, the which within three dayes he tooke, and <hi>Raflan</hi> also, and all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie yeelded vnto the Emperours obedience, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Cities situated vpon the riuer of <hi>Euphrates.</hi> The Prince gaue vno him a commandement, to stay at the passage for to ioyne with him, and himselfe in person to come vno him: all the which hee performed accordingly. The Prince did giue him very good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, greatly commending his valour and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage before all the Captaines of the Army, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes sent him backe vnto his charge, hauing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10494:91"/>
commandement to ioine a part of his forces with those of <hi>Axalla,</hi> and himselfe was appointed vnto the<note place="margin">Tamerlan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with his Army marched into Persia.</note> Arier-guard, ouer the which <hi>Calibes</hi> had bene leader: although indeed our Armie marched all in a front: for the Prince marched in the middest, <hi>Axalla</hi> on the right hand, and the great Chamberlaine vpon the left: the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> was in the Battaile neare vnto the Prince. I do not here set downe by name so manie Princes and other great Captaines, the which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ouer troupes as well of horse as footmen. So the Emperor came vnto <hi>Mebeg,</hi> where he passed ouer the riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> from the which place he sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ten thousand horse vnto <hi>Calibes,</hi> vnder the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct of the Prince of <hi>Atacen,</hi> together with fifteene or six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thousand footmen for aide, he being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take his way by <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to make the same subiect vnto the Prince; and he remained in the same place to vnderstand what successe <hi>Atacen</hi> had, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also commanded to remaine in that same place to heare newes from <hi>Calibes,</hi> and to aduertise him what need he had of him, the Emperour hauing bene certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of some stirring of the Soldan. Notwithstanding <hi>Calibes</hi> sent word, that they came from all parts to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselues vnder the Princes obedience. In the end, after some abode, he caused the front of his army to march directly into <hi>Armenia,</hi> being desirous to passe by <hi>Diaberoth,</hi> and punish these litle kings, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled against his men, being also desirous to bring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the subiection of the Parthian Empire those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries which lie euen at the mouth of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which the Prince of <hi>Atecen</hi> did happily bring to passe: &amp; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors came from all the kings which commanded to take the oth of fidelity for the same: for you must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10494:92"/>
that since the Empire of the Christians, which they call Romans, they were sometimes gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> sometimes by the Soldans, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Califes, &amp; sometimes by the Lieutenants general of the Romans; so as these people were now at the strongest, but greatly destroyed by means of these warres. Now the Prince would assure himselfe of the passage ouer the riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> for to succour fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence the prouinces of <hi>Egipt,</hi> at such time as they should haue neede thereof: and being ready to drawe straight into <hi>Armenia,</hi> he receiued newes from <hi>Calibes,</hi> beseeching his Maiesty to dispatch aide vnto him. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently<note place="margin">Aid sent vnto Calibes into Egipt.</note> was the Prince of <hi>Atacen</hi> sent backe againe, and commanded to set forward into <hi>Egipt,</hi> and the Prince in person went vnto <hi>Babylon,</hi> leauing <hi>Axalla</hi> with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt-guard, not to leaue the iourny into <hi>Armenia.</hi> The Prince being aduised to go thither himselfe in person, to the end for to bring vnto them a great astonishment and assurance in his bountie, when they would trust to the same. We came in eleuen daies vnto <hi>Babylon:</hi> the Prince hauing receiued all those people vnder his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he left the great Chamberlaine at <hi>Romedat</hi> for to fortifie it, and also for to command all the riuer of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> euen to the Armenians. He reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto him the inhabitants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who had shewed themselues verie affectioned towardes him, and the which was almost wholly peopled by the Tartarians: for the late Prince of <hi>Sachetay</hi> his father hauing made an enterprise thither, did take the same, and for the better keeping thereof, he caused the Parthian Colonies to come thither; who in the end were so vexed by their neighbors, as well Mamelues as Persia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that they were of necessitie compelled to submit themselues vnder
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10494:92"/>
their Empire, the affection and remembrance of their ancient originall remaining alwayes with them. The Emperour for this consideration shewed them all mildnesse, and vpon this occasion desired to make himselfe Lord of this countrie, by this right, that the late Prince his father had once conquered it by a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall of his, called <hi>Sahali,</hi> whose reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance was yet verie fresh, for the seruices he had done vnto the Empire of <hi>Sachetay.</hi> From this place the Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in great hast, being aduertised by Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> how the Persian <hi>Guines</hi> came to visite him in peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<note place="margin">Guines the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Persian.</note> maner, for to submit vnder his obedience what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer countries he held, the which were not many. The Emperour who did wonder at his holinesse, and honoured him, hauing vnderstode thus much, made haste to set forward for to honour him the more: for he held an opinion alwayes of him as of an holy perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, in so much as the Emperour was determined for to see him, for the estimation of his holinesse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Now vnderstanding that he came in this maner towards him, he left his troupes to come softly vnder the charge of the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> and himselfe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced forward vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> who looked for the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Guines:</hi> who presently dispatched towards him the Prince of <hi>Liseauceu</hi> and the great Chanceller for to gratifie him, and to assure him of the great desire the Emperour had of his comming. The Prince won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring greatly at his holie life, determined to yeeld him all the honour hee could possiblie, and to deuise all meanes to pleasure him. So the Emperour set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to meete with this <hi>Guines,</hi> who did come in<note place="margin">The strange comming of Guines vnto Tamerlan.</note> verie humble manner, bringing also with him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of sundrie kinds of beasts, the which he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:10494:93"/>
kept tame, and by the which he taught men. As soon as he did see the Emperout, he began to make his praiers towards the heauens, for the greatnesse of the health of the Emperour, for the greatnesse of the religion of the Prophet, excommunicating with all his power the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> as enemies vnto the faithfull beleeuers. The Emperor who came in great pompe, was greatly asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, to see this man in such furniture as he was, and as he was by nature, a great wonderer at such kind of of people, there was he more then euer before: and being willing to gratifie him, he offered him part of the enemies spoyles hee had conquered, giuing vnto him fifteene or sixteene thousand prisoners, to the end they might be instructed in his religion, a present the which was verie acceptable vnto <hi>Guines,</hi> in as much as this same did greatly help to augment &amp; also increase him, causing the most part of them to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues according to his manners and opinion. But as this deuout humour pleased the Emperour, so diuers on the other side did reprooue the strange fashions in this Prince, who through holinesse knew well how to bring so many countries vnder his obedience. Now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers blamed the Emperor for making so great account of his holines: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the honor &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which man oweth vnto religion, I am not of those, which will say, that a prince ought not to haue so much therof: for certainly it is a thing wherof any do seldome complaine. Now after all this great shewe of religion, he came not vnto the Emperor for nothing, but rather for two ends, whereof the one was, the feare he had of<note place="margin">Guines religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abused for the increase of his greatnesse.</note> this army, which he desired to be fauorable vnto him: &amp; the other, to receiue by meanes thereof, increase of his affaires, vnder shew of deuotion, knowing the Emperor
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10494:93"/>
to be enclined as much as might be to godlinesse, and also that he might be alwaies neare vnto the Emperors person, as protector of all the countries neare vnto him, the which by his meanes and intercession did submit themselues vnder the Princes greatnesse: and himselfe was the first that thereunto did willingly submit all the iurisdiction he had, although the Emperour made no request for the same. But this humility did serue him to good purpose, and to his successors also: for this was his preseruation, &amp; the foundation of their greatnesse: so as the Prince, hauing subdued all Persia excepting<note place="margin">Tauris.</note> the citie of <hi>Tauris,</hi> the which is a very great and rich ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and hauing made vnto it selfe a peculiar kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, did hinder as much as in it lay, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Guines,</hi> and a great part of the country also that was obedient vnto him, and in the same was a Captaine who did commaund them, called <hi>Talismahar,</hi> who<note place="margin">Talismahar.</note> was throughly aduertised of the credite <hi>Guines</hi> had with the Emperor, and who would not faile to solicite him for to enterprise and conquer this citie, and thereof change also the gouernment: and he hauing an opinion that the Emperour being desirous to returne, would not busie himselfe about him, if he set but a countenance of well defending of himself, and so hauing taken such or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he sent his Embassadors vnto the Emperour for to informe him of the vsurpations <hi>Guines</hi> had made, and his purposes vnder the pretence of a fained religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Emperour would heare nothing of all that he sent him word. But he himselfe would declare his owne reasons, and would demand the auncient right his predecessors had vnto this countrie: or for want thereof, hee would make appeare how hurtfull the same would be vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The Emperour omitted not to here them, and noted
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:10494:94"/>
verie well the meanes he might haue to make himselfe greater through these diuisions: acknowledging and considering well therof, he found that euery where they did abuse the same, and especially that the cloake of religion is bigge and large enough for to couer all the world: but he dissembled it, and setting forward caried <hi>Guines</hi> with him, and receiued a new oath of all the people, and in the strong cities he planted new Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: to conclude, the Emperours determination was to bring all Persia vnder his subiection. Nowe Prince <hi>Guines</hi> hauing alreadie submitted himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his obedience, had giuen an example vnto manie: but the Emperour who considered that <hi>Tauris</hi> was a great citie, and the chiefest of that countrie, he sought to haue practises vnder hand, hauing sent some of his men vnto this end, promising vnto this Captaine a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement within his owne countrie: but hee who was hated of <hi>Guines,</hi> could not assure himselfe, so as he perswaded the people to resolue vpon the extremitie of a siege, the which did greatly displease the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, vnto whom it being declared, that the presence of <hi>Guines</hi> was very preiudiciall vnto him, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this citie vnder his obedience, hee aduertised him thereof, and hauing presented him with all sortes of giftes and honours, hee returned from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne countrie, hauing remained with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour some fifteene dayes: the borders of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion stretched from <hi>Saucausan</hi> on our side, and on the<note place="margin">Axalla mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with his armie into the countrey of Tauris.</note> other side, euen vnto the Caspian sea. Now <hi>Axalla</hi> was commanded to aduance forward with the auantgard: and as soone as he entred into the territory of <hi>Tauris,</hi> to put vnto fire and sword all them which should resist him. Behold how the Emperour could serue himselfe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:10494:94"/>
with this occasion, for to put vnder his subiection all <hi>Glautere</hi> &amp; <hi>Taperestan,</hi> the which vntill this present had maintained themselues against the often roades of the Tartarians. Now as soone as <hi>Talismahar</hi> vnderstood our armie approched vnto his territorie, he entred into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to aduance forward with all his horsemen, and some footmen for to furnish the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g places, the which might busie the Emperors armie. He had with him full thirtie thousand good horse, hee being also a most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Captaine, being able greatly to distresse our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, the which was we arie with wants, and through the long time it had marched and encamped, euen vnto the beginning of winter. But the inhabitants of <hi>Tauris</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very light &amp; inconstant, he thought that the euents of warre are doubtfull, and oftentimes vncertaine, and that if there should happen any disgrace vnto his armie, he doubted least some change &amp; alteration should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen within the citie, where hee hoped to find his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest safetie. He therefore sent his horsemen vnder the charge of one of his Lieutenants called <hi>Camares,</hi> who<note place="margin">Camares.</note> was of very great experience, he being enioined to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie our armie, and if he found oportunitie to fight with it, assuring himselfe that there would be sufficient to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the same: but aboue all, that he shold fight by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, and not in open battell, knowing wel, that so great a multitude of men did take vp a great countrie, and lay stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly being ioyned together. The Emperor being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertised of this resolution, sent word therof vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> to the end he should not be assaulted on a sudden, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing summoned a city the which they called <hi>Cafechion, Camares</hi> had put men thereinto when he did see our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie go that way, so as the same made a refusall. Now <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing inuested it, he began to assault the same,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:10494:95"/>
hauing with the great number of pioners he had, raised vp a Caualier, the which did defend our men appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vnto the wall, and from whence likewise they did continually fight with them that were within, who did resolutely defend themselues. <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing assaulted them on euery side, in the end they were ouercome, their courages failing them, and also because they were almost all wounded, our souldiers entred thereinto, and so they were all cut in peeces. About the time that our men spoiled, and put all vnto fire and sword, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour being as yet three leagues from the siege, <hi>Camares</hi> shewed himselfe with his horsemen, and beganne the<note place="margin">Encounters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Axalla and Camares Lieutenant vnto Talisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har.</note> fight vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two thousand horse, the which some had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to aduance forward on a sudden, doubting of the enemie, and they came euen where the maine battaile of <hi>Axalla</hi> was, driuing that troupe forward in fight, but wisely and like a Captaine, aduancing no more then foure thousand horse to performe this exploit, and him selfe comming after in very good order, &amp; hauing cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the retrait for to sound, Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> commaunded sixe thousand Parthian horse for to follow them, and if they could mingle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues amongst them, the which being very well and diligently performed by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine which did conduct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the auant-currers of these foure thousand horse, hauing perceiued <hi>Axallaes</hi> maine forces to aduance forward, following the lightnesse of these Parthians, began presently to turne themselues, and retire in very good order, leauing the foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse to make head against the sixe thousand Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, notwithstanding in retyring themselues in the end, at the passage of a riuer, <hi>Camares</hi> did stay, &amp; put all his troupes in battell array, assisting of his men, who were somewhat pressed by the enemie, although the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:10494:95"/>
fight was in a manner equall, and there were some sixe or seuen hundred men slaine of either side, <hi>Camares</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a shew of lodging, was carefull for to send to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all the passages. <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing aduanced forward the footemen with him, forced the passage, and found the enemie retired ten leagues beyond the same, who wisely had put into a citie neare adioyning, a sufficient garrison for to defend it, and hold out for the space of eight dayes: and <hi>Camares</hi> in the meane time did wearie our armie, and made great spoyle of all kind of victuals, hoping to draw things into length. But the example of those the which had beene handled so roughly, caused them not to bee so obstinate: for it is a Maxime to<note place="margin">A Maxime.</note> shorten the war, that by punishing wel the obstinate by their liues, the neighbours become wise through their example, not to play the fooles in the same manner: so did it fall out with <hi>Gorgechin,</hi> the which in steed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obstinate, came to parley, and was receiued by composition, and well vsed. <hi>Axalla</hi> being aduertised that <hi>Camares</hi> was at <hi>Archiech,</hi> tenne leagues beyond that place, he made choise of tenne thousand Parthians, and of sixe thousand Scithians, and of tenne thousand choise Stradiots, determining for to surprise the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and caused a rumor to be spread by some sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, that they of <hi>Gorgechin</hi> looked for his succour, and had not yeelded themselues; &amp; that they did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly batter the same, the which <hi>Axalla</hi> hoping to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish,<note place="margin">A stratageme.</note> aduanced directly towards them, hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the rest of the armie to approch as neare as they could. By this meanes he surprised them in a morning, being encamped within a great village, &amp; hauing found a thousand of their horsemen at their ease, he caused them to be pursued euen into the campe, and putting
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:10494:96"/>
himselfe into battell array, to the end they should not come foorth without fighting, hee encamped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vppon the wayes into their campe, hoping verie soone either to famish them, or for to compell them to come vnto a battell. Now there was but one way to issue out in order: the Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the footemen hee had with him to aduance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he placed the same vpon the wayes vnto their campe. Now they had left their footemen behinde them, and had none but their horsemen, the which Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> perceiuing, he caused trenches to bee made for to hinder them, and hauing sent word vnto the Emperour of this deede, hee set forward with all diligence. Now <hi>Camares</hi> thought he had all the whole armie vpon him, therefore he beganne to thinke vpon his safetie, seeing himselfe compelled for to fight, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but one issuing place, the which was vppon the side of the enemies campe. Nowe hee had caused a counter-trench to be made, the which was along by a litle mountaine, wherewith he hoped to strengthen himselfe so well, as to set himselfe in battell array, and to force foure thousand horse which were his guard. I haue forgotten to declare, that the Emperour assoone as he had receiued these newes, caused the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> to march on forward, with twentie thousand horse that were alreadie arriued, the which caused our enemies to beleeue that our whole armie was encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Now the enemy was determined to make his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, &amp; for to cut in peeces this standing watch of foure thousand horse, &amp; this matter fell out about midnight, when as the Moone did shine bright.

Now our men had alreadie begunne a counter-trench for to be opposite against that same which they had made. This did hinder them, and our souldiers hearing the noise, beganne to take armes, and to resist the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who did strongly assault our men, and vpon their first comming being followed by certain footmen, they did winne our counter-trench, and beganne to labour for to leuell the same, for to passe ouer their horsmen, where happened a very great disorder: for our footmen being astonished, their horsemen hauing passed, the most part of them were cut in peeces, wherein the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies busying themselues longer then they should haue done, our men were soone vpon them (the which were the sixe thousand horse that were in gard halfe a league from thence) who arriuing found the enemies in this disorder, and charged vppon them: but <hi>Camares</hi> was alreadie passed ouer the first trench.

The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> remained within the campe for to guard it. In the morning the Emperour in person arriued, who found this faire sight, and as he commended the valour of <hi>Axalla</hi> and his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, so he blamed the Captaines who were in gard,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10494:97"/>
because they had ill performed their indeuor in repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the enemies first horsemen: the Emperor caused their inditement to be framed, and two were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who according to the lawes for warre were puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed about ten of the clocke in the morning. They of the City, wherein remained full two thousand horse whom they had gathered together, and about sixe thousand footmen, seeing their men ouerthrowne, and especially beholding the head of <hi>Camares,</hi> lost their courage, and entred into communication: and the Emperour hauing giuen them his word, they came out to treat, there was a composition made with them, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon<note place="margin">A composition with certaine of the inhabitants of Tauris.</note> condition, that none of them should reteturne into <hi>Tauris,</hi> but might otherwise go whither they would: so they required to be conducted vnto <hi>Louan,</hi> promising to subiect themselues vnto whatsoeuer the inhabitants of <hi>Tauris</hi> would yeeld vnto, who were greatly astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed at the euill hap which did light vpon <hi>Camares,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing him of the fault he had committed, to suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be shut vp in this maner. So as the Emperour at that verie instant caused his Armie to march as soone as it was ioyned together, and hee encamped within eight leagues of <hi>Tauris,</hi> his maine battell at <hi>Sedema,</hi> and caused his auantguard (wherein was <hi>Axalla</hi>) to lodge at <hi>Chiara,</hi> who hauing shewed vnto them of <hi>Tauris</hi> the head of him that was ouer their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, they were greatly astonished, and the Princes pleasure being sent vnto them by an Herald, they were in great trouble, as well by meanes of the part Prince <hi>Guines</hi> had within the City, who vpon this disgrace happening vnto the contrary partie, would make no doubt to be obeied, vpon which occasion they being all of them retired into one of the quarters of <hi>Tauris,</hi>

they determined openly to fauour the Emperour, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselues of peace and mildnesse. Now you must<note place="margin">Talismahar chosen Prince of Tauris.</note> vnderstand that the inhabitants of <hi>Tauris</hi> had chosen <hi>Thalismahar</hi> for their Prince, and sworne fealty between his hands after they had perceiued the approach of the Emperours Army<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so as he was no longer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged onely as Captaine generall, but for their Prince, and hauing receiued a solemne oth of them all, they had euery one sworne vnto him to dye, rather then obey the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> or to acknowledge anie thing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from them: but seeing their affaires for to change, they repented themselues alreadie, so inconstant a thing is the election of a new Prince, who tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to fight with the <hi>Tartarians</hi> in a raunged battel, and to driue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fighting euen into their owne country.

This murmuring was spoken aloude, and the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, who were their Priestes, and who did abhorre the chaunge of the religion they held, and which would not receiue the new reformation of <hi>Guines,</hi> nor his superstitions, they were the first which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to stirre vp the people, and to exhorte them to thinke vpon their safetie, declaring vnto them how vaine their Princes promise was, and that he deceiued them, their destruction being a thing most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest; that they should remember them selues of <hi>Caire,</hi> and so many thousands of Cities, the which

But they were not the sixt part: notwithstanding a bodie cannot haue so small an euill in anie one of his parts, that it shall not greatly empaire the health of all the rest. This canker although it was litle at the begining, did dayly increase and went on augmenting. The Prince of <hi>Tauris</hi> being aduertised of these two factions, the one of <hi>Guines</hi> sent vnto the Emperour, knew not how to remidie the same; for the enemie being so neare, and thinges so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he doubted a great reuolt, and did wisely beare all with patience vntill some extremitie, when as hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to vse extreame remedies for his benefite. Now within the Citie of <hi>Guines</hi> faction were some thirtie thousand men, whereof they hauing assured the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and hauing bene comforted to assure themselues
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:10494:99"/>
of his assistance, they returned from thence, spreading ouer all, the courtesie they had found there with the Emperour, and they published the same aloude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people and that there was no euill meant vnto anie, but to the new chosen Prince; and that the Emperour required nothing of them but their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and that notwithstanding the folly which some seditious had committed in choosing this man for Prince, yet was it not fit to ouerthrow so flourishing a Citie and so manie honest men, for such a light matter; that the Emperour required but the life of this new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and of his confederates, and not of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. In the ende matters came vnto this passe, that they of <hi>Guines</hi> faction had assembled the people, and caused the same Embassadours whom they had sent vnto <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> to declare aloude vnto the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assembled, what they had heard the Emperour say, the which was; that he directed his armes onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the elected Prince, and not against the City.

The new Prince withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into his lodging, where being intrenched and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to entermeddle his authoritie, he was desired to retire vnto the Pallace, into some corner about his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell, with those of his faction: and seeing himselfe weake, hee determined to forsake the Citie, and to withdraw himselfe vnto the Mountaines. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror being aduertized of this happy successe by <hi>Axalla,</hi> who came vnto him, &amp; declared vnto him this purpose, to the ende he might haue leaue to cut of the way vnto the Prince elected. But the Emperour hauing meditated
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:10494:99"/>
long thereupon wold not hazard anie thing rashly but let him go, and rather take that great city through their diuision then by his armes: he therefore commanded <hi>Axalla</hi> to suffer him to retire, and to send none vnto the warre, being vnwilling to enterprise any thing by armes, to the end they shold haue a greater confidence in his mercie. The night following the Prince elected departed away, together with those of his faction, who<note place="margin">The Prince elected depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out of Tauris.</note> had bene onely fifteene dayes Prince of the common wealth, whereof he had bin Captaine the space of eight and twenty yeares with all prosperity, hauing stoutly resisted the supstitions of <hi>Guines,</hi> and the tyrannie the which he would vnder colour of this new godlinesse bring vpon the <hi>Persians:</hi> and surely if the ouer sight of <hi>Camares</hi> had not bene, his affaires had not receiued so bad successe, which doth teach vs that the matters of warre are so vncertaine, as it is necessary to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes regard vnto the most sure way, and preserue the principall matter. For if those forces had not departed out of <hi>Tauris</hi> nor hazarded them, there had bene worke for our Armie the space of sixe moneths. And you know what chaunces and nouelties do commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the estate of so great a monarkie as is ours, the which hauing so great a breadth of country, it is not possible but some new alteration must daylie needs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen within the same, especially seeing long sieges are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great armies, &amp; principally in such an estate as ours was, which hauing bin out of his own country the space of two years, it drew neare home, so as it was hard to keepe them from seuering during so long abode.

That same hauing happened, all the Citie being ioyned together, sent vnto the Emperour, desiring eight dayes respite for to treate with him, and yeeld them selues vnder his obedience, the which the Emperour graunted them willingly. And this they did, to the end they might haue time to prouide the meanes to keepe them selues from the gouernement of <hi>Guines,</hi> &amp; his superstition, or rather reformation in the Prophets law: for the faction of <hi>Guines</hi> which was smal in respect of the other parties could do very litle.

The other was, that they shold<note place="margin">2</note> be maintained in their priuiledges, and acknowledged as subiects vnto the Tartarian Empire, and not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vnto that of the <hi>Persians.</hi> That they wished this great<note place="margin">3</note> Monarchie that had so long time flourished, should be chaunged in the time, and vnder the raigne of so great and coragious an Emperour of the Tartarian nation, as our Prince <hi>Tamerlan</hi> was: to the end the reproch of their nation might be the lesse. That they desired not to be<note place="margin">4</note> freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordinarie tributes, although it might please the Emperour to consider the great warres they had lately maintained against <hi>Guines</hi> for preseruation of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; and that it would please him to ease them of the same. The Emperor who was of a curteous nature, made
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:10494:100"/>
shew there of in good earnest towards this people, and made grant vnto them that they shold liue without any constraint in their religion, aswell after the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Guines,</hi> as after the law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> according vnto the interpretation of <hi>Haly,</hi> and also the Christians and Iewes should be likewise free, as they had alwayes vsed and accustomed. All other demands being granted, they submitted themselues vnder his obedience, and the next day came from thence three hundred principall men of the city, who performed the oth of fealtie, in the name of all the people. The Emperour after this, determined of his entry: so Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> was commanded to enter the first thereinto with fifteene thousand horse, &amp; thirty thousand footmen; they deliuered into his hands all the fortresses giuing commandement for honour and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience<note place="margin">Tamerlan his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the city of Thanais.</note> vnto the Emperour: he seised vpon the gates, and caused proclamation to be made, that all the Citizens should bring their weapons into his lodging, the which was done. So the Emperour arriued there in great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, being receiued with the full reioycing of all the people, and he was almost worshipped of euery one, thinking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues happie to be saued from such a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke. The next day the Emperour had newes of the death of the Emperour his vnkle, by the Empresse who had apprehended some great men that would haue ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp some tumult: he made great lamentation for him; yet it was the lesse grieuous vnto him, for that he knew his great sicknesse, which did threaten him with death of long time: &amp; had not the kindnesse of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his daughter bin, who had such care of him as she ought for to haue, old age had made an end of him long before.

he assembled together the principall men of the law, to make triall for to agree this controuersie: but he did see this to be impossible, so stiffely euery one held his interpretation to be according to the true meaning of the Prophet, wherein hauing spent some time in vaine, in the meane time hee receiued the oth of all the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp; gathered together great store of money, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had payed his armie, and gratified his men of warre, rewarding them after their desertes, he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> to commaund ouer them in his absence, with whom he left an hundred thousand feotemen of his armie, to the end for to suffer the same to winter in all the Cities, and through all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to keepe all in subiection, and refresh it selfe. The rest did the Emperour conduct with him, and all his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners of what qualitie soeuer, except those whom he<note place="margin">The cunning practises of Guines vnder the cloake of religion.</note> gaue vnto <hi>Guines,</hi> for to instruct them in his reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Now he declared the death of the Emperour his vnkle vnto his Counsell, and forgot no ceremony due vnto the honor of the said Emperour, outwardly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grief he conceiued for his death; where after he had rested some eight dayes, he determined to go vnto <hi>Quinzai</hi> for to see the Empresse, and hauing left <hi>Baia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> in the custody of the gouernor of <hi>Zachetay,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror<note place="margin">Tamerlan his ordinarie court of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse and threescore thousand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> set forward with his ordinarie court, which was of fortie thousand horse, and threescore thousand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

This was the cause that before he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Tamerlan his wise foresight.</note> from <hi>Quinzai,</hi> he dispatched towards the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> one of his most faithfull counsellers called <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazes,</hi> to the end he should haue an eye vnto the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and also for to succor all the places that should haue neede, as well on the side of <hi>Caire</hi> as towards the <hi>Mediterran</hi> sea, to the ende that nothing should be chaunged during his absence, giuing him charge moreouer that the pollicy and discipline should in his Armie be carefully obserued, and commanding him to credit <hi>Nobazes,</hi> verie expert in the art of warre. So the Emperour being come vnto <hi>Cambalu,</hi> he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued newes of the battell <hi>Odmar</hi> had wonne against the king of <hi>Chinas</hi> Captaine generall, and how he pursued his victorie, hauing taken three or foure great and rich Cities, the which did yeelde themselues vnto him, and that againe the <hi>Chinois</hi> did desire peace.

sending vnto him for wife one of his sisters with all magnificence that might be, for to make him the more affectioned vnto him. I will declare how the Emperour was receiued at <hi>Cambalu</hi> by his subiects with all the magnificence possible, the Emperour for to gratifie them hauing restored their priuiledges, the which hee had taken from them, for the rebellion they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with <hi>Calix:</hi> so as the Emperour went ouer all gratifying his subiects for this new succession that was lately fallen vnto him, all the companies coming vnto him: for in these countries they haue no certaine dwellings, they are alwayes wandring in troupes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they go: thither the Empresse (hauing left Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> to gouerne at <hi>Quinzai</hi>) came vnto him.

Now the Emperour loued her onely, hauing no other affection in such pleasure, but only the happinesse of a faire of-spring, the which he hoped for.

This country was replenished with some three hundred cities, and was in largenesse more then foure hundred leagues, besides an finite number of villages.

The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> earnestly desired to vndertake this charge: but some declared vnto him, that the importance of the fight was vpon the land, as also it belonged vnto <hi>Calibes</hi> to dispose of all within his gouernement, for to fight at the verie same time (according to the enemies countenance) with the whole armie, the enemies being within their trenches, if in case he did seuer himselfe from his footemen, to assist his armie vppon the water, or else if he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to put fresh souldiers into his boates and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liottes: for we were within two thousand paces the one from the other, so as euery one was assured that the day would not passe away, but they would set vppon the enemies within their trenches, especially they which knew the heate of this young Prince, the which had come to passe, but that the Emperour had placed two olde Counsellers neare about him, who knewe how to temper this his forwardnesse, who was notwithstanding greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for animating of the souldiers, accustomed vnder the good fortune of the Emperor to attempt any thing, although very hard
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10494:108"/>
and daungerous. So the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> hauing heard news of the army by water, he sent thither with all speed thirteene or fourteene thousand of the most expert souldiers within his armie, vnder the conduct of the Colonell of his footmen (who was his Lieutenant when as the Emperour himselfe commaunded in his armie) called <hi>Synopes,</hi> brought vp a Captaine vnder Prince<note place="margin">Synopes.</note> 
               <hi>Axalla,</hi> at such time as he had the generall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ouer the footmen. The Prince at the same very time he supposed the fleete to drawe neare vnto that place the enemie had fortified with oakes, with botes, and galliots, caused all the armie to mount on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, &amp; appointed fortie thousand souldiers to march directly vnto a place the which he had noted to be most easie &amp; for his best aduantage, for that the enemie had as he thoght traueled least in that place, who (doubting the Prince would lodge betweene the citie of <hi>Caire</hi> and him) had there emploied the most of his time.

So<note place="margin">A stratageme.</note> the victuals passed, and our victorious army encamped within this Iland, the which our men had wonne, for to giue passage vnto the rest of the victuals. The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> caused three engines of artillerie to be imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked presently, for to shoot into the enemies campe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the riuers banke, at such time as they should shew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues for to hinder our victuals. It was a great losse of <hi>Calibes,</hi> because he was a person in whom the Emperor put great trust, and hee had done him great seruices. They busied the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in seking for his body, the which could not be found, by reason of the great multitude of bodies which were within the riuer. They hold opinion that there died twentie thousand men this day on both sides, few of <hi>Calibes</hi> men being saued, who had giuen the onset vpon the left wing of the enemies. <hi>Synopes</hi> obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned great honour, and this day was the occasion of his good fortune. Also he had done a notable peece of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice worthie to be remembred, there being no possible
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:10494:109"/>
meanes to succour <hi>Caire,</hi> but by that same place: for this great citie was so weakned, that it required a long time for to repaire it, the which could not be done by land, but only by the riuer, looking for the reuolt the which could not be sooner the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> three moneths. Now after this victorie <hi>Synopes</hi> encamped himself within this Iland to hinder the <hi>Soldans</hi> men from passing, notwithstanding they passed ouer in the night from the one shoare vnto the other, &amp; they iudged that the enemies were forced vnto the fight, or vnto a shamfull flight, the which could not be but by the other side of the water; for by land he had no retrait at all, but by the swords point, hauing no place but beyond the water, the which bred suspition that he would make his retrait by water. For he might wel thinke that <hi>Caire</hi> was not for him, &amp; that his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise on that side was weake. As for those which fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him within <hi>Alexandria,</hi> all was changed there, &amp; in a manner euery where. Therfore it behoued the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> to haue a watchful eie vnto the enemies new practises, and to prouide well for the maintenance of his army, the which could not be done without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by reason of the scarcenesse of the victuals: for by feeding his armie he famished <hi>Caire.</hi> For there could not come victuals sufficient, neither by land nor water, for to victuall it being encamped so neare vnto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: our army hauing made prouision for victuals but for 8. dayes, keeping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues encamped in one place, so as it was resolued by the Counsell to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues assoone as they had deliuered <hi>Caire,</hi> &amp; seene the same victualled. For they supposed the enemies had made great prouision of victuals to be able to continue in their campe, their armie not being so great as ours. Insomuch as it was resolued to passe ouer halfe our
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:10494:109"/>
Armie vnto the other side, and that <hi>Synopes</hi> should not remooue out of the Iland, our purpose being no other then to hinder that the enemies should not keepe the victuals from entring into <hi>Caire.</hi> This counsell was verie secret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so much as the enemies perceiuing their victuals for to faile, had the same purpose that we had, the which was to retire themselues, the which they could not do but in the night. Hauing as yet many boates they rigged them, and the day before made a shewe to drawe towardes <hi>Syria,</hi> hauing caused part of their Armie to go out of their Campe, supposing that assoone as they should shew themselues to go out, our Armie would be on horsebacke, and by that meanes should deceiue our men, hoping that this would make them thinke they had a purpose to retire themselues on this part, the which they did: for hauing in the night made shew of assaulting our Armie, and hauing kindled fires, hee caused his men to passe ouer, and to lodge themselues along the riuer, what hindrance so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <hi>Synopes</hi> could do vnto them, for that the night was verie darke. The first that passed ouer was the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, hauing left within his Campe his Lieutenant ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall with all his footmen. In the morning we knewe that their Armie passed in part; the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> was of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to assalt the enemies within their camp, and was verie stiffe in this resolution, but the old Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines were not of this opinion, but rather to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then <hi>Synopes</hi> with men and engines, to the intent to endamage them therewith; &amp; that three-score thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men were not to be forced within their trenches. So all was deferred: they were yet of opinion, that if noise were heard, and that they passed ouer, to attempt for to force the Campe vpon their retrait. Nowe the

Soldan seeing his passage had good successe, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his men to do the like that he had done: but he was not aduertised of the supply <hi>Synopes</hi> had receiued: so as he returning for to look his men, and guiding the formost vnto the passage along by the bank side, he was assaulted by <hi>Synopes,</hi> who began the fight, wherein the Soldan was wounded: notwithstanding he passed ouer<note place="margin">The Soldan wounded in passing the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</note> the water &amp; came vnto his men, who had already pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.

Now the enemy seeing our men so near the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, began to parley, and to cause their interpreters to speake, asking for the Prince of <hi>Thanais;</hi> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the rest there was a Parthian Ensigne, who enquired for the said Prince, who at that time was visiting the guards of the trenches: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that he should be brought vnto him, &amp; hauing talked with the said Captain, who had bene long a sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier vnder his ensignes, and remaining sicke, had bene taken, and had giuen himself vnto the Soldans seruice,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:10494:110"/>
who had made him Ensigne generall, whom we do call Colonel of all the footmen: he beseeched the Prince to receiue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the victory without shedding the bloud of his soldiers, or of his own men. The which the Prince did grant vnto them, causing them to sweare to remain for euer slaues vnto the Emperour, and his subiectes<note place="margin">The Prince of Thanais nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble victorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</note> for to make warre wheresoeuer it should please him: the which they did sweare vnto. The Soldans Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant being in the night retired with some of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines into a boate. Now the Soldan being hurt, retired himselfe with his horsmen some twentie leagues, vnto certaine places which he held, where hee died of his hurt. The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> pursuing the said Soldan, found him, being not yet buried within <hi>Palema,</hi> &amp; was<note place="margin">The death of the Soldan.</note> carefull to giue an honorable buriall vnto the said Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, and entertained all his seruants curteouslie. There remained a sonne of his, with whom did ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the most part of those which would not submit themselues vnder the Empire of the Parthians, and withdrew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues vnto the borders of <hi>Libia</hi> into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine places, whither verie hardly (by reason of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts of <hi>Libia</hi>) any could come vnto them, in hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge their miserable fortune against the Parthian name. Thus ended this warre, the which had put the Emperour into a deliberation to go thither in person. When as he receiued perfect newes of our victorie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did he commend the valour and courage of the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> &amp; aboue all the noble mind of <hi>Synopes:</hi> but the losse of <hi>Calibes</hi> did hinder the ful reioycing for this happie victorie: for the Emperour did hold the losse of such a person to be great, who was greatly to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he had in the art of war. The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> was appointed by the Emperour to

command ouer <hi>Calibes</hi> charge: but the Armie was<note place="margin">The Prince of Thanais ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Siria &amp; Egypt after the death of Calibes.</note> commanded to returne from thence into <hi>Persia,</hi> for such assaires as might happen there. <hi>Synopes</hi> also was appointed Colonel general of the footmen in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours armie. The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> remaining Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerner ouer Syria and Egypt, with the same estate of the former Gouernor, the Armie was conducted back againe by the great Chamberlaine, who was come thither vpon the end of the affaires with new forces for to aide the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> if he had any need of the same: the Emperour hauing this custome, to send out forces vpon forces, vnto such places as he thought had need thereof. This happie successe comming vnto the Prince, by the means of his Lieutenants generall, made him for to knowe how necessarie his presence is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his realme, for to giue aide in euerie place, where there were affaires. Now for to returne vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Court: the king of China came to visite him at his Court, according vnto the couenantes offered<note place="margin">The king of China came vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans court, &amp; did sweare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> vnto him, the which he accepted: hee did sweare once againe obedience vnto the Emperor, who caused him to see all his greatest cities, for to make himselfe the more to be feared of this Barbarian, who kept no more promise then pleased himselfe. Hee was astonished to behold so many souldiers, and the countrie so well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with people; and aboue all, that they vsed so litle curiositie of riches in their apparell and garments, wondring that the Emperour was apparelled in meane cloath of one colour, without any other fashion: but<note place="margin">The meane apparell of Tamerlan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> to counteruaile that, he had about him men which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be kings. At the same time when the king of China was at the court, the Emperour receiued newes of the victorie against the Soldan, for the which the

Emperour reioyced, making feastes and turnies in his Court in token of mirth, and this reioycing continued for the space of eight dayes. After the Emperor had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen order for the double paying of his Armie that came into Persia, vnder the conduct of the great Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine, and <hi>Synopes</hi> Colonel generall in the imperial Armie, the Emperour went vnto <hi>Quinzay</hi> for to see his sonne, and visite the people of this countrie, who desired his presence, and also for the affaires which hee had not as yet established in these countries, as he had done in all the rest of his kingdomes, Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> not being willing to take so much authoritie vpon him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Emperor had sent vnto him a speciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the same: but hee doubting least this people would take some occasion to murmure, and the fault thereof might haue bene laide vpon him, being wont alwaies to say wisely, that these maner of affaires were the prises of a skilfull Maister, hauing alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Emperors comming. Then did the Prince with equitie cause all to vse the like lawes, the same waightes &amp; measures, &amp; he imposed certaine tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes throughout all his kingdoms, euerie one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their abilitie, for to help his affaires, and lay the foundation of his reuenues, and store-houses for victuals, the which were dispersed as the want in his Armies required: for the Emperour was wont to say,<note place="margin">An apt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</note> that an Armie must be made like vnto the shape of a man; he called the Captaines the head, the souldiers the armes, money the feet which made it for to march, and victuals the bellie that nourished the whole. In so<note place="margin">A notable say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Tamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</note> much as he often said, that an Armie was inuincible which had a perfect man: for (said he) it fighteth when it will, and neuer hazardeth any thing to ill purpose:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10494:112"/>
for the ouersights of warre do happen at such time as this body is lame of a leg, or maimed in an arme, or that the bellie is famished, or when the head is sicke. At such time as hee sent the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> against the Soldan, he doubted nothing but the head and the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; because the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> was a yong Prince: and for victuals, he had but bad prouision of them: for he was wont at such time as he was to begin any war, for to make a great collection of victuals the yeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the which was not done now, attributing this victorie vnto his good fortune, which would not turne her backe vpon him, and not vnto his wisdome. So the Emperour arriuing neare vnto <hi>Quinzay,</hi> Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> comming to meete him two dayes iourney off, with all the chiefe Lords of the countrie, together with the principall Citizens, who were preparing for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour the most magnificent receiuing that might be, as well by water as by land.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:10494:113"/>
to beare good will each vnto other, and faith and obedience vnto him, two flowers which raised him vp vnto his greatnesse. There was also another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, which was, that the Chinois would not by anie meanes sweare obedience vnto <hi>Odmar,</hi> as representing the Emperours person, by reason of certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints he made against them. The Emperour who did temper all things with his mildnesse, did honor <hi>Axalla</hi> with this charge and commandement, for to end all these particular matters. <hi>Axalla</hi> found Prince <hi>Odmar</hi> vpon the entrance of the borders, who receiued him with all the magnificence that might be: and hauing honored and feasted him the space of three dayes with all the royaltie that might be, after he had imparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the affaires of the Emperour his Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he set forward towards him with all diligence, and Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> went forward towards <hi>Paguin,</hi> where he was receiued of the Gouernour with all possible honor. And hauing assembled all the Emperours forces, hee set forward towards the borders of China, to haue an enteruiew at <hi>Pochio,</hi> where the meeting place was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He passed by <hi>Quantou:</hi> there did he view this strong citie, which he had won against the hope euen of his maister, who supposed the same was able to resist him six moneths, he hauing taken it in three: so as euery one for his valour came to reuerence him, honoring &amp; magnifying him, desiring his gouernment, because he was milde, curteous, and of easie accesse to them that had businesse with him. To be short, the Emperor who knew with wisdom and readinesse how to order his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, could not reforme them but by the changing of <hi>Odmar,</hi> who in truth was seuere and graue: but <hi>Axalla</hi> being milde &amp; curteous, did knit again euery one vnto

So the king of China arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued within a league of <hi>Pochio</hi> with all his Court: hee set forward vnto a plaine, where he and Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> did see each other, who was much better accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from whom the king did as much differ as from the Emperors owne person. They met three seuerall times together: the king desired to be admitted into a Citie, which the Emperor had granted vnto him by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Prince <hi>Odmar</hi> declared that it was of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, therefore Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> was by the Emperor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for to be iudge of this controuersie. In the end they required another further within the countrie, the which the king accepted: so he was put into possession of that city, the situatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof was very pleasant, being compassed about with a lake. <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing discouered that this barbarous king did earnestly desire it only for his pleasure, and not for any other euill intent, the city which hee deliuered being seated vpon a riuer further within his countrie, and that other within our countrie compassed about with our fortresses: but <hi>Odmar</hi> did not allow of that, and supposed it to be for an euill purpose, as for to contriue some new practises. <hi>Odmar</hi> being an
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10494:114"/>
olde man, who knew the kings vnfaithfulnes, although he had made him know it well enough vnto his smart, hauing (as I haue said) won twenty or thirtie Cities fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and aboue four-score leagues of countrie, at such time as hee obtained the last battaile, during the time that the Emperour was in his last voyage against the Persians. So the enteruiewe continued yet betweene Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> and the king of China on the plaine, a tent being pitched, whither Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> did come vnto him, whom he continually honoured as much as the Emperours owne person, where after they had long time treated by interpreters, it was in the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that the king of China should enter againe into <hi>Quinanci,</hi> not suffering him to put anie Garrison into it, nor to fortifie the same: but euen as a prisoner &amp; sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto the Emperour, he should enioy it, &amp; it should be his owne, inioying all the reuenue thereof, neither should he carrie any kingly ensignes, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse<note place="margin">The resolution of the meeting between Axalla and the king of China.</note> leaue of the Gouernour for the Emperour: hee should notwithstanding haue a guard of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men for his person; and should giue knowledge vnto the said Gouernour of his iourney, before he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Emperours countries, the which hee must passe for to go thither. Now the Citie was situated in the middest of a verie great lake, in the which were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Ilands, wherin there were an infinite number of houses of pleasure, and it had bene alwaies a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate place, where the kings of China were wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in alkinds of pleasures that were there to be found: in so much as this barbarous king did not respect the conditions propounded vnto him, so as he might make his abode there, as it were in an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage. Hauing left vnto his brother the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:10494:115"/>
of his whole kingdome, through the displeasure he had of his bondage whereunto he was brought; a courage certainly magnanimous, and worthie a nation made ciuill with the best learning, and vnworthy the name of a Barbarian wherewith wee called him. So Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing visited all the cities newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and deliuered vp by the king of China, hauing brought all things into a peaceable estate, he sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperour to beseech that it would please him to grant vnto his returne, and also for to vnderstand, if he allowed of all things which he had done. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror<note place="margin">Tamerlan his custome in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing gouerners ouer his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces.</note> who vsed this custome, often to change the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerners of his Prouinces, would gladlie haue retained Prince <hi>Odmar</hi> neare vnto his person, and put another into his place, seeing him olde, and also for that he was not liked of the souldiers and people, by meanes of his age and frowardnesse, the which the Emperour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing, did purpose for to bring him neare vnto his person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for to send in his place the great Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, who was young, and would bee more acceptable the he, and more able to sustaine all thinges, as well in respect of the vntemperatenesse of the aire, as also for the paines of warres; determining that if a verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary occasion did not happen, to haue him neare his person, for to serue him with counsell, and to ease him in the gouernment of his estate. So <hi>Axalla</hi> was called backe againe, being commaunded to come vnto the Emperour, who was at <hi>Cambalu,</hi> where hee stayed his returne, and to suffer in staying the great Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine to come thither. The Prince of <hi>Vauguefu,</hi> who had of long time verie faithfully serued the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and whose faithfulnesse was most especiallie acknowledged in all his warres hee had conducted,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:10494:115"/>
wherewith both himselfe and a brother of his had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued verie well. Notwithstanding it was not conuenient to leaue him for to command absolutely, as wel for that often times honours doe change the affection vpon occasion, as also because the Parthians do verie vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie obey strangers. The Emperour had also a desire to honout him with another gouernment, where hee should doe him better seruice then there: for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had this custome, to make a note of those that<note place="margin">Tamerlan his worthy custom</note> were fit to doe him seruice, and hee remembred such, to imploy them in the gouernment of his estate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were in peace or warre, without being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned with demanding, there being no man in his court so bold as to demaund anie estates or honours of him: for money and goods it was permitted, but not for anie other thing, esteeming that they which doe ambitiouslie seeke for gouernments and charges, do it not to vse them well, neither for the Princes or peoples profite. He had also this Maxime, that hee did change them, and they for all that did not thinke themselues any thing disgraced, thinking it verily the destruction of an estate, how flourishing soeuer it be, to deliuer countries and places vnto Gouerners as heritages: for in the end they vsurpe them as their owne, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state how great and mightie souer it be (being knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) comming to be seuered in peeces, is at the end of his power and authoritie, and becommeth nothing. And alwayes for the most part he did imploy them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a lesse vnto a greater charge of countrie: sometimes he called them neare vnto his person, to leade his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the which was the greatest honour within the Empire: and they were obeyed throughout all his countries euen as the Emperours owne person. I haue
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10494:116"/>
seene two of them alone, after that foure, then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as at this present; they are come vnto this number euen as the Empire increased vnto his greatnesse: none of the other hauing iurisdiction of all the Empire but they, and vpon whom as on seuen pillers, the Princes person doth relie his greatest affaires, of the which they do not speake but in the presence of the Prince, &amp; as he propoundeth the matters, for to haue their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise therein, whether it be of peace or warre. Now to return vnto the Prince, who was at <hi>Cambalu,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>Odmar</hi> and <hi>Axalla, Odmar</hi> an olde man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading the Emperor vnto peace, and <hi>Axalla</hi> who was warlike, an enemie vnto rest, and desirous of glorie, did prouoke him vnto warre. But the Princes borders were stretched out so farre from the Court, that he could not set downe any plot for that matter: so as seeing the countrie of <hi>Quinzay</hi> a countrie of quiet, he iudged this estate to be fit for <hi>Odmar,</hi> who was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy olde, and allyed vnto the Emperour, who would bee fitter then hee to gouerne this countrie, as also this reuerent olde age which was in him, would bee verie conuenient for to traine vp the youth of the young Prince, who was brought vp in this place, and that there was none fitter then he: but the means how to set this forward was a thing he durst not vndertake, because he would not be noted to haue any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose then that which proceeded from the will of his maister. Now it fell out that after a certaine time the Emperour receiued newes that the ancient discipline of the Armie did degenerate, in so much that euerie souldier desired the Emperours presence, rebelling often against their heads which were there, for that they had not the accustomed authoritie for to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

Nowe this Armie was the life of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, the terrour of the whole world, and that which maintained in obedience so many countries conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the sword. The Emperour being aduertised hereof by the Captaines, was troubled: for to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thither in person, alwayes to remaine there, his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and rest which he promised vnto himself did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde him, so as hauing secretly sent for <hi>Odmar</hi> and<note place="margin">Consultatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Prince who did alreadie perceiue the sweetnesse that was in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in comparison of the wilde life in Armies; as heretofore he had taken delight therein, so at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent apprehending this maner of liuing, hee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to preserue his estate by his Lieutenants, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to rest, and enioy the fruits of his trauaile, being alreadie of the age of fiftie yeares, he thought before hee died to take his rest, and to content himselfe with the remembrance and contemplation of so many happie victories and worthie deedes, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue in full peace his conquestes without enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or attempting any thing but in his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: so as he turned himselfe towards Prince <hi>Axal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and sayd vnto him, that surely hee would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Odmar</hi> in quiet as long as hee could; and surelie<note place="margin">Resolution.</note> hee should haue bene vngratefull vnto his seruices, if hee had not prouided for him a quiet life: that his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion did greatly content him, for to giue vnto him this gouernement, that hee might end his dayes in those quiet and peaceable countries, in continuing

with honour the faithfulnesse of his seruice. That his own person wold make his abode at <hi>Sachetay,</hi> to be the nearer vnto the occasions his Armie might haue of his presence in <hi>Persia,</hi> where he would leaue the same, and would increase it with the number of thirtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse: but his pleasure was that hee should go and command ouer it, for that he knew him the only person in his Empire which could performe that seruice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing tried the affection that the souldiers did beare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, together with the care hee alwayes had for the obseruation of militarie discipline: that hee trusted him with all his estate, trusting him with his Armie, whereupon onely depended the keeping of so manie great prouinces, and the terror vnto so many nations, differing both in language and manners, ouer whom he commanded, and of whom he was the conquerour; that he only should haue an eie vnto all that should be necessarie for the maintenance of his Armie; and that the first foundation of his reuenues &amp; the best should be appointed thereunto, as well for the recompence of his souldiers, as for the ordinarie paymentes; that hee would haue them to be kept in the ancient disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline<note place="margin">The discipline of the Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> of the Parthians, the which is, to lodge in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen fieldes, and to keepe within the Campe, and from three moneths vnto three moneths to diflodge, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, and paying for all; that he had alwayes bene brought vp within his Armie, for to consider the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and deserts of euerie one; that hee had gouerned them; that the Captaines and souldiers should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed as hee should appoint according to their deserts; that Persia was the place where hee would keepe his Armie, for that their mindes are more stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and impatient in bondage.

In the end they so earnestly be sought his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, that he graunted them the bringing of him vp in his youth amongst them. So the Emperour went vnto <hi>Samarcand,</hi> hauing taken such order as was conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent throughout all his Empire: he determineth to make his ordinarie abode there, and to make this citie (the place of his birth) worthie to be the seate of his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, so faire would he make it, large, and beautified with all manner of faire buildings. Deuotion did also drawe him vnto solitarinesse, where unto his nature inclined as much as was possible. Where had it not bene for a certaine desire of glory he had, which forced his nature of long time, he had plaied this part. It is also a great wisedome to knowe how to commaund his inclination, and also to be able to content himselfe with glorie, and to suppresse his ambition, and enioying it, to begin in good time to giue vnto himselfe a happie end, if it be possible, and that this is the will of fortune the enemie vnto mans quiet: for oftentimes that which
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:10494:118"/>
men purpose, God the chiefe gouernour of all things doth frame it after another manner: but the happe of the Emperour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the which I do attribute vnto the honor and reuerence he did beare vnto the Diuinitie, was the cause the same had care of him, and fauoured his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. Now returning backe againe vnto Prince <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla,</hi> who after he had receiued this commaundement, was nothing sluggish: so as he gathered together from all partes the old souldiers which had bene discharged, it seeming vnto him they had enioyed sufficient rest: he sent also on the other side vnto the Moscouite, to draw from thence souldiers on horsebacke for his guard, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting greatly in their valour and courage, and all the way he entertayned the Emperour about the order it would please him should be obserued in his armie. <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> propounded vnto him that which was conuenient to be done: the Emperour then did either adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto<note place="margin">Tamerlan the most excellent man in the art of warre.</note> or take away as it seemed good vnto him: for in the arte of warre he had so great knowledge and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that no man was equall vnto him.

All matters thus dispatched, Prince <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi> hauing taken his leaue of the Imperiall Maiestie, he set forward, &amp; had with him some twentie thousand horse, all the flourishing youth of the Court acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. The Emperor desiring they should be trayned vp in the paines of wars, rather then in the delicacies of a Court: for the Prince did aduance vnto charges those which were in his armie, and not such as remained in his Court, except they were by his expresse commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement neare about his owne person. The Emperour whilest these matters passed thus, receiued newes from the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> appointed Gouernor ouer Siria and Egypt; who sent him word, that all things in those parts were very quiet, a thing which brought great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment vnto the Prince, who had his minde wholly bent vnto peace, busying himselfe in building of his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Samarcand,</hi> and in decking of a sumptuous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">Tamerla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> built a Temple at Samarcand, and called it the Temple of Salomon.</note> the which he had built; wherein he meant to make his Tombe, and for his successors, the which he caused to be named the Temple of <hi>Salomon.</hi> And there did he hang vp all the Trophes which he had conquered from his enemies: he caused also therein to be grauen all the battels he had fought, together with the diuersitie of<note place="margin">Tamerlan his Zealous grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</note> Nations he had ouercome, and the countries hee had conquered. To the end he might (he said) shew vnto his great God, how greatly he did acknowledge his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits &amp; goodnesse. And because he had many Christians
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:10494:119"/>
of all kindes of artes and occupations, whom he had brought from all partes where they had giuen them vnto him: his pleasure was they should haue a Temple built for to pray in the same, the which hee called the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Iesus. This had <hi>Axalla</hi> obtained of the Prince, who liued according vnto this law, and many others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, of whom our armie was compounded, the Emperor seruing himselfe with them indifferently, hauing suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thoroughout all his kingdomes the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of Iesus Christ, euen within the armie it selfe, and the sacrifices of the Christians were offered, the Christians being his best souldiers, and the chiefest in his Court: so had he also many countries vnder his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience the which were all wholly Christians, whose ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice he vsed in his warres, who would not be forced nor helde for other then such as were of his religion, in as much as they worshipped one onely God, and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (no more then he) the pluralitie of Gods, the which aboue all other things he had in detestation and horror, driuing away and destroying the Idolaters, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring them slaues in all the countries of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And as this Emperor was religious, he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heare holy men, as well of his owne religion, as of the Christians, whose austeritie he wondred at, being without ostentation as that of <hi>Guines</hi> was, and of others fayning holinesse for to get honour and praise amongst the people: but he did see one thing throughout all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, whereat he greatly wondered, religious people who liued with dried things, refusing all moist things, which were in the deserts for the name of Iesus Christ, whom they account God, depriuing themselues of all delights for to follow his crosse &amp; passion, things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy admiration. He heard also recited the persecutions
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:10494:120"/>
of the Romaine Emperours against the Christians: this same caused in the Emperour (who was naturally reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious) a respect towards them which were of this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, recommending himselfe vnto their prayers, and putting as much trust in them as in his other subiects, maintaining them in the libertie and exercise of their conscience, as if they had beene his owne naturall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. And we must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend in the Emperour two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the which were without intermission exercised by him, that is to say, godlinesse &amp; iustice: for three times<note place="margin">The godlinesse and iustice of Tamerlan.</note> in the weeke at <hi>Samarcand</hi> he ministred open iustice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the meanest, in his Imperiall Maiestie, a thing which made him beloued of the people ouer whom he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In the other dayes he gaue secret audience for the affaires of his estate, &amp; tooke aduice for matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which were decided daily in his presence. He had such seuerity in his counsell, that they must needes deale truly before him, &amp; without all passion in discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Notwithstanding he alwaies shewed himself cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation, &amp; made himself both beloued &amp; feared of his people: he neuer changed his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept<note place="margin">Tamerlan his great liberality</note> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted great falts against him: of all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the late Emperor his vnkle he did not change one of them, but he did withall encrease their estates, making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this change to feele his liberality, which he made strangers for to tast also, vnto whom he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to giue, to binde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him.

three monethes within one houre, both the ordinarie and extraordinarie expences, they presented it so well digested vnto him. His reuenue was not certaine, for he augmented or increased it according vnto his owne good pleasure, and one certaine day in the yeare he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased or deminished the same. His great Tresurer was very familiar with him, as one who made him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an account of his doings, and also for to receiue at euery houre his commandements: the great Treasurer paied the estates of all the Princes and great officers with his owne handes, and all the reuenues by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe or by deputies for whom he was answerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing administred generally in all the Prouinces by him for to distribute them according to the Princes will. These estates were verie daungerous: I haue seene two of them punished with death most cruelly, being found to abuse their offices.

During the time that the Emperour did remaine at <hi>Samarcand,</hi> he did greatly reforme the estate of his reuenues, &amp; euerie one made account that he would make a great founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein, and they knew not wherefore he made so great a heape thereof: he was accounted to be very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, which is a point of no small commendation in<note place="margin">Tamerlan ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry liberall.</note> the great; the same was verie ordinarie, and as it were borne with him, being wont to say, that on the day he had not giuen something, that hee had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all that day: saying, that giuing doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende men, making them like vnto God. Often glorying that neuer anie had refused that which hee offered vnto them. Nowe let vs returne againe vnto <hi>Axalla,</hi> who as soone as he was come vnto the armie,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:10494:121"/>
caused the old laws to be published, the which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror did obserue when he did first begin his wars, the which had beene cancelled, and left in all the orders of warfare, many strange fashions being mingled therein, which did cause the decay of the militarie discipline. Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> assembled the Captaines of the armie, declaring vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the disorders which were amongst their companies, for the which he did not blame them, but the heads which had commaunded them these two or three yeares: but hee de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ired them, together with himselfe to take the paines for to reduce all things into the first forme of the Parthian discipline; that he would not giue vnto them any new thing, but he was only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous indeede for to cause the auncient discipline to be obserued. The which was, first to encampe euery where;<note place="margin">The Parthian discipline.</note> to entrench the campe, commanding that the souldier who was become daintie in the garrisons, should accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome himselfe againe from hence forward vnto the paines of the field, strengthening himselfe by trauelling with those which were appointed onely for the fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the campe, the number of whom was alwayes fiue and twentie thousand in the Imperiall Armie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he would haue the first number wherein there was anie commandement amongst the footmen, should be ten,<note place="margin">The order of Tamerlan his standing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe.</note> next an hundred, then a thousand, and afterwards ten thousand, ouer whom one should commaund alone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the Colonell generall: amongst the horsemen an hundred, next a thousand, then ten thousand, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the generall of the armie should commaund o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all. He caused particular viewes to be made, for to settle this order. He had threescore thousand footmen within his armie, ouer whom commaunded sixe Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels vnder the Colonell generall, there were 40000.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:10494:121"/>
horse vnder foure heades, whereof there were ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand light horsemen. He had his particular gards beside these, which did amount vnto 2000 horse, and 4000 footmen, these encamped about the generals person. Behold the estate which the Emperour commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be obserued within the Army, the which onely they called Imperiall, the others not hauing that name: for there is in <hi>Siria</hi> an army of thre-score thousand me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, twenty thousand horsemen, and forty thousand footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as many in <hi>China:</hi> as many towards <hi>Cambalu:</hi> as many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Moscouie:</hi> as many towards <hi>Cherroneze,</hi> but not in the field, except then when neede required. But this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my thus ordered was a sound body, the which was fit to strengthen the other bodies of his armies (the which were weake and ill ordered) vpon the first need. Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> trauelled also to search out the inuentions which the Christians had, and this caused he to be performed by meanes of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who did traficke into all partes: and he spared no cost for to get all sorts of inuentions and engines, the which might serue in the art militarie, wherein was all his study, for to excell in the same. So as he obtained the inuention of artillerie, the which was<note place="margin">The inuention of Artillery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Christians.</note> new amongst the Christians, and it was brought vnto him by a Greeke, who had serued him euer since the death of Prince <hi>Andronicus.</hi> The same did greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonish euery one, to behold the violence of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: that caused them also to study the more thereon, for to get the full perfection thereof, wherein the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did spend greatly, in causing some of them to be made, after he had gotten people which had skill to make them, as also for to get some of them already made. For we had alwayes indeede this inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to thrust forward a bullet by a violent motion,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:10494:122"/>
but with this powder it was a thing wonderfull, and of great astonishment. The Emperour would haue the prayse of this inuention to be giuen vnto Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> the which he caused to be written within the historie of his raigne for an eternall memory, amongst the seruices he had done him for the increase of his Empire, euen as also he had acknowledged them in earnest, hauing giuen vnto him more then a million of reuenues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his ordinarie pensions, the which did amount vnto as much. <hi>Odmar</hi> had not much lesse, and also the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> had a great estate. I haue left vnspoken of an infinite number of other acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of seruices, the which he bestowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that serued him well: for the meanest souldier might hope for the greatest honours of the Empire: for the first notable seruice of the soldier was remembred, for to encourage him to do the better, so as the reward for the good, and punishment for the wicked, were distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according vnto their desertes. That same held this great Empire linked together, in such sort, as it could not disseuer what onset soeuer he had, how great soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the same were; so as by that order, as soone as any warre was begun, it was as soone ended. And for his new conquests, they did order the same so well for him, that reuoltes did seldome happen in the same; and if any did chance, they were well punished, and but of small waight. Thus our estate was in his force, &amp; at his period, &amp; very hardly could be greater. Our Prince waxed old, &amp; became heauy, his sonnes grew to be great, &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to worship the sonne rising. But the Emperour did beare such loue vnto them, that there was nothing did vexe him, nor any iealousie, but the feare he had that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death they should not haue so much valor &amp; wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:10494:122"/>
as to preserue his estate together, fearing diuisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, often lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting that he had not a third son for to agree them both whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they should be at strife, as it is a thing which doth often happen; and he was therein a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: for this great Monarchie through deuision of the brethren was ouerthrown and dispersed after his death, as we shall see in their historie. Now to returne vnto the affaires that passed there, Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> who was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be doing, being returned from <hi>Babilon,</hi> whither hee went vpon some reuolt, gaue the Emperour to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that the <hi>Ottamans</hi> hauing knowledge of the death of the Emperour <hi>Baiazet</hi> within the prison at <hi>Samarcand,</hi> had chosen his second sonne called <hi>Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi> and that they gathered together, a great Armie for to conquer all <hi>Natolia</hi> againe. And that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour who was troubled much with the inward warre against his bretheren in Greece, harkened not after the affaires of <hi>Asia.</hi> That this was of great importance for his greatnesse. That euen within <hi>Persia Democa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> had gathered forces together, and came towardes him. That he thought good to giue his Maiestie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of these newes, to the ende it would please him to aduise himselfe therein; that he was most ready to receiue his commandements, and that he would set forward after hee had receiued the same; that hee did assure him, his army was wel disposed to do him seruice; that it was much better to go &amp; meete the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to fortifie his borders, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to stay for the warres in <hi>Persia,</hi> where their minds were not as yet sufficiently confirmed in his friendship; that <hi>Lichibanes</hi> who was gouernour in <hi>Nato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> had retired his forces vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this rumour out of <hi>Bursia,</hi> the which he had vnma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teled and destroyed, not hauing sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t forces for to keepe it, and had retired the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:10494:123"/>
vnto the mountaines looking for the forces he hoped to receiue from his Maiesty, seeing there was no city of importance in the champion country. These newes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come vnto the Emperour, he assembled together his<note place="margin">Consultation.</note> counsell, where these affaires were consuled of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was in the end resolued, that Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> shold<note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And to this ende there was a commandement sent from the Emperor vnto all the Cities of his kingdomes, and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners wer appointed for to make choise of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, some for wars, the other for the workes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Victuals were commanded in all the Emperours countries for setting forward of the Armie.

It was published ouer all that the Emperour went thither in proper person, for to punish once againe this proude race of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> In the meane time <hi>Aralla</hi> marched directly towardes the borders, and he went like a ball of snow, his Armie

alwayes increasing, being glad of so good occasion. The Emperour hauing sent vnto him his resolution, with a commandement also to take and leaue all that should be necessarie for the maintenance of his Army, in all the places of the Emperours reuenues. <hi>Axalla</hi> marched with diligence, being desirous to come vnto the borders, and to ioyne with the forces that stayed for him, for to fight with and expulse the enemy, before the Emperour should come vnto him, whereof he had an expresse commandement, the Emperour for this occasion marching slowly, in such maner as he greatly desired to execute the same by Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> this iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney being troublesome vnto him, by reason of his indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. Where to the end nothing shold be wanting vnto him, he sent a commandement vnto the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> to go and meete with Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> as soone as he had setled his gouernment. He caused also two or three thousand horse to go one after another, who came vnto him with diligence. Passing also by <hi>Tauris,</hi> he drew from thence fiue thousand horsemen, and ten thousand footmen of ordinary garrison, ouer whom commanded a Lord called <hi>Aliren,</hi> greatly affectioned vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors seruice, and principality of Prince <hi>Axalla.</hi> Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing also in <hi>Armenia</hi> hee drew out of the garrisons as many as amounted vnto twenty thousand horse, so as his army was very neare 80000 horsmen, and 160000 foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the Emperor making account to be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied also with as many forces from <hi>Parthia,</hi> as also from the <hi>Moscouite.</hi> Now the Emperour could not come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Tamarlan waxed sickly.</note> it was neare sixe moneths and slowly as I haue sayd marched his owne person, not being wel at ease, hauing complanied these 3. moneths of a paine in his reines, in so much as some doubted greatly lest this sicknesse wold

For he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten sayd amongst his men, that he did acknowledge him selfe to be mortall, and that he was subiect vnto the law of nature; that he did often thinke of paying his tribute. Now he looked for <hi>Odmar,</hi> who should bring the Prince his eldest sonne vnto him, prouiding wisely for his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires before he would march any further, faining to be desirous to carrie him with him, and to teach him to know his subiectes, and the meanes to serue him selfe with them if any ill fortune happened vnto him.

At such time as the Embassador came, who was a very wise man, they thought Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> had only certaine troupes of ten of twelue thousand horse: but as soone as they vnderstood of the great army he had, they entred into suspition, that the same might be as well against them as <hi>Calepin,</hi> although he assured them of all maner of good will of the Emperors part, insomuch as present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was negotiated to treat some argreement between the brethren, at the least a truce, but peruailed nothing: for they would not trust their elder brother. Vpon the Embassadours returne, we learned where <hi>Calepin</hi> was and his army, and of what quantity it was. After he had made a generall reuiew, and caused a muster to be had of all the souldiers, hee marched directly towards the enemie who was in <hi>Caramania. Calepin</hi> was greatly astonished to see the diligence this Armie had made, the which he had caused to be viewed by his spies; hee did thinke it had bene but of ten or twelue thousand men onely: but when he knew how great an Armie it was, he entred into a great feare, insomuch as hauing committed the whole charge of his Army vnto a <hi>Bassa,</hi> he retired towards the sea; hee remaining onely of the stocke of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> they thought it not good hee should hazard his person vnto the euent of the battell, although his Armie were great. But the <hi>Persians</hi> and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:10494:125"/>
the <hi>Mamelues</hi> had the principall forces, which made him doubt least any disgrace happening vnto him, they should make their agreement vnto his domage, the which was not ill aduised. He had also intelligence from <hi>Persia</hi> that the Emperour marched forward, for to assist his forces with another great Armie, insomuch as hee repented that he had stirred the sleeping dogge. The Greeke on the other side entred into a great suspition, of the great preperation the which was made in euery place, not thinking that it was onely for <hi>Calepin:</hi> but in respect of his estate hee began to seeke the meanes<note place="margin">The Greeke Emperour did seeke aide of the Turke his mortall enemy, against Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlan his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued friend.</note> to assure the same, and also to demaund succour of <hi>Calepin,</hi> affirming that the plot of this warre was begun against them both, and that the Emperour would not content himselfe to haue the <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Also hee had not desired the <hi>Parthian</hi> Emperour to vndertake this voyage, and much lesse had made anie countenance to fauour him, for feare of breaking with <hi>Calepin,</hi> with whom hee had made a certaine agreement, so faint hearted was hee. All these matters put him in a great doubt, and made him to thinke vpon ioyning himselfe with <hi>Calepin</hi> in good earnest, for to resist our forces if hee might. All these cogitations were good, but it was very late to aduise there of now, matters being very doubtfull in respect of <hi>Calepin,</hi> who was of the same mind, if he had had the leasure: but all remained now vpon the hazard
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:10494:126"/>
of a battell, the which he was constrained to aduenture, seeing that delay did bring more hurt then profit. Also the forces which he did hazard, were most of them <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> and <hi>Mamelues,</hi> banished men and fugitiues, who had taken the contrary part against the Emperour.

This same was the <hi>Bassa</hi> who was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the day before the battell, wherein <hi>Baiazet</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, vnto whom the Emperour did giue a horse: he sayd that he was assured that he knew our maner of fight, and had noted well the fault <hi>Baiazet</hi> had committed in the battell the which he had lost, the which did bring them more hurt by reason of the sayd Emperours presence, being a Captiue, then for any other losse, the same ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene much more bloudie on our side: and he sayd true. And this was the occasion wherefore he would not haue <hi>Calepin</hi> commit <hi>Baiazet</hi> his fault; behold the reasons of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> as I haue sayd,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10494:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had made a generall muster, hee had found to be in the Imperiall Armie an hundred thousand footmen, and foure-score thousand horsemen, there were of them threescore thousand most braue and resolute men, of the Princes trayned men and all of them old souldiers, there were foure score thousand very good men who where commanded by <hi>Sinopes,</hi> desirous of honour and glory. As soone as the enemie had turned his face towards vs, and that Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> had asked the aduise of the Princes and Captaines of the Army, he marched straight towards him vnto <hi>Goualache,</hi> the which was yet thirtie leagues from vs; who marched in small iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, neuer going farre from the sea side, in respect of victuals, whereof they receiued with ease good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, so as all thinges abounded within their Army, but we had some want thereof. Now in the end Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> commanded a <hi>Parthian</hi> Captaine called <hi>Stucan,</hi> who did leade the light horsemen of the Army, to haue an eye that the enemies did not surpirse the Army, and that we should not faile but haue word thereof, as soone as they drue neare vnto vs. Now he was a very wittie and vigilant Captaine and a man of enterprise, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as hauing a souldier of the countrie with him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place where their Armie was lodged, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the language, hee thought with himselfe that in an Armie of sundrie nations he might intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle himselfe as it did march, and performe some braue peece of seruice: the which he hauing imparted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> hee allowed well of the enterprise, and thought that it might bee performed. So <hi>Stucan</hi> aduaunced forward with three thousand horse within ten leagues of the Armie, and arriued at <hi>Regdin,</hi> where hee found a part of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> Armie aduaunced,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10494:127"/>
and hauing gotten vnderstanding by some prisoners, that the enemies marched towards the forefront of the Army, hauing viewed their Campe, he determined to enter into the same by the meanes of this souldier, who vnderstood the language, fayning that hee came from some seruice, whither he had bene sent for to be a guide vnto two thousand <hi>Persian</hi> horse, who returned from thence, and that at this very time he would mingle himselfe and surprise them vnawares, the which fell out: for hauing aduanced two hundred horse with<note place="margin">A stratageme.</note> these souldiers, they mingled themselues within the<note place="margin">The worthy exployt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In the morning they were greatly astonished whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vnderstood our Army was as yet ten leagues off, and that they were but three thousand horse, the which had put so great disorder in the campe. The <hi>Bassa</hi> was determined to stay for our army, and if it were possible to weary the same before he came vnto the battell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aduertised that we had not victuals at our owne pleasure. Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> being come within fiue leagues of the enemies army, he intrenched his army, and made a shew of abiding there. Now he was very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to view the situation of the enemies Campe, and hauing one day aduanced all his Army in a playne within two leagues of the enemies Army, he would
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10494:127"/>
set forward for to view their countenance, and the place where they were encamped: the which he hauing done, he perceiued the way by which their victuals did come vnto them, and raysing the Campe, he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded either to compell them for to fight, or else to lodge betweene them and the sea, for to cut off the way of their victuals: for he was well aduertised of the enemies purposes: and being vncamped, he marched in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell array directly towardes the enemy, as if he meant to haue assaulted him within his trenches. In the meane time he caused his Armie to be lodged within a league of him. Now the <hi>Bassa</hi> who had not stirred out of his Campe, knew not what was our purpose, our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie hauing bene in battell array, within the view of their Campe aboue eight houres, in the meane time our souldiers lodged. The enemie who did not thinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such matter, was greatly astonished, when some of his men came and declared vnto him that we were lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged so neare vnto him, and did hinder their victuals, and hauing assembled the chiefe Captaines of his Army, to haue their aduise, hee determined to come vnto the fight, and giue a battell, if he did perceiue that our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was to hinder him from the sea, he would yet inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor as much as he could to procure that his victuals might come, making triall by scoutes to do the same. So the day being come, the <hi>Bassa</hi> caused sixe thousand horse to issue out for to discouer our purposes, giuing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sent to hazard nothing, but to retire if they did see that any did stop the passage: so as it falling out that the Captaine of our side, the which had this charge, was this day on horseback, with x. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse, who vpon the first alarum of his enemie, did beate them brauely into their Campe, the which the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10494:128"/>
               <hi>Bassa</hi> perceiuing, and that it was the purpose of our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he supposed hee could no longer shun the battell. And the same night he began to approach vnto the point of their campe neare vnto a mountaine, the which was nearer vnto them then vs, to lodge there in parcels, and also to the ende we should not lodge there at all, the which they did foresee might greatly preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice them if we should win the same before them. So in the morning Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> had certaine newes that the enemies Army did dislodge, the which he desiring to descrie, mounted on horsebacke, and aduanced for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with some twentie thousand horse for to behold their dislodging, determining to set vpon them if hee saw cause, and followed them to take an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to do it vpon their lodging. But it fell out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: for seeing their countenance, hee supposed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently what they would do, and hauing called vnto him the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> and <hi>Sinopes,</hi> hee sayd vnto them, that he thought it not conuenient to suffer the enemie for to intrench vpon this mountaine, for the discommodities we should receiue thereby. For this cause hee commaunded <hi>Sinopes</hi> to set vpon them with twentie thousand men, and to hinder them from this mountaine, assuring himselfe that if he did win it, hee should haue the victorie of the battell most assured. Now the place was such, as the horsemen could by no meanes do anie seruice there, by reason of a marrish that was at the foot of the same mountaine, the which did stretch a good league, but the footmen did easily march thither. Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> assured himselfe hee had good footmen, and that <hi>Sinopes</hi> who was desirous of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, would not omit to giue a strong assault vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies vpon this occasion. So our army being wholly
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:10494:128"/>
ranged in battell arraie, Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> caused all his footmen to aduance forward: hee determined to fight on foot if the enemies did wilfully attempt the same mountaine, and hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the Prince of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nais</hi> to keepe himselfe at the head of all the horsemen who were in battell array, he aduanced forward, for to succor <hi>Sinopes</hi> in good time, who aduanced lustily with twenty thousand men only. Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with himselfe, as the best, to cause them to march along by a litle hill, and that by this way they shold do their endeuors by surprising of the enemy, who could not perceiue them: so as they should as soone feele their blowes and assault, as see their persons; this being<note place="margin">A Maxime.</note> a <hi>Maxime</hi> that an enemy throughly viewed is halfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered: this was the cause that the same became so great an astonishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto the enemy, to see himself assaulted not knowing whether it were with all the footmen, or part of the same. The enemies Army was at the other end of the marrish, &amp; we were within the view the one of the other: but euen as our men did giue this onset, you might haue seene their whole army stir, for to resist the strong force of our men, the which continued a good houre. The <hi>Bassa</hi> who was a discreet Captaine, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the footmen he had to aide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which where vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this mountaine, and although our men vpon the first fury had won the top of the mountaine, so as then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies did fight on foot comming vp, the which was a great aduantage for our men. <hi>Axalla</hi> perceiuing this aide mount vp, commanded also 20000 of our men to oppose themselues against this new troupe which mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and after them he sent 25000 more, and came to this point, that he himselfe alighted, determining for to leade the third succour, saying, that as soone as he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:10494:129"/>
should perceiue another great troupe of footmen for to stirre, it was his turne to march. The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> vnderstanding that he would go thither in person, sent to beseech him for to suffer the Colonels of the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to performe that, and that it belonged vnto him only to command. Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> sent him word that this was a speciall match, and that if they did win the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine they should also win the battell; that he would this day obey him, and be his souldier. About this time he did see this great bodie moue, which was the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the enemies footmen, the most part <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who at their coming, performed a wonderfull act: but in the end Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> comming with many of the brauest men about him, he put the enemies to flight, and did win the mountaine, and remained Maister thereof before he departed, and lodged there, intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching himselfe on the enemies side. He left <hi>Sinopes</hi> to commaund there, who had this day gotten great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. There died of our men fifteene thousand, and aboue thirtie thousand of the enemies: the fight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured from eight of the clocke euen vntill night, our horsemen being lookers on, not any wayes able to helpe the footmen. The enemy hauing receiued this disgrace, marched ten good leagues that night, and forsooke his Campe as ouercome, but it was not without hauing<note place="margin">The discomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Bassa with his flight by night</note> the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> &amp; <hi>Stucan</hi> at their taile, with his light horsemen, Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> continually following them, encamped within two leagues of them, hauing alwayes the coast of the sea, and they bending towardes <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania.</hi> Now the <hi>Bassa</hi> hauing receiued againe his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits after this disgrace would encampe himselfe: but the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented for that he had not fought, adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in such sort, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we were ready to lodge

had newes that it behoued to aide him with diligence, the which Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> vnderstanding, caused the signe of battell to be giuen speedily, and he himselfe with all the horsmen aduanced forward. Now it was a litle riuer he had passed ouer, not thinking the enemie had beene so neare vnto him: which the enemies perceiuing, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded 10000 Persian horse to giue the first charge, the which they hauing valiantly performed, our men being engaged, without any other delay, were constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to come vnto the fight strong &amp; resolutely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended<note place="margin">The r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hauing sent forward with all diligence, tenne thousand horse more for to maintaine the fight, he came speedily vnto the order of fight, &amp; aduanced forward with forty thousand horse, the which he put into three troupes: on front he followed the enemie, who had knit himself together, &amp; put our men to flight, hauing had alwayes the better

The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> at the third charge was ouerthrowne to the ground as dead in the enemies power: but the 10000. horse whereof I did speake, compelled the enemie to make head against Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> who would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer<note place="margin">The battaile b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There were aboue fiue and fortie thousand of the enemies slaine in this last day: these were two battels happily atchieued; there were slaine of our men aboue twentie thousand, and Prince <hi>Stucan</hi> was found amongst the dead vnderneath his horse, his target being vpon his face, all the whole armie made great lamentation for his death; he had greatly ouershot himselfe, for he had like to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen all the whole armie. There was great ioy made for the safetie of the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued<note place="margin">Axalla greatly reprehended the Prince of Thanais for his rashnesse.</note> amongest the dead. The Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> did greatly reprehend him for his rashnesse, hauing beene the occasion of the death of twentie thousand men, and to make the victorie vnto vs bloudie, the which
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:10494:131"/>
had not otherwise bene so, seeing we might haue had the same better cheape. The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe vpon <hi>Stucan</hi> and the light horsmen, who had aduanced themselues too farre, and also hee did not thinke to finde the maine forces of the enemies so neare at hand. Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> sayd vnto him, that hee was in great doubt least such a matter would fall out, and for this cause he had aduanced the armie as neare vnto the riuer as he could. But Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all these great and happie victories, had not that which he desired, and shewing himselfe verie sad for that he knew the indisposition and sicknesse of the<note place="margin">Axalla verie sad for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition of the Emperour his master.</note> Emperour as incurable, he purposed to returne vnto the Court, to the end he might win the good fauour of the young Prince, whom hee knewe the Emperour his father had sent for. And hauing assembled the Counsell, he caused the dispatch to be read, the which he did send vnto the Emperour of the happie successe of the victorie: and in the meane time he sent after the enemies, to the end they should haue no more leasure, but only to get the mountaines, and hauing giuen this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, very early in the morning he followed after with the rest of the army. The greatest part of the Persians sent to sue for their pardon, and did come and yeeld themselues, the Prince their chiefe hauing bene slaine; the head of the Bassa was brought by a souldier,<note place="margin">The Bassaes head brought vnto Axalla.</note> who had killed him in his retiring, at such time as he did see the Persians forsake him. This was the same Bassa, who had bene taken before in the battell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Emperor <hi>Baiazet</hi> was taken prisoner. The prince <hi>Axalla</hi> followed continually the small remnant of the enemies Armie that remained: they made foule warre vppon the <hi>Mamelues,</hi> because the most part of them
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:10494:131"/>
had falsified their faith giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> for the rest they made them faire warre. In lesse then fifteene dayes this armie was wholly ouerthowne, and <hi>Calepin</hi> retired into Europe, all the cities vpon the sea coast yeelded themselues. The winter drawing neare, the Armie demanded their pay, whereupon they tooke aduise, and hauing considered where the same might winter, it retired towardes <hi>Goualache.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> was desirous to withdrawe himselfe into his gouernement, and leade backe his troupes, as also to preuent the nouelties the which the indisposition of the Emperour might bring foorth, and Prince <hi>Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alla</hi>
               <note place="margin">A league of friendshippe sworn between Prince Axalla and the Prince of Thanais.</note> and he, hauing sworne great friendship each vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other, he went his way.

The Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> was gone twentie leagues or thereabout, when as behold there came a post, who brought newes of the Emperours death, the which did happen two dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">The death of the Emperour Tamerlan.</note> he had receiued the newes of this victorie, hauing done nothing after the receipt of these news, but quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end this life, speaking euen vnto the last gaspe, with sound and good sense, taking order for the affaires of his Empire, without any alteration in his accustomed<note place="margin">Axalla lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the death of the Emperor Tamerlan pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.</note> manner. The Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing receiued these newes whereof he doubted, withdrew himselfe alone, and with all kinds of complaints, he bewailed the death of his good maister, he concealed his death certaine
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:10494:132"/>
dayes, and hauing with all diligence sent these newes vnto the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> he desired that it would please him they might meete for to consult of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. So they appointed a place to meete in about this accident. This post brought his dispatch signed with the name <hi>Sautochio</hi> our Emperour, by the which he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to leaue 40000 men with the Gouernour of the borders, and himselfe to take his iourney thorough Persia with his army. This post was followed by a fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the new Emperor, who came vnto Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> for to gratifie him, &amp; to make him an affectioned serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto the Emperour, as a person whom he knew very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for to maintaine the greatnesse of his Empire, holding in his power at this day, the principall forces, besides the great authority hee had of long time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed with the late Emperor: so as the quiet of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire depended more vpon Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> then vpon any one, especially hauing had very lately so famous a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This same did greatly procure him the good will, both of the Captaines and souldiers: but there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but worthinesse in Prince <hi>Axallaes</hi> mind, who<note place="margin">The worthie mind of Prince Axalla to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his new Prince.</note> assured the new Prince of his faithfulnesse, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto his commandements. I will not forget to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that during the time the armie did refresh it selfe, the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> came to meet with Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> where interchangeably they did swere faith the one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other, for the preseruation of their honours and<note place="margin">The meeting of the Prince of Thanais &amp; Prince Axalla <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They thought it best to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale the death of the late Emperour, the one of them in the armie, the other in his gouernement: but euen as euill newes doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse abrode sooner then good, so did <hi>Axalla</hi> vpon his returne find these newes spread ouer all, the which he
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10494:132"/>
perceiuing, thought good to cause the armie to bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together, and there for to giue them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the losse of their Emperour. You did neuer<note place="margin">The lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Emperours death by the whole armie.</note> see so many cries, and so much shedding of teares: hee exhorted them vnto the same faithfulnesse and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards the young Prince his sonne, for the honour of the late Emperour: the which they promised, euen<note place="margin">Axallaes faith fulnesse vnto the Prince.</note> vnto the meanest souldier. <hi>Axalla</hi> caused the oath of fidelitie to be particularly taken by the chiefest of the Armie, and after he had couered all the standarts with mourning weede, according to our custome, and had made also a muster of all his souldiers, where he did againe exhort them to honour the memorie of their late Emperour, towards the Prince his sonne, saying vnto them, that he did not die at all, seeing he had a sonne, who deserued to be beloued of euerie one for his vertues, vnder whose good fortune they should henceforward fight, who would acknowledge their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices. That it was conuenient to go vnto him for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the recompence of their faithfulnesse; that he was young for to exercise the young, and liberall for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider well of their trauels; that hee would neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them, but would be alwayes their Protector. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was done, he seuered vnto the Gouernor those men as hee thought necessarie to remaine with him, for to keepe this countrie in peace, and to hinder the enemies from fortifying of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: the which Prince <hi>Axalla</hi> hauing performed, he aduaunced two dayes iournies forward. Now for to recite that which passed at the Emperours death, this it is, that feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ill disposed, hauing from all partes sought for health: in the end, seeing nature did decaye in him, he called for <hi>Sautochio</hi> his eldest sonne, vnto whom
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:10494:133"/>
in the presence of <hi>Odmar,</hi> and of all his Councell, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed<note place="margin">The Emperour Tamerlan his discourse vnto his sonne before all his counsell lying vpon his death bed.</note> of the course of his life euer since the death of his father <hi>Zachetay,</hi> who being giuen ouer to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, had left vnto him three personages neare vnto his person, for to assist and counsell him, of whom (said he) there remaineth none aliue at this present but only <hi>Odmar,</hi> being the youngest of the three, the which had brought him vp as well in the actions of warre, as the affaires of peace, whereof you may iudge by the great enlargement he hath added vnto <hi>Zachetay,</hi> the which he had obtained as well through his great reputation, as by force; and that the hope euery one conceiued of his vertue in his youth, had called him vnto the full suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Tartarian Empire. For hauing by the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of these three, as fathers, enterprised the warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Moscouite, whose armes were at that time the most to be feared of all Asia, this enterprise hauing had good successe, not onely all his neighbours, but all his kinsemen, desired to haue peace and friendship with his armes, and the Emperour his vnkle, whose purpose was to deuide his Empires amongst his Princes, whom he loued, for my valour chaunged his determination, hearing my reputation to resound, and that I had in this young age thorough my good conduct, ouercome the common enemie vnto our Nation: whereupon I was iudged by him worthie to commaund the same, and sending to offer his daughter vnto me in mariage, he made choise of me to succeed him in this monarchy, hoping that I would ease his old age, and that I would guide the yeares which remained vnto him in peace, thorough my trauell, and the reputation of my armes. He was not deceiued in me, hauing honoured him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies as my Lord, and loued him as another father,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:10494:133"/>
carying my selfe so cunningly during his life, that at such time as his death happened, I kept this great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion therin, but rather all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection and obedience. I will tell thee my son, that I did not only succeed him in the Empire, but also in the loue of all his seruants, whom thou doest see about me, who haue serued me faithfully these twentie yeares, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer since I haue enioyed this great large countrie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the late Emperour my vnkle did promise only recompence of their seruice, but my selfe haue bene so much acccompanied with good hap, that I haue bene able to giue vnto them. I leaue vnto thee then these seruants, who are worthy to be kings; honor them, and raigne with them: they will be faithfull vnto thee, and haue remembrance of me for to serue thee faithfully, and do know how to excuse thy youth and guide the same: beleeue their counsell. And taking <hi>Od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> by the hand, pulled him on the right side of the place where he was set, and looking vpon the other side, he turned vnto the young Prince his sonne, saying vnto him: This side and place here shall bee kept for <hi>Axalla,</hi> who is absent, whose faithfulnesse and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had prooued, the worthy acts of whom were so recommendable vnto all this Empire and himselfe, that he would speake no more vnto him of the same; that he commanded him to beleeue their counsell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as he had done, wherein he had found great good; that the Prince of <hi>Thanais</hi> was his kinsman, that he should esteeme of his faithfulnesse, and serue himselfe therwith; that he might assure himselfe he would yeeld him obedience, euen to the spending of his owne life. In the end that hee recommended vnto him so manie worthy Lords and Captaines, who had serued him
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10494:134"/>
faithfully in so many warres he had made for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Parthian Empire, ouer the which hee had left him to commaund without anie desert but for a faire hope, and for that he was his son. And giuing his hand vnto all the Princes and Lords, which he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to come before him, hee presented them vnto his sonne, saying vnto him, that this was his Empire and good fortune, and demaunding his seale of the great Chanceller, hee put it into the handes of the young Prince, and caused the same to be redeliuered vnto him againe, and hauing continued a certaine space with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out speaking, he said vnto him: My sonne, loue iustice, minister it as well vnto the litle as vnto the great, this is your dutie, and he shall ease you therein sometimes. Remember your self, that the weapons which you haue in your hands, are but to make execution of the same: this is the cause therefore that it behooueth the warres you begin be iustly enterprised, and then will they haue happie successe. As his speech was directed vnto the young Prince, he had the Chanceller neare him; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon during the same, there was a great noise more then was accustomed in the Emperors outward cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and asking what the matter was, they caused a Lord to enter in, sent from <hi>Axalla</hi> (nowe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had nothing at all left the care of his affaires, as he was accustomed, although they were somwhat the more slowely dispatched,) who brought newes of the happie successe of two battailes wonne in <hi>Natolia,</hi> by the Armie led by Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> victorious ouer <hi>Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins</hi>
               <note place="margin">Newes brought vnto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Tamerlan of Axallas vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolia against Calepins forces</note> forces; and declaring this happie successe in his affaires, the messenger of these newes said vnto him, that he hoped the next sommer his person marching forward, the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> should be easie for him
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10494:134"/>
to conquer, seeing the astonishment the enemies had.<note place="margin">Tamerlan his speech vnto the messenger, and to the Prince his sonne.</note> He answered him, that he neuer doubted of his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers affections, but that hee was called by a greater then himselfe, and vnto a more happie conquest, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a more high place, whither he must needs go. Tell <hi>Axalla</hi> (said he vnto the Lord which spake vnto him) that from hence forward hee must receiue my sonnes commandements. And drawing a ring from off his thombe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that it should be carried vnto Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> to signifie vnto him the contentment he had in his seruice, and in witnesse of his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. He demaunded in generall of the health of all those of his Armie, recommending them vnto his sonne, euerie one according to their vertues and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertes: amongst the rest he recommended the serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Prince of <hi>Thanais,</hi> commaunding his sonne to honour him as his kinsman, and to continue him in the charges and honours the which he had put into his hands, for that he did deserue the same; that hee should be well serued by him. And returning againe to speake, he commanded his sonne, that if he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his armies vnto any man to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, it shold be vnto Prince <hi>Axalla,</hi> a thing notwithstanding which he did counsell him to do the latest he could, because it was so precious a thing, and that if it were possible, he should not trust it with anie man but himselfe; that it was fit for the Parthian Emperors to be in the middest of their armies, &amp; amongst the soldiers, euen as house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders are with their children, &amp; that by this meanes he should preserue this great Empire, which he left to him by inheritance, hoping in time he would deserue it by his vertues. And as his last wordes he perswaded him to be gentle and curteous vnto his friendes, and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10494:135"/>
terrible vnto his enemies, and if they demaund peace of you, do not in any case refuse it, and forgiue your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occasions, &amp; do iustice for the loue of your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This yong Prince had the tears in his eyes, and the Emperour contrariwise vttering these words, had a maiestie in his countenance more then accustomed, and causing his sonne to go out, he sent him vnto the Empresse for to comfort her. And hauing againe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for <hi>Odmar,</hi> he recommended vnto him the young yeares of his sonne, the loue and faithfulnesse vnto his seruice, willing that his yonger son should be brought vp to obey his elder brother: for of the loue and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the two brethren dependeth (said he) the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and preseruation of this estate: and sending for them both, he was desirous to giue them his last blessing. And they being come before him, he commanded the younger to obey his elder brother, and both of them<note place="margin">Tamerlan his last speech &amp; blessing vnto his sonnes.</note> together to honour the Empresse: and beginning to giue them his blessing, touching the head of <hi>Sautochio,</hi> he pressed it downe, and touching the head of the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hee raised it vp, lifting vp his chinne, a presage that <hi>Letrochio</hi> the younger should be lifted vp vnto the Empire, and should be the ouerthrowe of his elder brother, as it fell out afterwards through their diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the which caused the destruction of the Empire. Night being come he slept verie sweetly, and about the breake of day, according to his custome, hee caused them to be called vnto him which had any businesse with him: and <hi>Axallas</hi> dispatch being presented vnto him for to signe, vpon this last victorie obtained, hee signed it without any change of countenance, &amp; after turning himselfe, a slumbring tooke him againe, and they perceiued he passed away vnto another life, they
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:10494:135"/>
ran for to call the Emperour his sonne, who as soone<note place="margin">The death of the Emperour Tamerlan.</note> as he was come shut his eyes, powring out teares, as also did all his seruants.
