         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS Tract meeting with so Candid a Reception, at its first Appearance, has Encouraged it to make a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Essay; And what was omitted in the former Impression, is incerted in this: <hi>viz.</hi> The Prayers annexed to the several Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which doubtless will prove very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Practical to the Contemplative. The Original Part of this Discourse, was Extracted from a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Bp.</hi> Hall<hi>'s Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m of</hi> Gilead.</note> laid by a Learned and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Prelate, upon whose Basis this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure is Erected: He, like a Wise Master-Builder laid the Corner Stone, as a Pattern for others to imitate; and they which attain to his height of Perfection, shall enjoy what Christ said to his Disciples, <hi>In their Patience, they shall possess their own Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, we never wanted more Motives to excite us to this Duty, than now: When this Virtue appears so dissentaneous to most Dispositions: But I would to God those Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Spirits would listen to the grave Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of St. <hi>Chrysostom, If with a Desire of Judging, thou wouldst needs be a Judge, I will shew thee the Judgment-Seat, which


<pb facs="tcp:54318:3"/>
shall be adventageous to thee, and no way touch thy Conscience; Let thy Mind and Thought sit down to give Sentence, call forth all thy Offences, and begin to say with thy self, Why hast thou done this or that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This private Examining of Themselves would soon make these Publick Controllers, of all others, by plausible Pretences of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; look nearer Home, and subdue that in themselves, they are apt to spy in others. St. <hi>Paul</hi> blamed their Course, whose manner was to <hi>go from House to House, Tit. 1.13. Esau,</hi> that lost the Blessing, was Hunting; but <hi>Jacob</hi> that enjoy'd it, and the Inheritance, kept at home, <hi>Gen. 17.30.</hi> The Just Man, saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> first accuseth himself; And <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> spake humbly of an Offender, when he said, <hi>She is more Righteous than I,</hi> Gen. <hi>38.26.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let such hot Spirits take along with them this Information, That <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice;</hi> and that he which <hi>giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Grace to the Humble,</hi> is also said to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the Proud:</hi> And they may be well assured, that this Counterfeit Coyn will prove dross when it comes to the Test. It is an easier Task for Malecontents to reprehend others, than to amend themselves; as <hi>those who have blemish'd Eyes, think the Sky ever cloudy.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common with troublesome Dispositions, which <hi>have not known the way of Peace,</hi> than to be ever Contending, seldom Contented.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Elements,</hi> though in quality divers, yet they accord, for the Constitution of the


<pb facs="tcp:54318:3"/>
Corporeal Nature: And I would to <hi>God,</hi> that all who profess and call themselves <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> would accord together for the Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Church and State, <hi>That Peace may dwell in our Land:</hi> We are all sheep of that Fold, whereof Christ is the Shepherd; Stones of that Building whereof he is the chief Corner Stone; Branches of that Vine, whereof he is the Stock; We have but one <hi>God</hi> for our Father that Created us; one <hi>Saviour</hi> that Redeemed us; and one <hi>Holy-Ghost</hi> our Sanctifier, that adorns us.</p>
            <p>We are here but Pilgrims and Strangers, and we shall one day find, that a Peaceable Christian Life, with a good departure hence, shall bear a greater Value than all Temporal Enjoyments, can afford us; In pursuance of which, let us all endeavour to learn these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Instructions, by which means we shall not only attain to be Schollars, but Proficients in this <hi>School of Patience,</hi> and acquire that Conquest over our unruly Passions, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Affections, but shall be enabled cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to <hi>run with Patience the Race which is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our Faith; who for the Joy that was set before him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Cross, despising the Shame, and is set down at the Right Hand of the Throne of God,</hi> Heb. <hi>12.1, 2.</hi> and therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech we <hi>God,</hi> That <hi>Mercy and Truth may meet together, that Righteousness and Peace may Kiss each other;</hi> and that his Glory may dwell in our Land until we come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite in the Land of Glory.</p>

Heb. 12.14. and to practice those Celestial Duties of <hi>Humilty, Meekness</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. HUMILITY is first a Duty we owe to <hi>God,</hi> which is to have such a Sense of our Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness, and his Excellency, as may operate in us a lowly and unfeign'd Submission to Him: Now, this Submission is twofold; <hi>First,</hi> To his Will; <hi>Secondly,</hi> To his Wisdom. The Submission to his Will is of two sorts, Obedience and <hi>Patience:</hi> Obedience is our yielding up our selves with alacrity to do what his Divine Will and Pleasure command us; and to enable us to perform This, <hi>Humility</hi> is exceeding necessary: And to acquire this Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we must endeavour to possess our Hearts with the Sense of that great unspeakable Distance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and us. To consider Him a <hi>God</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majesty, Power and Glory; and we poor Worms of the Earth: He of Infinite Purity and Holiness; and we polluted and dead, in Trespasses and Sins: He of Power able to do all things; and we nothing, but by his Divine Assistance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>Second</hi> sort of Submission to his Will, is <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>; the Subject-matter of our Discourse. This consists in suffering his Will, as that of Obedience did in acting it; and is composed of a voluntary yielding to what ever Afflictions <hi>God</hi> is pleased to inflict upon us: In this, <hi>Humility</hi> is a great Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and renders things easie to us; perswading us not to murmur, or repine at any thing <hi>God</hi> does; but let what Afflictions soever come, though in the heaviest kind, we may be always ready to say, <hi>Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven:</hi> And with old <hi>Eli,</hi> when that great Affliction came of <hi>Gods</hi> threatning the Destruction of his <hi>Family,</hi> he loss of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> the Cutting off both his <hi>Sons</hi> in one Day; yet considering it was the <hi>Lord,</hi> inabled him calmly to yield to 'em, saying, <hi>Let him do what


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54318:5"/>
seemeth him good,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. The same Effect it had on <hi>David,</hi> in his Affliction; <hi>I was dumb, I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not my Mouth, because thou didst it,</hi> Psal. 39.9. <hi>God</hi> doing it, silenc'd all Murmurings and Repinings in him: And it must operate the same Effect in us, in all our Afflictions, if we intend to acquire this Duty of <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. THEREFORE, when ever <hi>God</hi> strikes, we are not only <hi>Patiently</hi> to endure his <hi>Rod,</hi> but kiss it also; that is, be truly thankful, that he is pleased not to <hi>Give us over to our own Hearts Lusts,</hi> Psal. 18.12. But still continuing his tender Care over us, sending <hi>Afflictions</hi> as so many <hi>Messengers,</hi> to call us to himself. From whence we may learn, what an absurd Folly it is to murmur at those Stripes, which are design'd so graciously.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THIS Duty is not compleated, by only a Quietness and Thankfulness under <hi>Affictions</hi>; but there must be <hi>Fruitfulness</hi> also, or all the rest will be of no Advantage; which is the production of that, for which the <hi>Afflictions</hi> were sent; <hi>viz.</hi> the Amendment of our Lives: So that, in Time of <hi>Affliction,</hi> it is a necessary Duty to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our Hearts and Lives, and make a severe Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny what Sins have provoked <hi>God</hi> to scourge us; and whatsoever we find our selves guilty of, humbly to confess to him, and immediately to forsake them; Redeeming what we have lost, the Time to come.</p>
               <p n="6">6. OUR next Duty concerning <hi>Patience,</hi> is, That we are as much bound to comply with one sort of <hi>Sufferings,</hi> as another, whether they be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Sickness,</hi> loss of <hi>Friends,</hi> or the like; or whether it be from Men, who sometimes are Instruments of afflicting us; and cannot prejudice us, without <hi>Gods</hi> Permission: And <hi>God</hi> may as well create the Instruments of punishing us, as to do it directly Himself; for it is a Counterfeit <hi>Patience</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>


                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54318:6"/>
that pretends to submit to <hi>God,</hi> and yet can bear nothing from Men. We see an Instance of Holy <hi>Job,</hi> who is recorded in Sacred Scripture, as a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of true <hi>Patience</hi>; he made no such Difference in his <hi>Afflictions</hi>; but took the loss of his Cattle, which the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi> robb'd him of, with as much <hi>Meekness,</hi> as he did that which was consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Fire</hi> from <hi>Heaven.</hi> Therefore, whatever we suffer from Men, if it be never so unjust in respect of them, we are humbly to confess it is most just in respect of <hi>God;</hi> and instead of looking upon them with <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> as the vulgar custom of the World is, we are to look up to <hi>God,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Justice in the <hi>Affliction</hi>; imploring his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don most earnestly for those Sins, which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked his wrath against us, and <hi>patiently</hi> and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to bear those Sufferings, till He shall in his own good time, see fit to remove them; still saying with <hi>Job, Blessed be the Name of the Lord,</hi> Job 1.21.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A <hi>Second</hi> sort of Submission in <hi>Humility,</hi> is to the Wisdom of <hi>God</hi>; and that is, to acknowledge him Infinitely Wise: And whatsoever he doth, we must confess it the best and fittest to be done: And this Confession we are to put in practice, both in his Commands, and in his disposing and ordering of all things. <hi>First,</hi> Whatsoever he commands us to believe, we are to believe, how impossible soever it seems to our shallow Understandings. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To do whatever he commands us, how opposite so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be to our Carnal Reason and Humour; and to conclude in both, that his <hi>Commandments</hi> are most reasonable, <hi>and not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.3.</p>
               <p n="8">8. NEXT, we are to submit to his Wisdom, in disposing and ordering of Things; which is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, He desposes of all things most wisely: Not only to the World in General; but in what concerns every one in particular: So that, in what


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54318:6"/>
Condition soever we are in, <hi>We are to be Content,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.8. and not to be impatient and disturb'd, at any Choice which <hi>God</hi> makes; since he chuses for us, who cannot err: But to leave all things to him, to fit us with such an Estate and Condition, as he sees best for us. Perhaps, it may not please our unreasonable Humours, because we cannot live in that Splendour equal to our Superiours: And the Reason is, we are so full of our selves, that we can see nothing beyond it. We expect <hi>God</hi> should place us where we please, though by it he discomposes the whole Scheme of his Providence: But he, like a wise Master-Builder, knows that every Stone is not fit for the Corner, not every little Rafter for the main Beam: And sure, there cannot be a more vile contempt of the Divine Wisdom, than to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his Choice, who knows what is fitter for us, than we do our selves. Therefore, when ever we are disappointed of any of our Aims or Wishes, let us not only <hi>patiently,</hi> but joyfully submit to it, and acknowledge, that it is certainly best for us, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chosen by the unerring Wisdom of our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father.</p>
               <p n="9">9. HAVING spoken of the <hi>Humility</hi> due to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God;</hi> I am now to speak of <hi>Humility,</hi> as it concerns our selves; which will be no less necessary than the former. This <hi>Humility</hi> is of two sorts; the first is, the having a mean and low Opinion of our selves; the second is, being content that others should have so of us. The first of these is contrary to Pride, and the second to Vain-glory. Pride cast the Angels out of Heaven; and it is the greatest Sin the Devil hath been guilty of: And we may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently find in Scripture the hainousness of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Every one that is proud in Heart, is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the</hi> Lord; and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. among many things which the <hi>Lord</hi> hates, a <hi>Proud Look</hi> is set as


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54318:7"/>
the chiefest. It is indeed a most prolifick Vice, and there are few Sins to which it is not either Parent or Nurse to: There are many places of Scripture, which shews the detestableness of it; I shall only add one, <hi>James</hi> 4.7. <hi>That God resisteth the Proud, but giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. AND the means of relinquishing this Sin of <hi>Pride,</hi> is perform'd by <hi>Humility,</hi> by these Directions: <hi>First,</hi> We are to consider the hainousness of the Sin, with that Regret as may operate in us no petty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, but a deep and irreconcileable Hatred against it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To be vigilant over our Hearts, that they foment not any Originals of it, never suffering them to feed on the Phantasm of our own Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence: But when ever such Cogitations arise, let us reverberate it immediately with the Memorial of some of our Follies and Vices; so we may make this very Motion of our <hi>Pride</hi> an occasion of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Thirdly,</hi> We are to make no Comparison of our selves with those we think are more foolish and vicious than we are, lest we fall into the same Snare with the <hi>Pharisee, Luk.</hi> 16.11. Extol our selves for being better: But if we will compare, and associate our selves, let us do it with the Wise, Sober, and Religious; and there we shall find, we come so far short of 'em, that we can have no high Esteem of our selves, but rather a more Submission to <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> than we had before. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Let us humbly and earnestly invoke the <hi>Almighty,</hi> That he would era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate all Degrees of this Sin in us, and make us of the number of those that are <hi>Poor in Spirit,</hi> Mat. 5.3. to whom the Blessing even of Heaven it self, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and promised.</p>
               <p n="11">11. THE next Vice in opposition to <hi>Humility,</hi> is Vain-glory; which is a hungring and thirsting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Praise of Men: and first, that it is a Sin, the Words of our Saviour prove it, John 5.44. <hi>How can


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54318:7"/>
ye believe, that receive Honour one of another?</hi> So it is not only a Sin, but such a one as hinders the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Christ</hi> into the Heart. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The great danger of this Sin is such, if it keep <hi>Christ</hi> out of our Hearts, it brings us to inevitable Destruction; for all our Hope of escaping the Wrath to come, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends in our Reception of Him: And this Sin where ever it takes Possession in the Minds of Men, it endangers the being guilty of many others; and he that seeks so much for popular Applause, may be in danger of the Mobile's Hissing, and without Repentance, in danger <hi>of Hell Fire,</hi> Mat. 5.22.</p>
               <p n="12">12. THIRDLY, The Folly of it is, we pursue after a Blast of Wind, the Breath of Men, which affords us no real Advantage. Secondly, It is not only unprofitable, but dolorous and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult also; for he that eagerly seeks Praise, is not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of himself, but must suit all his Actions to that end and purpose; and contrary to what his own Reason and Conscience dictates to him, he must take care to do what will bring him in Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; and so captivates himself to every one that hath a Tongue, to extol him. And this Sin is further prejudicial, when it is used in Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or any Christian Acts, it destroys all the Fruits of it: They that pray, or distribute Alms to be seen of Men, must accept of that for their Portion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Verily, I say unto you, They have their Reward</hi>; for they must expect none from <hi>God,</hi> but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of those Hypocrites, <hi>that love the Praise of Men, more than the Praise of God:</hi> And they that make such a miserable Exchange, are not only guilty of Folly, but are in danger of <hi>losing their own Souls,</hi> Mark 8.36.</p>
               <p n="13">13. AND the Remedies against this Vice, are these: <hi>First,</hi> We are to keep a strict Watch over our selves, and to observe in any Christian Duty, whether we consider the Praise of Men; or in the


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54318:8"/>
most indifferent Action, whether we have not an earnest Inclination to it; and if we find our selves leaning that way, we must endeavour to have a a strict Eye upon it; and whenever we find it moves, reprehend and resist it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let this be our Design, to please <hi>God</hi>; that when we intend any thing, we may make this inquiry, whether it hath his Approbation: and then we shall have no time to think what Praise it will bring us from Men; for it is a greater Benefit for us to please <hi>God,</hi> who is able to give us Eternal Rewards; than Men, whose Applauses are vain and empty; and none of us can but think it reasonable, to make the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer our only Care. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If at any time we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Praise of Men, let us not be fond of it, nor think a tittle the better of our selves: If it be Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue we are esteem'd for, we must remember it came from <hi>God,</hi> and return him the Glory; and not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any belongs to our selves. Indifferent Actions can deserve no Praise, and bad Ones ought to set us a trembling; else that Woe of our Saviour belongs to us, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.26. <hi>Woe unto you, when Men speak well of you; for so did their Fathers to the False Prophets:</hi> and there is not a greater Appearance of an hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Heart, than when Men make their Sins the Object of their Glory.</p>
               <p n="14">14. THE next Virtue is <hi>Meekness,</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of a calmness and quietness of Spirit, opposite to the Rage and Impatiences of Anger. This Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is a Duty to <hi>God,</hi> of which I have already spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of under the Head of <hi>Humility</hi>; and may be exercised towards our Neighbor, and our selves: I shall begin with that towards our selves. <hi>First,</hi> The advantage we receive by it is this, We have the Blessing which <hi>Christ</hi> pronounced, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Blessed are the Meek</hi>; not only in the World to come, but in this; <hi>They shall inherit the Earth:</hi> and indeed none


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54318:8"/>
hath a more perfect Enjoyment, than Meek Persons: For the Impatient can never enjoy the greatest Prosperities; and the uneasiness of this Passion is such, that it raises Storms within their own Breasts, and a Perturbation upon their Spirits.</p>
               <p n="15">15. SECONDLY, We acquire Honour by it; for we resemble <hi>Christ,</hi> that blest Pattern of Meekness: <hi>Learn of me,</hi> saith he, <hi>for I am meek and lowly in Heart,</hi> Matth. 11.28. And by it we conquer our selves, and our unruly Passions, which is the noblest Victory. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It makes us deport our selves like Men, whereas Anger transforms us to the Fierceness and Wildness of Savage Beasts: The One is esteemed, and the Other abhorred; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one shunning an outragious Man, as they would a tameless Beast. Moreover, <hi>Meekness</hi> infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a sober Mind; whereas Anger is direct Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and renders him uncapable of being his own Master; exciting him to those things, as himself, in his serious Temper, utterly detests. Many Men have committed those things in their Rage, which they have repented all their Life after. Therefore, seeing how much Anger resembles Beastiality, a mad Man than a sober Man, let us imbrace this Vertue of <hi>Meekness,</hi> and abandon the contrary Vice of <hi>Anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. MEEKNESS, in the next place, makes the worst Condition tolerable and easie; and if we meekly bear any Suffering, it takes off the Edge, that it cannot wound us; whereas they that rage, whets it, and makes it sharper than it would be; as in the case of reproachful words, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do no prejudice to our Bodies nor Estates; all the mischief they can do, is to make us angery; and then the Anger will create more Strife and Debate, and animate the Espoused Party but more against us: Whereas he that <hi>Meekly</hi> passes them by, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54318:9"/>
the worse but the better; for he shall he reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>God</hi> for that <hi>Patience</hi>: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> gives us this Advice, <hi>To speak Evil of no Man, to be no Brawlers, but gentle, shewing all Meekness unto all Men,</hi> Tit. 3.2.</p>
               <p n="16">16. AND the means to obtain this Vertue, are these: <hi>First,</hi> To make a deep Impression in our Minds, of the Loveliness and Benefits of <hi>Meekness,</hi> together with the Deformity and Mischief of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Secondly,</hi> To set before our selves the Example of our Blessed Lord and Saviour, who indured all Reproaches and Torments, with a perfect <hi>Patience,</hi> that was <hi>Led as a Sheep to the Slaughter,</hi> Isa. 53.7. <hi>That when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatned not,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.23. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To be very vigilant in preventing the beginnings of <hi>Anger</hi>; and to that end, we must mortifie all inward Peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Frowardness of Mind, which is a Sin in it self, if it proceed no further; but if cherish'd, will break out into open Effects of Danger. Therefore, when ever thou find'st the least Motion of it within thee, make as much haste to check it, as thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to quench a Fire in thy House: And be sure to keep a strick watch over thy Tongue, that it break not out into any angry Expressions; for that Breath will fan the Fire, not only in thine Antagonist, but thy self too: Therefore, though thy Heart be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent within, suffocate the Flame, that it break not out; and the greater the Temptation is, the more earnestly call upon <hi>God</hi> to assist thee to conquer it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Often call to mind the great Punishments thy sins have deserved; and then, whether thy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions be from <hi>God</hi> or Man, thou wilt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be far short of what thou deservest; and wilt be ready to blush at thy great Impatience.</p>

                  <p>O Most Blessed Lord God, the Perfect Pattern of Humility and Meekness; infuse into me, I humbly beseech thee, those Excellent Graces, whereby I may be fully convinced of my own Wretchedness, and Evidently behold that I am sinful Dust and Ashes; Lord work in me such a lowliness of Mind, that I may in the sincerity of my Heart confess and acknowledge that I am less than the least of all thy Mercies, and justly deserve the greatest of thy Judgments: Give me, O Lord, a Contrite Spirit, a Meek and an Humble Heart, and chase from me all Pride and Vanity of Mind, whereby I may become lowly, yea base and vile in my own Eyes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. ROOT out, O Lord, from me all perverseness of Spirit, and wholly dispossess it of its residence; that I may be fit to entertain that good Spirit of thine, and thou mayst take delight to dwell and remain with me: Grant that I may every day be more humbled with the sight of my own Unworthiness, and Spiritual Wants, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem my self as nothing without thee, but always acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my own frailty and weakness: O, let me wholly depend and rely upon thee, and ascribe the Praise and Glory of whatsoever good is wrought in me, or by me, unto thee alone, who art the God of my Strength, the Author and Giver both of Grace and Glory, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner and Finisher of every Good Thing, which is wrought in any of thy Servants, to whom be all Honour and Glory, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. WHAT should we do in this Vale of Tears, but condole each others Miseries? Every Man hath his weight, and happy is he whose Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then is so easie, that he may assist his Neighbours. Many have waded through a Sea of Sorrows; and the Angel of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that hath Redeemed their Souls from Evil, and led them within few Paces of the Shore, offers to lend thee his Hand; to guide thee in this dangerous World, wherein every Error is Death: Let us follow him therefore with a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Confidence, and be safe in the View and Pity of the woful Miscarriages of others, and take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their sad Misfortunes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THOU art on thy Bed of Sickness, and with holy <hi>David, Roaring all the day long,</hi> Psal. 32.3. for the Extremity of thy pain, measuring the slow Hours, not by Minutes, but by Groans: <hi>Thy Soul is weary of thy Life,</hi> Job 10.1. through the Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Anguish of thy Spirit,</hi> Job 7.11. Of all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Afflictions, this is the sorest: And <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. after the loss of his Goods and Children, could yet support himself, and <hi>Bless the God that gives and takes</hi>: But when his Body was tormented, and made one <hi>Boyle,</hi> then his <hi>Patience</hi> is extended so far, as to curse (not his <hi>God,</hi> but) his Nativity, <hi>Job</hi> 3.3. <hi>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, there is a Man Child con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> And King <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> questioning with his Cup bearer <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> could say, <hi>Why is thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance sad, seeing thou art not Sick?</hi> Nehem. 2.2. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed that the Sick, of all others, hath just cause to

be dejected. Humane Crosses are at a distance, but Sickness is in our Bosoms: Those touch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaly, these Internally our Selves: Here the whole Man suffers. What could the Body feel without the Soul that animates it? How can the Soul (which makes the Body sensible) chuse but be most affected with that Pain, wherewith the Body is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted? Both Partners are perplex'd to encounter so fierce an Enemy, and the sharpest requires the most powerful Resistance. Therefore let us recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect our selves, and summon all the Powers of our Souls, to engage with so violent, and potent an Enemy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THY Body is by a sore Disease confin'd to thy Bed: I should be sorry to say, thy self wert so. Thy Soul, which is thy self, I hope is at a distance from thee; but however it is content to take a share in thy Sufferings, soars above to the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; and is prostrate before the Throne of Grace, imploring for Mercy and Forgiveness; beholding the Face of thy Glorious Mediator, interceding for thee. Unhappy were we, if our Souls were lockt up in our Bosoms, that they could use no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but what our lumpish Bodies could contribute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, blessed be <hi>God,</hi> he hath animated us with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Spirits, that can move themselves, while our Bodies lie still; that can be so agil in their Motions, as they can pass from Earth to Heaven, ere we can turn our wearied and sick Bodies to find ease.</p>
               <p n="4">4. AND how much shall we be wanting to our selves, if we do not make use of this Spiritual Agility; sending up these Spirits of ours, from this brittle Clay of our Bodies, to those Regions of Blessedness, that they may from thence Extract Comforts to alleviate the Sorrows of their heavy Partners.

that Spiritual Part of thine shall ere long be in Bliss, whil'st this piece of Earth lies putrified in the Grave. Why dost thou not then, even now before thy Dissolution, improve all the Powers of it to thy present Advantage?

Weep still and be not too much hastly to exhaust thy Tears; for they are precious, and rendred fit to be reserv'd in the <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Almighty,</hi> Psal. 56.8. Over-speedy Remedies may prove injurious to the Patient: And as in the Body, so in the Soul; Diseases and Tumours must have their due Maturation, 'ere there can be a Cure. <hi>The Inwards of the Sacrifice must be three times rinsed with Water,</hi> Lev. 1.9. One Ablution will not serve turn. But when thou hast Evacuated thine Eyes of Tears, and unloaded thy Breast of leisurely Sighs, I shall then, by full Commission from him that hath the Power of Remission, say to thee; <hi>Son, be of good Comfort, thy Sins are forgiven thee,</hi> Mat. 9.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THINK not this Word meerly formal, and forceless: <hi>He that hath the Keys of Hell, and of Death,</hi> Rev. 1.18. hath not said in vain, <hi>Whose Sins

ye remit, they are remitted,</hi> John 20.23. The Words of his Vicegerents on Earth, are ratified in Heav'n; only the <hi>Priest</hi> under the Law, hath power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the <hi>Leper</hi> clean, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13.3. Had any other <hi>Israelite</hi> done it, it had been as unprofitable, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous. It was a good Expression that fell from <hi>Elihu</hi>; When a Man's <hi>Soul draweth nigh unto the Grave, and his Life to the Destroyer, if there be a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger</hi> (of God) <hi>with him, an Interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto that Man his Uprightness; then He (i. e.</hi> God) <hi>is Gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down into the Pit; I have found a Ransom,</hi> Job 33.22, 23, 24. Behold! this is thy State, thy Souls Life is in danger of the Destroyer, through his powerful Temptations: I am (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever unworthy) a Messenger sent to thee from Heaven; and in the Name of the Almighty that sent me, do here upon thy serious Repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> proclaim thy Soul fix'd in the Court of Heaven: The Invaluable Ranson of thy dear Saviour is accepted for thee; so thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd from descending into the Pit of Perdition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. OH, happy Message, thou replyest, were it receiv'd with Comfort! But, Alas! my heart is possest with deep Grounds of Fear and Diffidence, not easily to be remov'd: That convicts me, whil'st you offer to acquit me; and positively acquaints me, I am a worse Criminal, than a Spectator can imagine: My Sins are beyond measure hainous, such as my Thoughts tremble at; and Tongue dare not express to <hi>God</hi> that knows 'em, against whom only they are committed. If there is Horror in their very Remembrance; what will their be then in their Retribution?</p>
               <p n="4">4. THEY are bitter things thou urgest against thy self; no Adversary could plead worse: But I admit thy vileness; be thou as wicked as <hi>Satan</hi> can


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54318:18"/>
make thee: It is not his Malice, or thy Wickedness, that can exclude thee from Mercy: Be thou as sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did as Sin can expose thee, yet <hi>There is a Fountain opened to the House of</hi> David, Zach. 13.1. (a bloody Fountain in the Side of thy Saviour) <hi>for Sin, and for Uncleanness.</hi> Be thou as Leprous as that <hi>Syrian</hi> was of old, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.18. if thou canst but <hi>Wash seven times</hi> in the <hi>Waters</hi> of this <hi>Jordan,</hi> thou wilt be clean; <hi>Thy Flesh shall come again to thee, like to the Flesh of a little Child:</hi> Thou shalt be at once sound and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Be thou stung with the Fiery Serpents of this Wilderness; yet if thou cast thine Eyes to that <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> erected for thy Malady, thou wilt find Cure. Wherefore came <hi>Christ</hi> into the World, but to save Sinners? Add, if thou wilt, <hi>Whereof I am Chief,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. Thou canst alledge no worse by thy self, than the best did before thee; who, in the Right of a Sinner, claimeth the Benefit of a Saviour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. WERE it not for Sin, what use were there of a Redeemer? Were not Sin hainous, how should it require such an Expiation, as the Blood of <hi>Christ?</hi> The magnitude of thy Sins, merits but to magnifie the Mercy of the Forgiver: To remit the Debt of Farthings, were insignificant; but to forgive thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Talents, is the height of Bounty. Thus <hi>God</hi> deals with thee: He permits thee to run on to so deep a Sum, that when thy Conscious heart hath proclaim'd thee a Bankrupt, he may infinitely oblige thee, and glorifie his own Mercy, in crossing the Reckoning, and acquitting thy Soul. All Sums are equally dischargable to the Munificence of our Great Creditor in Heav'n: As it is the Act of his Justice, to expect the least; so it is of his Mercy to forgive the Greatest. Had we to do with a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power, we might sink under the Burthen of our Sins: But having an Infinite Power to attend


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54318:18"/>
us, let thy Care be to lay hold on that Infinite Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and as thou art an Object of Mercy, sinful, and miserable enough; so conclude thy self (as thou art) a Subject proper to receive it as a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Believer. Open and enlarge thy Bosom, and assume this Free Grace, and close wth thy Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour; and in him, possess thy self of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, Peace and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. COMFORTABLE Expressions, thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessest, to those that are capable of them: But what is this to me, that am neither Penitent nor Believer? Alas! That which is Honey to others, is Gall and Wormwood to me; who want the Grace to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and Believe as I ought. Why art thou so imprudent and unjust, as to conspire with <hi>Satan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy own Soul? Why wilt thou be so unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully injurious to the <hi>God</hi> of Mercies, as to deny those Graces which his good Spirit hath bestowed upon thee? If thou wert not penitent, why are these Tears? What means these Sighs and Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Expressions of Sorrow, which thou utterest? It is no Temporal Loss that afflicts thee; nor Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Distemper that thus disquiets thee: Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, thou art Soul-sick, thy Spirit is wounded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee; and what can thus affect thy Soul, but sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or what can this Affection of thy Soul be for Sin, but true Penitence?</p>
               <p n="7">7. THOU repliedst; I am indeed sorrowful for Sin, but not upon the right Grounds: I grieve for the misery that Sin hath brought upon me, not for the evil of Sin, but for the Punishment, not the Offence; for my Peril, not for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of my <hi>God.</hi> Beware, lest an undue Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility cause thee falsely to accuse the Graces of God's Spirit: Thou art no competent Judge, whilst thou art under Temptations. Had not thy Sorrow a relation to God, why wouldst thou Sigh


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54318:19"/>
to Heaven? Why would thy Heart challenge thee for unkindness in Offending? And to cry out of the Sordidness not of the Peril of thy Sin? What ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the act of thy Sin to be sinful, but the offence against the Divine Majesty? How canst thou be sorry that thou hast Sinned, and not be sorry that thou hast Offended? Tell me, What is it thy Conscience primarily suggests to thee in this impression of thy Sorrow? Is it thou shalt be Punish'd, or that thou hast Sinned? And were it put to thy Choice, Whether thou hadst rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Favour of God with extremity of Pain, or continue in his Displeasure with Ease? Or if Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty were tendred to thee, that thou mightst free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sin without danger of Punishment? Whether doth not thy Heart rise at the Condition, as ready to flie in the Face of the Offerer? Besides Fear and Horror, dost thou not find an internal Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at thy Miscarriage, and such a detestation of thy Sin, that were it to be reiterated if it were possible to be concealed from God and Men, and if there were no Hell to avenge it, woulst thou not abhor to commit it? All these are strong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of the right grounds of thy Repentance, and of the injury which thou dost thy Soul, in the unjust Scruples which thou raisest against it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. IF the grounds (thou say'st) of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be regular, yet the measure is Insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. I am sorrowful for Sin, but not enough: An effectual grief for sin, should be serious, deep, hearty, intensive; mine is slight and superficial. I Sigh, but my Sighs proceed not from an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heart: I can sometimes Weep, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pour out my self in Tears: I mourn, but don't continue my Sorrow. To this I <hi>Answer,</hi> Thou hast to do with a God, which in all the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy Soul, regards Validity, and not Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity:

If he find thy Remorse, he exacts not the solid Measure: He doth not meet up our Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by Inches or Hours, but where he finds sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of Penitence, is Indulgent. Look upon <hi>David,</hi> and acknowledge his Sin formidably detestable, no less than <hi>Adultery, Inebriation</hi> and <hi>Murder</hi>: Yet no sooner did he in a true Compunction of Heart, cry out, <hi>I have sinned against the Lord</hi>; then he hears from that Mouth which accused him; <hi>The Lord also hath put away thy Sin, thou shalt not die,</hi> 2 Sam. 12, 13. Here is a penitent Confession, which was efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Expiation of those grievous Crimes. Thou art deceived if thou imaginest <hi>God</hi> delights in the Affliction of his Creatures: So far only is the grief of his Servants pleasing to him, that it may conduce to the health of their Souls, in the sensibleness of their Sin, and meet capacity of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I do not, with some Casuists, flatter thee with an Opinion of the sufficiency of any slight Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and empty wishes, that thou hast not Sinned; doubt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ess a true Contrition of Spirit, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction of Heart, are necessarily required to a saving Repentance: And these, wert thou but an indifferent Censurer of thine own ways, thou would'd find within thy self. Why is thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance so dejected, thy Cheeks pale, and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so oft with Tears, thy want of Rest, and loss of Appetite? Wherefore dost thou pour out those doleful Complaints and vehement Deprecations? But after all this, art thou such as thou accusest thy self, defective in thy <hi>Repentance</hi>? Dost thou rest contented in this condition, and not complain of it as the greatest Misery? Art thou not heartily sorry that thou canst be no more grieved for thy Sin? Comfort thy self, even this is an acceptable <hi>Repentance,</hi> and God accepts it. What is <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>


                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54318:20"/>
but a change from Evil to Good? And how sensible is this Change, that thou who formerly delightedst in thy Sin, now detests it and thy self for it; and art yet ambitious of more Grief, for being transported into it? Let not thy Souls Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who desires nothing more than to make thee perfectly Miserable, so allure thee, as to render thee unsatisfied with the Measure of that Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency which is accepted of <hi>God</hi>: Rather turn thine Eyes from thy Sins, and look to Heaven and fix 'em upon thine All-sufficient Mediator, and behold his Face smiling upon thy humbled Soul, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reconciling thee to his Eternal Father, as being fully assured, <hi>That being justified by Faith, we have Peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by Faith into this Grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in the hope of the Glory of God, Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2.</p>
               <p n="10">10. THERE thou say'st is the very root of my Complaint: I want that <hi>Faith</hi> that should give me an interest in my Saviour, and afford true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to my Soul, and <hi>Boldness and Access with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi> to the Throne of Grace, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.12. I can be sorry, but cannot believe; my Grief is not so great as my Infidelity: I see others full of <hi>Joy and Peace in believing,</hi> Rom. 15.13. But my stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Heart cannot soar up to a conformable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of my Saviour: So as indeed I dwell in obdurate Darkness, and a sad ponderosity of Incredulity, wanting that Assurance which others profess to find in themselves. Take heed, lest whilst thou art too querulous, thou prove unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and whilst thy Humbleness disparages thee, thou make God a Loser. A Man may have a rich Mine in his Ground which he knows not of, and there are Shells furnish'd with Pearls, whose Worth many are not sensible of. This is thy State: Thou


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54318:20"/>
hast that Grace thou complainest to want; and there is no measuring of thy self by Sense, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the time of Temptation. Thou coulst not so sensibly lament the want of Faith, if thou hadst it not. Thou canst not deny an Assent to the verity of all <hi>God</hi>'s Promises: Thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgst he could not be what he is, if he were not even Verity it self. Thou canst not doubt but he hath made those promises of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to all Penitent Sinners, which tend to their Salvation; and thou canst not but grant, thou art sinful enough to need Mercy, and sorrowful enough to desire and Embrace it.</p>
               <p n="11">11. CANST thou but love thy self so well, that when thou seest a Pardon held forth to stretch forth thy Hand, and take it? This Hand is thy <hi>Faith,</hi> which takes hold of thy Redeemer. As for that Assurance thou mentions, they are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that can feel and maintain it; and it must be our holy Ambition to be diligent in the Aspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: But such a height of Perfection, every Traveller in this wretched Pilgrimage, cannot whilst he is in this perplexed and heavy Road, hope to attain to. It is an unsafe and dangerous Path, which those Men have walked in, who have used to define all Faith by Assurance. Should I conduct thee that way, it might be prejudicial. So sure a Certainty of our constant and reflected apprehension of Eternal Life, is both hard to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and not easie to hold unmovably, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many strong Temptations that we are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to in this Vale of Misery and Death. Should Faith be reduced to this Trial, it would be more rare than our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath foretold it: For as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boasts of such an Assurance, who is yet failing of a true Faith, embracing a vain Presumption instead of it: So many also hath true Faith in the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> who yet complains to want that Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54318:21"/>
Canst thou in a sense of thine own Misery close with thy <hi>Saviour</hi>? Canst thou throw thy self into the Arms of his Mercy? Canst thou trust him with thy Soul, and relie upon him for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness and Salvation? Canst thou prostrate thy self before him, as a miserable Object of his Grace and Mercy? And when it is offered thee, canst lay some (tho weak) hold upon it? Labour for further degrees of Strength daily. Set not up thy Rest in this pitch of Grace, but cheer up thy self, and thus much Faith shall save thy Soul. Thou believest, and he hath said it, that is Verity it self, <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath Everlasting Life,</hi> Joh. 3.36.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I know, thou averrest that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> came into the World to save Sinners; and that <hi>Whoever believeth on him, shall not Perish, but have eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 3.15. Neither can I deny, but in a sense of my sinful Condition, I cast my self in some measure upon my <hi>Saviour,</hi> and lay hold upon his All-sufficient Redemption: But, Alas! My apprehensions of him are so weak, that they can afford no Comfort to my Soul. Were it not that thou expectest to be Justified, and saved by the power and act of thy Faith, thou hast reason to be disheartened with the imbecility of it: But now, that the Vertue and Efficacy of this happy Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the Object apprehended by thee, which is the infinite Merits and Mercy of thy <hi>Saviour,</hi> that cannot be abated by thine Infirmities, thou hast reason cheerfully to expect thy Salvation. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand thy case aright: Here's a double Hand that helps thee towards Heaven; thy hand of Faith lays hold on thy <hi>Saviour</hi>: Thy <hi>Saviour</hi>'s hand of Mercy and plentious Redemption, lays on thee; thy hold of him is feeble and easily loosed; his hold of thee is strong and irresistable. Comfort thy self therefore with the blessed Apostle; when thou art


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54318:21"/>
                  <hi>Weak,</hi> then thou art <hi>Strong</hi>; when weak in thy self, then strong in thy Redeemer: Shouldst thou boast and say, Tush, I shall never be moved; I should suspect the Verity and Safety of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Now thou deplorest thy Weakness, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but Congratulate the happy Estate of thy Soul. If a greater Work were expedient, strength of Hand were necessary: But now only receiving of a precious Gift is required, why may not a weak Hand perform that as well as a strong, tho not so forcibly? Be not dejected with Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, but comfort thy self in the Mercies of thy Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="13">13. THOU expressest; Sometimes, I find my heart at ease, in a comfortable Reliance on my <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;</hi> and being well resolv'd of the safety of my State, promise good days to my self; and after the banishment of my former Fears, dare bid defiance to Temptations: But, Alas! how soon is this sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity over? How suddenly is this clear Skie clouded, spread over with obscurity, and I return to my former Despondency? Did'st thou conceive, that Grace would put thee into a constant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual invariable Condition of Soul, whil'st thou art on this side Heav'n? Didst thou ever hear or read of any of <hi>God</hi>'s Saints upon Earth, that were unchangeable in their holy Dispositions, whil'st they continued in this Region of Mutability? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Man after <hi>God</hi>'s own heart, thou shalt find him sometimes so couragious, as if the Spirits of all his Worthies were met in his own Bosom, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely doth he blow off all dangers, trample on his Enemies, and triumph over all cross Events? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other while thou shalt find him so dejected, and transform'd from what he was: When chearful; <hi>The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall lack nothing,</hi> Psal, 23.1.

In a holy Rapture, thou shalt find him caught up into the Third Heaven, and by Permission of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> buffetted by the Messengers of Satan, and uttering Complaints to <hi>God</hi> of the Violence of that Assault.

But when thou finds thy Soul becalm'd, and not a Leaf stirring in its Garden, be not too much dejected with an ungrounded Opinion of being destituted of thy <hi>God</hi>; neither repine at the Seasons, or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his Bounty: That most free and beneficent Agent, will not be tyed to our Terms; but will give us what he sees necessary: Therefore humbly wait upon his Goodness: and <hi>be confident, that he who hath begun his good Work in thee, will perform it until the Day of Jesus Christ,</hi> Phil. 1.6.</p>
               <p n="14">14. IT is true, (thou say'st) if <hi>God</hi> had began the Operation, He would at last, for his own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry finish it: But for me, I am a Man dead in Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and Sins; and never had any true Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in me: Some shew, indeed, I have made of a Christian Profession; but I have only deceived the World with a fallacious Pretence, and have not found in my self the Verity, and Solidity of those Heavenly Vertues, whereof I have made an Ostentation. It were pity thou shouldst be so bad as thou representest thy self: I have no tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion in store for Hypocrisie; nor no Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more odious to the <hi>Almighty;</hi> insomuch, as when he expresses Vengeance against Sinners, he uses those terms of Terror, <hi>I will appoint him his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Hypocrites,</hi> Mat. 24.51. Were it thus with thee, it were high time to work thy Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in Dust and Ashes; and resign thy self into the hands of his Almighty Protection, to be created anew by his Powerful Spirit; and never to give thy self Peace, till thou findest thy self <hi>Renewed in the Spirit of thy Mind,</hi> Eph. 4.23. But, in the mean


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54318:23"/>
while, take heed of being guilty of mis-judging thine own Soul; and misprising the Operation of <hi>God</hi>'s Spirit: <hi>God</hi> hath been better to thee, than thou wilt acknowledge: Thou hast a true Sense of Grace, and perceiv'st it not. There is no Cognisance to be taken of the Sentence thou passest upon thy self, in the hour of Temptation: When thy heart was free, thou wert in another Mind; and shalt, upon better advice, reasume thy former Thoughts.</p>
               <p n="15">15. IT is with thee, as with <hi>Eutychus,</hi> that fell down from the third Story, and was taken up for Dead, when his Life remained in him. We have known those in Trances, without any perception of Life; yea, some (as that subtil <hi>Johannes Duns Scotus</hi>) laid in their Graves before their Souls had taken leave of their Bodies, though unable to exert those Faculties, which might Evince her hidden Presence. Such perhaps art thou at the worst; and wert thou in Charity with thy self, thou wouldest be found in a better Condition. There is the same reason of the Natural Life and the Spiritual: Where it is discern'd by Breathings, Sense and Motions; where there is a breathing Motion, there must be a Life that sends it forth: If then the Soul breaths Holy Desires, doubtless there is a Life whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Now deny, if thou can'st, that thou hast not these Spiritual Breathings of Holy Desires Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally? Dost thou not many times sigh for thine own Insanity? Is not thine heart perplexed with the Thoughts of thy Spiritual wants? Dost thou not truly desire, that <hi>God</hi> would <hi>Renew a right Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within thee</hi>? Be cheerful: This is the Operation of <hi>God</hi>'s Spirit: As well may a Man breath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Life, as thou couldst be thus affected without Repentance. Sense is a quick Discrier of Life: Wound a dead Man, he is not sensible; but the Living perceiveth the easiest Touch. When thou

hast heard the Judgments of <hi>God,</hi> denounced against Sinners, and laid to thy Conscience; has thy heart been pierced with them? Hast thou not secretly thought, how shall I decline this dreadful Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? When thou hast heard the Mercies of <hi>God</hi> to Penitent Sinners, hath not thy heart said, Oh that I had my share in 'em! When thou hast heard <hi>God</hi> blasphem'd, hast thou not felt a horror in thy Bosom? All these are Symptoms of a Spiritual Life.</p>
               <p n="16">16. MOTION is the perfectest Discoverer of Life: He that stirs his Limbs is not dead. The Feet of the Soul are the Affections: Hast thou not found an hate and detestation of that Sin, wherein thou hast been allured: And discover'd Grief of heart for thy Indisposition to all good things? Hast thou not found a Love to, and Complacency in those who are truely Religious and Conscionable? Without a Life of Repentance, Penitence had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht. Are not thine Eyes and Hands often lift up to implore mercy? Canst thou deny, thou hast a real, though weak Appetite to the means, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it?

Discomfort not thy self with the disappearance of <hi>God</hi>'s Spirit: In the hour of Temptation, it is with thee, as with a Tree in Winter, whose Sap is run to the Root; where there is no Appearance of Vegetation, by any Buds or Blossoms, but appears, motionless: Yet when the Sun returns his comfortable Beams, it sprouts forth afresh, and bewrays that Vital Juice, which lay in the Earth: So thou must with <hi>Patience</hi> wait, till the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with Healing in his Wings, and Summon thy Humidity into thy Branches; that that Grace may spring in thee, which is able to save thy Soul: Then thou wilt say

Only use the means, and wait patiently <hi>God</hi>'s Leisure; stay upon the Bank of this <hi>Bethesda,</hi> till the <hi>Angel</hi> descend and move the Water.</p>
               <p n="16">16. I could gladly, thou repliest, attend with <hi>Patience</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> in this happy Work of the Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Grace, were I but sure I had it; or could be perswaded of the Verity of my Conversion: But it is my unhappiness, that here I am at an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable loss; for I am inform'd, that every Convert can design the Time, Place, means and manner of his Conversion; and demonstrate how near he was to the Gates of Death, nay, to the Verge of Hell; when <hi>God,</hi> by a mighty Arm, has snatcht him away, from the Pit of <hi>Perdition,</hi> and rescu'd him from everlasting Damnation; placing him in a State of Eternal Salvation; Which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain to; not finding any such vehement Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion, hearty Contrition, or such forcible and irresistable Operation of <hi>God</hi>'s Spirit in me, nor can I practice the Sermon design'd for my Conversion, or those Approaches my Soul made towards an hardly-recovered Desperation.</p>
               <p>To which I answer: It is not safe for any Man to set Limits to the Almighty; or to prescribe Rules to that Infinite Wisdom: That most free, and All-wise Agent, will not be tyed to walk al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in one Path; but varies his Courses accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Divine Will. One he calls suddenly, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>; another by sweet Solicitations, as <hi>Philip, Nathanael, Andrew, Peter, Matthew,</hi> and other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. One he draws to Heaven with gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations; another with a strong hand. We have known those, who having mispent their Juvenile Years, in notorious debauch'd Courses, living as without <hi>God,</hi> and have been heart-stricken with


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54318:24"/>
some Denunciation of Judgment; which hath so wrought upon 'em, that it hath brought them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in sight of Hell: But after deep Humiliation, have been raised through <hi>God</hi>'s mercy, to a Comfortable Sense of the Divine Favour, and have proceeded to a high degree of Regeneration, and liv'd and dy'd good Christians.</p>
               <p n="18">18. BUT this is not every ones Case; those who have from their Infancy been brought up in <hi>The Nurture and Fear of the Lord,</hi> Eph. 6.4. and from their Youth been Train'd up under a Godly and Conscionable Ministry; where they have been plyed with the effectual means of Grace: <hi>Precept upon Precept, Line upon Line; here a little, and there a little,</hi> Isa. 28.10. and by an insensible Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, received the Gracious Inoperations of the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> though not without many inward Debates, Temptations, and deep Humiliation, for their particular Failings; these cannot expect to find so sensible Alterations in themselves: As well a Child knows when he was born, as these know the instant of their Spiritual Regeneration; and as well may they see the Grass grow, as perceive their insensible Increase of Grace: It is sufficient that a Child, attaining to Reason, knows he was born; as when we see the Grass higher than we left it, know that it is grown. Let it then suffice thee, that the thing is finish't, though thou canst not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the time, and manner of doing it: Be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver curious in matters of particular Preceptions, whil'st thou art assured of what is wrought in thee. The skilful Chyrurgion, makes a Fontinel in the Body of his Patient, either by a sudden Incision, or by a leisurely Corrosive; both equally tend towards Health. Trust <hi>God</hi> with thy self, and with his own Work; without making inquiry, which way he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs thy Salvation?</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54318:25"/>19. ALL were safe, thou say'st, if I could be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain'd of my Election to Life Eternal: I could be <hi>Patient,</hi> so I might be sure: But, wretched that I am, here I am plung'd: I see others walk com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, as if in Heav'n; whereas I droop under a continual Diffidence; raising my self new Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Distrust. Could my heart be settled in this Assurance, nothing could make me unhappy.</p>
               <p>It is true, as all other mercies flow from our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; so the securing of this one, involves all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Favours that concern the welfare of our Souls. It is no less true, our Election may be assured; else the Holy Ghost had not laid so deep a Charge upon us, to use our utmost Endeavour to ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: And we are much wanting to our selves, if hearing so excellent a Blessing may be attained by diligence, if we pull not our hand out of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, to reach that Crown so offer'd to us: But withal, 'tis true, if there were not a difficulty in this work, the Apostle had not so earnestly call'd for the utmost of our Endeavour to effect it; 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p n="20">20. THE Truth is, in Christianity there is no Path, wherein there is more need of treading wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than in this: On each side is Danger and Death; Security on one hand, and Presumption on the other: And the Miscarriage either way, is deadly. Behold the miserable Examples on both kinds: Some walk carelesly, as if there were no Heav'n; or if such a Place, yet of no Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Their hearts are fond of the Pleasure of this Life; and they neither care, nor wish to be happier, than this World can make 'em: <hi>The God of this World hath blinded their Eyes, that they believe not,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4. Others walk proudly, being vainly puff't up with their own ungrounded Imaginations, as if they were invested with Immortal Glory; fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54318:25"/>
themselves rapt up with St. <hi>Paul</hi> into the Third Heav'n, and have seen their Names record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Book of Life: Whereas this is nothing but an Illusion of that Lying Spirit; who knows the the way to keep 'em out of Heaven, is to make 'em believe they are in a State of happiness.</p>
               <p n="21">21. IT must be thy main Care to walk, in a just Equidistance from both these Extreams; that thou may'st be resolute without Presumption, and careful without Diffidence. And, <hi>First,</hi> I advise thee to abandon those false Teachers, who improve their Wits for the Ruine of Souls, in broaching the sad Doctrines of Uncertainty and Distrust. Be sure our <hi>Saviour</hi> had not bid his Disciples rejoyce, that their <hi>Names are written in Heaven,</hi> Luke 10.20. Had there not been a particular Enrollment; nor the Disciples could never have attained to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of such Inscription. Neither is this a Mercy peculiar to his Domestick Followers; but univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal to all that believe what they testifie; and by believing we may be assur'd our Names are Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in those Eternal Records.</p>
               <p n="22">22. NOT that we should take an <hi>Acesius</hi> his Ladder, and climb up to Heaven, and turn over the Book of <hi>God</hi>'s Councils, and read our selves design'd to Glory. But as we by Experience ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we can by Reflections read those Letters, which directly we cannot: So we may do here in spiritual Objects. The same Apostle that gives us our Charge, gives us withal our Directions, <hi>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give all diligence to make your Callings and Election sure; for if ye do those things, ye shall never fall; for so an Entrance shall be ministred unto you abundantly, into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour</hi> Jesus Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10, 11. Here is first our Calling, then our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Not that we should begin with Heaven, and


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54318:26"/>
thence descend to Earth; but that we should from Earth ascend to Heaven, from our Calling, to our Election: As knowing, that God shews what he hath done for us above, by that which he hath wrought in us here below.</p>
               <p n="23">23. OUR Calling not outward and formal, but inward and effectual. The Spirit of <hi>God</hi> hath a Voice, and our Soul an Ear; that Voice of the Spirit speaks inwardly and effectually to the Ear of the Soul, calling us out of the State of Corrupt Nature, into the State of Grace; out of Darkness, into his marvellous Light. By thy Calling, thou mayst judge of thine Election: <hi>God</hi> never works in vain, neither doth he cast away his saving Graces: But <hi>whom he did Predestinate, them also he Called; and whom he Called, them he Justified; and whom he Justified, them also he Glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.30. This doubtless, thou sayst, is sure in it self, but how assured to me? I answer: That which the Apostle adds, <hi>By good Works,</hi> if we comprehend the Acts of Believing and Repenting, is a special Evidence of our Election. But not to urge that Clause of <hi>Good Works,</hi> which (tho read in the Vulgar) is found wanting in our Editions; The clear words of the Text evince no less: <hi>For if ye do these things, ye shall nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r fall:</hi> Here is our Negative Certainty: And for our Positive; <hi>So an Entrance shall be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto you abundantly, into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour</hi> Jesus Christ. If we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall, but shall undoubtedly enter the Kingdom of <hi>Christ</hi>; what possible scruple can be of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of our Election? What then are these things that must be perform'd by us? Fix your Eyes upon that Collection of Graces, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>If you add to your Faith, Vertue, and to Vertue, Knowledge; and to Knowledge, Temperance; and to Temperance, Patience; and to Patience, Godliness; and


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54318:26"/>
to Godliness, Brotherly Kindness, Charity,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="23">23. IF Thou wouldst be inform'd what God hath written concerning thee in Heaven, look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy own Bosom, and see what Graces he hath wrought in thee. <hi>Truth of Grace,</hi> saith the Divine Apostle, <hi>will make good the certainty of your Election.</hi> Not to instance the rest of that Heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination; do but single the first and the last, Faith and Charity: For Faith, how clear is that of our Saviour; <hi>He that believeth in him that sent me, hath Everlasting Life, and shall not come into Condemnation; but hath passed from Death to Life,</hi> Joh. 5.24. What danger can befall us in our acquiring Heaven? All the Peril is in the way. Now the Believer is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy passed into Life: This is the Grace, by which <hi>Christ dwells in our Hearts,</hi> Ephes. 3.17. and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have Communion with him, and an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Testimony of and from him: <hi>For he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in the Son of God, hath the Witness in himself:</hi> And what Witness is that? <hi>This is the Record, that God hath given us Eternal Life: And this Life is in his Son; he that hath the Son, hath Life,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.10, 11, 12. Oh happy Connexion! Eternal Life first: This Life Eternal, is in and by <hi>Christ Jesus</hi>; he is ours by Faith, and this Faith testifieth to our Souls assurance of Life Eternal: Charity is the last, which comprehends our love to God and Man: For, from the reflection of <hi>God</hi>'s Love to us, ariseth a Love from us to him again. The beloved Disciple can say, <hi>We love him, because he loved us first,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.19. And from these resulteth our Love to our Brethren: And such an Evidence we have, that the Apostle tells us expresly, <hi>That we know we are passed from Death to Life, because we love the Brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.14.: For the love of the Father is inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable from the love of the Son: <hi>He that loveth


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54318:27"/>
him that Begets, loves him that is Begotten of him,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1.</p>
               <p n="25">25. NOW deal impartially with thine own Heart, and enquire seriously, as in the Presence of the Searcher of all Hearts, Whether thou dost not find in thy self these Evidences of thine Election? Art thou not effectually, tho not perfectly called out of the World, and corrupt Nature? Dost thou not inwardly abhor sinful ways, and think of what thou wert with Detestation? Dost thou not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be in all things approved to God, and confirmed to thy Saviour? Dost thou not cast thy self upon the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and depend upon his free All sufficiency for Pardon and Salvation? Dost thou not love that infinite Goodness, who hath been so rich in Mercies to thee; and bless those Beams of Goodness which he hath cast upon his Saints on Earth? Lastly, Dost thou not love a good Man, because he is so? Comfort thy self in the Lord, and let no Fear and Distrust possess thy Soul: <hi>Faithful is he that hath Called thee,</hi> 1 Thes. 5.24. who will also <hi>Preserve thy whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Thes. 5.23.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THOU art assaulted with Temptations: And what the Enemy cannot do by Force or Fraud, he seeks by Importunity. Can this seem averse to thee, when the Son of <hi>God</hi> was in the Wilderness forty Days, and forty Nights, under the Tempter? He that durst set upon the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> Heb. 2.10. How shall he spare frail Flesh and Blood? Why should Christ suffer himself to be Tempted, but to support thee in all thy Temptations? The Keys of the Bottomless Pit are at his disposal: He could have confin'd that Presumptuous Spirit to Chains of Darkness, and admitted him no nearer to him than Hell; but he would let him loose, and permit him to act his worst, purposely that we might not dislike to be Tempted, and that he might foyl our greatest Enemy.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:54318:28"/>2. CANST thou think that he, who sits at the right Hand of Majesty, commanding the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Heaven, Earth and Hell, could not keep off that malignant Spirit from assailing thee? Canst thou think him less Merciful, than mighty? Would he die to save thee? And will he turn that Miscreant of Hell loose to worry thee? Dost thou not Pray daily to thy Father in Heaven, to <hi>Lead thee n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that was led by his Divine Spirit into the Wilderness, to be Tempted of that Evil Spirit, bids thee pray to the Father that he would not <hi>Lead thee into Temptation</hi>; implying, that thou couldst not go into Temptation, unless he lead thee; and whilst he that is thy Father, leads thee, how canst thou miscarry? <hi>Let no Man when he is Tempted, say, I am tempted of God; for God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be tempted with Evil, neither tempteth he any Man,</hi> Jam. 1.13. <hi>God</hi> Tempteth thee not; yet being his, thou couldst not be Tempted without him, both permitting and ordering that Temptation to his own Glory, and thy eternal Welfare.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THAT Grace which God hath given thee, he will have thus manifested.

of Sin; yet even those overcome, yield no small cause of Triumph: For by them is our Faith tried; and the trying of our Faith worketh <hi>Patience</hi>; and the perfect work of <hi>Patience,</hi> is a blessed Entireness. The number of Enemies adds to the Praise of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: To overcome a single Temptation, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; but to subdue Multitudes is glorious.</p>
               <p n="6">6. ALAS, thou repliest, I am opprest, not with Multiplicity, but with Pow'r: In <hi>Duelling</hi> respect is had to the Equality both of the Combatants and Weapons: But alas, how am I overmatch'd! I am a weak Wretch; and <hi>We wrestle not against Flesh and Blood; but against Principalities and Powers: against the Rulers of the Darkness of this World, against Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wickedness in Heavenly Places,</hi> Ephes. 6.12. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the</hi> Amorite, <hi>whose height is like the height of Cedars, and their Strength as the Strength of Oaks,</hi> Amos 2.9. We are but poor Pismirs in the Valley, to these Men of Measures? Who can stand before these Sons of <hi>Anak</hi>? I did not advise thee to be strong in thy self; we are all Compounds of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: One of those Pow'rs of Darkness were able to subdue all Mortality: But to be <hi>Strong in the Lord</hi>; whose inferiour Angel is able to vanquish a Hell of Devils: And in the Pow'r of his Might, commandeth the most furious of those Infernal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to their Chains.

ASSUME Courage therefore to thy self; there can't be so much difference betwixt thee, and those Hellish Pow'rs, as there is betwixt them, and the Almighty: There Force is finite, and limited by Omnipotence. How glad do'st thou think, <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> the great Magicians of <hi>Egypt,</hi> would have made but an Insect in affront to <hi>Moses</hi>? but could not. How earnest was that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Devils fain to beg leave to prevail over a few <hi>Gaderene</hi>-Swine? How strong soever they seem to thee, yet to him they are so weak, that they cannot move without him. Who fears a <hi>Bear,</hi> or a <hi>Lion,</hi> when chain'd to a Stake? Children then can be Spectators, when they are so Restrained. Look not on thy self therefore, nor them; but look up to the Almighty, who ordinates all Motions to his own holy Purposes; and even out of their Malice, raises Glory to himself, and Advantage to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
               <p n="8">8. IT is a sad Advantage, (thou say'st) I have made of Temptations: For, Alas! I have been soil'd by 'em, what by their Subtilty and Violence, have been seduced into a grievous Sin against <hi>God,</hi> and lie down in a just Confusion of Face, to have been so miserably vanquished. Had'st thou want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tears for thine Offences, I should willingly have lent thee some. But it is indeed a deplorable Case, that thou hast given thy deadly Enemy this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Triumph over thee; and hast thus provoked <hi>God</hi>: Nevertheless be thou throughly humbled under the Guilt of thy Sin, and be not too hasty in snatching a Pardon out of the hand thou hast offended: Be humbled, and after a serious Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, be not dis-heartned with thy Failings: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I dread to tell thee of an Advantage to be made, not of thy Temptations only, but of thy Sin.</p>

thou dost in a Holy Indignation, rise up, and fight the more valiantly? A Wound received, whets the Edge of Fortitude: Many a one had not been Victorious, if he had not bled first. Look where thou wilt, upon all the Saints of <hi>God</hi>; observe if thou canst see any of them without his Scars: Many fearful Gashes we have beheld of the Noblest of <hi>God</hi>'s Champions whose Courage had not been rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to so high a Pitch, had it not been out of the sense of some former Discomfortures! As some well-spirited Wrestler, be not troubled with thy Fall, as zealous to repay it with a successful Encounter. <hi>We know,</hi> saith the blessed Apostle, <hi>that all things worketh together for good to them that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.28. Yea, even their very Sins. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> offended in their silent Connivance at the Incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Person: The Apostles Reproof produced their Sorrow: What was the Issue? <hi>For behold, this self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same thing that ye sorrowed after a Godly sort, what Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness is wrought in you? Yea, what clearing of your selves; yea, what Indignation; yea, what Fear; yea, what vehement Desire; yea, what Zeal; yea, what Revenge</hi>? 2 Cor. 7.11. What a marvellous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is here made of one Offence? And what hath <hi>Satan</hi> gain'd by this Encounter? One poor <hi>Corinthian</hi> is misled to an incestuous Copulation: The Evil Spirit rejoiceth at such a Prey; but how long shall he enjoy it? Soon after the offending Soul, upon the <hi>Apostles</hi> Censure, is reclaim'd; he is deliver'd to Satan, that he should never possess him.</p>
               <p n="10">10. THE <hi>Corinthians</hi> are raised to a greater height of Godly Zeal, than ever. <hi>Corinth</hi> had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been so rich in Grace, if not defiled with so foul a Crime. Confess now, if this be not in effect thy Case? Shouldest thou ever have detested thy Sin, if thou had'st not been drawn in, to commit it?


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54318:30"/>
Shouldst thou have had so fervent a Love to <hi>God,</hi> had it not been out of a sense of his great Mercy, in remitting it? Wouldst thou have been so weary in thy Stops, as thou art, if thou hadst not slip'd? Give Glory to God, but shame to thy self, and Bless him for the benefit that he hath been pleased to make of thine Offending him.</p>
               <p n="11">11. BUT Alas! thou sayst my Case is far worse than it is conceiv'd; I have been more than once miscarried into the same Sin: For after I have made profession of my Repentance, I have been transported into my former Wickedness: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving washt off my Sin, (as I thought) with many Tears, yet I have suffer'd my Soul to be defiled again. I must not flatter thee, this Condition is Dangerous: Those Diseases, which upon their first Seisure have receiv'd Cure, after a Relapse, have threatned Death. Look upon the Saints of <hi>God,</hi> thou shalt find they have kept a distance from that Fire wherewith they have been formerly Burn'd: Thou shalt not find <hi>Noah</hi> again Uncovered through Drunkenness, Nor <hi>Judah</hi> climbing to <hi>Tamer</hi>'s Bed: Thou shalt not take <hi>Peter</hi> again in the High-Priest's Hall, denying his Master; or after St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, <hi>Halting in his Dissimulation,</hi> Gall. 2.11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="12">12. BUT tell me, notwithstanding, Art thou truly serious with thy <hi>God?</hi> Hast thou doubled thy Humiliation, for the Reduplication of thine Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and sought God more instantly with an unfeigned Contrition? Hast thou found thy Soul hath a greater detestation of Sin, than thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with it hath indulg'd thee? Hast thou taken this occasion to lay hold on thy <hi>Saviour,</hi> and to reinforce the Vows of strict Obedience? If so, this unpurpos'd Reiteration of thy Sin, shall be no Prejudice to thy Salvation. It is one thing for a Man


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54318:31"/>
to walk on willingly in a beaten Path of Sin, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing for him to be led out of the way of Righteousness, by the violence of a Temptation, which he soon recovers by a sincere Repentance.</p>
               <p n="13">13. THE Best cannot but he overtaken with Sin: But, <hi>He that is Born of God, doth not commit Sin,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. He may be transported, but makes not a Custom of doing ill: His Heart is against that, his Hand is drawn to: And if in this inward Strife he is over-power'd, he lyes not down with a willing Mind, but struggles, and with a reassu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Courage, tramples on that which formerly supplanted him. Didst thou give thy self to a resolved course of Sinning, and betwixt whiles smite thy Breast with a formal <hi>God forgive me,</hi> I should have no Comfort for thee, but rather send thee to an afflictious Remedy of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, if possibly those Stripes may prevent thine Everlasting Torments.</p>
               <p n="14">14. BUT now, since <hi>What thou hatest, that thou dost; and thou dost that which thou wouldst not; and it is no more thou that dost it, but Sin that dwels in thee,</hi> Rom. 7.19, 20. Exclaim as much as thou wilt on the sinfulness of thy Sin, bewail thy Weakness with a better Man than thy self: <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death,</hi> Rom. 7.24. But know, that thou hast found Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with <hi>God:</hi> Thy repeated Sin may grieve, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prejudice thy Soul. Had we to do with a Finite Compassion, it might be abated, by wasting it self on a frequent Remission, as a great River may be drawn dry by many small Out-lets: But now that we deal with a God, whose Mercy is Infinite; it is not the greatness, or number of our Offences, that makes a difference in his free Remission: That <hi>God,</hi> who hath charged our weak Charity. <hi>Not to be overcome of Evil, but to overcome Evil with Good,</hi>

THOU complainest of the <hi>Imbecillity of Grace:</hi> Some little motions thou art sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of <hi>God</hi>'s Spirit; but so insignificant, that thou canst not find any solid Comfort. Thou seest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (thou say'st) whose <hi>Breasts are full of Milk, and their Bones moistned with Marrow,</hi> Job 21.24. whil'st thou languishest under a Spiritual Leanness and Imbecillity.

I like this Complaint, and tell thee, That without this, thou could'st not be in the way to happiness.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THINK'ST thou, that those whom thou esteem'st eminent in Grace, make not the same moan that thou do'st? Certainly, they never had any, if they did not complain of too little. Every Man is sensible of his own wants, and ready to pass secret Censures upon himself for being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by others. Even the Man after <hi>God's</hi> own heart, can say, <hi>But I am Poor and Sorrowful,</hi> Psal. 69.29. He was a great King when he said so; it was not Meaness in Estate, that troubled him; but a Spiritual Necessity: For he had before, in the same Heavenly Anthem professed; <hi>O God, thou knowest my Foolishness, and my Guiltiness is not hid from


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54318:32"/>
thee,</hi> Psal. 69.5. It was an old Observation of Wise <hi>Solomon; There is that maketh himself Rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hath nothing; there is that maketh himself Poor, yet hath great Riches,</hi> Prov. 13.7. In this latter Rank are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pious Souls, and thine (I hope) for one; who certainly had never been so Rich in Grace, if they had been conceited of greater Store: Even in this Sense many a Saint may say with St. <hi>Paul, When I am weak, then I am strong</hi>; since the Complaint of Weakness, argues Strength: And, on the contrary, an Opinion of sufficient Grace, is an Evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of meer Emptiness.</p>
               <p n="3">3. BUT suppose thy self so poor as thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest; it is not so much what we have, as how we improve it. How many have we known, that have grown Rich out of a little; and others, out of a great Stock, have run to Beggary? Had that <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> with <hi>One Talent,</hi> imploy'd it to the Gain of a <hi>Second,</hi> he had been proportionably as well rewarded, as he that with <hi>Five</hi> gain'd <hi>Ten.</hi> In our Temporal Estate, we are warned by the Wisest Man, to <hi>Take heed of making haste to be Rich,</hi> Prov. 28.20. And the Apostle tells us, <hi>That he that would be Rich, falls into many Temptations,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.9. Surely, there is no small danger also, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to be too suddenly Rich in the Endowments of the Soul: This cannot but be accompanied with the Temptation of an unthankful distrust: For he that believes makes not haste; and we cannot be sufficiently thankful for what we have, whil'st we do over eagerly reach after what we have not.</p>

Spirit in full Vials? If thou enjoys any, it is his bounty, and more than thou canst repay him: Take what thou hast, as an Earnest of more; and wait thankfully upon his Bounty for the rest: Is it not convenient in a free Gift, to attend the leisure of the Donor? What sturdy Beggars are we, not to stay at the Door till we be served; and grudge at our Alms, when it comes? Look upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> thou shalt find him fourscore and six Years Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; and after he had got <hi>Ishmael,</hi> he waited four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years for the Promised Seed; and when he had enjoy'd him not longer than he expected him, he must Sacrifice him to the Giver. Thus must our Faith be exercised for Time and Measure of Mercy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THY Graces are weak; yet discomfort not thy self: How many frail Bodies have we known, which with careful Tendance, have been Healthier than those of grosser Constitutions. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it otherwise in the Soul: Soundness of heart, is Health; Increas'd Degrees of Grace, make up the Strength of that Spiritual Part: If thou have this Health tenderly observed, thou may'st be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in thy Maker, although more happy in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Sense of a stronger Fruition. We have to do with a <hi>God</hi> that minds not Quantity, as Truth of Repentance. He knows we have nothing, but what he gives us, and enables us to improve: And where he sees our Wills and Endeavours not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he is ready to accept and crown his own Gifts in us. <hi>He will not break the Bruised Reed, nor quench the Smoaking Flax,</hi> Matth. 12.20.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THOU art weak in Grace: Be not dismay'd; there are all Ages, all Statures in <hi>Christ.</hi> Shall the Child repine, that he is not grown a Man? Shall the Dwarf quarrel that he is not a Giant? Were there a Standard of Graces, less than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

and would not be accepted, thou hadst reason to be troubled: But it is so far from that, as that our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath encharged; <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.14. In some Legal Oblations, it pleased <hi>God</hi> to regard Time and Age: <hi>The Lamb for the Passover, and for the Peace-Offering,</hi> Lev. 3.7. <hi>The Bullock for the Sin-Offering of</hi> Israel, Lev. 4.14. have their Date assign'd: And in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Cases, he hath called for <hi>Two Turtle Doves, or two Young Pigeons,</hi> Lev. 1.14. Lev. 5.7, 11. Lev. 12.8. Lev. 15.14. Young <hi>Turtles,</hi> and Old <hi>Doves,</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors) were unlawful to be offered: But in Spiritual Sacrifices; he that is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal regards not Time, nor Statures: For the Eleventh Hour, carried the Peny as well as the First: <hi>And let the weak say, I am strong,</hi> Joel 3.10.</p>
               <p n="7">7. IT perplexes thee, thou hast made so slow a Progress in Graces: Thy desire is Heav'n-ward, and thou checkest thy self for want to Celerity: It is an happy Ambition, that wings thee to Blessedness. Quicken thy self, with Gracious Incitations; but observe, we must not go a full Career: For that Passage admits not of haste: How many have we known, by much forwardness, have been rejected in their Journey, whether by mistaking their Way, or misplacing their Steps? But I am glad it is the desire of thy Soul, to <hi>Run the way of</hi> God's <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> Psal 119.32. and do encourage thy Zeal, in pursuing that Holy Race; ever praying thou may'st <hi>so run, as that thou may'st obtain,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.24. But withal, I tell thee, that, <hi>Blessed is the Man, that doth but walk in the Law of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 119.1. Whil'st thou passest on, though but a Foot-pace, thou art every step nearer to Glory: And if thou gain'st ground, thou art secure. <hi>Blessed is the Man, whose Strength is in Thee, O</hi> God; <hi>in whose heart are


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54318:34"/>
thy Ways; who passing through the Vale of Misery, goes on from Strength to Strength, till he appear before Thee his</hi> God <hi>in</hi> Zion, Psal. 84.5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THY Grace is diminutive; but thou labourest for more: This is a good Beginning of Heavenly Treasure: For he is in a way to Riches, that desires to thrive; and never any Holy Soul lost her Longing. If thy Wishes be hearty, thou hast thy desire, or shalt be assur'd of it. <hi>If any Man lack Wisdom, let him ask it of</hi> God; <hi>who giveth to all Men liberally, and upbraideth no Man; and it shall be given him,</hi> Jam. 1.5. Were this Condition offer'd for Temporal Riches, who would be Poor? And if we embrace it not in Spirituals, we distrust the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, or neglect Mercies. In Temporal things, how many have so eagerly Chased the World, that they have over-run it; and whil'st they greedily swallowed Gain, have been choak'd? But in better Blessings, earnestness of Desire, and fervour of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, was always answered with a Gracious Impetration.</p>
               <p n="9">9. THOU art poor in Spirit; but in an humble Dejection, long'st for more: Know, that an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Poverty, is better than a proud Fulness: Wert thou Poor and Proud, there were no hope of thy Proficiency: Thy false Conception lyes in the way of thy Improvement; and many a one had been Gracious, had they not esteem'd themselves: But now thou art Meaner in thine Opinion, than in thine Estate, who can more justly claim our <hi>Saviours</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; <hi>Blessed are the poor in Spirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven?</hi> Mat. 5.3.</p>
               <p n="10">10. THOU art weak in heart: It is thine own Fault, if thou acquir'st not more Strength. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that Heavenly Food of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to nourish thy Soul to Eternal Life? Do but Eat and Digest, and thou wilt grow stronger


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54318:34"/>
                  <hi>God</hi> will not be wanting to thee in an Increase of Grace, if thou art not wanting to thy self: He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his Holy Spirit, with the Means; and it is thy neglect if thou separate 'em. Thou knowest in whose hands is the Staff of Bread, pray, That he who gives thee Food, and Mouth, would also give thee Appetite, Digestion, and Nourishment.</p>
               <p n="11">11. THY Spirit is weak: It concerns thee highly to be cautious, in avoiding occasions of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He that carries brittle Glasses, is careful lest they should break; whereas strong Metal fears no danger: So he that has a small Rush-Light, walks gently, and keeps off every Air. Thou art weak, thy <hi>God</hi> is strong. Do'st thou not see the Infant that cannot go alone, how fast he clings to the hand of his Mother; more trusting to her help, than his own Strength? Do thou so to thy <hi>God</hi>; and say with the Blessed Psalmist; <hi>Hold up my goings in thy Paths, that my Foot-steps slip not,</hi> Psal. 17.5. <hi>Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe,</hi> Psal. 119.117, <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me according to thy Word, that I may live, and let me not be ashamed of my Hope,</hi> Psal. 119.116.</p>

St. <hi>Peter</hi> was presumptuous, in attempting to tread on the Waters: But he that ventured to walk there, upon the Strength of his Faith, when he felt the stiff Wind, and saw the great Billow, began to sink in his Weakness: But no sooner had <hi>Jesus</hi> stretch'd forth his hand, and caught him, but he takes Courage, and goes now with the same assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance upon the Sea, as he on the Land: And with a Check, receives more Supportation from <hi>Christ</hi> than his own Limbs could afford him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.29, 30, 31.

THOU art amaz'd with Grief, to see the Pestilence raging in our Streets, in so frequent a Mortality, as breeds a question concerning the number of the Living and the Dead: That which is wont to abate other Miseries, heightens this; the Company of Participants: It was certainly a hard and sad Option, that <hi>God</hi> gave to <hi>David,</hi> after his numbring the People: <hi>Chuse thee whether Seven Years Famine shall come unto thee in thy Land, or three Months Flight before thine Enemies, or two days Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.13. We may believe him when we hear him say, <hi>I am in a great Strait</hi>; but his wise Resolutions soon brought him out: <hi>Let us fall now into the hands of the Lord, (for his Mercies are great) And let me not fall into the hands of Man,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.14. He that sent these Evils, know their Value, and the difference of their Malignity.</p>
               <p n="15">15. YET he opposes three days Pestilence, to seven Years Famine, and three Months Vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He knew there was advantage betwixt the dull Activity of Man, and the quick Dispatch of an Angel! It was a favour that the Angel, who in <hi>One Night</hi> destroy'd an <hi>Hundred fourscore and five thousand Assyrians,</hi> 2 King. 19.35. should in three days cut off but <hi>Seventy thousand Israelites:</hi>


                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54318:41"/>
But the <hi>Almighty</hi> in his Judgments remembers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. We read of <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> wherein Eighteen hundred thousand were swept away in one Years Pestilence; enough one would imagine, to have De-Populated the whole Earth: And in our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles of so general a Mortality, that the Living were hardly sufficient to Bury the Dead. In the Year, 1624, died of the Plague in one Week, Four thousand four hundred sixty three; and in our last Visitation, 1665, was a larger Number: In one Week, Seven thousand one hundred sixty and five; and in the whole Year, Sixty eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand five hundred ninety six. It was his tender Mercy, that he spared any Alive: But he Wounds, that he may Heal; and in wounding, heals us; for his Compassions fails not to us Sinners.</p>
               <p n="16">16. THESE are dreadful demonstrations of <hi>God</hi>'s Displeasure; but there is this alleviation of our Misery, that we suffer more immediately from a Holy, Just and Merciful God. The Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had never made that distinction in his Choice, if he had not known a difference betwixt the Sword of an Angel, and an Enemy; betwixt <hi>God</hi>'s more direct and immediate Infliction, and the Malice of Men. It was but a poor Consolation given by a Victorious Enemy to dying <hi>Lausus; Comfort thy self in thy Death with this, that thou fallest by the Hand of</hi> Aeneas. But surely, we have just Reason to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our Souls, when a Pestilential Death compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses us about, from the Thought and Intuition of that Gracious Hand, under which we suffer: So as we can say with good <hi>Eli, It is the Lord.</hi>

A Soul divided in two Bodies, and animated by the same Spirit.

been so oppressed with Sorrow: if thou hadst foreseen it: It is our weak inconsideration if we welcome these Earthly Comforts not as Guests, but Inmates, some are importunately Hospitable, to entertain their Friends, that they have no power to let 'em Depart: Whereas, we ought according to the Advice of <hi>Seneca,</hi> to possess 'em, as those that make account to fore-go 'em, and fore-go 'em as if we possest 'em. And the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us this Advice, to <hi>Use this World as if we us'd it not; for the fashion of this world passeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.30, 31.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THOU art griev'd for the loss of a Dear <hi>Friend:</hi> Take heed, lest thy Love had too much of Humanity, and too little of the Deity. All Blessings as they flow from the Father of Mercies, should be enjoy'd in him: But if we enjoy 'em as in themselvs, our Love degenerates into Carnal. It is a sure Rule, that Love depends upon the thing affected; but when that ceaseth, Love is Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd: As he that loves a Face for Beauty, when Deformity appears, it cools his Affection: He that respects a Man for Bounty, disregards him when he is Impoverish'd.</p>
               <p n="5">5. DID'ST thou value thy <hi>Friend</hi> for Wit, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance and kind Offices? All these are lost, and thy Love with them: But if thou didst affect him for Eminency in Goodness, for the sake of <hi>God</hi> that dwelt in him, thy Love cannot be lost; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou enjoy'st <hi>God,</hi> in whom thou loved'st him. Comfort thy self therefore in <hi>God,</hi> in whom he was thine, and yielded him cheerfully into those Hands, from whom thou receiv'st him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THOU hast lost a true <hi>Friend</hi>: That Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el was to be priz'd for the rarity of it. The World affords Friends enough, such as they are: Friends of the Purple, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls them; Friends of the Basket, as the Poet nominates them; such as

love thy Loaves and Fishes, and thee for them. <hi>Wealth makes many Friends,</hi> saith the Wise Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.20. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.4.

Whil'st there is Honey in thy Pot, the Wasps and Flies will be buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing about it; but the Honey being gone, the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel remains quiet.</p>
               <p n="7">7. WAS he so much thine, as not to leave thee in Adversity? Did he honour thee, when the World despised thee? Did he follow with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, whilst thou wert hooted at by the Multitude? Would he have own'd thee, if he had found thee stripped and wounded in the Wilderness? Such a <hi>Friend</hi> is worthy of thy Tears: But take heed, thy Love prove not envious. If God hath thought him fitter for Society of Saints and Angels, dost thou repine at his happiness? Thou hast lost his Presence; he is advanc'd to the Beatifical Presence of the <hi>King</hi> of Glory: Now Whether is thy Loss, or his Gain the greater.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THOU hast lost thy <hi>Friend</hi>: Say rather, Thou hast parted with him. That is properly lost, which is past Recovery, and past hopes to see any more: It is not so with this <hi>Friend</hi> thou mourn'st for: He is but gone Home before thee; and thou art follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: You will both meet in your Father's House, and enjoy each other more happily, than you could have done here below. How just is that Charge of the Blessed Apostle; <hi>That we should not mourn as Men without Hope, for those that do but sleep in Jesus,</hi> 1 Thess. 4.13, 14. Did we think their Souls vanish't into Air, (as that Heathen Poet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely expresseth it) and their Bodies resolv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Dust, without all Possibility of Reparation, we might weep out our Eyes for the utter Extinction of those we lov'd: But if <hi>They do</hi> but <hi>sleep, they shall do

               <p n="2">2. DID'ST thou not know, <hi>That Riches have Wings to fly away</hi>? Prov. 23.5. And of what use is Wings, if not to flie? If any Man's Violence shall clip those Wings, they take their flight. Set thy heart upon that Supream Wealth, which cannot be taken from thee, which shall never leave thee, nor forsake thee; then thou mayst easily slight these poor Losses. As these were not Goods, so they were not thine: Here thou foundest them, and here

What Reason hast thou then to complain? It was not giv'n, but lent thee for a while, till it were call'd for? And do'st thou grudge to restore what thou borrowest? Nay, (that thou mayst have less Claim to this Talent) was it not left in thy hand, by the Owner, to employ it for his Use, till he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demand it, with the Increase? Thou wert only entrusted to improve, and account for it. If others have taken off thy Charge, by thy impoverishment, they have eased thee.</p>

Be thankful for what thou hast, and forget what thou didst possess. Hadst thou had plenty, thou couldst have used no more than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls for; the rest could have but lain by thee, for readiness of Imployment: Do but forbear the Thought of Superfluities, and what art thou the worse? Perhaps thy Fare is courser, Dishes fewer, Utensils meaner, Apparel homelier, and thy Train shorter; But how is thy Mind affected? Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consists not in Quantities, nor Qualities, but in the inward Disposition of the Heart; that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies Numbers, and raises Prizes; turns course Freezes into rich Velvets, Pulse into Delicates, and makes one Attendant many Officers.</p>
               <p n="6">6. WISE <hi>Seneca</hi> tells thee, the true Mould of Wealth is our Body, as the Last is of the Shoe; if the Shoe be too big for the Foot, it is troublesome and useless: It is Fitness, that is regarded here, not Magnitude: And this is the Charge of the Blessed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle; <hi>Having Food and Rayment, let us there with be content,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.8.

               <p n="7">7. THOU hast parted with thy Wealth; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for thine Advantage: How many have been swell'd with Plenty, resembling the <hi>Ostrich</hi> or <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard</hi> with the Bulk of Body, unweldly to raise their Thoughts to Spiritual Things; who when their Weight have been taken off, have mounted nimbly towards Heaven? How many had lost their Lives, if (with the Philosopher) they had not parted with their God? and, how many through Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, may loss their Souls? The Vessel had sunk in this boist'rous Sea, if the Earthly Freight had not been cast over-board? and why art thou troubled

to lose that, which might have undone thee in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p n="8">8. THOU had'st Wealth: Hast thou not parted with that, for which many hath been worse both in Body and Soul; and for which never any Soul was better? Have not Corn-fields been spoil'd with Rankness, and a Branch spilt with too much Fruit? Whereas had they been thinner sown, or seasonably eaten down, had yielded a fair Crop; and those Boughs moderately laden, had out-liv'd many <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumns.</hi> Do'st thou not hear thy <hi>Saviour</hi> say, <hi>How hardly shall they that have Riches enter into the Kingdom of God</hi>? Mat. 10.23. Art thou troubled that a Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block is remov'd out of thy way to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? That the Bunch of the <hi>Camel</hi> is taken off, if yet thou wilt pass through the Eye of the Needle?</p>
               <p n="9">9. THOU hadst Riches? But hadst thou not Cares attended 'em? Else thou hast fared better than thy Neighbours. None but thy self could handle these Roses without pricking their Fingers. He was famous amongst the <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctors, whose Maxim was; <hi>He that multiplies Riches, multiplies Cares</hi>: And our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> hath annexed, <hi>The Cares of the World, and the Deceitfulness of Riches,</hi> Mark 4.19.

Thy sides are now freed from Thorns, why do'st thou repine at thine Ease?</p>
               <p n="10">10. THOU lately possessed'st great Riches: But rather say, Thou wert possess'd by them? A wise <hi>Roman</hi> truly observed, That many a one hath Wealth, which clogs him, as many aptly say, Such a one has an Ague, when indeed the Ague hath him, and holds him with severity. Indeed, many a Man's Wealth is his Master, and keeps under rigid Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, not allowing sufficient Diet, Competent Rest,

               <p>THOU art very poor: Who made thee so? If thy Negligence, Laziness, Improvidence, Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and rash Engagements; thou hast reason to bear that Burthen, which thou hast pull'd upon thy Shoulders: And if forc'd to groan under thy Load, which thy own Will hath procured in this Necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="12">12. HOW easie is it for thee to see <hi>God</hi>'s Hand chastising thee by another Man's Sin? And to be griev'd as the Sin of others Injuriousness, than at thine own Correction. How dismal it is for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to see Brethren a Prey to each other? That Neighbours should be like the <hi>Reed</hi> and <hi>Brake,</hi> set near together, the one to Starve the other? That we should have daily occasion to renew that woful Comparison of <hi>Bromiard,</hi> betwixt the Friends and Enemies of <hi>Christ; That Jews don't suffer Beggars, but Christians make them</hi>?</p>
               <p n="13">13. NOW, if <hi>God</hi> thinks fit to send Poverty to thy Door, by the Message of Men, bid it Welcom for his sake that sent it, and entertain it, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piningly, for its own sake; for if well us'd, 'twill repay thee with many Blessings; as quiet Rest, safe Security, humble Patience, contented Humility, and a contemptuous Valuation of Earthly Things!

               <p n="1">1. THOU art restrain'd of thy Liberty: I cannot blame thee to be sensible of the Affliction. Liberty uses to hold competition with Life it self: And how many have lost their Lives to purchase Liberty? But take care that thou art not guilty of thine own Complaint, for certainly thou canst not be depriv'd of Liberty, except thou wilt: Liberty is a priviledge of the Will: Will is a Sovereign Power, not subject to Restraint, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:54318:50"/>2. HAST thou freedom to thine own Thoughts? It is not the Inclosing of these external Parts that can make thee a Prisoner: Thou art not worthy the name of a Man, if thou imagin'st this Body thy self, which Human Power can reach to. Art thou a Christian? Then thou hast learn'd to submit thy Will to <hi>God</hi>'s; and his Divine Will is declared in his Actions: And if his will be to have thee Restrain'd, why should it not be thine? And if thou desire to be Confin'd, why dost thou complain for want of Liberty?</p>
               <p n="3">3. THGU art Restrain'd: And is it such Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice thou art depriv'd from ranging Abroad? How ill hast thou improv'd thy Time, if thou hast not laid up enough both of Employment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in thy Bosom? What pleasure can'st thou enjoy abroad to behold those Contentions and horrid Actions thine Eye shall meet withal; which thy Confinement frees thee from being a Spectator. The Thought is enough to make a Man Miserable: And instead of them, thou art presented only with the Face of thy Keeper, which Custom and Necessity hath made Familiar.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THOU art immur'd within Stone-Walls, and all Company secluded from thee; but content thy self: <hi>God</hi> and his Angels cannot be kept out: Thou hast better Company in Solitude, than Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty afforded thee: The Jollity of Freedom rob'd thee of the Conversation of Spiritual Comforts, which only can render thee Happy: They which were Strangers to thee, are thy Guests and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, to Sojourn with thee in this Retiredness. What if the Light be excluded from thee? It cannot hinder thee from seeing the Invisible. <hi>The Darkness hideth not from thee</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>but the Night shineth as the Day; the Darkness and the Light are both alike to thee,</hi> Psal. 139.12.</p>

I may say without dubiousness, God hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been so evidently seen, as in darkest Dungeons; for the external Light of Prosperity directs our Visive Beams, which are strongly contracted in a deep Obscurity: He must descend low and be in Darkness, that would see the glorious Lights of Heaven by day. They ever shine, but not seen except in the Night: If thine Eyes be blessed with this invisible Prospect, thou art exempt from envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Persons, tho they could see all that the Tempter represented to the view of our Saviour upon the highest Mountain; <hi>All the Kingdoms of the World and the Glory of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. THOU art forced to Retiredness, but with what Disposition of Mind and Body? If thou hadst a burden'd Soul, the open and free Air could not refresh thee; and if thou have a sincere Heart, a strict Closeness cannot dismay thee; thy Thoughts can keep thee Company, and cheer thy Solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. If thou hadst an unsound Body, afflicted with the Gout, Rupture, or Luxation of some Limb, thou wouldst not complain of thy Retiredness; thy Pain would make thee insensible of thy Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But if <hi>God</hi> have blessed thee with Health, how easily may'st thou digest an harmless Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A Wise Man (as <hi>Laurentius</hi> observ'd) doth much in Solitude: So may'st thou employ the Hours of thy close Retiredness, and bless God for so happy an Opportunity.

WE shall not seek far for Histories, our Times and Memories will furnish us sufficiently: Some who have sucked the Breasts of our common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon a little dislike, have spit in her Face? Others of our Domestick Compatriots, have upon the disgust of some displeasing Laws fled their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, suborn'd Treasons, and incited Forreign Princes to our Invasion? That have endeavour'd to subvert


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54318:53"/>
the Government, extirpate that Religion Establish't amongst us; and to set up a piece of Pageantry of their own? So this Natural Affection is not so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in many, but may be quench'd with a mean Discontentment. If there were no other ground of thine Affliction, thy Sorrow is not so deep-root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but it may easily be pluck'd up.</p>
               <p n="4">4. PERHAPS it is not the Air or Earth, thou insists upon; but the Company, from whom it is Death to part: Thou arguest, I shall leave all Acquaintance and Conversation; and be cast upon strange Faces, and Languages I understand not: My best Entertainment will be Solitude, and my Ordinary, Inhospitality. What do'st thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex thy self with these superfluous Terrors? He is not worthy the Name of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> much less of a Christian, that hath not attain'd to be absolute in himself; and which way soever he is cast, to stand upon his own Bottom; that if there were no other Men left in the World, was ignorant how to enjoy himself: It is that within us, whereby we must live and be happy: Some Additions of Complacency may come from without: Sociable Natures find Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in Conversation; but if that be deny'd, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify'd Spirits know how to converse comfortably with <hi>God</hi> and themselves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. HOW many holy Ones of old have purposely withdrawn themselves from Worldly Company, that they might be blessed with an invisible Society; that have exchanged Cities for Deserts, Houses for Caves, the Sight of Men for Beasts; that their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Eyes might be fixed upon those Objects, which the World held from them? And necessity puts thee into that Estate, which their Piety affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But to be driven to forsake Parents, Kinsfolk, Friends, how sad a Case must it needs be? What is this, but a perfect Distraction? What are we,


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54318:53"/>
but Off-springs of our Parents? What are Friends, but dear to us? And what is the World without these Comforts?</p>

               <p n="7">7. BUT is this so vexatious a Case? Do'st thou think to find <hi>God</hi> where thou goest? Or dost thou believe his Company will attend thee to the End of thy Journey? Hath he not said, who cannot fail; <hi>I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee</hi>? Certainly, he is not worthy to lay Claim to <hi>God,</hi> that cannot find Parents, Kindred and Friends in him alone: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he that of <hi>Stones could raise up Children unto Abraham</hi>; how easily can he of Inhospitable Men, raise up Friends to the Sons of <hi>Abraham</hi>?

               <p n="9">9. THINE Exile separates thee from Friends: This were no small Affliction, if it might not be remedied.

What Difference is there betwixt thee and them, but that their Travel is voluntary, thy Exile constrain'd? But who are there thou art so sorry to part with? Remember what <hi>Crates</hi> the Philosopher said to a Young Man, that was beset with Parasitical Friends: Young Man, said he, I pity thy Solitude: Perhaps, thou may'st be more alone in such Society, than in the Wilderness: Such Conversation is better lost, than continued.

For tho one Eye be but <hi>Testis Singularis,</hi> yet the evidence of that is as true as of both, and in some Causes more: For when ye take a perfect Aim, we shut one Eye, as being conducive to an accurate Perspective: Yet for ordinary use, we value equally these Lights, that there is no wise Man, but would rather lose a Limb, than one of them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Person not less Religious than Witty, when his Friends bewail'd the loss of one of his Eyes, ask'd them, whether they wept for the Eye which he had lost, or the Eye which remain'd? Weep rather said he, for the Enemy that stays behind, than for the Enemy that's gone. He look'd upon his Sight with Eyes different from others; he look'd upon 'em as Enemies, which others beheld as Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Servants, good Friends, and dear Favourites.</p>

If thine Eyes have been employ'd in evil Offices to thy Soul; God hath done that for thee which he hath in a Figurative Sense, enjoyn'd thee to do thy self: Matt. 5.29. <hi>If thy Right Eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: For it is better for thee that one of thy Members should Perish, and not that thy whole Body should be cast into Hell.</hi>

Are not thy internal Senses more quick, thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory stronger, thy Fancy more active, and thy Understanding more apprehensive? The Wonders we have heard of Blind Men's Memories, were if to be credited, not obvious to conceive, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of Distractions, gives them opportunity of a careful reposition of desired Objects, and a sure Fixedness of 'em where they are laid. Hence hath it come to pass, that some Blind Men have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to those Perfections which their Eyes could never have endu'd 'em with.</p>

               <p n="14">14. THERE was one very Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54318:57"/>
of difficult Authors, and extracting their Treasures of hidden Secrets, than those that had the sharpest Eyes about 'em; insomuch as it was noted, those were singular Proficients which employ'd themselves in reading to him: If they read Books to him, he dictates Lectures the while to them, and taught 'em more than he learn'd himself.</p>
               <p n="15">15. AS for the other external Senses, they are vulgarly more exquisite in the Blind: We read of some who have been of so accurate a Touch, that by their feeling they could distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betwixt Black and White:<note rend="inter">

                  </note> And for the Ear, as our Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers observe, Sounds are sweeter to the Blind than to the Sighted, being more curiously judg'd by 'em: But the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect recompence of these Natural Eyes, is in the Exaltation of our Spiritual Ones. We are more Illuminated towards the Beautifical Vision of God, as they apprehend more Obscurity in all Terrestial Objects: Thou wilt not miss the loss of thy Sight, if thou findst thy Soul thus happily Illuminated.</p>
               <p n="16">16. THINE Eyes are lost: It is a Blessing that once thou hadst 'em: Hadst thou been Born Blind, what a Stranger wouldst thou have been to God and the World? Hadst thou never seen the Face of the Elements, what Expressions could have made thee apprehensive of the wonderful Works of thy Creator? Not any Discourse could have made thee understand what Light is? The Sun the Fountain of it, the Heavens the Glorious Region of it, and the Moon and Stars Illuminated by it? How could'st thou have had thy Thoughts raised so high, as to give Glory to that Great God, whose infinite Power hath wrought all these marvellous things.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:54318:58"/>17. NO doubt, God hath his ways of Mercy for those that are Born Blind; not requiring what he hath not given, supplying by his Spirit in the internal Vessels, what is wanting in the External: So as even those that never see the Face of the World, shall behold the Face of God that made it: But in an ordinary Course of proceeding, those which have been Blind from their Birth, must needs want those helps of knowing and glorifying God in his mighty Works, which lye open to Sight: These once satisfied thine Eyes, and remain with thee in their absence.</p>
               <p n="18">18. THEREFORE walk on in the strength of those fixed thoughts; alwayes adoring the Majesty of that God whom thy Sight hath represented to thee so Glorious; and in an humble Submission to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, strive against all the discomforts of thy Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. It is reported of a valiant Soldier, <hi>Polyzelus,</hi> who after his Eyes were shot out in Battle, cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Face with his Target, fought and laid about him vehemently, as if he had receiv'd no hurt. Strive to imitate this Courage, and let not the loss of thine Eyes hinder thee from a cheerful Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of those Spiritural Enemies, which labour to draw thee into an impatient Murmuring against God: But wait humbly upon him who hath better Eyes for thee than thou hast lost.</p>
               <p n="19">19. THOU hast lost thy Hearing: It is not easily determin'd which loss is greatest, the Eye, or Ear; both are afflictive. Now all the World is to thee Dumb, since thou art Deaf to it: And how small a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath made thee a Cypher amonst Men? These are the Senses of Instruction; and there is no other way for Intelligence to be convey'd to the Soul, either in Secular or Spiritual Affairs. The Eye is the Window, the Ear is the Door, by which all Knowledge enters: In matter of Observation

by the Eye; and of Faith, by the Ear, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.</p>
               <p n="20">20. HAD it pleas'd God to have excluded these Senses from thy Birth, thy State had been utterly Disconsolate, and there had been no possible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess for Comfort to thy Soul. Had this Affliction happen'd in thy riper Age, there had been no way but to be content with thy former Store: But now he hath vouchsafed to leave thee one Passage open, it behoves thee to supply one Sense by the other, and to let in those helps by the Window, which are deny'd Entrance at the Door. But now Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency hath been pleas'd to lend thee an Ear so long, till thou hast laid the sure Foundation of Faith in thy Heart, thou mayst work upon 'em in this silent Opportunity, with Celestial Meditations, and raise 'em up to no less height than thou could'st have done by thy quickest Hearing.</p>
               <p n="21">21. IT is a great Blessing, that in the plentitude of thy Senses, thou wert sollicitous to improve thy Bosom, as a Magazine of Heavenly Thoughts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding with the Wise <hi>Patriarch,</hi> for the seven Years of Dearth: Now that the Passages are block'd up, thou mightest have been in danger of Famishing. Thou hast now leisure to recal and ruminate upon those Counsels, which thy Improvement hath laid up in thy Heart, and to thy happy Advantage, find'st the difference betwixt a wise Providence, and a careless Neglect.</p>
               <p n="22">22. THINE external Hearing is lost: But thou hast an internal Ear, whereby thou hear'st the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret motions of God's Spirit, which shall never be lost. How many thousands whom thou enviest, are in a worse Condition? They have an external Ear, whereby they hear the voice of Men; but they want that Spiritual Ear, which perceives the least Whisperings of the Holy Ghost: Ears they have, but not hearing ones; for Fashion more than Use.

Wise <hi>Solomon</hi> makes and observes the Distinction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.12. <hi>The hearing Ear, and the seeing Eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</hi> And a Greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> can say of his formal Auditors, <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they hear not,</hi> Matt. 13.13.

And the Wise of <hi>Israel</hi> made the same Complaints; <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.1. <hi>Give me Children, or else I die.</hi> So desirous hath Nature been to propagate, and so impatient of a Denial: <hi>Lo, Children and the Fruit of the Womb, are an Heritage, and Gift that cometh from the Lord: Happy is he that hath his Quiver full of such Shafts,</hi> Psal. 127.4, 6.

And observ'd by the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> as a wonder of <hi>God</hi>'s Mercy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 113.8. that <hi>He makes the Barren Woman to keep House, and to be a joyful Mother of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. IT is pity he was born, that esteems not Children a Blessing. She hath a double Favour from <hi>God,</hi> that is a Joyful Mother of Children: Many, breeds Sorrow, and Death: And there is scarce any other Blessing, season'd with so much Acrimony of Misery and Danger. Do but compare one Pain with another, and consider the Anxious Cares that attend 'em; and tell me, whether thy bemoan'd Sterility enjoys not more ease, and less sorrow?</p>
               <p n="4">4. IT is thy Sorrow thou art not Fruitful: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider thou art freed from a greater affliction. <hi>In Sorrow shalt thou bring forth Children,</hi> Gen. 3.16. Think on the Shricks in the Painful Travels of thy Neighbours; wearying Days and Nights in restless Pangs, and calling for Death in despair of Delivery: And after the unprofitable Labours of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives, have made use of another Sex; so have been deliver'd of Life and Birth together. All these Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows thou hast escap'd: And many whom thou enviest, have thought thee happier than themselves?</p>
               <p n="5">5. THOU art afflicted thou art not a Mother: And many a one wishes they had been Barren. If Children prove deform'd, unnatural and wicked; what a Corrosive is this to the Parents? <hi>Rebecca</hi> thought it long to be twenty Years Childless; her Husband at Sixty, prays for Issue, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.20, 21. his Devotion carried him to <hi>Moriah</hi> the place where his Life was miraculously preserved from the Knife of his Father, hoping it might, by the like Miracle, be renew'd in his Posterity.</p>

Gen. 25.22. And when she saw a Child, <hi>Red all over like a hairy Garment,</hi> Gen. 25.25. and saw his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions no less rough than his Hide, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.41. do we not think she wish'd that part of her Burden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born? Certainly, Children are Blessings, or Crosses. Hast thou a Child well dispos'd, well govern'd? <hi>A wise Son maketh a glad Father,</hi> Prov. 10.1. Prov. 19.13. Hast thou a Child disorderly and debauch'd? <hi>A foolish Son is the Heaviness of his Mother, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity of his Father,</hi> Prov. 10.1. Chap. 19.13. Hast thou a Son stubborn, and unnatural? Then <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us; <hi>He that wasteth his Father, and chaseth away his Mother, is a Son that causeth Shame, and bringeth Reproach,</hi> Prov. 19.26. And if such a Son live and die impenitent, what can answer the Discomfort of that Parent?</p>
               <p n="7">7. THOU hast no Children: As thou hast less Joy, thou hast less Trouble. It is a continual Care that belongs to these Possessions. <hi>Artimedorus</hi> observes,<note rend="inter">Artimedor <hi>de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somniis, Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.</note> that to dream of Children, imports Cares. As they are our greatest Cares, many lesser ensues. For thou hast many Mouths to feed, and 'tis thy Duty to provide for 'em: For, <hi>If any provide not for his own, especially for those of his own House, he hath denied the Faith, and is worse than an Infidel,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.8.</p>
               <p n="8">8. DOES not many <hi>Rivulets</hi> from the main <hi>Channel,</hi> leave the <hi>Stream</hi> shallow? So is it with thee; But this Expence is not more necessary, than comfortable. A Great Man visited a Gentleman in the <hi>Country,</hi> and seeing his Children placed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Age and Stature, said, These make Rich Men Poor: But immediately he receiv'd


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54318:61"/>
this Answer; Nay, my <hi>Lord,</hi> these make a Poor Man Rich: For there is not one of these, I would part with for all your Wealth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. INDEED, we receive to distribute, and are but <hi>Farmers</hi> of those we leave behind. If we freely lay out of our Substance before-hand, so much of our Rent is happily clear'd. It is observable none are so Covetous as the Childless: For those who for maintenance of large Families, are inur'd to frequent Disbursements, find such Experience of Divine Providence in Prudent Managing of Affairs, that they lay out with more Cheerfulness, then they receive: So that their Care must be abated, when <hi>God</hi> takes it to himself.</p>
               <p n="10">10. AND if not wanting to themselves, Faith gives them Ease, in casting their Burden upon him, who hath more Power and Right to it, since Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are more his, than our own. He that feedeth the <hi>Young Ravens, Psal.</hi> 147.9. can he fail the best of his Creatures? A worthy Divine tells us of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, coming to the Cottage of a poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, furnished with Children, could say; <hi>Here are the Mouths, but where is the Meat</hi>? But not long after was answer'd to that Question; for the poor Woman after the Burial of her last Child, inverted the Qustion upon her; <hi>Here is the Meat, but where is the Mouths</hi>?</p>
               <p n="11">11. SURELY, the Great Governour of the World, will never leave any of his without the Bread of Sufficiency; and who so fit to be his Purveyors, as Parents for their Children? Nature hath taught <hi>Birds,</hi> to pick out the best of Grains for their Young: Nature sends Moister out of the Root, which gives Life to Branches and Blossoms: Sometimes, indeed, it meets with a kind Retaliation; some Stork-like Disposition repairs the loving Offices done by the Parents, in a dutiful Retribution to their Age or Necessity.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:54318:61"/>12. BUT how frequently proved often the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? By an unsatiable Importunity of extracting from the Parents that Maintenance, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant: Sometimes an undutiful neglect, in not owning the Meanness of their Parents, or support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their decay'd Estate by due Maintenance. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude is odious in Man; but in a Child mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous.</p>
               <p n="13">13. IT is thy Grief thou never hadst a Child: There is not so much Comfort in having of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as Sorrow in parting with 'em; especially when their parts, and Disposition have raised our Hopes, and doubled our Affections towards 'em: And according to the <hi>French</hi> Proverb; <hi>He that hath not, cannot lose</hi>; so, on the contrary, he that hath, must lose. Our Meeting is not more certain, than our Parting: Either we must leave them, and so their Grief doubles ours; or they leave us, and so our Grief will be no less than our Love was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p n="14">14. IF thou wilt be truly wise, set thy heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that only Good, which is not capable of losing: Divided Affections abate their Force; and since no Objects of Dearness, distracts thy Love, place it wholly upon that Infinite Goodness, which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it with Mercy, and rewards it with Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. If <hi>Elkanah</hi> therefore could say to his Barren Wife <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.8. <hi>Why weepest thou? and why is thy Heart heavy? Am not I better to thee than ten Sons</hi>? How much more comfortably may'st thou hear the <hi>Father of Mercies</hi> say to thy Soul, Why is thy Heart heavy? Am not I better to thee than ten Thousand?</p>

Couldst thou forbear the Desire of it, perhaps it would come unexpected: Now thou Sollicites it, like some froward Piece, it is coy and pievish, and punishes thee for thy Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness after it.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

GRAY-HAIRS is that we desire to aspire to; and when attain'd, are ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain our greatest Misery; verifying in part that old Observation, <hi>That Wedlock and Age are things which we desire, and repent of.</hi> Is this our Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or Inconstancy, that we are weary of what we wish'd for? Perhaps this Accusation may not be Universal: There is difference in Constitutions, and latitude in Old Age. Infancy and Youth have their limits, age admits of no certain Determination.</p>
               <p n="2">2. AT Seventy, <hi>King David was old and strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in Years; and they cover'd him with Cloaths, but he got no heat,</hi> 1 King. 1.1. Whereas <hi>Caleb</hi> can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, <hi>Now loe I am fourscore and five Years old, and yet I am as strong this day, as I was in the day that</hi> Moses <hi>sent me to spy out the Land: As my Strength was then, even so is my Strength now, for war, both to go out, and come in,</hi> Josh. 14.10, 11. And beyond him, <hi>Moses was an hundred and twenty Years old; when he died, his Eye was not dim, nor his Natural Force abated,</hi> Deut. 34.7. <hi>Methuselah</hi> was but Old, when he was <hi>Nine hundred sixty and nine,</hi> Gen 5.27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. BUT for the generality of Mankind, the same <hi>Moses,</hi> who liv'd to see an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hath set Man's ordinary Period at half his own: Psal. 90.10. <hi>The days of our Age, are threescore Years and ten. And tho Men be so strong, that they come to fourscore Years, yet is their Strength but Labour and Sorrow: So passeth it away, and we are gone.</hi> Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Years, are load enough for the Strength, much more for the weakness of Age. But when


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54318:65"/>
Labour and Sorrow are added to the Weight, how can we but sink under the Burden?</p>
               <p n="4">4. HE was old and wise, that said by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; <hi>That our last Days are the Dregs of our Life: The clearer part is gone, and all drawn out, the Lees sink down to the buttom.</hi> Who can express the miserable Inconveniencies that attenst the Aged? For Cares must needs be multiplied according to the manifold occasions of Affairs: For the World is a Net, wherein the more we stir, we are Entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p n="5">5. AND for Bodily Grievances, What Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do we meet withal? What <hi>Aches</hi> in the <hi>Bones, Pains</hi> in the <hi>Joynts, Convulsions</hi> of <hi>Sinews,</hi> and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in the <hi>Bowels</hi>; the <hi>Stone, Collick, Stranguary,</hi> and <hi>Distillation of Rheums</hi>? What <hi>Hollow Coughs, weaknesses</hi> of <hi>Retention, Expulsion, Digestion,</hi> and <hi>Decay of Senses</hi>? So that Age is the common <hi>Sewer,</hi> into which all Diseases of our Life are Evacuated. Well therefore might <hi>Sarah</hi> say, <hi>After I am waxed Old, shall I have Pleasure</hi>? Gen. 18.12. And good <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillai</hi> justly excuses himself for not accepting the gracious Invitation of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 19.35. <hi>I am this day fourscore Years old, and can I discern between Good and Evil? Can thy Servant taste what I eat, or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Men, and Singing-Women? Wherefore then should thy Servant be yet a Burden unto my Lord the King</hi>?</p>
               <p n="6">6. THESE are they the Preacher calls the <hi>Evil Days,</hi> and <hi>the Years,</hi> wherein a Man shall say, <hi>I have no Pleasure in them:</hi> Wherein <hi>the Sun, or the Light, or the Moon, or the Stars are darkned, and the Clouds return after the Rain: When the Keepers of the House shall tremble, and the Strong Men shall bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the Grinders cease, because they are few, and those that look out of the Windows, be darkned:</hi> Eccles. 12.1, 2, 3. In short, what is Old-Age but the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54318:65"/>
of Life? And how can we expect any other but <hi>gloomy Weather, chilling Frosts, Storms, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests</hi>?</p>
               <p n="7">7. BUT whilst we thus querulously aggravate the incommodiousness of Age, we must beware lest we derogate from the Bounty of our Maker, and disparage those Blessings which he accounts Precious; amongst which, Old-Age is none of the meanest. Had he not put that value upon it, he would not have honour'd it with his own Stile; calling himself, <hi>The Ancient of Days</hi>? Dan. 7.9.13.22. Or would he else have set out this Mercy, as a Reward and Obedience to himself, <hi>(I will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the number of thy days,</hi> Exod. 23.26.) and of Obedience to our Parents, <hi>To live long in the Land,</hi> Exod. 20.12.</p>
               <p n="8">8. WOULD he have promised it as a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Favour to restor'd <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> (now become a City of Truth) <hi>That there shall yet Old Men and Old Women dwell in the Streets of Jerusalem, and every Man with his Staff in his Hand for every Age</hi>? Zach. 8.4. Would he else have denounc'd it as a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to over-indulgent <hi>Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.32. <hi>There shall not be an Old Man in thy House for ever</hi>? Far be it from us, to despise that which God Honors, and turn his Blessings into a Curse. For the same God, who best knows the Price of his own Favours, as he makes no small estimation of Age himself, so he hath thought fit to call for a high Respect to be given it by Men, out of an Holy Awe to himself. Lev. 19.32. <hi>Thou shalt rise up before the hoary Head, and Honor the Face of the Old Man, and fear thy God. I am the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. HENCE it is, that he hath pleas'd to put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the <hi>Ancient, and the Honourable,</hi> Isa. 9.15. and hath told us that an <hi>Hoary Head is a Crown of Glory, if it be found in the way of Righteousness,</hi> Prov. 16.31.


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54318:66"/>
Chap. 20.29. And lastly, makes it an Argument of the deplorable State of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Lam. 4.16. That <hi>They favoured not the Elders.</hi> Therefore as we too sensibly feel what to complain of, so we know what Priviledges we may challenge due to Age; even such as Nature hath taught those Heathens, which are in the next degree to Savage. If Pride and Skill have made the <hi>Athenians</hi> Uncivil, yet a Young <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> will rise, and yield his Place in the Theatre to neglected Age.</p>
               <p n="10">10. IT is not a little Injurious to fasten our Eyes upon the disadvantages of any Condition, as not to take in the Advantages that belong to it; which carefully laid together, may perhaps sway the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to an equal Poise. Suppose Old-Age is oppress'd with Bodily Griefs; yet it may yield other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities to keep the Scales even: And it is not the least, that it gives us firm Resolutions and bold Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities against Dangers, and Death it self: For the Old Man knows how little of his Thred is left in the Winding; and therefore when just Occasion is offer'd, insists not much upon so inconsiderable a Remainder.</p>
               <p>OLD-AGE and Orbity, as <hi>Ceselius</hi> profess'd, were those things that emboldened him. And when <hi>Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritius</hi> refus'd to deliver the Hostages of <hi>Placentia</hi> to <hi>Carbo</hi> the <hi>Consul,</hi> and was threatned with many Swords, he answer'd those Menaces with his many Years. What young Man would have been so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily induc'd to part with his Life, and having been so ready to give entertainment to an unexpected Death? Surely the hope and love of Life, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly softens the Spirits of vigorous Youth, and disswades them from those Enterprizes, which are attended with manifest Perils: Whereas, extream Age teacheth us to contemn Dangers.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:54318:66"/>12. YET a greater priviledge of Age, is a Freedom from those impetuous Passions wherewith Youth is commonly over-sway'd; for with our Natural Heat, the Fire of our inordinate Lusts is abated, so as our weaker Appetite may be subdu'd to Reason. The Temperate old Man in the Story, when one shew'd him a Beautiful Face, could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; <hi>I have long since left to be Eye-sick</hi>: And could say of Pleasure; <hi>I have gladly withdrawn my self from that Imperious Mistress.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. WHAT an unreasonable Vassalage our Youthful Lusts subject us to, we need no other Instance than in <hi>Sampson,</hi> who was effeminated by his impotent Passion, and weakned to betray his Life to a mercinary Harlot, and to endure to hear her say; <hi>Tell me wherewith thou mayst be Bound, to do thee hurt,</hi> Judg. 16.6. How easily might he have answered her; O <hi>Delilah,</hi> even with these Cords of Brutish Sensuality. How was Solomon Besot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his Strange Wives, and drawn away to Worship strange Gods, 1 <hi>King,</hi> 11.5.</p>
               <p n="14">14. AND how may Fir-trees howl, when Cedars fall? Who can hope to be free from being transported with irregular Affections, when we see such great precedents of Frailties? From the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of these sad Miscarriages, our Age happily secures us; disposing us into quiet Harbour, whence we may see Youth toss'd with Tempests of unruly Passions, from which Seniority hath free'd us.</p>
               <p n="15">15. ANNEX Experimental Knowledge, which Age enriches us; every Dram is worth Pounds of Junior Contentments: In comparison the Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Knowledge is weak and imperfect. This may come at an easie rate, perhaps cost us nothing: That, commonly we pay dear for, and is esteem'd valuable. If Experience be the Mistress of Fools,


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54318:67"/>
I'm sure 'tis the Mother of Wisdom: For the long Observation of variety of Actions and Events in the whole course of our Life, must needs leave such sure Rules of Judgment, as may be unfailable Directions for our selves and others.</p>
               <p n="16">16. IN vain shall this be expected from our Minority, which the Wise Philosopher excludes from being Judges of true Morality: And well might the Old Man say; <hi>Ye Young Men, think us Old Men Fools; but we Old Men know you Young Men to be Fools.</hi> And indeed what value Ignorance may put upon it, this Fruit of Age the Earth hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing equally so precious. It was Prophane, but fit for the Mouth of an Heathen Poet, <hi>That Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is above Destiny.</hi> But surely a Christian may justly say, That next to Providence, Humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may challenge the supream Place in Earthly Affairs, and Age claim the greatest Interest in that vertue.</p>
               <p n="17">17. YOUNG <hi>Elihu</hi> could say, <hi>Job</hi> 32.7. <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of years should teach Wisdom.</hi> And the Wise Man, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 25.4, 5. <hi>Oh, how comely a thing is Judgment for Gray-Hairs, and for Ancient Men to know Counsel! Oh, how comely is the Wisdom of Old Men, and Understanding and Counsel to Men of Honor.</hi> And the <hi>Grecians</hi> could say, <hi>That young Men are for Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and old Men for Advice</hi>: And among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Senators</hi> take their Name from Age. That which causeth weakness of Aged Eyes, is, they better discern things further off, and by the strength of their Mental Eyes, they perceive Judgments or Advantages at a distance, and accordingly frame their Determinations.</p>
               <p n="18">18. IT is observ'd, that Old Lutes sound better than New. It was <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Folly and Undoing, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to follow the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Green Heads, and abandon those Grave


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54318:67"/>
Senators of his Fathers Counsel. Not that Age of it self is Rich in Wisdom and Knowledge: But well cultur'd, and improv'd, is valuable. There are Old Men, that live, and have a Being upon Earth, who can give no Proof of their many Years, but only Gray-Hairs and Infirmities. There are those, who, like to <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> are Old, whilst Young; and Children, when Old: These the Elder they grow, are more stupid.</p>
               <p n="19">19. TIME is an ill Measure of Age, which should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be meted by Proficiency, Ripeness of Judgment, and Monuments of commendable and useful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. If we have thus imployed our selves, our <hi>Autumn</hi> will shew what our <hi>Spring</hi> was; and our Gray-Hairs will give us more Cause to fear Pride; than Dejection. We accuse Age of many Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and Indispositions: But these Imputations are not Universal: Many of these are Faults of the Person, not of the Age. All Wine doth not sowr with Age, neither doth every Nature.</p>
               <p n="20">20. OLD Oyl is clearer, and hotter in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal Uses than New. Some are pettish, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose in Youth; and others are mild, gentle and sociable, in their decayed Years. Some are cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy in their Prime; and others in their Wain are Vigorous: And many before the fulness of their Age, have lost their Memory; as <hi>Hermogenes, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinus, Antonius Carracalla, Georgius Trapezuntius,</hi> and <hi>Nizolius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. SOME, whose intellectuals have so happily held out, that they have been best at the last. <hi>Plato</hi> at fourscore and one, died with his Pen in his hand: and <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> when Death Summon'd him at an 100 Years, he bemoan'd himself, that he must now die, when he began to gain knowledge. And as for Spiritual Graces and Improvements, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> satisfies us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.12, 13. <hi>Such as be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54318:68"/>
in the House of the Lord, shall flowrish in the Courts of our God: They shall also bring forth more fruit in their Age; and shall be fat and well liking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. BUT the chief Benefit of Age is, our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to our Journeys end: For the end of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is rest; and once attain'd, their remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fruition: Now Age brings us after a weary Race within some breathings of our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end: For if Young Men may die, Old Men must; a condition which a carnal heart bewails and abhors, complaining of nature as Niggardly in Dispensations of the shortest time to her noblest Creatures; and envying the Oaks, which many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations must leave standing and growing.</p>
               <p n="23">23. NO marvel, the Worlding thinks himself at home, and looks upon Death as a banishment: He hath placed his heav'n here below, and can see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his remove, but Annihilation, or Torment: But for Christians, who know, that <hi>whilst we are present in the body, we are absent from the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.6. and do justly account our selves Foreigners, our Life a Pilgrimage, Heaven our Home; how can we but rejoice, that after a tedious and painful Travel, we do now draw near the threshold of our Father's house; wherein we know there are <hi>many Mansions,</hi> and all Glorious, <hi>John</hi> 14.2.</p>
               <p n="24">24. I could blush to hear a <hi>Heathen</hi> say, if God would offer me the choice of renewing my Age, and returning to my Childhood, I should heartily refuse it; for I should be loath, after I have passed so much of my Race to be recalled back from the Goal, to the Bars of my first setting out; and to hear a Christian sighing and sobbing at the thought of his Dissolution.

                  <p>O LORD GOD, of my Salvation, I humbly render thee all hearty thanks for thy abundant Mercies and Favours, Spiritual and Temporal, for thy Gracious Preservation of me from my Youth, untill this present Moment: That thou hast spared me in thy Fatherly Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when in thy Justice thou mightest have destroyed me: Lord, as thou hast given me space for Repentance, and reserv'd me to these Years, who mightest justly have cut off the days of a mispent Youth, so now accomplish thine own Work; give me an Heart faithfully to adhere unto thee, that I may constantly Endeavour to Redeem the many Errors of my life past, by becoming a Pattern of Faith, and Obedience, in all those with whom I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with for the Future: Lord, fill me with thy Holy Spirit, that I may bear more fruit in my Age: Forsake me not now, I am Old and Gray-Headed: Neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Sins and Follies of my Youth.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THOU apprehendest true; <hi>Death</hi> is terrible, but <hi>Judgment</hi> more; both succeed upon the same decree; <hi>It is appointed unto Men once to dye; but after this the judgment:</hi> Heb. 9.27. It is not more terrible, than thought on: <hi>Death,</hi> because he strikes, and lays before us examples of <hi>Mortality,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but sometimes take up our hearts; but the last <hi>Judgment,</hi> having no visible proofs upon our thoughts, too seldom fright us:</p>
               <p n="2">2. YET who conceives the Terror of that day? When <hi>the Sun shall be turn'd into darkness, and the Moon into blood,</hi> Acts 2.20. That day, <hi>which shall burn as an Oven, when all the proud, and all that do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall be as the stubble</hi>; Mal. 4.1. That day, <hi>in which the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise; and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat; the Earth also, and the works that are therein shall be burnt up</hi>: 2 Pet. 3.10. That day, <hi>wherein the Lord Jesus shall be reveal'd from Heaven with his mighty Angels; in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Thess. 1.7, 8. That day, <hi>wherein the Lord will come with fire, and with his Chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire, for by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54318:76"/>
with all flesh,</hi> Isa. 66.15, 16. That day, <hi>wherein the Son of Man shall come in his Glory, and all the Holy Angels with him; and shall sit upon the Throne of his Glory; and all Nations shall be gathered before him; and he shall separate them one from another, as a Shepherd divideth his Sheep from the Goats,</hi> Mat. 25.31, 32. And that day, <hi>wherein all the kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of him,</hi> Rev. 1.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THAT <hi>great and terrible day of the Lord,</hi> Joel 2.31. wherein if the powers of Heav'n be shaken, how can the heart remain removed? And if the World be dissolved, who can abide it? Alas, we are ready to tremble at Thunder in a Cloud; and at Lightning that glances our Eyes; what shall we do when the Heavens shall break in pieces, and be on flame about our Ears? <hi>Oh who may abide the day of his coming, and who shall stand when he appeareth</hi>? Mal. 3.2.</p>
               <p n="4">4. YET be of good cheer, amidst all this horror there is comfort; whether thou be one whom it shall please God to reserve upon the Earth to the sight of this dreadful day, he knows in whose hands our times are; but this we are sure of, that we are upon the last days: And we may spit in the Faces of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Scoffers, that say <hi>where is the promise of his coming</hi>? Knowing that the Lord is not slack, but he that shall come, will come, and not tarry, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.17. And some may live to see the Son of Man come in the Clouds of Heaven, in this last Scene of the World:</p>
               <p n="5">5. IF so, let not thy heart be dismay'd with these fearful things: Thy change shall be sudden, one Moment shall put off Mortality, and clothe thee with Incorruption, not capable of fear and pain: The Majesty of this appearance shall add to thy Joy and Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt then see the Lord himself descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the

Arch-Angel and with the trump of God</hi>: Thou shalt see thy self, <hi>and those other which are alive and remain to be caught up into the Clouds to meet the Lord in the Air; and so shalt thou be ever with the Lord.</hi> On this Assurance, the Apostle subjoyns, <hi>Wherefore comfort one another with these words,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.16, 17, 18. And if ever there were comfort in words, not of Men or Angels, but of the God of Truth, these will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it to our trembling Souls.</p>
               <p n="6">6. BUT if thou be one whom God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to Summon before the great day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; here is a joy unspeakable and full of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>For those that sleep in Jesus shall God bring with him</hi>; 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.15. They shall be of that Glorious Train, which shall attend the Great Judge of the World: Yea they shall be Co-assessors to the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, in this Judicature; sitting upon the Bench, when guilty Men and Angels shall be at the Bar: <hi>To him that overcometh,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father upon his Throne,</hi> Rev. 3.21. What place is here for any terror, since such heavenly Magnificence, fulness of Joy and Eternal Glory?</p>
               <p n="7">7. THOU art afraid think of Judgment; I had rather thou wert awful, than timorous, when St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 24.25. discoursed <hi>of the judgment to come,</hi> it is no marvel that <hi>Felix</hi> trembled; But the same Apostle, when he pressed to his <hi>Corinthians</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the certainty and generality of our <hi>appearance before the Judgment-Seal of Christ, that every one may receive the things, done in his body whether good or evil</hi>; adding, <hi>knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we perswade men; but we are made manifest to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.10, 11.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THE holiest Man is not exempted from the dread, but slavish fear of the great Judge: We know his infinite Justice; and are Conscious of our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold

failings: And how can we acknowledge these, and not fear? But this fear works not in us a Malignant repining at the severe Tribunal of the Almighty, but a careful endeavour to approve our selves that we may be acquitted by him, and appear blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in his presence. How justly may we tremble, when we look upon our Actions and Deserts? But confidently appear at the Bar, where we are assur'd of a discharge? <hi>Being justified by Faith, we have peace with God through Jesus Christ our Lord,</hi> Rom. 5.1. When we think of a Conflagration of the World, how can we but fear? But when we think of a happy <hi>restitution of all things</hi>; how can we but rejoice in trembling? <hi>Acts</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <p n="9">9. THOU quakest at the expectation of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Surely the Majesty of that great Assize must needs be formidable: And if the delivery of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai, (Exod.</hi> 19.16, 18.) were with so dreadful a Pomp of <hi>Thunder and Lightning, Fire, Smoak and Earthquakes,</hi> that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were half dead with fear in receiving it; with what terrible Magnificence shall God come to require an account of that Law at the hands of the whole sinful gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Mankind?</p>
               <p n="10">10. REPRESENT unto thy thoughts, that which was shewed to the Prophet <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 7.9, 10. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine thou sawst, <hi>the Ancient of days sitting upon a Throne like a fiery flame; a fiery stream issuing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth from before him; thousand thousands ministring unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand standing before him; the judgment set and the Books opened</hi>: Or as <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Daniel</hi> of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, saw <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11, 12. <hi>A great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose Face the Earth and the Heavens fled away, and the dead both small and great standing before God; and the Books opened and the Dead judged out of those things which were written in those Books, according to their works.</hi>

Canst thou fear he will doom thee to death, who dyed to give thee life? Canst thou fear he will condemn thee for those sins which he hath given his blood to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate? Canst thou fear the rigour of that Justice which he hath so fully satisfied? Or canst thou misdoubt the miscarriage of that Soul he hath so dearly bought?</p>
               <p n="12">12. NO, all this Divine State and Magnificence makes for thee. Let those guilty and impenitent Souls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. who have heaped unto themselves <hi>Wrath against the day of wrath,</hi> quake at the Glorious Majesty of the Son of God; <hi>for whom nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries, Heb.</hi> 10.27. But for thee who art reconciled unto God by the Mediation of the Son of his love, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Christ, and made a Member of his My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Body; thou art Commanded with all the Faithful, <hi>to look up, and lift up thy head; for now the day of Redemption is come,</hi> Luk. 21.28.

               <p n="1">1. PATIENCE is a peaceable disposition of the whole Man, not troubled, nor trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; but abstaining from whatsoever may disturb himself or others. In its Definition, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these five heads, first the nature of <hi>Patienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>; it is peaceable, and quiet; not subject to sudden


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:54318:83"/>
Passion, light Motions, or short Affections towards it; but an habitual Disposition and due Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a Mans self, which may bear the impression of <hi>David</hi>'s Motto, Psal. 120.7. <hi>I am for Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. SECONDLY, the subject of <hi>Patience</hi>: The whole Man, not the external, but the internal the heart and head; the mind and manners, must be dispos'd, and compos'd towards it: Principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Heart, <hi>For out of it are the issues of Life,</hi> Prov. 4.23. and unless there be a <hi>Meek and Quiet Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. It is impossible to acquire it, but withall there must be a quiet <hi>Hand, Psal.</hi> 24.4. A quiet <hi>Eye,</hi> Job 31.1. A quiet <hi>Ear,</hi> Prov. 2.2. And a quiet <hi>Tongue,</hi> Psal. 39.1. And all parts and faculties of the Soul disposed to <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. THIRDLY, the parts of <hi>Patience,</hi> is not in being troubled, or being troublesom, neither active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impatient in displeasing others, nor passively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient in being disquieted by others. Fourthly, the practice of Patience, is an abstinence from whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may disturb, for so the word <hi>Patience</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Translated) doth import: And St. <hi>James</hi> doth thus describe it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>A laying aside of all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and superfluity of maliciousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. FIFTHLY, The Object of <hi>Patience,</hi> or Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, either in our selves, or others. Men disquiet themselves either by Causeless conceit of offence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, when it is not: By being too suspicious, and <hi>Inventers of evil things,</hi> Rom. 1.30. or by too much taking to heart, an offence when it is offered; by being too <hi>Furious,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.3. Men disturb others, either in offering occasion of offence by being <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Disorderly,</hi> 2 Thess. 3.11. or by bitter seeking Revenge, being full of Maliciousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. So Men likewise disturb themselves and others; when they continue in their sins, and never think of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: As <hi>Elijah</hi> told <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 King. 18.18 <hi>It

is thou and thy Fathers house that trouble and disquiet Israel.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. BY this short view we have taken of <hi>Patience,</hi> we may behold the true Character of a <hi>Patient Man</hi>: He is one of a <hi>Mild Nature, and true Christian Temper, swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. Phil. 2.5. Jam. 1.19. His head is not over-laden with <hi>Cares of this Life,</hi> nor his heart with <hi>Fears,</hi> his eyes are not itching after <hi>Vanities,</hi> nor his Ears after <hi>Novelties,</hi> Luk. 21.34. Prov. 29.25. Jer. 22.17. Act. 17.21.</p>
               <p n="6">6. His <hi>Hands</hi> are not intermeddling with imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent business, nor his <hi>Feet</hi> swift to run into <hi>Evil</hi>: His <hi>Mouth</hi> is far from <hi>Cursing</hi> and <hi>Bitterness,</hi> kept in as a <hi>Bridle,</hi> that it should not <hi>Offend,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.11. Prov. 4.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.14, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 17.3. His whole body is fit for a Load of Injuries, which he bears not out of baseness, and cowardise, because he dares not Revenge, but out of Christian Fortitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.13.</p>
               <p n="7">7. HIS <hi>Arms</hi> are strengthned by the <hi>Mighty God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>his hands are washt in Innocency,</hi> and his breast is <hi>the breast plate of Righteousness,</hi> Gen. 49.24. <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4.

Col. 3.12. <hi>His Loins are girt about with Truth,</hi> his <hi>Knees</hi> are pliable to <hi>Bow,</hi> his <hi>Legs</hi> to bear, and his <hi>Foot standeth in an even place,</hi> Eph. 6.14.

His hopes are so strong they can insult over the greatest discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and his apprehensions so deep, that when he hath once fastned, he sooner leaveth his life then his hold. Contrariety of Events, Exercise, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may him; and when Crosses Afflict him, he seeth a Divine Hand, invisibly striking with those sensible scourges, against which he dares not Murmur nor Rebel.</p>

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:54318:84"/>9. HE troubleth not himself, with Exciting Thoughts nor others, with needless Suits: He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddles not in others business, nor adventures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on rash Attempts, he offends none with provoking Terms, not taketh offence at others Actions, He lendeth not his Ear to idle Tales, nor soweth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or seeketh Revenge: But hath a meek heart, a contented mind, and a charitable eye; his Tongue is Affable, hand Peaceable, and his gesture sociable. His Deportment is Neighbourly, his Judgment cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, a loving Speaker, and a friendly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser: He puts up all wrongs patiently, and wrongs none willingly. And such manner of Men ought we to be in all holy Conversation.

God gave whatsoever we have lost; and seeing it hath pleased him to take away what he gave, his Divine Will be done: Never let us repine at this, but let us take it in good part, we are bound to be thank-ful as well in Adversity as in Prosperity; and if we cast up our Accounts well; this which we esteem so great a loss, is rather a great gain: For what is necessary and conducing to our

O thou that art the wise disposer of all Things, both in Heaven and Earth, let me look up to thee, from whence cometh Affliction, and then inspect into my own Heart, where I shall find out the efficient Cause: O let nothing then seem to perplex me, which thou in thy good pleasure knoweth to be advantagious; but let me ever be content to drink of the bitterest Cup of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which thou hast allotted me; O let thy good Spirit still strive with me, and draw me unto thee with the Cords of thy Love; it is of thy tender Mercies that I am not consumed, but I know thy Compassion fails not towards poor and wretched Sinners: Lord give me Grace to perform this Duty, and say of my Affliction, as thou, <hi>O Jesu,</hi> didst of thy bitter Cup and Passion; <hi>Father! if it be thy will let this Cup pass from me! if not; not my Will, but thy Will be done.</hi> Amen.</p>
