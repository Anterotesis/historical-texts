            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO a certain Person, that
for many Years had been
led wonderfully in the Ways of
God, it came to pass that one
day upon a deep Contemplation
of the Paradisical World, there
appear'd in the midst of a most
bright Cloud, a Woman of a
most Sweet and Majestick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
her Face shining as the
Sun, and her Vesture of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent
Gold, who said, <q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!
I am God's Eternal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb facs="tcp:38281:3"/>
Wisdom, whom thou hast
been enquiring after: I am to
unseal the Treasures of God's
deep Wisdom unto thee, and
will be, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> was to <hi>Iacob,</hi>
a true natural Mother; for out
of my Womb thou shalt be
brought forth after the manner
of a Spirit, being Conceiv'd
and Born again: This thou
shalt know by a new Motion of
Life, stirring and giving a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness,
till Wisdom be Born
within the inmost parts of thy
Soul. Now consider of my
Sayings, till I shall return to
thee again.</q> Then after three
days the same Figure appear'd
in greater Lustre and Glory to
this Person, bearing a Crown
on her Head, and spake to this
<pb facs="tcp:38281:3"/>
effect. <q>Behold thy Mother,
and know that thou art to enter
into Covenant with me, to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the Laws of the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which shall be revealed.</q>
And upon this a Golden Book
being Seal'd with Three Seals,
was by her presented to the said
Person, declaring that in it were
declar'd the deep Mysteries of
the Divine Wisdom, which had
been Sealed up from the past
Ages, and were now to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and manifested to her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
that should be found wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to receive, and to observe
such LAWS, as she should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
forth in the New Heart,
and in the New Spirit. After
Six days the Vision again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
and the Virgin Queen
<pb facs="tcp:38281:4"/>
shew'd her self in most Mighty
Majesty, being attended with a
numberless Train of Virgin Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and with a very great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Angels; and this Person
was call'd by Name to come and
view Her, with her First-born
Children, and invited to join
with them. To which there
being a ready and hearty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
given, the said Person was
immediately admitted into their
Number. Then said the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Virgin, <q>I shall cease to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in a Visible Figure to thee,
but I will not fail to Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
my self in thy Mind;
and there open the Spring of
Wisdom and Understanding.</q>
She also promis'd that by the
Opening of this Spring there
<pb facs="tcp:38281:4"/>
should be reveal'd Great and
Wonderful Things, that were
to be made Publick in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Day: And so exhorting
to Vigilance, and Obedience to
those Counsels and Laws which
should be given out from her,
she disappear'd, having first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
such an Answer, as the
Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> gave to the
Message of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi>
from this Person who was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
about with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Host, and made a Spirit
of Light. And as the Law was
given to <hi>Moses</hi> of old, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up to Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with God; so in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
it hath pleas'd the same God
our Father, to give forth in these
Last Days the Law of Paradise
<pb facs="tcp:38281:5"/>
to This Spirit, who was some
Years after this caught up on
purpose into Mount <hi>Sion</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it. There is no doubt to
be made, but that these holy
Commandments so receiv'd will
carry along with them to many
Awaken'd Souls, the Evidence
of their Divine Original: And
as for such as from the many
horrid Abuses that have been
made through Pretensions to the
Holy Spirit, cannot believe that
there either is, or can be any
True Inspiration at this Day in
the World; I doubt not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the Sober amongst them,
and all such as are willing to
humble themselves before the
Truth, of the Possibility, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency,
and necessity of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb facs="tcp:38281:5"/>
to be again restor'd, in a
Particular Discourse, which is
design'd to come forth very
shortly. As for any Particular
Objections against either the
Manner, or the Matter of these
Laws, then, when they shall be
Proposed, it will be time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of them. Now let us, who
<hi>know that the Law is spiritual,</hi>
Rom. 7. 14. be altogether spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually-minded,
and worship him
who is Spirit, in Spirit and
Truth.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THese are the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Paradise,</hi>
which must be observed by All
who set footing there, according as
they were declared and given forth by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38281:7"/>
                  <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as I was in the Spirit. Who
thus spake unto me;</p>
               <p>Having caution'd thee that thou
maist not be secure, telling thee that
the Tempter, and the Tree, are both
here, I Wisdom bid thee take good heed,
considering thou art yet but a Stranger,
and knowest not the Constitutions, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and Worships required by the
King of this Holy Land. Lest therefore
thou shold'st miscarry here, as did the
First <hi>Adam,</hi> and many more since, who
have come thus far, after the Similitude
of the Second, whom the Dragon hath
plucked down again, awakening in
them the Essences which were slain by
the Death; I do now present to thee,
out of my peculiar Love, CHRIST thy
Looking-glass. In Him behold thy
self, who was thy Dying Pattern, and
now must be thy Living Spirit; to act
answerable to Him, Bodily, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually.
And as he was in Paradise
Invisible, and in this World Visible, in
like manner as now thou art; so the
same Law which was enjoined by the
Father to Him, is expresly to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38281:7"/>
by thee: Not one Jot or Tittle is
to be abated therein. For here the
New Covenant is to be re-established,
in which the Laws of pure and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Nature are again revived, which
were Engraven upon the Heart before
Sin entered to obliterate them. And
as this Internal Law of Liberty was lost
in Paradise, so in all Ages it could never
be found by any, till they returned thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
again, to fulfil the whole Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
hereof, through the Birth,
Power, and Spirit of JESUS; that hath
imprinted the Law of Eternal Nature
upon the Fleshly Table of a pure Heart,
which becometh a Law of Life unto it
self, that none need to say, <hi>Know the
Lord</hi> from henceforth, if once come to
<hi>know themselves</hi> after the Law of this
<hi>Paradisical</hi> Life; which I will give thee
out as GOD gave to <hi>Moses</hi> in Ten Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
that what is given thee may
answer to the Out-spoken Word from
ME: Who for a General Benefit do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

Gross and Elementary, with
which the Earthly Sense might be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar,
and have recourse to for supply

the Faith in his Omnipotency, through
the going a Whoring after the God of
Reason, bowing down, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Rising Sun which governeth
the Day of this Fallen Creation; the
Apostate Spirits still crying in Man's
Nature <hi>as</hi> of old, <hi>Vp, make us Gods which
may go before us,</hi> that we may have our
sensible sight fed: As for this Invisible
Working Power, it delays to come
down to us; though his Arm hath been
made bare, and wrought great deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
yet now being withdrawn, we
wist not what is become of this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
God, that keeps in such a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
as we can not break in to him: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith the Unbelieving <hi>Israel,</hi> We
will make choice of a God for our selves
after our own Likeness. Now from
this high Idolatry thou art prohibited,
upon pain of losing Wisdom's Blessing.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38281:9"/>
For thy God will not bear or suffer any
one, whom he hath placed in this New
Land, to have any other God but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who is Jealous of his Honour, and
who will be trusted to and rested upon,
and have the whole worship and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the Will, and adoration of the
Mind; not admitting either Sense or
Reason to be his Rival. Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubting, and Love unfeigned, is
the Sum of this Commandment, which
observe thou with all fear.</p>

opens his Fiery Stream. And he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
to drink down this precious Name,
or else all will be in vain. No Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
is capable of this Fiery Baptism;
for the solemnizing of this holy Seal
must, according to what is Recorded,
follow after Believing.</p>
                  <p>II. A Second Rule is, That thou
maist receive, and bear this Name wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38281:10"/>
give it place that it may all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
thee in such wise, that thou maist
disappear, and be hid in it; so as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may be found, but this Holy
Flaming Name, purifying every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
turning all into a Godlikeness, as
becomes this holy Place. Thus will
you come to know what is the Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
VVorking of this Name, as it is
written, not only VVithin, but upon
the Forehead, being all over cloathed
therewith. This is no less than the
Establishing the New Covenant, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
good this Promise, <hi>I will be to thee
a God, and thou shalt be to me a People;</hi>
to shew, a cementing into each other,
so as there shall be no need, for such as
are come here to say, Know the Lord,
for his Name is now become One, and
All; knowing himself in Thee to be
<hi>IEHOVAH,</hi> acting in a restored
simplified Nature, as of old time. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner it is only worth taking,
and bearing the Name of thy God: To
which take thou heed, and drink it in.</p>

Carefulness. Here must be a Rest in
Paradise, yea all that smells, or favours
of the six days Labour, which entred in
with the Curse of Mortality is to be
ceased from: I say, all sinful Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
either in Mind, or in Body we are
to rest from; not doing our own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or speaking our own words. This
is that true Inward Sabbath we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to sanctifie our God with. This is
a Truth, but there is a Rest which
reacheth further than all this: But you
will say wherein, and from what must
we cease? Pray give us the Particulars
of it.</p>

                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:38281:11"/>
I. The First is this, A Total Cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Working Property of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the motion of which must be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:
Here is no occasion for it in this
New Paradisical World: It is Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Fruit to the Children of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
that must live one and the
same Life with JESUS, and with the
Angels; that is, a Divine Magical Life,
strictly bound up to the Mystery of
Faith here to be revealed. Thou must,
as one alive from the dead, forget all
those Morsels of Mortality, which
maintained the sensitive Properties, and
which are only allowable for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>II. A Second Particular is, That not
only thy Eternal Spirit, and Mind rest
from Labour and Commerce, but also
thine Outward, in whom live the
Working Essences, which would be
continually Trafficking, like a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wheel that is never at rest: These
are the Son and the Daughter, the Man-servants,
and the Cattel within the
Gates of the External Man that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38281:11"/>
working; having fulfilled the
time hereof, in the six days Working
Properties, being now entred into this
holy Sabbath, where nothing must be
known, but such a Life as can take
pleasure in loving the Lord thy God
with all thine Heart: No Work being
required of thee, but to believe, and
rest upon his Omnipotency, to bring
all into thy hand: Thou needest not to
wander out from the Tabernacle which
the Lord hath pitched, to gather Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
it shall be rained down into thy
Tent, if thou continuest in this holy
Rest of Believing.</p>

               <div n="5" type="commandment">
                  <head>The Fifth Commandment.</head>
                  <p>HEre thou art required to honour
thy Eternal Father, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
thy true Natural Mother, which
hath brought thee forth, and up, to
that stature and degree in which thou
now art: Hence no less is expected
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38281:12"/>
from thee; and as my Fear and Love
is with thee, so my Honour must be thy
great Concern; that so length of days
may be thy Blessing from thy Father,
and Me, for evermore.</p>
                  <p>But to answer to the thoughts of
thine Heart, which saith, Oh! my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
wherein, and how may I come to
laud and honour God my Father, and
Wisdom my Mother, according as thy
First-born Son, my Pattern, hath in
his Paradisical Body done, while he was
in this World. Consider thy JESUS
then in his high and holy Calling,
from his Birth to his Ascension, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth one pure Act of Glorifying his
Father, in observing the Law of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
his Mother, from whose Eternal
Virgin Nature he had his Existence:
And now know, that as thou hast had
thy Birth from me, so thou art in the
same Line to run parallel; having pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
through the Birth-death, answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him that was before thee, whom
thou art to follow after in hallowing
that Great Name, which is secret, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38281:12"/>
known but to few, according to these
following Rules.</p>
                  <p>I. First, in being Partaker with thy
Jesus in the holy Calling and Order of
Priesthood, which is a perfect separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Life; whereto being once taken in,
thou art to consider what thy Charge
is. Thou art by this come under the
Vow of a Nazaritical Life, and art to
go no more out, having the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Oyl upon thine Head; and this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling
about thine Heart, thou must no
more defile thy self, either for any dead
Father or Mother, Son or Daughter;
lest thou profanest the Name and holy
Sanctuary of thy God, instead of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
it: Who will be sanctified in,
and through the whole Royal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
Because the Crown of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
Oyl is therefrom prest, giving
glory to God on high.</p>
                  <p>II. A Second Rule, by which thou
maist answer the Life of him that did
always magnifie the Father, is, to rest
and live in the Prophetical Spirit, as a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38281:13"/>
                     <hi>Seer</hi> into that which is beyond the Vail
of the pernicious sensitive Life; to do
and determine all things according to
what thou art made quick-sighted in,
through that Oyl which maketh the
Eye to be all Light, so as to see what is
done within that Region and Kingdom,
where the Father, and Wisdom the
Fountain of Light, govern jointly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
To whom thou art to make
thy Application, and Enquiry at the
Oracle of Wisdom, which is fixed in
thy inward part. For thou canst not
lessen, or impeach the honour of thy
God more, than in not obeying the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Prophecy, that is, and shall ever
rest, as a sign for distinction upon the
Holy Priests, who are called to be nigh
to the Holy One, and who may be
known from others by such Gifts and
Powers, whereby they may be enabled
to glorifie the Fountain, and the Giver
of this Spiritual Eminency.</p>
                  <p>III. A Third is, when thou art come
to take unto thee the Dominion and
Power to rule, and to subject, as Christ
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38281:13"/>
hath done, all things as thy footstool;
It is certainly the pleasure of Wisdom
to give thee a Kingdom, and all others
whose Ears are open, to her Discipline.
Soveraignity well becometh thy Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical
Habitation, for there it was first
left, and there thou, by abiding faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to these Laws, shalt recover it again,
and shalt know how to manage as well
the Golden Scepter of Power, as the
Rod of Iron, which is for the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Party who stand out, and refuse
to submit to the Reign of Jesus in this
his Second Appearance. Neither will
he now be awed, or frighted out of his
Right, but will make all those Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Tyrannical Spirits, which have
lived hitherto in Man's Nature, to yield
and bow, whether in Bodies, or out of
Bodies. Wherever this Name is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon, there terrible Majesty will
appear, to consume with the Brightness
of the Eye, all such as would oppose
God's return to Nature again with his
mighty Soveraignty. See now here to
what thou maist arrive: It is well
worth thy running for such a Prize, by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38281:14"/>
taking which thou wilt thy Father
highly bless. And with a greater and
more acceptable Tribute than this thou
canst never honour thy great King, and
Chief High-Priest.</p>

               <div n="6" type="commandment">
                  <head>The Sixth Commandment.</head>
                  <p>WHereas it was said in the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<hi>Thou shalt not Kill,</hi> here
thou art required to do Self-murder,
and not to spare cutting off the Head of
that Life, which would cut thee out
from having a Name and Place in the
New <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will say that is done already,
or I could never have known a Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
into this Paradisical Light and
Liberty, where I frequently behold
Glorified Objects, and hear the unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
Sounds, condescending to come
down to the Organical Senses, so to let
me understand the mind and pleasure of
the Father of this my new begotten Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38281:14"/>
True it is, thou art now quickned
into such a Life as is no more to be put
to death: For there is no Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to such as are risen with Christ. But
yet know there is a Mortal Sense, that
hath not yet left thee, which hath
thrust in here along with thee; and
this as it was by the First Adamical
Man awakened, so by the Second (in
Thee) it must be extinguished, if thou
desirest to know no more Curse. Which
Curse did enter as soon as the Windows
of the Earthly Senses were opened:
Then <hi>Adam</hi> came into the strife of the
Four Elements, and he needed not to
be told that he was <hi>Naked,</hi> or <hi>Hungry,</hi>
the Intelligencer being now in his own
Depraved Sense. But you will further
say, How can this be till Mortality be
swallowed up in Life, so as to have no
more occasion to use this World, whose
very Consistency is hereby; for take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the two Foundation Pillars, and it
will not, nor cannot exist longer?
Well, it is no more than what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed:
For <hi>Babylon</hi> must fall. Let it
be then the Cry, and the Endeavour,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38281:15"/>
that in thy self thou maist first behold
its Fall: Nor be thou afraid of thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
as to this self-degradation; for it
is the Injunction of Paradise that all
strife should cease, that thou maist
come only to know a Life of Serenity
and Peace in this holy Place, where a
Cessation of Mobility, and of all Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Essences is required. Which Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences,
if not stopped, would busily ply
thee, and so destroy the Magical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
which acts through the All-seeing
Eye of Eternity, and refuses all
contribution from the Sensitive Part;
well knowing its own sufficiency to
make thee again, to flower forth in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radisical
Povver. Be novv hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard

mayest put forth, vvhich shall be above
all Creaturely Addition: And no more
doubt that shovvers shall here be vvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Encrease, for all is ordered
in its proper course and season, to the

All thy Danger vvill lye in this Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38281:15"/>
vvhen thou shalt see that there
is nothing of Visibility to live upon, but
that all must be continually renewed
from the Virtual Power of the White
Stone, given to answer to all and every
Necessity. Therefore take good heed
thou dost it not mistrust, or deny: For
herein was the Transgression of that
Chosen Generation, whom JEHOVAH
by his Wonder-working Deeds would
have convinced, and made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that no other Fountain Blessing
they should ever stand in need of, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given so many proofs of his All-sufficiency,
bringing them even through
the deep Red Sea, that so they might
have no cause to question, but that the
same Almightiness would still be their
subsistence in all places; by the means
of which the barren Wilderness should
have been as a fruitful <hi>Lebanon:</hi> had
they not revolted, God intended no less
than miraculously to feed and cloath
them, but the Inundation of Sense over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
them with such Diffidence,
as turned that which would have been
a Paradise into a waste howling Desart,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38281:16"/>

every Hour, as being that true Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying

                  <head>The Seventh Commandment.</head>
                  <p>THou art not to break the Marriage-knot,
which is tied betwixt thee,
and the Lord thine Husband, to whom
thou art betrothed through the Eternal
Spirit. For it is an high Breach of the
Covenant of Love, which is established
upon immutable Promises on God the
Father's part, and on thine: Wherein
there is a passing over to each other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Witnesses, that bear Record in the
high Court of Heaven of this Espousal
betwixt Thee, and my Beloved Son,
the Heir of all the Riches of Heavens
Glory.</p>
                  <p>Now seeing this Royal Match is
made, and concluded on, by consent of
the Everlasting Father, and of Wisdom
thy Mother, who could not propose a
more Honourable, Worthy Person to
unite thy Spirit unto, thou art required
to abide most Constant and Loyal to
Him, and never more so much as to
look upon, or entertain any other Lover,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38281:17"/>
thereby to defile the Marriage-bed, in
committing of spiritual Adultery;
which doth consist in these following
Particulars.</p>
                  <p>I. First, in the Lust of the Eye after
this or that Creaturely Object, which
soon betrays the Heart, stealing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
insensibly, before it is aware of it.
In great Temptation thou dost here
stand, having such variety of Objects
still to court and captivate thy Mind,
from thy True and Royal Consort,
who watcheth every Motion and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
thereof which way it worketh,
being a very Jealous Lover, and one
who is resolved to prove thy Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in this time of his absence. He
therefore permitteth this and that <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>
to allure, and subtilly to encroach
into thee, that he may know what is in
thine Heart: And according as in this
time thou dost carry it, so will the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
come forth for a further proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as to the Consummating part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:38281:17"/>
II. The Second Caution I have to
give thee, is not only to make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with thine Eyes, but also with
thine <hi>Ears.</hi> For all Enchantments
come in through the Senses, which
though even in Paradise, are yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to be ensnared; as <hi>Adam</hi> was
with his <hi>Eve</hi> by their means. Who
taken with the sight of their Eye, and
entrapped with the hearing of their
Ear, were drawn on by one Sense after
another, even to the tasting of Eternal
Death, and the cutting asunder hereby
the Golden Link; which gave them the
heavy Fall out of Paradise into This
World. This was the Effect of the
Adulterous Eye and Ear. Stand then
upon thy guard with fear; see thou be
not snared in by them; hearken not to
any other Voice but what thy JESUS,
through ME, shall to thee speak; by
whom thou art prohibited to confer
with any other, well-knowing of what
dangerous consequence such a Liberty
would prove. It would provoke thy
Lord to Jealousie, who cannot bear that
thou shouldest be familiar to talk with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38281:18"/>
any other Spirit: For as much as the
Serpent is most subtle, and seeks many
ways to make a Prize of thee, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to break the Royal Band of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Marriage-Union, which hath
been so long contrived by Me, and
which I would now see Finished. Let
therefore my Counsel take place with
thee, so as thou neither taste, nor han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
those inviting pleasant Fruits, that
seem to say, Come, eat of me, try
whether I do not excel all whatever is
in Paradise, who have all that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to suit the Palate of thy Sense. Why
shouldest thou deny thy self to taste
hereof, depending only upon what the
Spirit of Faith must bring down to
thee, which also is not always present
with thee, to be commanded to run to
and fro on thine Errand, as occasions
require? But I will be sure never to fail
thee, who am thine old Lover and
Friend. Why then shouldest thou
forsake me, for one that is unseen, and
that cannot be handled sensibly? After
this manner, O my Bride, wilt thou be
exercised, if that so by any means thou
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38281:18"/>
canst be drawn away to break thy
Faith with me, who would fain knit
thee wholly to my self so as thou maist
not regard at all this Spirit of Reason,
that thus seeks to flatter and entice
thee from me, who have plighted my
Troth unto thee, never to forsake, or
cast thee off, if thou thy Virginity do
retain, and suffer thy self by none of
these fine twisted Cords from Me to be
drawn down. For thy JESUS cannot
admit any other Lover to sit in thine
Heart: And if at any time a Stranger
he shall find there, know that from
thee he will take the same most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly:
Although they may say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
they are the Friends, not the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of the Bridegroom, being of a
more Spiritual Train, yea, such as are
perfumed with a Paradisiacal Scent; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
which thou must also stop that
Sense: For it is possible to commit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
with Seraphick Angels, if thou
awakenest any Lusting Desire to them
more than to thy <hi>Iesus.</hi> So beware
then of running into any Spirit, though
never so sublime; for there is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38281:19"/>
in this, than in those Objects that
are of a more visible, gross and earthly
Dress; thinking with these who are
Spiritual, thou maist be more free, and
more bold. True it is, thou mayest;
but yet here it is good to be limited,
that thou be not circumvented, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
thy Virgin Head to be deflowered.
Wherefore from all keep thy self an
unspotted Mirrour, and so shalt thou
come to be the Chaste Bride of the
Lamb, and to enjoy the Nuptial Bed.
But after all this, methinks, I hear this
Question in thee to arise, How long
shall it be before the Marriage shall be
Solemnized? For I am now kept in
suspence, not knowing how long my
<hi>Iesus</hi> in Paradise will yet prove me, to
try my Loyalty, who like a despond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lover, would fain know the very
Day and Hour, that so I might get
my self all in a readiness, to meet my
Beloved; that when he calls I may not
be surprized. This is a Query that
may be allowed, tho' not as to the
date or prefixed time to be resolved.
Hast thou not learnt how the Times
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38281:19"/>
and Seasons the Father still reserveth in
his own Power, who keepeth always
this Prerogative to himself, while he
admitteth none to look into his Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
no not the Angels, till they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Trumpet to sound for Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
when the Marriage Feast is
ready: Therefore go thou thy way,
and stand in thy Lot: It is enough
thou art chosen, and elected hereto:
Thy present Business is to observe this
Law of pure Chastity, in which thou
art to wait patiently the Motion of thy
Bridegroom, who doth not forget the
Cry of the Spirit and Bride, but sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
may come e're thou art aware:
Therefore at all times watch, and have
thy Virgin Robe on, and thou shalt
not need to fear that he will stay long.</p>

<hi>Adam</hi> committed this high Theft in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
and stole out there in the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Property from God, with whom
he should have kept in an Indissoluble
Band of Unity; whereby he lost his
Godlike Power and Dignity, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38281:21"/>
would have been appropriated to him,
had not he rent, and gone out from,
the Eternal Essences of God, the Abyss
of his Being; out of which he was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated,
to be a Mighty Potent King,
and Hierarchy in the Angelical, and
Paradisical World; the which, under
God, he was to have Ruled, like a
God, uncontroulably; and did so till it
was lost most Cowardly. Well, but
now in thine Heart, I know, thou say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
<hi>How may I bring back into Paradise
this Honour, Name, and Praise, which
I would not for a Thousand Millions of
Worlds be reckoned to rob my God of, now
that I, O Mother, see in thy Glass the
Evil Consequences hereof?</hi> If so, then
Call and Summon in all those Essences,
wherein stand the Virtual Powers and
Mights, which belong to thy God, to
whom thou art to return with them,
and to work in an Undivided Spirit, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Operative Power, which
will work Godlike through all thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
unto the recovering of those
lost Goods, which the subtle Serpent,
together with the Harlotry Spirit of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38281:21"/>
this World, had Cheated thy God in
Thee of. But now Wisdom is come
to direct how all should be cemented,
and gathered in again, that so thou
mayest not take from the Inhabitants
of the Outward World any of their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
unsavoury Morsels; in all which
lyeth hid to this day the secret Venom
of that Evil Tree, which the whole
Universe of Spirits do still take, and
feed upon, as if it were lawful for them
so to do, making it matter of Necessity,
or even of Ordination from the most
High. But that this is not so, will
soon be made appear when the Sun
shall break forth, the Day spring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now upon its Rising, that shall
convince the Unbelievers, that there is
quite another way for the Ransomed of
the Lord to live. Which way I will
declare and open to thee, that thou
mayest take nothing of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s stuff a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with thee into thy Father's House,
where is All in abundance. But these
Treasures indeed cannot be come at but
by the Key of Faith, which opens, and
shuts, and doth all here at pleasure,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38281:22"/>
bringing down, and carrying up, as a
mighty Power, which Spirit is God's
only Familiar Friend, that can do any
thing with him. Then with all get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
do thou aim at this, which will
make thee do Exploits indeed. As it is
my Gift and Skill to make this Key, so
it lyeth in thy power to turn it into the
Lock, which will make this Magical
Door to fly open, uniting the Divided
Essences to act Miraculously.</p>

                  <head>The Ninth Commandment.</head>
                  <p>HEre thou art required not to bear
false Witness against thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
but to love him as thy self, being
one with, or nearer to thee than thy self.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, <hi>Who is this my
Neighbour?</hi> Dost thou not know him,
thou that hast been so long an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in the Paradisical Ground? He is
even that true <hi>Samaritan</hi> who hath
poured in the Restorative Oil for thy
Healing, who hath taken the care of
thee wholly, and undertook thy Cure
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38281:22"/>
then when he saw thee wounded
unto Death. His Eye pitied, and
officiated in this Love Service, as
one that had a fellow-feeling of thy
Calamity and Suffering, under the
Violence of Cruel Blood-thirsty Spirits,
under whose power thou wert fallen:
And seeing thee now in such imminent
danger to lose thine Eternal Life, he
was immediately sent by the Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Father to rescue thee out of the
Hands of these Robbers, that designed
to kill the Heir of Life and Glory in
Thee. So here you may see who is
that true Worthy Neighbour, whom
you are obliged to bear witness <hi>to,</hi> and
<hi>for,</hi> and not <hi>against;</hi> stedfastly bearing
Record of the Truth, from the Spirit
of God's Wisdom dwelling in you,
which is the only True Prophet, and
Witness for Jesus in Thee. Verily
there are intruding Spirits, that would
come in as False Witnesses, of whom
be thou aware, and be not found in the
Conspiracy with them, who would
condemn that Just One again, and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
the Life afresh, that is risen out
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38281:23"/>
from the Morning Womb of God's
Virgin, to be the Anointed Nazarite.
Against whom out of thine own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
false Prophets will arise to seduce,
and if possible, deceive my Elect and
precious Seed, now formed into the
Heavenly Similitude. But I am come
to give thee Light from my Celestial
Glass and Globe, that in it thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
see all the false transforming Spirits
that would subtilly bring in old Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
things; instead of, and in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to my Pure and Unmixed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
the which I do into the Clean
and Gold-refined Vessels never fail to
pour: That so by it thou mayest be
Tinged throughout, and in thy self
feel a mighty Burning Oyl, spiriting
thee for Infallible Prophesie. This will
give thee the true Witness for Divine
Wisdom in her First-begotten Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
that now must be testified unto,
as the Finisher and Consummator of
what is yet left behind to be done; and
who will not come as a bare Record,
only to Prophesie, or Preach the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Gospel in thine Earth: This
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38281:23"/>
witnessing is much too short before the
coming down of the New <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
in which thou art to wait, until thou
be transfigured all over by the Holy
Ghost, who will then be the true and
undeniable Witness, that will need no
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> by Voice to cry, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
That this JESUS verily is the
Son of God. A greater Testimony than
that of Man verily now is required, for
God seeing that to be but weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual,
hath ordained a more glorious
Demonstration, which shall convince
the Unbelieving World that JESUS is
risen, and doth appear to certain Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
upon whom the Lot is fallen,
and according to Fore-knowledge:
Who are to shew in their Age and
Time, at the Opening of this Oriental
Stone and Diadem of Glory, what
manner of Persons they shall in, and
through the Touch, and Sight hereof,
come to be, in being made by it all
Pure, Wise, and Potent, according as
their JESUS is. For nothing short of
this will be worth bearing a Record to.
Therefore I do give you this Charge to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38281:24"/>
look and wait upon this Change on
your selves to see; that so my worthy
Recorders ye may be, and Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of JESUS in your own Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.
The Dominion will to Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's
Off-spring first come down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are trained up to Perfection
through Wise Discipline, obeying in
all things my Revealed Will. Know
also this Commandment doth further
reach, than to love thy JESUS in thy
Self: That must not be all; thou art
Conjugally and Neighbourly to know
him where-ever he dwelleth Bodily;
and with the same Love, Care, and
Concern, as for thy self, always to his
Necessities administer supplies, as God
giveth to thee.</p>

               <div n="10" type="commandment">
                  <head>The Tenth Commandment.</head>
                  <p>THis is the Great, Full, and Last
Charge, which I shall leave
with thee, still running Parallel with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38281:24"/>
those Old Covenant Laws which are
never to be nullified, but to be fulfilled
according to the Original Exemplar,
which was given forth to the First Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radisical
Man; and to be revived now
afresh unto a full and perfect Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,
without abating one Iota or
Tittle of them; according to that
Word of thy JESUS, who said he
came not to destroy the Law, but to
fulfil it in Thee, and for Thee; who
will be the End and the Consummation
of the same, through the obliterating
of Sin, and bringing in the Everlasting
Righteousness. Here then thou art
forbid all coveting or ingrossing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
after what is the Possession and
Enjoyment of another. For whatever
is of this doth proceed from an Evil
Eye, which must be plucked out, as
being never to be satisfied, but still apt
to envy at, and covet after what is his
Neighbours. Now here is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
a Threefold Neighbourhood,
that borders upon the Intellectual
Mind. The First, as was shewed, is
Wisdom's Root and Off-spring, JESUS
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38281:25"/>
the First-born of all New Creatures,
existent Bodily in thy self. Secondly,
He is thy Neighbour, as he may be
considered Incarnated in another, as
well as in Thy self. Thirdly, thine
Outward Man; which hangeth, and
cleaveth to thee, as the subtle <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
that would still be adjoined to
the Inward Man, and never be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from it. This last Neighbour is as
the <hi>Esau,</hi> that would come in for his
Birthright, who is rejected, and must
live by his Sword, that is to bring him
in his Blessing, consisting of the fat
things of this Outward Principle, to
which his Blessing gave him Right:
And he being thus here to confined, is
not to meddle with <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Portion,
that is quite of another Nature, to
whom the Dominion is pronounced to
have the Lordship over All, in, and
through Cohabitation with the <hi>Shiloh</hi>
of God, that is thy true Neighbour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p>I. Now as to what thy JESUS in
thee hath, thou needest not to covet;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38281:25"/>
for thou art in Propriety with Him.
As all that is the Father's and mine is
his, so what is his is thine, in common:
Which thou shalt better understand
when to the Tenth Number thou art
come.</p>
                  <p>II. Thy Restriction lyeth here at
present, not to let out thine Eye upon
what is another's Portion as to Eternal
Possessions; for one may come to his
Inheritance before another, according to
that Spirit which worketh as a free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
to increase Spiritual Substance.
And this may be either sooner or later,
as the Spirit worketh more or less indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously;
which useth to operate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly,
according as the Soil and the
Nature of the Ground is, that of a
much different Constitution is found.
In some this Internal Ground is richer,
pleasanter, fatter, and every way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than it is in others; like as you may
see in the Visible Earth: But every
one is to be contented with his Lot, as
it is divided. <hi>Caleb</hi>'s Portion was much
above that of his Fellow Brethren,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38281:26"/>
whose Dwelling was betwixt the upper
and nether Springs. So if thou should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
see thy Spiritual Neighbour much
encreased in Powers, in Gifts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
in Knowledge, in understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the deepest of all Mysteries, and
living in a more stately Habitation
than thou, enjoying therein the Virgin
Wife of Youth, having Men-servants
and Maid-servants to command, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this, Go, and he goeth, having
all things put under, and in subjection
to him, as a <hi>Solomon</hi> in great Dominion
and Glory in the Reign of the Holy
Ghost: Yet all this must not draw thee
out to covet. <hi>No,</hi> you will say, <hi>this is
hard to come to see all these high Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
conferred upon my Spiritual Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and yet I must not desire the like
Dowry and Riches, to stand upon equal
Ground with him.</hi> Mistake thou not,
for I do not here prohibit any from
looking after the same Immunities and
Increase: But let it be from their own
Fountain, opening out of their own
deep Ground, from which every one is
to be blessed, according to what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38281:26"/>
and Soil they are planted in. And
there are you to dig deep, till that you
shall come to find that precious Stone,
with your own Name upon it, which
may advance and establish you in the
like state of Glory. For so it is ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all that are mine, should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their own stock of Life, and so
each one wear their own Crowns; not
coveting any thing out of themselves,
because I have enough to give to every
one of my Children, even a full Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue;
so as there shall be no occasion of
grudging one at another: But their
Growths, Degrees, and Gifts may be
different, according as in my own wise
Counsel I shall see meet to dispence,
who will be Uncontroulable, giving
no account to any Creature, but will
confer my Favours upon such as I see,
and know to be most diligent. For
which they shall have no cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
who have their Minds wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
and bent toward ME, and who
unto these my Laws do entirely cleave;
which Laws, without a Mosaical Vail,
I now present; that thou mayest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38281:27"/>
the good Will that I do bear unto
thee, and unto such as love and know
My Name, so as in pure <hi>Nazariteness</hi>
to separate for the Work, which I have
cut out for you to imitate exactly, as
approving your selves in all things, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to please Her who will be your
Crowning Reward.</p>
                  <p>III. But I must not forget to cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee concerning that Out-birth
Neighbour, lest thou shouldest covet
that which is his Right in this Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Principle: Where he also hath a
great Lordship, and a Might-Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
over all whatever the Visible
Earth doth bring forth. Here is in
this World likewise a Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
consisting in Riches, Honour,
and Majesty, with Dominion over
their Fellow Creatures, where-from I
set thee free.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Opposition which this Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Spirit met with, during the
Delivery of these Laws.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS I was strictly engaged to attend
the giving out of <hi>Wisdom</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radisical
Laws; that opened in me like
a Flaming Shower, which drowned
the Old World, that a New World
might in the room of it spring up, my
whole New Man walking up and down
therein, and drinking of that pleasant
River <hi>Pison,</hi> which waters this new-entered
Land, into which no Earthly
Stuff must be admitted; I could not yet
be free from molestation. For tho'
Sin, that strange deformed Monster,
must look for no welcome here, being
for ever Banished this Holy Place, yet
after Death in several Shapes he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
still to haunt me, often saying he
will be avenged of me, for that I have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38281:28"/>
exposed him to a violent Death, for the
making my way into Paradisical Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Therefore he transforms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
now into a Spirit, and pursues me,
and would bring all my dead Works
after me; that so I might be restless
even here, where according to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Law of Liberty, I should rest
from all Fear and Care.</p>
               <p>This occasioned somewhat of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
which I brought before my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> telling her, That after
Death I did hope, I should have been
freed, and that all Wars should have
ceased, when I was once got in within
this Gate. But, replied her Witness,
the Spirit of Prophesie in me, I never
said Death would acquit thee so, as
that no Temptation at all should mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
thee through the subtilty of the
Serpent, who hath liberty to prove thee
Here, in like manner as he had liberty
to prove thy dear JESUS; who for this
end suffered him, that he might give
proof of an unconquerable stedfastness,
during the appointed time that he was
in Paradise to abide. So must thou
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38281:28"/>
here expect, that the Man of Sin may
by the Angel of the Bottomless Pit be,
though dead, again assumed; and may
make War against the Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
As it is said, <hi>There was War in
Heaven;</hi> as of Old, so Now again in
thee. Therefore to the Law, and to
the Testimony, which within thy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
do open, do thou give good heed;
that thou mayest prevail, and come off
a Conqueror, by the keeping of the
Commandments, and the Faith of
JESUS. The last Battel which is to
be fought is in this Paradisical Field:
Thou art now to engage in a single
Combat. Therefore to thee I bring
my Flaming Armour, which is Love
and Faith, by which thou wilt only
an Overcomer be. Remember that
Charge of Honouring thy Father and
Mother, and do not thou them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace:
For now thou art upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Stage, where the whole Hierarchy
of Throne-Powers do thee view, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
how thy <hi>Michael</hi> in thee will Fight
against the Dragon, with his Fiery
Might. The Honour of thy God is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38281:29"/>
much herein concerned, that thou do
over the Beast and the False Prophet
prevail, defying the Number, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the Mark of his Name, that
nothing any more he may be ever able
to claim in thee. For through Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Faith holding out, thou wilt see
him Cowardly sneak out of Paradise.
Since he will not care to abide there, if
he see thee resolutely fixed in the Spirit
of my Might, who foreseeth all his
cunning Slights, by which he would
pluck thee down out of Paradise. Then
saith he, my Design would take place,
and I should have Wisdom in derision,
that hath no better provided for her
Children, but left them thus to be foil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Dragon. See now how this
Evil One will, if thou shouldest fall,
reflect upon GOD thy Father, and ME
thy Mother: Therefore, dear Child,
for our Honour stand; that so thy days
may not be short in the Promised Land.
To which thou wilt surely come, if thou
canst hold out all the appointed time of
Temptation: Then another Remove
thou shalt see, where no more shalt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38281:29"/>
thou to the Dragon's Fury be exposed,
but shalt the long and everlasting Day
inherit, and keep this Sabbath without
end rejoicing, according as thou shalt
here Meritoriously vindicate that Name
of Mine, which to the World is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Secret.</p>
               <p>I was also further Encourag'd by
<hi>Wisdom</hi> against the great Opposition
which I felt, when waiting for the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of the <hi>Sixth Commandment,</hi>
there appear'd to me all on a <hi>sudden,</hi>
while She was giving her Counsel and
Charge, a glorious Circle with all
Flaming Colours: Upon which I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very stedfastly. It continu'd a good
space, as well as I might guess, near
upon half a quarter of an hour, before
it vanish'd. This Circle consisted of
various and wonderful Colours, the
inmost part of it was all clear and
bright, as the Air without a Cloud.
Then spake <hi>Wisdom</hi>'s Spirit in me,
What hast thou seen here but the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Eye,</hi> which is an All-seeing Globe,
that includeth all Light, Power and
Might within its Circle, so that there
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38281:30"/>
is no need to go out for any Supply, for
that all lyeth within the compass of
this All-generating Eye: And like as
thou didst see it rise in a <hi>Moment,</hi> so
shall it give new Existencies from its
own in the <hi>twinkling</hi> of an Eye. This
is the manner of <hi>Paradisical</hi> Living,
quite different from the Way of the
Inhabitants of the Outward World,
who live upon the Mouldy Bread of
Sense, upon whose Breast they hang,
and cannot endure to be plucked from
it; though they suck in thence the
Curse and Poyson of God's Anger,
which came in when the Paradisical
Life ceased. But to thee that art come
out and separated from these, my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
is, that thou entirely rest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon this Divine Magical Eye,
and never wander out from it; so will
it become to thee thy Basket and thy
Store: So will it be to thee thy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-blessing,
and thou shalt need to
know no more, and to take care of no
more, than what this will give forth
to thee. For it is an endless Procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Source, that still puts forth New
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38281:30"/>
Births altogether Supernatural, to
which belongs a pure, sublime, orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
Body, having highly irradiated
Senses, with uncorrupted and divine
Rationality, such as is grounded upon
what is Seen and Known by This Eye.
Hence may be demonstrated the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of those Holy Beings, which
are generated from this Source and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
Here also may be added the
Perfect Animal and Vegetable Life,
with the Sensitive and Rational, they
all making up the New Creature or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radisical
Man; but after a much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manner than that after which they
are in the <hi>Degenerated,</hi> or those that are
<hi>departed from the Faith.</hi> Which <hi>Faith</hi>
is here again to be restored, through a
Magical Operative Life that maintains
its own Being, after a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
cutting off all occasions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
more with a sinful state. For
there is here no coveting any Mortal or
Perishing Things, which the Low Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Life stood in need of: But thou
being Born into this <hi>Seraphical</hi> Nature,
which looks only in to God, whose E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38281:31"/>
Stores stand open and free for
thee to come, and take of, as thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Right, hast no need to go to any
other Fountain. Now as Christ said,
All that the Father had was his, so is
it thine by virtue of the same Spirit of
Christ in thee, who never crouch'd to
this World for any of its unrighteous
Mammon, and who would not dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
his Father's House-keeping, to
seek any Benevolences from Creatures
that lived upon Self-propriety. Him
therefore herein I present to be thy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
who had a Body Terrestrial,
as thou hast, but his Celestial Paradisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Man had Keys to open all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
either in Heaven above, or in the
Earth beneath. But I know thou wilt
say, <hi>This is too wonderful for me to aspire
to, or to expect.</hi> Nay, not so: For
whatever thy JESUS acted here and
did, thou mayest not fear to imitate:
That which is Formed in thee, will
certainly drive thee to this, if thou dost
not check it by Unbelief. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of that Holy Thing which is Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
within, will contend for this
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:38281:31"/>
its High Prerogative, and not always,
as it were Ass-riden, be subject to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Properties, and Earthly Spirits.
Who must all to that New Name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
within Vail themselves and Bow:
And that so it may accordingly be, I
will not fail to aid thee with my <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <l>Which shall give Skill in this for thee to try,</l>

               <p>UPon the giving down and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Paradisical Laws, I
was beset with a Seditious Party, that
would have stirred up a Mutiny in me,
to contradict this worthy and precious
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38281:32"/>
Covenant, so as it might not take
place, or be of force with me: Saying,
These were intolerable Impositions;
that none could, or ever did, reach to
the requirings of them: And what was
I? Or where was my Sufficiency more
than others, that I should hope, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Accomplishment of them in
my self? This was to go into a Legal
Dispensation, and turn the Covenant of
Grace into Works again, so to Yoak
and Fetter my self within the Confines
of these strict and severe Laws; and
then where was the Liberty that was
to come in by JESUS to set me Free?
He having satisfied the Law for me,
that I might not be obligatory to it.
Come, come, cried the King-crowned
Beast, away with these Innovations,
and receive my Laws, in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of which there will be Ease and
Rest. Dost thou not see how peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
all my Subjects live under me, that
bear my Mark and Name? Who are
like them, great in Fame, and mighty
through Honour and Riches, which they
obtain, by observing my Orders and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38281:32"/>
Rules? Which I will give to thee, who
would have thee Great in my Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and not Despiseable as now thou
art.</p>
               <p>I. Whereas it is said thou must have
no other God but One, and that thou
must own him as thy Creator, and
none other before him, this I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
and thou art not prohibited here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from:
Nevertheless thou art not so
strictly tyed up here, but that thou
mayest own Subordinate Powers under
God, and obey Nature's Laws for its
Self-preservation. This is but equal,
and therefore do not slight these Laws,
that are founded upon Reason's bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
but Sail thou with its Tide, as
thou desirest Blessing and Prosperity in
this World. Is it not great Folly in
thee, and in such as do join with thee,
to be Singular, and to observe such
Laws as none are able to agree with
you in, that wisely intend to maintain
their Interest as to the Friendship, and
the Favours from the Kingdom of the
World, which, as thou hast a Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38281:33"/>
Life, and a Mortal Body, thou
dost stand in as much need of, as any
of the Natural Off-spring whatever?
Now hath God said indeed unto thee,
that thou must neither Eye, nor have
reference to any other, either in the
Heavens above, or in the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath;
but must live upon him for all,
singly and undoubtingly, by a Spirit
of Faith alone: This is a Law for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicks,
but not for Creatures that bear
Mortal Shapes, who are fallen under
the Line and Dominion of the Starry
Constellations. It is unavoidable, thou
must bow, and be subject subordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto the Starry Heavens, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
and constitute, and give forth
Right Laws, being such as consist ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well with refined Reason, which
you would exclude: And then what
will become of you, when you shall
forsake the Order of Sense and Reason,
which your New Laws call Low and
Earthy? Must you not hereby needs
bring all into Desolation and Ruin upon
your External Comely Station, and be
a By-word, and a Derision to all your
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38281:33"/>
Fellow Creatures, that you will before
your Eyes see fair and flourishing
Branches, thriving through obedience
to the Laws of this my present, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Kingdom? For I do not defer my
Rewards, but do give them as soon as
their Work is done; neither do I keep
my Subjects and Children in such sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
and waiting for what they do not
See, so awing them in the mean time,
as they must not so much as look awry,
or be Company for any other but Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks.
O who can such a Life as this
bear, while living in this Mortal Sphere?
Oh come out, and regard not this self-destroying
Covenant, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
make a Breach, and set all at
variance against thee, if thou shouldest
keep to it. Then I must tell thee,
Wars from my Principle shall for ever
annoy thee: Lo, this is my last Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to thee, and if thou all my Love-Intreaties,
and Rational Laws shalt
still renounce and disobey, then expect
that I will raise up the whole Earth's
Monarchy against thee. For they will
all concur with me against such, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38281:34"/>
to observe these singular Laws,
which are so opposite to Our Decrees,
that if we should among our Subjects
any of these once allow, we soon should
lose our Soveraignty over them, and be
our selves made to own a Superior Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
by the utter loss of our own
Dominion. Ah, but this will not be
yielded to, I do assure thee: For veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all Power and Force to the utmost
ends of the Earth we will call in, and
will War with Reason's mighty Sword
and Spear, till we see Garments rouled
in Blood every where: Thou shalt
through Blood the Conquest get, and
seeing that Terms of Peace thou hast
refused, War within thy Paradise is
Proclaimed. Now think not that State
with all its Laws, which Wisdom thy
Mother hath brought down, shall from
our mighty power thee secure, or from
our sharp and piercing Hosts thee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Therefore in short, if thou wilt
set thy Seal to these Articles that I do
here present to thee, then thou mayest
hereby purchase thy Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
As,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:38281:34"/>
I. In the first place, thou art to own
me who am the Prince that Ruleth in
the Astral Region, who by these visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
natural Planets do rule the whole
Day of all lower Created Beings.</p>
               <p>II. I require to be feared, worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and confided in; the Image of
whom thou shalt make to thy self.</p>
               <p>III. Thou shalt not be ashamed to
bear my Name, or to act forth in all
my Natural and Sensual Properties, as
Baptized into the Laver of Common
Regeneration.</p>
               <p>IV. Thou shalt rest from thine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Calling, and from the work of
thine Hands, and shalt dedicate a Day
in special, to bring in thy Peace-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and to pay thy Vows, as a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
unto me thy King.</p>
               <p>V. Thou shalt love and honour me,
as a Father that hath begotten thee,
and that doth also take care to provide
worthily for thee; that thou mayest
not disparage thy Birthright to all these
visible good Things.</p>
               <p>VI. Thou art not to kill, or wound,
the Life of that Judicious Spirit of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38281:35"/>
which is the Choicest Plant in thy
Ground, and my True Prophet that
giveth forth my Mind expresly.</p>
               <p>VII. Thou art not to Adulterate
from me, who am thy Natural Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
being joined and knit together,
by that immutable Bond of Love's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality;
from which if thou dost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
before Death, thou highly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressest
against the Law of me thy First
Husband, who will never acquit thee,
nor hold thee guiltless in so great a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty.</p>
               <p>VIII. Thou art not to Rob me of
what is my Right, as I am the chief
and the great Monarch in this Outward
World, who will not have any one
Title, Prerogative, or Revenue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to my Region taken from me,
or diminished.</p>
               <p>IX. Thou art not to witness against,
or be at Enmity with thy Fellow Off-spring,
thine adjoining Neighbour;
but art to love him as thy self, as being
compacted together, and growing up
Naturally with him as an Inhabitant in,
and from, the Earthly Source.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:38281:35"/>
X. Thou art not to Covet, or to
Desire any thing which I have not to
give.</p>
               <p>If this my Charge thou dost ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
the whole Earthly Principle shall
then be employed to Contrive, Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,
and get increase of Riches and
Honours for thee, that thou mayest
spend thy Life in Pleasantness, Joy,
and Content. Expect not that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
will give forth any thing unto thee,
till after the dissolution of thy Body:
Therefore thou art not to covet in this
Life-time the things that are reserved
for Eternity. Not but that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
have liberty of setting up Divine
Ordinances, and attending them in
their appointed Course, so long as thou
dost not rend, or neglect the Duties of
thy Outward Calling; giving God his
due, and Man his, and thy self his, so
all together jointly and mixedly as thy
Rational Service. Thus thou seest my
Kingdom hath substantial, good, and
prudent Laws, which now I expect
thou shouldest subscribe to, as thou art
under, and in, my Dominion: Who
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38281:36"/>
though I cannot reach thy Paradisical
Man, yet so long as thou livest in a
Terrestrial Body, that is, and will be,
liable to all the Penalties that shall for
the Breach of these Laws be inflicted.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Reply of Wisdom's Paradisical
Inhabitant to the King-Crowned
Beast, as in Conjunction with
the False Prophet.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>O Thou subtle Spirit! How long
wilt thou not cease to seduce and
tempt, plying hard upon the New-born
Innocent, which from thy Kingdom is
gone out? I am not now ignorant of
thy great rage, neither canst thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me by putting on a seeming holy
Shape, pretending to an Unparallel'd,
Judicious Uprightness, with all thy
cunning slight. These Arguments thou
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38281:36"/>
hast to me presented, to draw me from
the Great Work that is intended by
Wisdom: But know that I this day
do thy Laws defie, and am not afraid
of thy terrible Might; and all Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
in order to a Compliance with
that low, sordid, corrupt Rational
Life, I do here in Wisdom's holy fear,
renounce and despise. Far be it from
me ever to listen to them: I, who have
had such a Call out of the Precinct,
where the Dragon and the Beast, the
professed Enemies of My God and his
Wisdom, do exercise their Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
can have no Inclinations of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back: I cannot, I will not, let them
threaten me never so long, to make me
feel the Effects of their Fury, which
they boast they can let forth upon that
part, which is not yet freed from their
Astral Dominion. All this, O migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
subtle Prince, I have well consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Even how far your Power against
me may extend. I go not about to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
you of your Right: Neither do
I in the least envy you your strong, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and fiery Might, or Dominion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:38281:37"/>
Only this you must give me leave to do,
to disclaim your Usurped Power, as
making a Challenge to any part in me,
who do well know that from your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Government, I am set free by
the Birth of <hi>Iesus</hi> in me. And now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my own Peril it would be, should
I own any other Law-giver or King,
besides Virgin Wisdom in Him, who
is the <hi>Yea,</hi> and the <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this be the Ground of your
Quarrel and Despight, that I will not
yield to your Summons, or agree to any
of your Articles, I slight both your
Cause and you. Nor will I ever sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to any Conditions that shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with what Wisdom hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
my Hand and Seal to, that so I
might not from her Laws depart, in
adherence to which, I doubt not but
perfect Freedom to find, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from your Insolence wholly;
the most Potent Instrument that you
have in your Kingdom, being too weak
to Encounter God's Agent, the Spirit
of Wisdom, who will with me rest,
and so defeat all Plots and Counsels
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38281:37"/>
that are contrived by the whole Dark
Hierarchy, conspiring in your Earthly
Sphere. Therefore I will not fear you,
O great <hi>Leviathan,</hi> though you have
defied and made light of that unspotted
Mirrour of God's Wisdom; saying,
Tush, let me see if she can secure you, or
deliver you out of my Hands, who can
command Legions of Spirits to torment
and devour you. Such like Threats as
these I can hear, and your Denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
against Faith's Resoluteness bear,
knowing who is my Standard-bearer,
who will come in to my Relief, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that which will make me able to
hold out, even for a long Siege. For
which Wisdom hath taught me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,
expecting as little Favour from
thee, and thy Principle, as from an
open Proclaimed Enemy: The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
is come now to be so great, that
the Virgin Seed must yet again in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
spring and rise, till thy Head, O
Serpent, be brought under foot, and
by the Lamb of God so crushed; that
no more Revenge or Plots may by that
Head be contrived. Which Head is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38281:38"/>
the Seat of the Imaginary Mind, that
flows in like a mighty Torrent, as I
have seen sometimes witnessed in sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
as also out of the same Source the
flowings of strong Reasonings, which
are as the Artillery of War, that thou
hast against me to display. By which
indeed I grant thou hast overcome
World after World, so that all People,
Nations, and Languages, have bowed
and submitted to thy Monarchy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is agreeable to an Outward Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Birth, which is conceived and
brought forth out of the Lapsed Womb
of Rationality. The Life's Food, of
which is only Sensibility, united with
these gross and low Elements, in which
the Universe of Creatures consisting,
do like Natural Children fall under thy
Starry Dominion, and to all thy Laws
and Constitutions incline, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
them obey. Against such, O
King of the Bottomless Pit, thou wilt
never proclaim War: Only these shall
live peaceably within thy Gates. But
for such as are again conceived in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Wisdom's Womb, and brought
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38281:38"/>
forth from between her Everlasting
Knees, at whose Birth the Eternal
Day-star breaketh out, there is no
Quarter to be given: Therefore Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations
from thy dark Herodian
Kingdom do begin immediately, as that
which is not able to bear or hear of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
King, that cometh to thwart or
alter the whole Course of Things, as
they are established in thy Natural and
Earthly Kingdom. But why, O great
Prince of Darkness, shouldest thou be
offended at the Birth of <hi>Emmanuel</hi> from
the Virgin Womb? It will not so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
turn thee out of Dominion and
Possession every where, as to have no
place in the Earth more. Why art
thou so Jealous? Thy Dominion here
is large enough, and like so to be; for
the Earthly Inhabitants will still be
thine, even all such as are of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
and Serpently Seed; there is
no danger but they will still bear thine
Image, and Likeness, and so be on thy
side to make War against the Lamb,
and his Bride, who are agreed to live,
and to maintain against thee, their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38281:39"/>
Rights, in their Paradisical King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
out of which they are resolved
to throw thee, with all thine accursed
and insinuating Powers, which like so
many Caterpillars would eat holes in,
and so spoil and devour our Paradisical
Flowers. Do not think thou shalt for
ever ingross all Spirits to thy self: Thy
Date is seen in Wisdom's Calendar,
and the Number of the Time of thy
Ten-horned Beast almost accomplished,
when he must return to his own place,
and be no more suffered to tempt those
that have received the most Holy, and
most Precious Name: Whose Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Within and Without, shall be
that signal Token of Victory over thee,
and thy Seven-headed Nations, whom
thou hast called in to thine Aid, if that
possibly hereby thou mightest over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
the great Design of Wisdom.
Who now hath sounded her Trumpet,
that whosoever will fly to her Banner,
shall be securely hid from thy Eye, and
be made so Strong and Wise, as to do
such Exploits, by the Weapons of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:38281:39"/>
Faith, as shall thee Amaze and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie.</p>
               <p>Therefore know, that to the Eternal
Law and Testimony given forth in
Paradise; to that I say, and say it
again, as an immutable Assertion from
which I shall never depart; I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to cleave, and by it to stand,
until it shall make me altogether Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and so Compleat, that thou
mayest be grieved to see that God
hath perfected Holiness in so high a
degree, in that which was the Fallen
Humanity, and which under thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
did once lye, but is now reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of it by the Mighty Arm of
the Lord of Hosts. And he will guard
me from thy Fury, JEHOVAH will
be my Safeguard, yea, the whole
Blessed Trinity will consult my Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
if I am found to confide therein,
Wherefore I shall not be further soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
to Answer any of thy Upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
But to my Ark of Strength I
will retire, And I leave thee in thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Fire. From Wisdom's Off-spring
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38281:40"/>
this total and final Answer is
given in, with which let thy Mouth,
