         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and to be short, the whole bodie, though all the

that Christ Iesus, the onely begotten sonne
of the almightie &amp; eternal God, had passed the like
yea and worse perilles: as by the historie of his
death and passion may appeare: that the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyr,
S. Steeuen had his tormenters, S. Paule
the Apostle his persecuters, and other of Christes
disciples their afflicters: then thought I, that these
sanctified vessels made their vocation honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
euen by their deathes, which were opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
and therefore, howe can it bee, but that this
our Martyr, worthie Bishop Hooper, offering
vp his body a burnt sacrifice, liuely, reasonable, &amp;
acceptable vnto God, shoulde giue good credit to
his doctrine, assure his profession, affirme his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
&amp; liue in euerlasting memorie, by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion
of his bookes, though his fauour be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and his body consumed? Of such a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
so valiantly fighting vnder the ensigne of his
Capteine, I cannot say sufficient. Of this I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued,
that although his earthly tabernacle bee
destroyed:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> yet hath hee a building giuen him of
<pb facs="tcp:4397:4"/>
God, euen an house not made with handes, but

To proceede and approch neerer to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
(for the premisses are effectuall enough, to
breed beleefe, and to kindle reuerence, in the heart
of any true Christian, towardes this our excellent
Martyr, replenished with the abundance of Gods
holy spirit) I commende vnto thy minde (good

<hi>Certaine expositions vpon the 23. 62. 72. and 77. Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of the Prophet Dauid,</hi> of the which the three
last (being gathered together by a godly professor
of the trueth M. Henrie Bull) were neuer before
printed. Their beginnings are vsually read in this
maner. 23. <hi>The Lord feedeth me, &amp; I shal lack nothing 62.
My soule truly waiteth vpon God. 72. Truly God is louing
vnto Israel, euen vnto such as are of a cleane hart. 77. I wil
crie vnto God with my voice, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> to God will I crie with my
voice, &amp; he shall hearken vnto me.</hi> The expositions of
which psalmes to be pithie, &amp; profitable, this may
be a substantial proofe: because they were written
in the time of his trouble, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> (no doubt) he was
talking in spirit with God: &amp; being so occupied,
his exercises could not but be heuenly, &amp; therfore
effectuall, fruitfull, and comfortable. Come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

for thou canst not heare him enough. He giueth
thee a pleasaunt Pomander, vouchsafe it the

good dansing: he bidds thee to a sumptuous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
bee not deintie in feeding: he presenteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Oh giue God thanks for all, &amp; glorifie the Lords
name, whome it hath pleased to plant in his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeard
so fruitefull a vine, which beareth grapes
Gods plentie, of whose iuice Ã´ Christ vouchsafe
vs to tast, that our vessels beeing seasoned with
true sanctification, they may be made sweete to
receiue and preserue the water of the riuer of life,
flowing from the liuely rocke Christ Iesus: to

of GOD knowne to all others, that as he, in all his aduersities,
put his trust in the Lorde, and had the ouerhand of all his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
euen so by his example, all other men should learne to
doe the same, and assure them selues to finde (as he found) the
Lorde of heauen to be the succour and defence of the troubled,
and their keeper from all euill.</p>
               <p>And bicause the hearers and readers of this most diuine &amp;
godly Hymne, should the better vnderstand the same, and the
sooner take credite thereof in the heart, he calleth the heauenly
father (the God of all consolation) in this Psalme, a shepheard
or heardman feeding his flocke: and the people (with him selfe)
he calleth sheepe pastured and fed by the shepheard. And by
these two meanes, as by a most conuenient Allegorie or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
meete for the purpose, from the office of a shepheard, &amp;
the nature of sheepe, he setteth out meruellously the safegard of
man by Gods prouidence, and goodwill towardes man. And in
the same Allegorie or Translation, he occupieth the foure first
verses in this Psalme. In the first verse, and so to the ende of the
Psalme, he declareth stil one matter and argument of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
towardes man, and howe man is preserued. But yet it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that he expresseth the same by other words and by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
translation, shewing the nature of God almightie, in feding
and nourishing of man vnder the name of a Lord or King, that
<pb facs="tcp:4397:6"/>
hath prepared a table and plentie of meats to feede the hungrie
and needie: and setteth foorth man poore and destitute of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
and necessarie helpe, vnder the name of guestes and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
folkes to a Kings table, where is plentie of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie,
not onely to satisfie hunger, and to quench thirst, but
also to expell and remoue them, that the poore man shall neuer
hunger nor thirst againe: and only that, but also for euer
world without end, this poore man shall dwell and inherite, by
the mercy of his heauenly king, the ioyes euerlasting. And this
last Translation or Allegorie is in maner not only a repetition
of the first in other wordes, but also a declaration, and more
plaine opening of the Prophetes minde, what he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in this celestiall Hymne.</p>

him: wherfore he can lacke
nothing to liue a vertuous and
godly life. In this first part some
thinges are to be considered.
First, of God that fÃ©edeth: and
next of man that is fed. GOD
that fÃ©edeth, Dauid calleth by the name of a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
and his people he calleth by the name of shÃ©ep.
By this name of a shepheard, the Prophet openeth
and discloseth the nature of God to al his miserable
and lost creatures, that he is content, not onely to
wish and desire man that is lost, to be found and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
againe: but also doth sÃ©eke and trauell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
and bring him home againe: as it is written
in Esaie the Prophete,<note place="margin">Esaie. 40. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>He shall gather together his
lambes in his arme.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezech. 34.</note> And in Ezechiel the Prophet, the
Lorde saith, <hi>Behold, I will require my flocke of the
shepheards, &amp;c. And I will deliuer my flocke from
<pb facs="tcp:4397:7"/>
their mouth, and they shall be no more their meate:
for thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will search out my
sheepe, and will visite them as a shepheard doth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
his sheepe, when he is in the middest of his scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
shepe, so will I visite my shepe, and deliuer them
from all places whereas they haue bene scattered, &amp;c.</hi>
And Ieremie the Prophet in the same sorte,<note place="margin">Iere. 31.</note> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the nature of God towards the lost flocke, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>He that dispersed Israel shal gather him together
againe, and keepe him as the shepheard keepeth his
flocke.</hi> Christ our Sauiour nameth him selfe a good
shepheard,<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> and saith, that He was sent to call such
as were not shÃ©epe of the vtter marke and signe in
the world, to be his shÃ©epe. This nature of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
father sawe king Dauid, when he saide at the
beginning of this heauenly Hymne: <hi>The Lord fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he is assured of Gods mercifull nature,
that sÃ©eketh the lost shÃ©epe, he openeth further the
nature of God, what he wil do with the shÃ©ep, which
he findeth: fÃ©ede him (saith the Prophet Dauid,) and
putteth him selfe for an example. Here is the mercy
of the great shepheard further declared, that he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not his shÃ©epe, robbeth them not, but fÃ©edeth and
nourisheth them.<note place="margin">Ezech. 34.</note> Of this speaketh the Prophet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel,
in the person of almightie God: <hi>I my selfe
will feede my sheepe, and make that they shall rest
quietly, saith the Lord God. That which is lost I wil
seeke, such as goe astray I will bring againe, such as
be wounded I will binde vp, such as be weake I will
make strong, but such as be fat and strong those will
I roote out, and I will feede my sheepe in reason and
iudgement.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> And the great shepheard Christe saith,
whether his shÃ©epe goe in or out, they shall finde pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:4397:7"/>
After that this king hath opened in this Hymne,
that Gods nature is not only to sÃ©eke the lost shÃ©ep,
but also when he hath found him to fÃ©ede him, then
he addeth in his Hymne, after what sort he fÃ©edeth
him: <hi>So that I shal lacke nothing,</hi> saith the Prophet.
Here is the declaring of the great shepheards pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
wherwith he fÃ©edeth the flocke of his pasture.
Christ expresseth the same wonderfully, in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his office and doctrine vnto the world in S.
Iohn saying:<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 4. 6</note> 
                     <hi>I came that they might haue life, and
haue it most abundantly.</hi> And talking with the poore
woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> he told her y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the drink he would
giue her should be water of life. And to the <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naites</hi>
he said, that meate which he would giue them
should worke eternall saluation. As these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
be in God the shepheard, (as the Prophete hath
marked,) euen in the like sort be the contrarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
in man, the shÃ©epe he speaketh of: for as the
nature of God is to sÃ©eke, so is the nature of man to
go astray.<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> As the Prophete saith: <hi>I haue strayed like
a wandering sheepe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Esaie. 53.</note> And euen so doth Esaie write
of all mankind: <hi>All we haue erred</hi> (saith he) <hi>as shepe
going astray.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 9.</note> Christe our Sauiour also in S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe
doth bewayle the people of the worlde, that
stray as sheepe that had no shepheard. S. Peter like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
saith vnto his countrimen that he writeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<hi>Ye were as sheepe that went astray,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>but ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
now vnto the shepheard and pastoure of your
soules.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. 3. Reg 22.</note> And as the nature of man is to stray from
GOD, so is it likewise to fÃ©ede vpon all vnholsome
and infected pastures: to belÃ©eue euery false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
that can do nothing but lye. In the Prophete
Esaie the Lorde saith,<note place="margin">Esaie. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>The nature of sheepe is to be
deceiued, and their pastours to be dronke, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knowe nor see the pastures of the word of God.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4397:8"/>
And in the same Prophete, there is a most horrible
plague vpon man for sinne,<note place="margin">Esaie. 29</note> for, <hi>The pastours shal be
vnable to feede, and all the foode of life shall be as a
booke fast clasped and shut.</hi> This going astray and
fÃ©eding vpon euill pasture, is wonderfully set foorth
by Saint Paule:<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.</note> for when men will not fÃ©ede vpon
the truth, it is Gods iust iudgement they should fÃ©ed
vpon falshoode. And as Gods nature is not onely to
fÃ©ede, but fully to satisfie and to replenishe with all
goodnesse, so that nothing may lacke for a godly and
vertuous life:<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 6. 3.</note> in like manner, the nature of man is
not only to fÃ©ede, but also to replenish it selfe with all
infected &amp; contagious doctrine,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> vntill such time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he
despise and contemne God and al his holesome laws.
This we may sÃ©e in the holy Prophete Esaie:<note place="margin">Esaie. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>The
people (saith the Lorde) prouoketh me vnto anger, a
lying nation that will not heare the lawe of GOD,
they say to their Prophets, Prophesie not, looke not
out for vs things that be right, speake pleasant things
vnto vs, &amp;c.</hi> And this replenishing of man with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
pasture,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7.</note> is horribly set foorth in Sainte Iohn,
when the wicked priestes and Phariseis would not
belÃ©eue the shepheardes voyce Christe, no not their
owne seruaunts that tolde them the truth, nor yet
Nichodemus one of their own court and profession.
Thus in the first part of this celestial Hymne, is the
nature of God and man described, vnder the name of
a shepheard and of shÃ©epe.</p>
                  <p>Of this part of the Psalme,<note place="margin">What is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of this part of the psalme Rom. 19.</note> what the Prophete
hath saide of God and of man, we must for our owne
doctrine and learning, gather some thinges to be the
better by. For S. Paule saith, <hi>What so euer is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
is written for our learning.</hi> Two thinges we
learne of this first place: The one, a certeintie that
God hath the cure and charge of vs: and the other, a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4397:8"/>
consolation and comfort, that we &amp; all ours be vnder
his protection and gouernaunce. The first doctrine
to be certein and sure of Gods defence, and care ouer
vs, maketh vs constant and strong to suffer &amp; beare
all aduersities and troubles that God shall sende vs.
And the second doctrine shall cause vs patiently and
thankfully to beare our crosse, and to follow Christ.
Both these doctrines the Prophet Dauid expresseth
in the third and fourth verse of this Psalme: <hi>If I
should</hi> (saith he) <hi>trauel and passe through places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
and infected, where appeareth nothing but
the image and shadowe of death, or be compelled to
passe through the handes and tyrannie of mine eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
I wil not feare, for thou art with me (O GOD)
and defendest me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 91.</note> In the 91. Psalme, he setteth foorth
the assurance and felicitie of all them that put their
whole trust in the mercy of God, and therein also the
Prophet reckoneth vp a wonderfull sort of dangers,
and layeth them before the eyes of the faithfull, that
he may by the sight and knowledge of the daungers,
fixe and place the more constantly his faith and trust
in God, that hath the charge and cure of him: <hi>Hee
shal</hi> (saith he) <hi>defend vs from pestilence most infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue:
from fleeing arrowes in the day, &amp;c.</hi> By the
which the Prophet vnderstandeth all kinde of euils,
that may come vnto vs, by the meanes of the diuell,
or of wicked men. And these things the faithful shall
escape (saith the Prophet) bicause they say from their
hearts vnto GOD,<note place="margin">The assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and comfort in troubles; must bee lerned out of Gods word.</note> 
                     <hi>Quoniam tu es spes mea,</hi> that is to
say, <hi>For thou art my hope:</hi> euen as he saide in the
beginning of this Psalme, <hi>The Lorde feedeth me,
and I shall want nothing.</hi> Such certeintie and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Gods defence, and such consolation in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of this life, we must learne &amp; pray to haue out
of Gods word, or else it were as good neuer to heare
<pb facs="tcp:4397:9"/>
nor to reade it.</p>
                  <p>And from this first part of the Psalme, euery estate
of the world may learne wisedome and consolation.
If the Lorde fÃ©ede and gouerne him, he shall haue
God to his maister and teacher, that shall giue him
holesome and commodious doctrine, meete for the
state of the life he hath chosen to liue in this world.
For all that shall be saued in time to come, followe
not one kinde of life, Some be Magistrates and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
&amp; appointed to sÃ©e both the laws of the realme,
and the goodes and commodities thereof, to be vsed
and applyed to the vse and profit of such as be vnder
them. Some giue them selues to studie and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of heauenly and diuine things, not busying
them selues with trauels of the body, but to knowe
them selues the way of life, and to be teachers of the
same to others. Some be giuen to apply the lawes
of the Common wealth: some to exercise the trade
and course of merchandize: some one kinde of liuing,
and some an other. But of what art, facultie, science
or kinde of liuing so euer he be, that is not contrarie
to Gods honour or honestie, he may vse therein to
serue God, to obserue iustice, to exercise truth, kÃ©epe
temperance, and be acceptable to God, who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
lawes mÃ©ete and conuenient to Publicans and
Souldiers, seruants and maisters, parentes &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
husbandes and wiues, and so to all other: but
all these sortes of people must assuredly knowe, that
in euery of these vocations be more daungers, then
he that must liue in them is able to beare. Therfore
from the bottome of his heart, he must be assured of
this beginning of king Dauids Hymne: <hi>The Lord
feedeth me, and I shal lacke nothing.</hi> And in dÃ©ede the
Lorde hath not only saide, He will fÃ©ede and defende
him from all daungers, but also saith, He wil teach
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4397:9"/>
him howe to liue vertuously &amp; reuerently towards
God, and honestly and quietly towardes man, what
state or vocation so euer he choose to liue in, so it be
not against Gods lawes, and the lawe of nature.
So saith king Dauid:<note place="margin">Psal. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>God hath appointed a lawe
to rule and teach the man that feareth him, what soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
kind of liuing he appointeth him selfe to liue in.</hi>
What treasure is there to be compared vnto this,
that man is not onely fed and mainteined by God,
but also taught and instructed in euery craft and
science that he appointeth him selfe to liue in? Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
therefore is the man, that in the entrailes and
dÃ©epe cogitations of his hart, can say, belÃ©eue, &amp; fÃ©ele
this to be true, that Dauid saith: <hi>The Lorde ruleth
me, and careth for me, and I shall lacke nothing.</hi> But
yet there is almost nothing spoken, that this king
would haue chiefly knowne. Howbeit doubtlesse,
they be wonderfull things, that preserue and teache
all persons both men and women, in what so euer
kinde of liuing honestly they appoint themselues to
liue in. He him selfe knew this to be true right wel,
as it appeareth when he saith:<note place="margin">Psal. 144.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed be the Lorde
my strength, that taught my handes to battel.</hi> For if
the Lord had not taught and ruled him, he had bene
ouerthrowne many times, bycause there was not
onely more strength then he had of him selfe against
him: but also more wit, more policie, more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But what things can ouercom that man, that
is couered with this shielde, <hi>Dominus regit me, The
Lord ruleth me?</hi> Doubtlesse nothing at all, whether
it be in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, or in
hell vnder the earth. Notwithstanding, this is not
all that this doctrine, <hi>The Lord ruleth me,</hi> doth for
the poore shÃ©epe that is ruled. But here must the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and hearer of this Psalme followe king Dauid,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:10"/>
and desire to haue the eye of his minde purged and
made cleane: for if the scales of infidelitie, and the
loue and delight to sinne remaine, or else the minde
be otherwise occupied then vpon the vnderstanding
of the Hymne: he shall heare it, or sing it, as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Colleges of Priestes doe, that daily bo-o and
rore the holy Scriptures out of their mouthes, and
vnderstand no more the meaning thereof, then the
walles which they sing and speake vnto. We must
therfore do as king Dauid did, lift vp the eyes of our
mindes into heauen, and fire our faith (as he saith)
fast in the Lord:<note place="margin">Psalm. 25. 128.</note> and then shall we sÃ©e the vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
treasures and wisedome, that lyeth hid in this
meruellous and comfortable head and beginning of
this Psalme: <hi>The Lord feedeth me, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Sauiour Christ openeth plainely in Saint
Iohn, what it is to be the shÃ©epe of God, and to be
fed by him, and saith, <hi>They wil heare the shepheards
voyce, but no straungers voyce:</hi> and bycause they
heare the shepheards voyce, the shepheard will giue
them euerlasting life, and no man shall take them
out of the shepheards hands.<note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and spirituall comforte, treasurie, and riches, which this doctrine bringeth.</note> There is the greatest
treasure and most necessarie riches for the shÃ©epe of
God vttered, which is not the knowledge of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
to be preserued in this life, and to lacke nothing
that is expedient and necessarie for the preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof: but also to vnderstand, which wayes
the heauenly father teacheth and leadeth vs to the
mansion and dwelling place of life euerlasting.
And if man were wise, he might soone perceiue, how
much the life to come is better then the life present:
yea, be it neuer so fauourably fed and preserued by
the heauenly father our shepheard and gouernour.
For his tuition here of vs, although it be sure, and
so strong, that none can take vs out of his handes:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4397:10"/>
yet is our safegard and life troubled and mingled
with aduersities, subiect to persecution and also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death: but in the life to come, Gods tuition is all
ioy, all myrth, all solace, with all perpetuitie, and
endlesse felicitie. And of this treasure Dauid chiefly
meant in the forefront of the Psalme, when he said:
<hi>And I shal lacke nothing.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Peter. 4.</note> For as we sÃ©e (vntill this
life be taken from vs) most troubles and most care
beginneth and tarrieth in the house of GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
his shÃ©epe, whiche be as lambes among
woolues.<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> Wherefore, the voyce and teaching of the
shepheard, doth heale the mindes of the shÃ©epe, Gods
deare elect, and pulleth from them all vnprofitable
feare and carefulnesse: it quencheth all flames of
lust and concupiscence: it maketh and giueth a man
a noble and valiant minde, to contemne al worldly
things: it bringeth a man in loue with Gods true
honour, maketh him ioyfull in trouble, quiet in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie,
and sure that the end of Gods people shal be
glorious and ioyfull: and also that this fauour of
the shephearde shall be his guide into the place of
blisse, whereas be crownes of euerlasting glorie, for
such as haue bene led by the Lorde, and there they
shall lacke nothing. For there is neither eye can sÃ©e,
nor toung can speake, nor minde can comprehend
these ioyes and glorie. And therefore the Prophete
both constantly and chearefully saide: <hi>The Lorde
feedeth me, and I shal lacke nothing:</hi> for all thinges
of this world be but trifles, in comparison of things
to come. Although it be a singular fauour of God, to
vnderstand his goodnesse and mercie towards vs, in
things belonging to this life: yet is it not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the other, as Dauid wonderfully declareth
in the 25. Psal. When he hath numbred a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Gods benefites, which he doth bestow vpon his
<pb facs="tcp:4397:11"/>
poore seruants in this life, he in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one specially that passeth them all, in these
woordes, <hi>Arcanum Domini timentibus illum, &amp; tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamentum
suum manifestabit illis:</hi> That is to say, <hi>The
Lord openeth to suche as feare him his secretes, and
his testament, The Lorde openeth to his faithfull
seruaunt the mysteries and secretes of his pleasure,
and the knowledge of his lawes.</hi> And these treasures,
the knowledge and right vnderstanding of Gods
moste holie woorde, he sayth, was more swÃ©ete vnto
him, then honie or the honie combe, and more he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stÃ©emed
the vertue of it, then he did precious stones.
Of all giftes this was the principall, that God gaue
vnto him a right and true knowledge of him selfe:
Wherefore, it shall be moste expedient and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
for euerie Christian man, to labour, studie, and
pray, that he may earnestly, and with a faithfull
heart knowe him selfe to be no better, then a sÃ©elie
poore shÃ©epe, that hath nothing of him selfe, nor of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, to saue his bodie and soule: but onely the
mercie of his shÃ©epehearde, the heauenly father, and
to be assured also, that his only mercie and goodnesse
alone in Christ, and none other besides him, is able
to fÃ©ede him, so that he shall lacke nothing necessarie
in this life, nor in the life to come.</p>

                  <p>In this part of the Psalme be many things wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be noted. First, it is declared, that the life of
man consisteth in the foode of Gods word: then, that
<pb facs="tcp:4397:12"/>
there is none that giueth the same to be eaten, but
God our heauenly shepheard: the next, that none can
eate of this meate of Gods word, but such as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost fÃ©edeth with the word.<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> Our sauiour Christ
declareth, that <hi>Man liueth not by bread alone, but of
euery woord that proceedeth out of the mouthe of
God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">We can no more liue in GOD without GODS word, then in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foode. Iohn 6.</note> Whereby he teacheth vs, that as the body li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
by externall meates, so doeth the soule by the
word of God. And no more possible is it for a man
to liue in God without the word of God, then in the
world without the meate of the world. And S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confesseth the same. For when the <hi>Capernaites,</hi>
and many of Christes owne disciples had satisfied
their bodies with externall meates, they cared not
for their souls, neither could they abide to be fed nor
to heare the meate of the soule spoken of, althoughe
Christ did dresse it most holsomely with many godly
and swÃ©et words: they would not tarrie vntil Christ
had made that meate readie for them: they could be
contented to fÃ©ede their bellies with his meates, but
their soules they would not commit to his diet, but
departed as hungrie as they came, thorough their
owne follie. Christ was leading them from the fiue
barlie loaues and two fishes, wherwith they had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
their bellies, vnto the pleasaunt pastures of the
heauenly word, that shewed neither barlie loaues
nor fishe, but his owne pretious bloud and painefull
passion to be the meate of their soules: how be it, they
could not come in to this pasture, nor tast in any case
of the swÃ©et herbes and nourishment of their soules.
When Christ perceiued they would not be ledd into
this pleasaunt pasture, he let them goe whither they
would, and to fÃ©ede vppon what pasture they would,
And then he asked of his twelue that tarried, saying:
<hi>Will ye depart also?</hi> Peter, as one that had fedd both
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4397:12"/>
body and soule, as his fellowes had, perceiued that
the body was but halfe the man, and that bÃ©eing fed,
there was but halfe a man fedd, and also that such
meates as went into the mouth, satisfied no more
then the body, that the mouth was made for: he felt
moreouer, that his soule was fedd by Christes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
&amp; that the hunger of sinn, the ire of God, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of the lawe, and the demaund and claime of
the diuel, were quenched and taken away: he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
likewise, that the meat which brought this nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
was the heauenly doctrine that Christe
spake of, touching his death and passion: and he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode
also, that this meate passed not into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by the mouth, but into the soule by faith, and by
the presence of Gods spirite with his spirite, that the
body also should be partaker as wel of the grace that
was in it, as of the life. So that he felt himselfe not
onely to haue a body and a soule aliue, but also that
they were gratiously replenished with the pastures &amp;
food of Gods fauour. Wherefore he said vnto Christ,
<hi>To whom shal we go? thou hast the words of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
life.</hi> Which wordes in effecte sound no other
thing then this Psalme doeth, where Dauid saith:
<hi>The Lord feedeth me and I shal want nothing, for he
leadeth mee into his pleasant pastures, and pastureth
mee by the riuers side.</hi> Wherein it appeareth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly,
that the word of God is the life of the soule.</p>
                  <p>The Prophete Dauid doeth meruellously open
this thing, in the repeating so many times the word
of God, in a Psalme worthie much reading, and
more marking of the thinges conteyned therein. For
he intreateth all the Psalme thorough, that a godly
life doeth consist in the obseruation of Gods lawes,
and therefore doth he so many times in the Psalme,<note place="margin">Psalm 119.</note>
pray God to illuminate and indue his spirite and
<pb facs="tcp:4397:13"/>
hearte with these two vertues, Knowledge and
Loue of his word, wherewith he may both knowe
howe to serue God, and at all times to be acceptable
vnto him. And our sauiour Christ himselfe in Saint
Luke saith vnto a woman,<note place="margin">Luke 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed be they that heare
the word of God and kepe it.</hi> And in S. Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> Christ
exhorteth all men to the reading and exercising of the
Scripture.<note place="margin">And yet our blinde guids say, that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of godlines. Amos. 8.</note> For the ignorance of Gods word brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
with it a murren and rott of the soule: yet for
the sinnes of the people, God said, He would sende a
hunger and famine amongst men, not a hunger of
bread nor water, but of hearing Gods word. King
Dauid therefore, as one assured both of the Authour
of life, &amp; also of the foode wherewith the life is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned,
stayeth himselfe with Gods benediction and
fauour, that he is assured God fÃ©edeth him with his
word. And he sheweth also that none is the authour
of this word, neither can any giue it, but God alone.
For when the first fall of Adam and Eue by eating
forbidden meates, had poysoned &amp; infected both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and soule with sinne and Gods displeasure, so that
he was destitute both of Gods fauour &amp; wisedome:
none but God could tell him where remedie and help
lay, nor yet could any deliuer him the help but God.
For till God made promise that the sÃ©ed of a woman
should make whole, and saue that which the diuel
and man had made sicke and lost, by reason of sinne,
and also made open the remedie vnto Adam, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
his heart to belÃ©eue the remedie: Adam was
dead in sinne and vtterly cast away. Then the pittie
of the heauenly shÃ©epheard said, He should notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in time be brought into the same pasture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<note place="margin">Iohn. 10.</note> and none should deceiue him, nor bring him
any more out of the pastures of life.</p>
                  <p>But onely God gaue this meate, which was his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4397:13"/>
holy word and promise,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> and also the mouth of fayth
to eate these promises of Gods onely gift. And the
same appeareth throughout the whole Bible, that
onely God, by sending of his worde and preachers,
brought knowledge of euerlasting life, to the people
that were in ignoraunce. As Saint Paule sayth:<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note>
                     <hi>God before time spake vnto our fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and in these latter dayes vnto vs, by his sonne,
and after the ascension of his sonne, by his Apostles
and Euangelistes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> in so much that none of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes-euer
spake of Gods worde, that mainteined
the life of the soule, otherwise then they receiued it
of the high shepheard, almightie God, as Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
saith:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.</note> Prophesie came not by the wil of man, but
the holy men of God spake as they were taught by
the holy Ghost. So that God is the onely authour
and founteine of his true word,<note place="margin">Iames. 1.</note> the foode of all mens
soules. In like manner, he is the onely giuer of the
same: as he is the giuer of it, and none but him selfe:
so none can eate it, but such as haue the same deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto them by the holy Ghost. So our Sauiour
Christ likewise in the Gospell of Saint Iohn telleth
Nichodemus,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> that it was not possible to vnderstand
and to knowe the grace of redemption, except he
were borne from aboue. And when Saint Paule
preached the worde of God at Philippos, amongest
the women by the water side, the Lorde opened the
heart of Lidia, to vnderstande the things spoken of
by Paule.<note place="margin">Actes. 16.</note> And when Christe preached among the
Iewes, and wrought wonderfull miracles, yet they
vnderstoode nothing, neither were they anything
the better. And Christe sheweth the cause, <hi>ProptereÃ 
vos non auditis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>quia ex Deo non estis,</hi> that is to say,
<hi>Therefore ye heare not, bicause ye be not of GOD.</hi>
But the fault was not in God, but in the obstinacie
<pb facs="tcp:4397:14"/>
and frowardnesse of their owne heartes, as ye may
sÃ©e in Saint Matthewe.<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> Christ offered him selfe, but
yet the malice of man rebelled at all times. Sainte
Paule to the Corinthians wonderfully setteth foorth
mans vnablenesse,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> and saith: <hi>The naturall man is
not able to comprehend the thinges that be of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note>
And in Saint Iohn, Christ saith, <hi>No man can come
vnto him, except the heauenly father drawe him, for
they must be all taught of God.</hi> Nowe as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
sawe these things for him selfe and his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Gods worde: euen so must euery Christian
man take hÃ©ede, that he learne the same doctrine, or
else it were no commoditie to haue the scripture of
God deliuered and taught vnto vs. And euery rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and hearer must learn of this Psalme, that there
is none other foode nor meate for the soule, but Gods
word, And who so euer doe refuse it, when it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or preached: or when they knowe the truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
doe yet of malice, feare, lucre and gaine of the
world, or any other way repugne it, they be vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of al mercy and forgiuenesse. Let euery man and
woman therefore examine their owne conscience,
without flattering of them selues, and they shal find
that the most part of this realme of England in the
time of our holy and blessed king Edward the sixt,
were fed with this holy foode of Gods worde, or else
might haue bene fed with it. For it was offered and
sent vnto them, as well by most godly statutes and
lawes of Parleament, as by many Noble men, and
vertuous learned Preachers. If they fed not vpon
it accordingly, or now their tÃ©eth stand on edge, and
their stomachs be cloyed with it, to their perill be it.
Thus Christ saith:<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>They haue nothing wherby iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to excuse them selues of their sin.</hi> And likewise he
faith, that <hi>Whosoeuer hateth him, hateth also his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:4397:14"/>
By which words it appeareth manifestly, that
no man can hate Christes doctrine, but he must hate
Christe him selfe: and no man can hate Christe, but
he must also hate the father of heauen. Wherefore,
it is expedient for euery man to marke such places.
For it was not Christes name, nor Christes person,
that the Iewes hated so mortally Christe for: but
they hated him to death for his doctrine sake, and
it was Christes doctrine that condemned the world,
and shewed the life and learning of the worlde to be
euill,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> and could not abide the light of Gods worde,
and therefore in no case they could abide to heare of
it: as ye sÃ©e the like in his poore Preachers.<note place="margin">Mark whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of God are contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the world.</note> For his
wordes sake they be lesse passed of, then dogges or
brute beastes: for they be hated to death, and more
fauour doeth Barrabas the murtherer finde, then
Peter the preacher of Christe, that would leade the
flocke redÃ©emed with Christes pretious bloud, into
the pastures of Gods word with the Prophete Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid:
and yet in this hatred of Gods worde the foode
of Gods shÃ©epe, they would be sÃ©ene, and none but
they, to loue and honour God, but it is not so in their
heartes: for they haue a contempt of God, as their
fruites well declare. And Christe saith, <hi>They hate
both him and his father, yea, and that without cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thou (Christian reader) sÃ©e thou fÃ©ede thy<note place="margin">Psal. 35.</note>
soule with no other meate,<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> then with the holesome
pastures of Gods word, what so euer the world shal
say or doe.<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.</note> Looke vppon this text of Saint Iohn:
<hi>When the comforter shall come, whome I shall send
from my father, euen the spirit of trueth, which doth
proceede from the father, he shall testifie and beare
recorde of me.</hi> Weigh that place, and thinke,
wherefore the sonne of man referred him selfe to
the witnesse of the holy Ghoste, and ye shall knowe,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:15"/>
that it was for no vntruth that was in the authour
being Christe, or in the doctrine that he preached:
but only to make the disciples to be of good comfort,
and that they should not estÃ©eme the Gospel he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vnto them any thing the lesse, although it had
many aduersaries and enimies, and was spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
in maner euery where: for against the furie
and false iudgement of the world that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>temned the
Gospell, they should haue the testimonie of the holy
Ghoste, to allowe and warrant the Gospell. Let vs
therfore pray to the heauenly shepheard, that he will
giue vs his holy spirit, to testifie for the word of God
the only foode of our soules, that it is true that God
saith, and onely good that he appointeth to fÃ©ede vs.
And this we may be assured of, that in this heauie
and sorrowfull time, there is nothing can testifie for
the truth of Gods word, and kÃ©epe vs in the pleasant
pasture thereof, but the very spirite of God, whiche
we must set against all the tumults and daungers
of the world. For if we make this veritie of GOD
subiect to the iudgement of the world, our faith shall
quaile and faint euery houre as mens iudgements
varie. Wherefore, let vs pray to haue alwayes in
vs the spirite of adoption, whereby when our faith
shall be assaulted, we may cry, <hi>Father, father,</hi> and the
same helpe for the maintenaunce of trueth, God
promised by his holy Prophete Esaie, saying:<note place="margin">Esaie. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>This

wherein is conteined all iustice, trueth, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Here is to be noted, what degrÃ©es and orders
the Lord and heauenly shepheard doth vse, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his shÃ©epe vnto the pasture of life. First, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth
the man that is gone astray, by his wicked
wayes and sinnefull maner of liuing. If he were an
Infidel, he bringeth him first to knowe, fÃ©ele, and
hate his infidelitie, and afterwardes to a true faith.
If he be a persecuter, he sheweth him first his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,

he be a sinful man that liueth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>trarie to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

teacheth in Saint Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> where he saith:
<hi>The holy Ghost, when he commeth, shall rebuke the
world of sinne, iustice, and iudgement.</hi> By the which
wordes he declareth, that the faithfull of God, can
not profite in the Gospell of Christ, neither loue nor
exercise iustice and vertue, except they be taught, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4397:16"/>
made to fÃ©ele the burthen and daunger of sinne, and
be brought to humble them selues, as men that be
of them selues nothing but sinne. And therefore the
lawe and threatenings of God be verie wholesome,
whose nature and propertie is to cite and call mens
conscience vnto the iudgment of God, and to wound
the spirite of man with terrour and feare. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Christe vseth a wonderfull way, and teacheth
the same vnto his Apostles, that neither him selfe
for that present time, nor they in time to come,
could preach profitably the Gospell, wherewith men
are led into the swÃ©ete and pleasant fieldes of Gods
promises by his word, except they vse this order: to
leade them from sinne to iustice, and from death to
life. And as iustice and life commeth by Christe,
shewed vnto vs in his bitter passion,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce that feeleth the sting of death by sinn, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth for life.</note> death, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Prophet, when he saide: <hi>The Lorde conuerteth my

This is a wonderfull sentence, and much and dÃ©epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be considered and weighed of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

Dauid. He fÃ©eleth in him selfe, that as long as
the diuell and sinne haue the rule and kingdome
in man, the soule of man being Gods creature, is
deformed, foule, horrible, and so troubled, that it is
like vnto all things, more then vnto God and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
whervnto it was created: but when the wicked

                  <p>Oh that we would, in the glasse of Gods worde,
looke vpon our owne soules, when they be in the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
of the diuell, vnder the kingdome of sinne, as

withall, then if we should for all our life
time, be put into sties with hogges, and alwayes

But sÃ©e howe the heauenly shepheard behelde from

to suche dishonour to be coupled and matched with

                  </p>
                  <p>It is but a follie for a man to flatter himselfe, as
though he were a Christian man, when his hart and
soule is not turned vnto the Lord. He shal neuer fÃ©ed
in the pastures of life, but be an hypocrite all the
days of his life, as the most part of the world be that
professe Christes name at this present day. They say
they be conuerted from the world to God, when there
is nothing within the pastures of Gods word, but
that they wil contemne rather, then to haue as much
as an euil looke of the world for it. They say they be
conuerted to God, when they be contented with the
world to honour that for God, that is but bread and
wine in the matter and substance, as the scripture of
God, and the holy Church of Christ haue taught and
belÃ©eued, these thousand and fiue hundreth yeares
and more. Oh Lord, be these men turned to thÃ©e? Be

doubtlesse, for they be not turned to thÃ©e, but from
thÃ©e, &amp; be not with thÃ©e, but against thÃ©e. They speak
with thÃ©e, and yet their dÃ©edes dishonour thÃ©e, they
talke of trueth and practise lies. What (good Lord)
shall thy simple &amp; poore vnlearned shÃ©epe do? Where
shall they sÃ©eke thy trueth? For the shÃ©epeheards say
and sing this Psalme euery wÃ©eke, and at euery di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rige
for the dead, and yet they be not conuerted in
their spirits to thÃ©e, that thou mightest lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the pathes of righteousnes. But (Lord) there is no
<pb facs="tcp:4397:18"/>
man nowe (in manner) that dare accuse them: they
destroy themselues and thy shÃ©epe, and no man can
be suffered with Gods word to remedie it. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
(good Lord) although in this world none
may accuse them, yet they in the world to come shal
haue king Dauid (whose Psalmes they daily reade,
and in whom they most glorie,) to accuse them, both
of heresie and blasphemie: as Moses shall accuse the
wicked Iewes, whome they most glorie of. For as
the Iewes read the scripture of Moses, and yet were
neuer the better: so these priests of Antichrist reade
the holy scripture, &amp; yet neither the people, nor they
themselues, are any thing the better. And in this
they passe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abhomination of the Iewes &amp; Turkes:
for they were, and yet be content, that their bookes
of religion shal be vsed in their churches in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
and common tongue: but these enimies of God
and man, would not haue the word that God hath
appointed for all mens saluation, to be vsed in any
tongue but in the Latine.</p>
                  <p>The God therefore of peace, that brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
from death to life, the great shÃ©epheard of the
shÃ©epe, by the bloud of the euerlasting testament, our
Lord Iesus Christ, conuert the soules and heartes
of all those, that cause the shÃ©epe of God thus to eate
and fÃ©ed vppon the carrine and infected pastures of
mens traditions. Amen.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, as king Dauid in this text hath wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
set foorth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miserable nature of al Gods shÃ©epe,
and put himself for an example, that the nature and
condition of all men is corrupt, wicked, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
so that it cannot be partaker of Gods benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and euerlasting grace, except it be borne a newe,
amended, restored, and instructed: so likewise he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
that none conuerteth the soule of man, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4397:18"/>
the heauenly father the great shÃ©epeheard, that both
sÃ©eth the loste state of his shÃ©epe, and willeth of his
mercie the saluation and calling of the shÃ©epe home
againe: and then he procÃ©edeth further, and sheweth
what the heauenly shÃ©epeheard will doe with his
shÃ©epe. He saith, <hi>Hee will lead them into the pathes
of iustice.</hi> Wherein the Prophete declareth, that it
is not onely God that conuerteth the man from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
but also he alone that kÃ©epeth him in goodnes
and vertue. And therein is shewed a wonderfull
miserie and wretchednesse in the soule and body of
man, that can neither beginne nor yet continue in a
life acceptable vnto God, except that GOD wholy
worketh the same himselfe.</p>
                  <p>And as it declareth the wonderfull wretchednes
of man, so doeth it manifest and set foorth a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and vnspeakeable mercie and compassion of God
towardes man, that so meruellously and gratious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he canne be content to helpe and saue his enimie
and very aduersarie. But herein is required of
as many as the Lorde conuerseth from iniquitie
and sinnefull liuing, that they walke in the same
lawe, and vse their conuersation in equitie and
iustice, as it bÃ©ecommeth obedient men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
redÃ©emed with the shÃ©epeheardes most preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bloud.</p>
                  <p>For the Lord doth not teach his shÃ©epe the truth,
that they should liue in falsehood: neither giueth he
them the remission of their sinnes, that they should
returne to the same againe: but because they should
studiously applie and diligently exercise themselues
in vertuous woorks,<note place="margin">Psalme. 1.</note> to the honor of almightie God.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note>
There be two sortes of people that the Lorde will
iudge and punish in the latter day, with extreme ire
and iustice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4397:19"/>
The one sort be called vpon to learne the knowledge
of God and of Gods honour, as Gods word comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:
but they will not heare, nor obey the calling,
but knowe God and learne God, as the custome and
maner of the world is to know him and learne him,
though it be neuer so farre from the trueth. And the
other sort be contented to heare and learne to knowe
God, and to serue him as he teacheth in his holy and
most pure word, but in their heartes consent not to
their knowledge: but contrary to it they do outward
seruice to a false God, and frame their conuersation,
both in religion toward God,<note place="margin">Woefull are these dayes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> in so cleare lighte of the trueth, the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are so faithlesse and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.

                  <p>Esaie the Prophet speaketh against the first sort
of men, that will not heare when they be called, nor
learne when they be taught, and saith: <hi>When other
men shall laughe, they shall weepe: when other bee

shalbe sicke: when other men shal liue, they shall die:
and when other men reioyce in mirthe, they shall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

For,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord hath stretched forth his hand alwayes
to a rebellious and obstinate people, that will not
learne nor knowe his holy will.</hi> Againe, the other sort
that knowe and haue learned the Lordes will and
pleasure, and yet prepare not themselues to doe his
will,<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> shall be beaten with many stripes (saith our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ.) And the Lord in S. Matthewe doeth
wonderfully charge both such as ignorantly doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
and those that doe with knowledge offend, those
also that be called vppon to amendment in faith and
charitie, and those that be not called vppon by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the trueth, and saith: <hi>The greater damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4397:19"/>
is vppon such as know or might knowe, or els
when they do knowe, they be nothing the better for
their knowledge.</hi> He putteth foorth there foure cities,
<hi>Chorozaim</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida, Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon:</hi> two of
them many times admonished by Christ to amend:
the other two not so called vppon, neuerthelesse both
of them the Lord will iudge, but most seuerely such
as neglect the word of God when it is offered. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
it is not ynough for a man to hearken or heare,
read or learne Gods word, but he must be ruled by
Gods word, frame his whole life after Gods word,
and before all things auoyd idolatrie by Gods word:
as king Dauid saith in this Psalme, that The Lord
did not onely conuert his soule, but brought him into
the pathes of iustice.</p>
                  <p>Let euery man and woman therfore thinke with
themselues, what knowledge they haue receiued of
God: for he that hath receiued most, shall make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt

and in case they knowe nothing at all, and be neuer
the better for all the preaching of the Lordes word,
let them take hÃ©ede what persons they be, and in
what place they haue dwelled. In case their pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was such, that they could not heare, and their
dwelling where as was no preaching at all: yet be
they vnder the iudgement and damnation of God,
because they knowe not, as <hi>Tire</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> were. If
they were of such state, as they might haue come if
they would, and had preachers to tel them the truth,
in case they would haue heard the trueth, such men
and women shall be the more in daunger of Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
and iust iudgement.<note place="margin">GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth not only a compt of that hath beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but of that might haue bene receiued.</note> For God doth not onely

<pb facs="tcp:4397:20"/>
of them, that might haue learned the thing,
that either willingly or obstinately they refused to

God will as well take an accompt of him that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

and leadeth mee by the riuers side, hee turneth my
soule, and conducteth mee into the way and pathe of
iustice for his names sake, and for his mercies sake.</hi>
He sawe the diuel, the world, his flesh, and sinne, all
conquered by the power of God, and for his names
sake brought both to liue, &amp; also vertuously to liue,
to his honour that gaue the life, and to his owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
that receiued the life.</p>
                  <p>All our teaching a great many of yeares, and also
your whole labours, haue bÃ©ene chiefly to knowe the
miserie of man, and the mercie of Almightie God.
Wherefore, it shal not nÃ©ed long to tarrie in opening
of this place of the Psalme: for ye be riche in God in
these 2. points, God giue you grace wel to vse them.
Yet in any case we must remember, that our soules
be turned from sinne, &amp; we accepted as the people of
<pb facs="tcp:4397:21"/>
euerlasting life, only for Gods mercies sake. So doth
king Dauid wonderfully open vnto vs in the 32.
Psalme, where he saith, <hi>Blessed be they whose sinnes
are forgiuen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>and whose transgressions be couered:
blessed is the man to whome the Lord imputeth not
his sinne.</hi> Of the which wordes we learne, that the
godly king called those happie and blessed, not that
be cleane and pure without sinne, (for there is no
such man in this life:) but those be blessed, whose
sinnes the mercie of God forgiueth: and they be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such, as vnfeignedly acknowledge their sinne, and
stedfastly from their heartes beleeue, that the death
and passion of Iesus Christ is the onely expiation
and purging thereof: as S. Paule wonderfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth
Dauids woordes in his Epistle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.
As the Prophete by these wordes, (<hi>For his
names sake,</hi>)<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> declareth, that there is nothing in him,
nor in any other man, wherefore God should turne
the soule of man from death to life, from errour to
trueth, from the hatred of God to Gods loue, from
wandring a stray to a stablished continuance in the
veritie of Gods word, but only Gods mercie: so doth
he in other of his Psalmes always, when he intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of Gods mercie &amp; of mans sinne, set foorth man
so naked and vile, as a thing most destitute of all
health and saluation, and sheweth that none of these
giftes, remission of sinne, acceptation into Gods loue
and fauour, pasturing of them with his most blessed
word, can happen vnto any other, sauing vnto such
as do knowe, and earnestly confesse, that they be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and infected with many contagious &amp; daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
infirmities, And therfore he sayth in the 2. verse
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> psalme aboue mentioned, <hi>Blessed is he to whom
the Lord imputeth no sinne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalme. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; in whose spirite there
is no guile.</hi> For there is no greater guile, nor more
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4397:21"/>
danger in man, then to think himself to be somwhat,
when he is nothing in dÃ©ede: or else to thinke him
selfe to be of such puritie of minde, as though he nÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not this frÃ©e remission and fauour of God. And
as there is nothing more proude and arrogant, then
such a minde: so there is nothing in man more detes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and miserable. Of the contrarie part, they be
blessed that hunger and thirst for iustice:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> for, <hi>God
filleth the hungrie with good thinges,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>but the proud
he sendeth away emptie.</hi> And that knewe this holie
Prophete right well, that it was humilitie and
the casting downe of him selfe that was most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
vnto God, and the sÃ©eking of health and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
onely for his names sake, that is to say,
for his mercie promised in the death and passion of
his onely sonne our Sauiour Christe. In the end of
the .xxxij. psalme, king Dauid that had thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himselfe,<note place="margin">Psal. 32.</note> bringeth in God that speaketh vnto
him, whiles he is thus making his complaint of his
corrupt nature and sinneful life, saying in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>Intellectum tibi dabo, &amp;c.</hi> that is to say, I <hi>will giue
thee vnderstanding, &amp; instruct thee in the way thou
shalt goe, and will haue mine eyes euer vppon thee.</hi>
Wherein he declareth, that suche humbled men and
lowly persons, as knowe their iniquitie, shall haue
vnderstanding of God, and shall not swarue from
the right wayes: not for their dÃ©edes and their deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges,
but for his mercie that vouchsafeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
&amp; teach them. And so likewise doeth this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
king shew in this Psalme: <hi>The Lorde ruleth me
and I lacke nothing, he feedeth me in sweet pastures
and leadeth me by the riuers side, he turneth my
soule, and bringeth me into the pathes of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and all for his names sake.</hi> When he hath ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the saluation of man, and also the cause thereof,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:22"/>
and wherein it consisteth: he procÃ©edeth to the fifte

do to him, that hath God the authour
of all life with him? Or what can the tyrannie

                  <p>In this fifte part, King Dauid sheweth, howe the
Lord God doeth exercise his shÃ©epe, whom he fÃ©edeth
with his blessed worde, in daungers and troubles: &amp;
also how he will defende them in the middest of their
troubles, what so euer they be. In the first wordes of
the fift part of this sacred and holy Hymne, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
declareth that the life of Gods shÃ©epe and people
in this worlde, can not be without daungers and
troubles. Therefore Christ sayeth, that <hi>He came to
put fire in the worlde, and that the same fire should
burne,</hi> meaning that he came to preache suche a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
as shoulde moue dissention and discorde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twÃ©ene

and sette them at debate. Not that his worde is a
learning or doctrine of dissention and discorde of it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4397:22"/>
selfe, but that by the malice of men, that can not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
to be rebuked by the worde of God, they will be
alwayes at discorde and variaunce with the worde
of God,<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> and with any friende or foe that teacheth it.
And the same doeth Christ our heauenly shÃ©epeheard
shewe vs,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. 8. 9. 10. 16.</note> both in his doctrine and in his life, who
was hated and troubled more then any man before
or sithens his time,<note place="margin">The crosse is the sure badge of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> and assureth all his to haue trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in this world, yea and death also. But it forceth
not, for he sayth, <hi>I haue ouercome the worlde.</hi> And
whatsoeuer the dangers bÃ©e, and howe horrible soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they sÃ©eme,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> Christe being with vs, we nÃ©ede not
to feare. Therefore in this pointe the prophete cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
the foolish opinion of man, that woulde liue as
one of the shÃ©epe of God in this world without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
It is contrarie both to the person that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
God, and also to the religion that he is professed
vnto, for in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde both shall be (as Christ sayth)
hated:) of which hatred commeth persecution and
troubles, so that the people of God shal, whether they
will or will not, passe through many daungers, and
no lesse perillous then the shadowes, and verie i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of death, as here King Dauid sheweth in this
wholesome and blessed Hymne.</p>
                  <p>And as he sÃ©eth right well, that the state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Gods people and shÃ©epe, is to be troubled
for Christe and his worde:<note place="margin">Zachar. 11.</note> euen so did Zacharie the
prophet speake of Christe and his people,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> howe that
not onely the shÃ©epe should be troubled and scattered
abroade, but also the shÃ©epehearde should be stricken
with the sworde, that both shÃ©epe and shÃ©epehearde
shoulde be condemned in this worlde. But nowe, as
Dauid and Zacharie declare, that the life and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christe and his shÃ©epe be troublous in the
world: so do they both declare, that whatsoeuer the
<pb facs="tcp:4397:23"/>
troubles be, they be both knowen and appointed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
whom they shall fall, and in what time they shal
trouble the shÃ©epe of God: so that they can come no
sooner then God appointeth, nor do any more harme
then the heauenly shÃ©epeheard shall appoint them to
do. And this we may sÃ©e and learne as wel in Christ,
as in his shÃ©epe. Howe many times did the Priestes
and Phariseis conspire Christes death? Yet because
his time was not come, they had not their purpose:
but when the time of God was come, Christ said to
his shÃ©epe: <hi>Ye shalbe all troubled this night for my
cause,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 18.</note> 
                     <hi>for the sheepeheard shall bee stricken, and the
sheepe shalbe scattered abroade.</hi> Then, as God had
appointed the time, it could be no longer deferred.
And because they should not misse of him, whose
death they sought, he came and met them and offered
himselfe vnto them, and said, that He was the same
man Iesus of Nazareth, whom they sought. And
when they had taken him, and vsed as much crueltie
towards him, as their wicked malice and diuellishe
hatred could deuise, they killed him, and made him to
passe not onely the shadowe and image of death, but
also death it selfe.<note place="margin">Matth. 27</note> They thought then they had him
where as they would,<note place="margin">Marke. 15</note> and said, <hi>He hath saued other,
let him now saue himselfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 23.</note> 
                     <hi>if he can.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was layed in the graue with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,<note place="margin">Iohn 19.</note>
they thought to execute their plagues and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
towardes him being dead, purposing that as
they had brought him to death and killed him: so
likewise they woulde kÃ©epe him downe still, that
he shoulde neuer sÃ©e life againe, but rotte in the
earth like a wretche, vntill wormes had eaten him.
And for the performance of this purpose, to doe all
their whole willes to the vttermost, they came to
Pilate and said, that The deceiuer of the people that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4397:23"/>
lay in the graue, made his bost whiles he was aliue,
that the third day after his death he would rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
but if it should be so, it would be worse with
them after, then it was before. Appoint therefore
souldiers (said they) and watchmen to kÃ©epe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
till the thirde daye be past.<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> Whiles they
yet minded to lay as much euil and contempt vppon
Christ our shÃ©epheard, as they ment vnto him, came
the heauenly father, that suffereth no more ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
to fall vpon his, nor will suffer them to continue
any longer then him pleaseth, with this inhibition
and stay of further procÃ©edings in dishonouring and
persecuting his onely sonne, and said: <hi>I am redijt lux
tertia, surge sepulte meus,</hi> That is as much to say,
<hi>Nowe is come the thirde day, arise mine owne deare
sonne buried.</hi> And then was the sorrowe &amp; contempt
of this our persecuted shÃ©epeheard not onely ended,
but also turned into endlesse &amp; vnspeakable ioyes: he
passed with his forefather Dauid most bitter paines
and also most vile death, but he feared not because
God was with him.<note place="margin">A doctrine of Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Psalme 2.</note> The same appointment also
hath the heauenly father made with al dangers and
troubles that shall happen vnto vs his poore and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
shÃ©epe, taken daily (as it were to the shambles)
to suffer what Gods enimies can deuise. But the
heauenly shÃ©epeheard doth sÃ©e all their doings out of
heauen, and mocketh them to scorne: for they shall
neuer do as much as they would, against Christ and
his people, but as much as God will suffer them.
Dauid afterwardes in his 37. Psalme, teacheth vs
the same with meruellous woordes and diuine sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences:
<hi>Commite Domino viam tuam, &amp; spera in eum
&amp;c. Laye</hi> (saith he) <hi>thy care vppon the Lord, and trust
in him, and he shall helpe thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is most necessarie therefore for euery troubled
<pb facs="tcp:4397:24"/>
man, to knowe in his minde, and fÃ©ele in his heart,
that there are no troubles that happen vnto man,
whatsoeuer they be, come they by chaunce or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
as many men say and thinke, but that they
come by the prouidence of God: yea, the very winds
of the aire, tempestes in the cloudes, trembling of
the earth, rages in the sea, or any other that come,
howe soudaine or howe vnlooked for soeuer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:
as ye may read in the 29. Psalme of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete,
wherein be wonderfull tempestes,<note place="margin">Psalme. 29</note> and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
thinges spoken of, as well done in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as vppon the drie land.</p>
                  <p>But here (alas) is our nature and knowledge
much to be lamented and complained vppon: for as
the knowledge we haue of Gods fauour and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
towardes vs in Christ, (for the most part) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in the vnderstanding of the minde, and talke
with the mouth, but the vertue, strength and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same fauour of God is not sealed in our
heartes and consciences: euen so be the troubles and
aduersities,<note place="margin">The cause why there be so fewe sincere and true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</note> which God threateneth for sinne, spoken
and talked of with the tongue, and knowen in the
minde, but they be not earnestly nor fÃ©elingly sealed
in our conscience and heart. And of this commeth
it, that we neither loue God, nor reioyce in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
as we ought to doe, when we heare or read
them, neither yet hate sinne, nor be sorrowfull for
Gods displeasure, as sinne and Gods displeasure
should be sorrowed and mourned for of Christian
men. Hereof also commeth it, (dearely beloued) that
we loue no further, then in knowledge and tongue,
nor hate vice but in knowledge and tongue. But
(alas) how miserable is this our state and condition,
that knoweth neither life nor death, vertue nor vice,
trueth nor falsehood, God nor the diuel, heauen nor
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4397:24"/>
hell, but halfe as much as they ought of Christian
men to be knowen? Read you therefore and marke
the 37. Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 37.</note> and you shall knowe, that it is not
ynough for Christian men, to vnderstand and speake
of vertue and vice, but that the vertue must be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the conscience and loued, and the vice kept out
of the conscience and hated, as Dauid saith: <hi>Leaue
doing of euill and doe good.</hi> So like wise he speaketh
of a fÃ©eling Christian man, whose conscience hath
tasted howe swÃ©ete and amiable God is. <hi>Taste and
feele</hi> (saith the Prophete) <hi>howe sweete the Lord is.</hi>
And this assure your selues, that when ye fÃ©ele your
sinnes, and bewaile the daunger and damnation of
them, the spirite of God hath wrought that fÃ©eling,<note place="margin">Psal. 53.</note>
And that troubled and broken heart God wil not des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise.
And there is no doubt nor mistrust of a sensible
and fÃ©eling sinner:<note place="margin">Here is thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort thou bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken harted and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Lord.</note> but in case he can finde in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
no loue to the obedience of God, nor desire to do
his will by hearing of his word, nor any fÃ©eling at
all of sinne, nor desire to be ridde from it by hearing
of the lawe: he hath knowledge in the minde, and
speache in the mouth: but no consent and fÃ©eling in
his heart and conscience. And this knowledge liueth
with sinne, and speaketh with vertue: whereas the
heart &amp; conscience consenteth to good, and abhorreth
euil, if the vertue &amp; nature of Gods woord by Gods
spirite be sealed in the conscience. And this doth S.
Paule teach wonderfully, as wel by faith, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by hearing of Gods woord, as also of his preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Supper, the Sacrament of his bodie and bloud
and passion.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> He saith, that <hi>The heart beleeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>th to
righteousnesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What it is to beleeue vnto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.</note> that is to say, The conscience and
heart of him that is sealed, and assured of the vertue
and grace of Gods premises in Christ, belÃ©eueth to
righteousnesse, or is ascerteined and knoweth it selfe
<pb facs="tcp:4397:25"/>
to be righteous and iust and before God, because it hath
consented, and receiued the mercie of God offered in
the Gospel thorough the merites of Christ: and then
the same faith,<note place="margin">Faith sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led once in the heart with the assurance of Gods mercy, can bee no more with out the fruite of wel doing, then fire without heate.</note> which God hath sealed in the heart,
breaketh foorth by confession, whiche confession is a
very fruite of faith to saluation, as it is written by
S. Paule in the same place. And where this faith is
so kindled in the heart, there can be none other but
such a fruite following it. And as possible it is to
haue fire without heate or flame, as this vertue,
Faith, without the fruite of well doing. And that is
it that S. Paule saith to the Corinthians: <hi>As often
as ye eate of this bread and drinke of this cupp, shew
ye the Lordes death vntill he come.</hi> Wherein Saint
Paule requireth a knowledge of Christ in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
not onely in his minde that he knowe Christ
died for his sinne, and the sinne of the world, and to
speake and declare the same death with his tongue
vnto others: but this is the chiefest and most princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
commoditie of Christes holy Supper, (whiche
men nowe vngodly call the Masse,) that the vertue
and benefite of Christes death, as it is appointed for
the remission of his sinnes,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> be sealed and fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
vnto in his conscience. And this knowledge
of Christes death,<note place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> right knowlege &amp; assured sense of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cie are ioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, note what they worke.</note> with the assurance of the vertue,
strengthe and power thereof in the heart, will and
ought to inflame vs to thankesgiuing, and to preach
and teach vnto others those commodities of Christs
death, that we knowe and fÃ©ele first in our selues
within our owne spirite and heart.</p>
                  <p>Thus I haue tarried longer then I thought in
this matter, bicause I would bring my selfe and all
others (as much as lyeth in me) to fÃ©ele that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and talke of vertue and vice, of Gods fauour
and of Gods punishment, is not sufficient: and to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4397:25"/>
bring my selfe and all men from knowledge and
talke,<note place="margin">Knowlege and talke without the feling of Gods fruitfull working spirit is not of God.</note> to fÃ©eling, consenting, and a full surrendring
of our selues, vnto the profite and vauntage of the
things which we speake and knowe, or else know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and speaking please not God, nor profite our
selues, as Christe saith: <hi>Not euery man that saith
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdome of heauen.</hi>
Therefore did Dauid both knowe, speake, and fÃ©ele
signed in his heart,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> the fauour, helpe, and assistaunce
of God, to be with him into what troubles so euer he
should fall, and in that fÃ©eling (did say) He would not
feare. But it may fortune I haue so written of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and vice to be knowne of in the minde, spoke of
with the mouth, and felt in the heart: that ye may
iudge and fÃ©ele in your selues, neuer to haue come to
this perfection. For this is out of doubt, he that hath
Gods loue and feare thus sealed in his heart, liueth
in this life rather an Angelicall life, then the life of a
mortall man: and yet it is euident by king Dauid
in this Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 121.</note> and by his 121. Psalme, and in many
more, that he was so sure, and so well ascertained of
Gods present helpe in his troubles, that he cared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for death, or any other aduersities that could
happen. And doubtlesse, we perceiue by his Psalmes
in many places, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his faith was as strong as stÃ©ele,
and he trembled not nor doubted any thing, but was
in manner without all kinde of mistrust, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
troubled what so euer he sawe contrarie to
Gods promises, and he passed ouer them, as things
that could not once withdraw his cogitations from
the trueth and veritie of Gods promises, which he
beleued.<note place="margin">Gene. 22.</note> As Abraham likewise did, he staggered not,
but with constancie of faith would haue killed his
owne sonne, so strong was his faith. But as the gift
of faith is a treasure incomparable, thus to knowe
<pb facs="tcp:4397:26"/>
and fÃ©ele faith to ouercome all daungers: so maketh
it the heart of him that is sealed with such a faith, to
fÃ©ele the ioyes and mirth vnspeakable. But as this
faith is the gift of God, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth only from him:
so is it in him only to appoint the time when it shall
come, &amp; how much and how strongly it shal be giuen
at al times, which is not at all times like, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so strong, that nothing can make the faithfull
man afraid, no not death it selfe, and sometimes it is
so strong, that it maketh the man afflicted to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to suffer: yea, death it selfe, rather then to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God. But yet it is with much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>flict, great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
many heauie &amp; meruelous cogitations, &amp; som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
with such a feare, as the man hath much ado to
sÃ©e, &amp; fÃ©ele, in the latter end of his heauie conflict, the
victorie and vpper hand of the temptation. And at
an other time the Christian man shal finde such hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse,
oppression of sinne, and troubles, that he shal
not fÃ©ele as much (in manner) as one sparke of faith
to comfort him selfe in the trouble of his minde,<note place="margin">The state of Gods children beaten downwith the sense &amp; horrour of sin and dread of gods iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments.</note> (as
he thinketh:) but that all the floudes and dreadfull
assaultes of desperation haue their course through
his conscience. Nothing fÃ©eleth he, but his owne
minde and poore conscience, one so to eate the other,
that the conflict is more paine to him then death it
selfe: he vnderstandeth that GOD is able to doe all
thinges, he confesseth with the knowledge of his
minde, and with his toung in his head, that God is
true and mercifull, he would haue his conscience
and heart to agrÃ©e therevnto and be quiet: but the
conscience is pricked and oppressed so muche with
feare &amp; doubtfulnesse of Gods ire for sinne, that he
thinketh God can be mercifull vnto other, but not
vnto him. And thus doth his knowlege for the time
of temptation, rather trouble him, then ease him,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4397:26"/>
bicause his heart doth not, or rather can not consent
vnto the knowledge: yet would he rather then his
life, he could consent vnto God, loue God, hate sinne,
&amp; be Gods altogether, although he suffered for it al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
paines of the worlde. I haue knowne in many good
men, and many good women, this trouble and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse
of the spirit for the time, as though God had
cleane hid him self from the afflicted person, and had
cleane forsaken him: yet at length, the day of light
from aboue, and the comfort of the holy spirite hath
appeared, that lay couered vnder the veile and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
of bitter cogitations of Gods iust iudgements
against sinne.<note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the afflicted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when God see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue forsa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken them.</note> Therefore, sÃ©eing that faith at al times
hath not like strength in man, I doe not speake to
discomfort such as at all times finde not their faith
as strong as Dauid did in this Psalme: for I know
in the holy Saints them selues, it was not alwayes
like, but euen in them as in others. And although
we can not compare with them in all things in the
perfection of their faith, yet may they compare them
selues with vs in the weakenesse of our faith, as ye
may sÃ©e by the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>In this Psalme and in many other, ye shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that Dauid by the constancie and suretie he
felt in the promises of God, was so strong, so ioyfull,
and comfortable in the middest of all daungers and
troubles of death: that he did not only contemne
troubles and death, but also desired death, and to be
dissolued out of this world, as Saint Paule and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did. At an other time ye shall perceiue him to
be strong in faith, but not so ioyful, nor yet the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
so easie vnto him, but that he suffered great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
and conflict with his troubles, and of the cause
of all troubles, sinne, and transgression of Gods
lawes,<note place="margin">Psal. 6.</note> as ye may sÃ©e in the sixt Psalme, whereas he
<pb facs="tcp:4397:27"/>
cryed out and saide: <hi>Lord chasten me not in thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
nor punishe me in thy wrath: my soule is sore
troubled, but how long Lord wilt thou deferre help?</hi>
And of such troubled consciences with conflictes, ye
shall finde oftentimes in the booke of Psalmes, and
in the rest of Gods scriptures: yet shall ye finde the
end of the temptation to be ioyfull and comfortable
to the weake man that was so sore troubled. For,
although God suffer a long fight betwÃ©ene his poore
souldier and the diuell: yet he giueth the victorie to
his seruant, as ye may sÃ©e in king Dauid. When he
cryed out, that both his body and soule was wearied
with the crosse of Gods punishment: yet he saide at
the last, <hi>Discedite Ã  me operarij iniquitatis, quoniam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audiuit
Dominus vocem fletus mei, Depart from me
ye workers of iniquitie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>for the Lorde hath heard the
voyce of my weeping.</hi> And in other of his Psalmes,
ye shall perceiue his faith more weake, and his soule
troubled with such anguish and sorrowe, that it shal
sÃ©eme there is no consolation in his soule, nor any
shewe of Gods carefulnesse towardes him. In this
state ye may sÃ©e him in the 13. Psalme, where as a
man in manner destitute of all consolation, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his complaint saying, <hi>How long wilt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
me?</hi> The same may ye read also in the 43. Psal.
where he sheweth that he, his most iust cause, and
the doctrine that he professed, was like altogether to
haue bene ouercome, so that his spirite was in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
all comfortlesse.<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 43</note> Then he said to his owne soule,
<hi>Quare tristis es anima mea, &amp; quare conturbas me? Why
art thou so heauie my soule, &amp; why doest thou trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mee? Trust in the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And in the 42.
Psalm he setteth foorth wonderfully the bitter fight,
and sorrowfull conflicte, betwÃ©ene hope and despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Wherin he complayneth also of his own soule,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4397:27"/>
that was so much discomforted, and biddeth it trust
in the lord. Of the which two places ye may learne,
that no man had euer faith at all times like, but
sometimes more strong, sometimes more weake, as
it pleased God to giue it. Let no man therefore des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,
although he finde weaknesse of faith: for it
shall make him to humble him selfe the more, and to
be the more diligent to pray to haue helpe, when
he perceiueth his owne weakenesse: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
at length, the weake man by the strong GOD
shal be brought to this point, that he shal in al trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
&amp; aduersities say with the Prophet, <hi>If I should
goe through the shadowe and daungers of death, I
would not feare what troubles soeuer happen.</hi> And
he sheweth his good assurance in the text that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,

can be more blessed, then to be susteined and kept

                  <p>In this sixt part the prophet declareth the old say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

quaerere parta tueri,</hi> that is to say, <hi>It is no lesse mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
to keepe the thing that is wonne, then it was to
winne it.</hi> King Dauid perceiueth right well the
same, and therefore as before in the Psalme he said,
The Lorde turned his soule, and lead him into the
pleasant pastures, whereas vertue and iustice reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for his names sake, and not for any righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his owne: so saith he now, That being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ught
into the pastures of trueth, and into the fauour
of the almightie, and accounted and taken for one of
his shÃ©epe, it is onely GOD that kÃ©epeth and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
him in the same state, condition, and grace.
For he could not passe through the troubles and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
of death (as he &amp; al Gods elect people must do:)
but only by the assistance of God, and therefore he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:4397:28"/>
saith, he passed through al peril, bicause he was with
him. Of this part of the Psalme we learne, that all
the strength of man is vnable to resist the troubles
and persecutions of Gods people, and that the grace
and presence of God is able to defend his people, and
nothing but it. Therefore doth Saint Paule bid the
Ephesians be strong through the Lord, and through
the might of his strength,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.</note> for he saith, that <hi>Great and
many be our aduersaries, strong and mightie, which
goe about not onely to weaken vs, but also to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
vs, &amp; we of our selues haue no power to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</hi>
Wherefore he willeth vs to depend and stay
onely vpon Gods strength.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.</note> And Saint Peter also,
when he hath declared the force and malice of the
diuell, he willeth vs to resist him strongly in faith.
And Saint Iohn saith,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5.</note> that <hi>This is the victorie that
ouercommeth the world, euen our faith.</hi> And our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ, when the time was come that he shuld
depart out of the world corporally, and perceiued
howe maliciously and strongly the diuell and the
world were bent against his disciples, that he should
leaue in the world as shÃ©epe amongest woolues, and
howe little strength his poore flocke had against such
maruellous troubles: he made his most holy and
effectuall prayer for them present, and them in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and likewise for vs that be nowe, and also in
trouble in this sorte:<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Pater sancte serua eos, per nomen

                  </p>
                  <p>Here hath euery one of Gods people suche lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Psal. 120.</note>
as teacheth that our help is only in the name
of the Lorde, who made heauen and earth. And
in this learning we shall vnderstand two necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
lessons. The first, that none can defende vs,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:29"/>
but God alone, who is our protectour and none but
he. And by this learning, he will beware to aske or
sÃ©eke helpe any other where, sauing of God, as we
be instructed by his holy word. And herein we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him, to knowe and confesse, that there is none
that can preserue nor saue vs, but he alone. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lesson is, that our conscience vnderstanding
that God can and will helpe vs, shall cause vs in all
trouble to commend our selues vnto him, and so
more strongly and patiently beare &amp; suffer all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and aduersities, being assured that we shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
them through him, or else be taken by them
from this world, into a world whereas is no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at all. So said this holy Prophet and King Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
<hi>If I walke in the shadow of death, I wil not feare,
for thou art with me.</hi> Nowe in that he saith (he will
not feare) he meaneth not that a man may sÃ©e and
suffer these perils without all perils: (for then were
a man rather a perfect spirite, then a mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:)
but he meaneth that feare shall not ouercome
him. For Christe him selfe feared death,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> neyther is
there any man that shall suffer imprisonment for
Christes sake, but that he shall fÃ©ele the paines: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
Gods spirit shall giue strength to beare
them, and also in Christe to ouercome them. There
is no man that can haue faith, but sometimes, and
vpon some occasion, it may be troubled and assaulted
with mistrust: no man such charitie, but that it may
be, yea and is troubled with hatred: no man such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may at times fÃ©ele impatience: no
man such veritie, but that it may be troubled with
falshoode: howbeit, in the people of God, by Gods
helpe, the best ouercommeth the worst, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
the sinne. But in case the worst preuaile and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome,
the man of God is neuer quiet, vntill he be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4397:29"/>
restored vnto God againe, &amp; vnto the same vertues,
that he lost by sinne: as ye may sÃ©e in this king by
many of his Psalmes, that he belÃ©eued, and found
God to defend him, howe so euer his state was, and
therefore attributeth vnto him the whole victorie &amp;
prayse of his deliuerance, saying: <hi>Thou art with me,
and doest ouercome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But nowe the Prophete declareth, howe and by
what means God is with him, and doth deliuer him
from all troubles. And this means of Gods presence
and defence, he openeth by diuers Allegories and
Translations, wonderfull mÃ©ete and apt to expresse
the thing that he would shew to the world. The first
Translation or Allegorie, he taketh of the nature of
a rod: the second, of a staffe, and saith, They did
comfort him and defend him: the third, he taketh of
a table, which he saith the great shepheard prepared
before his face, against as many as troubled him:
the fourth, he taketh from the nature of oyle, and of
a cup that was alwayes full, wherwith he was not
onely satisfied, but also ioyfully replenished in all
times, and all troubles whatsoeuer they were. By
the rod, is many times in the scripture vnderstanded
the punishment and correction that God vseth, to cal
home againe, &amp; to amend his elect &amp; beloued people,
when they offend him: <hi>He punisheth them, and yet
killeth them not, he beateth them, vntill they know
their faults, but casteth them not away:</hi> as he saide to
king Dauid,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 7.</note> that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he dyed, his kingdome should
come vnto one of his own children: &amp; in case he went
astray from his lawe, he would correct him with the
rod of other Princes, and with the plagues of the
sonnes of men, but my mercy (saith God) I will not
take from him, as I did from Saule. This same
manner of speache may ye reade also in his. 89.
<pb facs="tcp:4397:30"/>
Psalme, and in the Prouerbes of his sonne king
Solomon ye haue the same doctrine:<note place="margin">Prou. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>He that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
a heart, must haue his backe beaten with a rod.</hi>
And in the same booke he saith, <hi>He that spareth the
rod, hateth the childe.</hi> So doeth king Dauid here
confesse, that it is a very necessarie and requisite
way, to kÃ©epe the shÃ©epe of God from perishing, to be
chastened and corrected when they waxe wanton,
and will not heare the voyce of their shephearde.
And it is the part of euery wise godly man, to loue
this correction and chastisement of the Lord, as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
saith:<note place="margin">Prou. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>He that loueth discipline and correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
loueth knowledge: he that hateth to be rebuked, is
a foole.</hi> And king Dauid saith, <hi>It is to my great good
commoditie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Lorde chasteneth me.</hi> This
rod of correction, Dauid saith, is one of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and meanes, wherewithall God preserueth
his shÃ©epe from straying. Nowe in the scripture
somtimes the rod is taken, not for a correction that
amendeth a man: but for the punishment and vtter
destruction of man,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> as Dauid saith of Christ: <hi>Thou
shalt breake them with an yron rod:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> and in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse
ye may sÃ©e the same. But I will speake of the
Metaphors and Translations none otherwise, then
Dauid doeth vse them in this place, for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p>The staffe which he speaketh of in the scripture,
is taken for strength, power, and dominion: which
staffe is spoken of, as ye may sÃ©e, in the bookes of the
Kinges, howe the Embassadours and men of warre
sent from the king of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> to Ezechias at
Hierusalem,<note place="margin">4. Reg. 18.</note> called the strength &amp; power of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi>
and also of the almightie God, a staffe of
rÃ©ede,<note place="margin">Esai. 10. 14 28. 39</note> and a broken weapon, not able to withstande
the king of the <hi>Assyrians:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezech. 29.</note> and of suche manner of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4397:30"/>
speach ye may reade many times in the Prophetes.
But in this place Dauid confesseth, that the staffe of
the Lorde, that is to say, Gods power, is so strong,
that nothing is able to ouercome it: his wisdome is
such, that no man can make it foolishnesse: his trueth
is so true, that no man can make it false: his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is so certeine and sure, that no man can cause
him to breake or alter it: his loue is so constant, that
no man can withdraw it: his prouidence is so wise,
that no man can beguile him: his care is so great for
his flocke, that they can want nothing: his folde is
so strong, that no beast can breake it: he letteth his
shÃ©epe so in and out, that no man can deceiue him:
he hath suche a care of all, as he neglecteth not one:
he so loueth the one, that he hateth not the other: he
so teacheth all, as none is left ignoraunt: he so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
one, as all should be aduertised: he so chasteneth
one, as all should beware: he so receiueth one, as all
should take hope and consolation: he so preserueth
one, as all the rest may be assured, that he vseth his
staffe and force to comfort one king Dauid (as he
saith, <hi>Thy rod and thy staffe, they comfort me,</hi>) as
all other should assure them selues to be safe vnder
his protection.</p>
                  <p>In this Metaphore and Translation, vnder the
name of a staffe, king Dauid hath declared the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God to be such, that in case he should passe by
and through thousandes of perilles, he would not
care, for GOD is with him with his rodde and
staffe.</p>
                  <p>Then he setteth foorth the thirde Allegorie, and
expresseth an other meanes, which God vseth for
the defence and consolation of his poore shÃ©epe,
and saith, that GOD hath prepared a table in
his sight, against all those that trouble him. By the
<pb facs="tcp:4397:31"/>
name of a table, he setteth foorth the familiar, and (in
manner) fellowlike loue, that the God omnipotent
hath towardes his shÃ©epe, with whome he vseth not
only friendship, but also familiaritie, and disdaineth
not (being the King of Kings) to admit and receiue
vnto his table, vile and beggarly sinners, scabbed &amp;
rotten shÃ©epe.<note place="margin">The frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship and familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God the heuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his sheepe.</note> That friendship and familiaritie is
meruellously set foorth in this, that he made a table
for Dauid: as though Dauid had saide, Who is he
that can hurt me, when the Lorde of Lordes doeth
not onely loue me, but admitteth me to be alwayes
familiarly in his companie? The same manner of
speache is vsed of king Dauid, towardes Miphibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
Ionathas sonne,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 9.</note> when he saide he shoulde not
only haue the fieldes againe of Saule his grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but also be enterteined at his owne table, that
is to say, vsed friendly, honourably, and familiarly.
This worde (<hi>Table</hi>) is diuersly otherwayes taken
many times in the Scripture, but in this place it is
nÃ©erest to the mind of king Dauid, to take it in this
signification that I haue noted. And our Sauiour
Christe taketh it in the same signification, in Saint
Lukes Gospell where he saith, his disciples shall
eate with him at his table in the kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>The fourth meanes that the heauenly shepheard
vseth in kÃ©eping of his shÃ©epe, the Prophete setteth
foorth vnder the name of oyle, and a full cuppe. In
the worde of God these wordes haue also comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
significations and meanings extending to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids
purpose. Isaac, when he had giuen the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from Esau to Iacob, sayde to Iacob, <hi>God shall
giue thee of the deaw fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> heauen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>and from the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ground thou shalt haue aboundance of corne, of
wine, and oyle, &amp;c.</hi> By the which blessing, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that Iacob should lacke nothing to serue his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4397:31"/>
nÃ©edes, and to make him merrie. And if we take
Dauid that he meaneth by (Oyle) as Isaac did, that
at the Lordes table was all plentie, myrth and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
we take him not amisse: for so many times
oyle is taken for consolation and ioy in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
When Christe had purged the hurt mans
woundes, first with smarting wine, he afterwardes
put into them swÃ©ete oyle, to ease the smarte and
sharpnesse of the wine. And so likewise saith our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ to Simon the PharisÃ©e,<note place="margin">Luke. 10</note> that gaue him
meat enough to his dinner, but gaue him no myrth:
<hi>Since I came into thy house, thou gauest me no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for my feete, nor oyle for my heade, this poore
woman neuer ceassed to wash my feete with the tears
of her eyes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>and to annoynt them with oyle.</hi> But in
many Psalmes king Dauid vseth this word (<hi>Oyle</hi>)
to signifie the holy Ghoste, as when he speaketh of
our Sauiour Christe:<note place="margin">Psal. 45.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou hast loued iustice and
hated iniquitie, therefore hath God annoynted thee
with the oyle of ioye aboue thy fellowes.</hi> And this
oyle is not the materiall oyle that kings and priests
were annoynted withall in the old time of the lawe,
of whose confection we reade in the booke of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites:
but this is the oyle by whose efficacie, strength
and power, all things were made, that is to say, the
holy Ghost.<note place="margin">Psal. 89.</note> And in his 89. Psalme, he speaketh of
the oyle in the same signification. Therefore I take
king Dauid here, when he saith, God hath annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his head with oyle, that God hath illuminated
his spirite with the holy Ghost. And so is this place
taken of godly men,<note place="margin">The work of the holi Ghoste in the hearts of the saith full.</note> his head taken for his minde,
and oyle for the holy Ghost. And as oyle nourisheth
light, mitigateth labours and paines, and exhilera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the countenaunce: so doth the holy Ghost nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the light and knowledge of the minde, repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
<pb facs="tcp:4397:32"/>
it with Gods giftes, and reioyceth the heart:
therefore the holy Ghoste is called the oyle of mirth
and consolation. And this consolation commeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
king Dauid, and to all Gods liuely members, by
the meanes of Christ,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> as Saint Peter saith: <hi>We be
people chosen, and a princely priesthoode, &amp;c.</hi> By
the word (<hi>Cup</hi>) in this verse he meaneth, that he is
fully instructed in all godly knowledge, to liue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
and godly for the time of this mortall life,
and so is the cup in the scripture taken for any thing
that can happen vnto vs, whether it be aduersitie or
prosperitie, for they be called cuppes: as Christ said
of his death,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Father, if it be possible, take this cuppe
from me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 16.</note> And Dauid in the 16. Psalme vseth it for
mans prosperitie in God: <hi>The Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the
portion of mine inheritaunce, and of my cuppe.</hi> And
therein he speaketh in the name of Christ, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce
is the whole number of the faithfull, and
saith, that His inheritance which is the Church, by
Gods appointment is blessed and happie, for no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
can destroy it. This is meant by Dauids
words (<hi>The rod, the staffe, the table, the oyle, and the
cup:</hi>) and he vseth all these wordes, to declare the
carefulnesse, loue, and defence of God towardes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
man. And he could the better speake thereof
vnto others, bicause he had so many times felt, and
had experience that God was both strong and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
towards him in al time of daunger &amp; aduersitie.</p>
                  <p>And here is to be noted, that the daungers that
man is subiect vnto in this life, be not alone such as
heretofore king Dauid hath made mention of, as
sicknesse, treason, sedition, warre, pouertie, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the death of the body: but he felt also (as
euery man of God shall fÃ©ele and perceiue) that there
be greater perills and daungers that man standeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4397:32"/>
in ieopardie of, then these be, by occasion of sinne, the
mother of all mans aduersitie.<note place="margin">What sinn bringeth a man vnto.</note> Sinne bringeth a
man into the displeasure and indignation of God,
the indignation of God bringeth a man into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred

Gods anger &amp; displeasure which can not be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
nor pacified. These be the troubles of al troubles,
&amp; sorrowes of al sorrowes, as our sauiour Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
in his most heauenly prayer in S. Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Non

<hi>pray, that thou shouldest take those that I pray for
out of the worlde, but that thou preserue them from
euil.</hi> And in this prayer he hath wonderfully taught
vs, that a Christian man is subiect to two troubles,
one of the body, and an other of the soule, one of
the worlde, and another of the diuell. As for the
troubles of the world he saith,<note place="margin">It is not expedient that we be without troubles, least we seeke our selues and forget god</note> It is not so expedient,
that Christian men be deliuered from them, least in
idlenesse we should sÃ©eke our selues, and not God, as
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of Israel did: but this he knewe was most
necessa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>e, that the father should preserue vs in the
midst of these troubles with his help, from al sinne, &amp;
transgression of his holy lawes: &amp; this he assured his
disciples of, &amp; al other that put their trust in him: not
that they should in this life be preserued &amp; kept from
troubles and aduersities: but that the heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should alwayes giue vnto his, suche strength
and vertue against all the enimies of GOD, and
mans saluation, that they should not be ouer come
with troubles, that put their trust in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4397:33"/>
For God suffereth and appointeth his to fight and
make warre with sinne, and with all troubles and
sorrowes that sinne bringeth with it: but God will
neuer permit his, to be deadly and mortally woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
It is therefore expedient that man knowe who
he his greatest foes, &amp; do worke him most daunger.</p>
                  <p>There be diuers Psalmes, wherein he setteth
foorth the perill that he was in, as well in his body
as in his soule: as when he complaineth of his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
amongst not onely cruell people, but also
vngodly, that sought to take both his mortall life
from him, and also his religion and trust that he had
in Gods worde. Wherefore he compareth them to
the <hi>Tartarians</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 120.</note> men without pitie or
religion. And the like doth he afterwards in another
Psalme, where as giuing thankes for his deliuerie,
he saith, that, sinners froad vpon his backe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times warred against him, and he should haue
bene ouerthrowne,<note place="margin">Psal. 129.</note> if GOD had not holpen him.
Where in he speaketh, not onely of battell with the
sworde against the body but also of heresie and false
doctrine against the soule. As ye may sÃ©e howe <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi>
and <hi>Iulius</hi> the Apostata, two Emperours,
fought against the people of God, not onely to take
from them their liues: but also their religion and
true honouring of GOD. And of all battells that
is the cruellest, and of all enimies the principall,
that would take the soule of man from Gods word,
&amp; bring it to the word of man. And that persecution
&amp; trouble openly against Gods word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>tinued many
yeres, vntill Christ was preached abroad, &amp; princes
made Christians. Then thought the diuell his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to haue bene ouerthrowne, and Christian men
might liue in Christes religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, without any trouble
or warre for religion: howbeit at length for sinne,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4397:33"/>
the diuel entered by subtile meanes, not onely to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
true religion, but also persecuted the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours
thereof vnder the name of true religion, and
therein vsed a meruellous policie and craft, by men
that walked inordinately amongest the Christians
themselues.<note place="margin">2. Thes. 3.</note> From whose companies, sectes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation,
S. Paule willed vs to refraine by these
wordes: <hi>Wee commaund you brethren in the name
of our Lord Iesus Christ, that ye refraine from euery
one that is accompted a brother, that vseth himselfe
inordinately, and not according to the institution he
receiued of vs.</hi> And because ye haue not taken hÃ©ede
of his holy commaundement, and kept your selues
from danger and peril of heresie, sinne, idolatrie, and
superstition, by the rod and staffe of God, nor haue
not eaten your meate of religion at Gods table, nor
your mindes haue bÃ©ene annoynted with the holy
Ghost, (as Dauid in this Psalme saith that he was
against all troubles, by these meanes, defended and
mainteyned, that no perill of the bodie by the sword,
nor perill of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule by false doctrine could hurt him:)
therefore marke a little, and see the daungers that
haue hurted both you and your conscience also, not
like to be healed (as farre as I can sÃ©e) but more hurt
hereafter. For the way to heale a man is to expell
and put away sicknesse, and not to increase and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the sickenesse. From whome thinke ye that S.
Paule commaunded you to restraine in the name of
our Lord Iesus Christ? He saith, <hi>From him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haueth
himselfe inordinately.</hi> Who is that think ye?
S. Paule saith, He that ruleth not himselfe after the
rule and institution that he himselfe had taught the
Thessalonians. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we must refraine then from all
such,<note place="margin">Gala. 1.</note> as conforme not them selues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> institution of
S. Paule: yea, although he be an angel from heauen.</p>

This departure from such as haue ruled and put

vsed in England of English men, more then twentie
yeares since we departed from the sea of Rome, for
the ambition of the Romish bishops that transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
both this ordinance of S. Paul and also of Christ.
Of the which deadly and pestilent ambition, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Ezechiel prophesied,<note place="margin">Ezech. 34.</note> and so did also S. Paule, if

what is spoken of such a wicked shÃ©epeheard. I doe
put you in minde of this wicked sea, because I do sÃ©e,
that contrarie to the word of God, contrarie to the

supremacie, against all our othes that be English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

I doe exhort all men (therefore) to beware of
him, as of one that came naughtily to such vsurped
authoritie, and whose authoritie is not onely the
trouble of all Christian realmes and princes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of all Christian soules. And as he hath bÃ©ene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

                  <p>The GrÃ©eke Church for this ambition of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe
bishop, separated her selfe from the Church of
Rome, and would not haue to do with her. For after
that the GrÃ©ekes knewe, that the bishops of Rome
ment to take from them their liberties, they would
not indure it: yet did the Romish bishops alwayes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4397:34"/>
to come to the supremacie, picke quarels and maters
to fall out vpon, first with the Clergie and then with
the Laitie. <hi>Platina</hi> writeth howe <hi>Pius</hi> bishop of
Rome, bÃ©eing deceiued by one <hi>Hermes</hi> a very euill
man, began a new order about the kÃ©eping of Easter
day, and altered the time that the Apostles and their
disciples vsed, vntill <hi>Pius</hi> dayes, which was to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
and kepe the day of the resurrection of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ the fourtÃ©enth moone of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first moneth,
which is with the Iewes our March. And although
it be wel done to kÃ©epe it vpon the Sunday, yet was
this an horrible presumption vpon so light a cause,
to excommunicate the GrÃ©eke Church, and to make
diuision where before was vnion. It came to passe
in <hi>Victors</hi> time the first, which was about the yeare
of our Lord two hundred, and in the time of <hi>Iraeneus,</hi>
the bishop of <hi>Lugdune</hi> the disciple of Iohn the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,
this <hi>Victor</hi> would haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>demned the GrÃ©eke
Church, &amp; procÃ©eded with excommunication against
it, had not <hi>Iraeneus</hi> letted it: yet was it the elder
Church, and had continued in the doctrine of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
from Christes time, and had Iohn the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist
amongest them for the space of thrÃ©escore and
eight yeares after Christes ascension. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the GrÃ©eke Church was the elder Church:
yet the Romane Church to be equall with them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, &amp;
also according to the decrÃ©e that was made in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Counsell at <hi>Nice.</hi> And the GrÃ©eke Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
contented with the Romish Church for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie,
vntill a proud and arrogant Moncke that
feigned humilitie, was preferred to be bishop of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
which came to such arrogancie of spirit,
that he would haue bÃ©ene taken for the vniuersall
head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church: which was a very marke to know
<pb facs="tcp:4397:35"/>
that he was of Antichrist, and not of Christ, as <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi>
the great writeth to <hi>Constantia</hi> the Empresse,<note place="margin">Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus histor. tit. 13. 3. 23. 13.</note>
and at length this proud Monke at a Synod kept at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> created himselfe the vniuersall head
of the Church. Although before his time one <hi>Menna,</hi>
and other archbishops of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of the imperial state being there, were called v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersal
Patriarches: yet that was by name alone,
and without execution of authoritie in any foreigne
bishopricke or Church. But such was the ambition
of these bishops, that walked (as S. Paule saith) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately,
that they would haue the head and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie
of religion and of the Church, at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
because there was the head and principalitie
of the worldly kingdome, and so they began betime
to confound the ciuil policie, with the policie of the
Churche, vntill they brought themselues not onely
to be heads of the Church, but also Lords of all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
and kings, and at the last of God and Gods
word: as ruthfully it appeareth in mens conscience
at this present day. Which abhomination and pride
<hi>Pelagius</hi> the second bishop of Rome,<note place="margin">Distinct. 99. nullus.</note> both spake and
wrote against, and would that he nor any man els
should haue the name of a generall bishop.<note place="margin">Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus tit. 12. cap. 3.</note> And <hi>S.
Gregorie</hi> doeth confirme the same godly sentence of
his predecessour <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and would not, when he
was commaunded by the Emperour, whome <hi>Iohn</hi>
the bishop had abused, take the Archbishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
for the vniuersall head, nor condescend
vnto the Emperours commaundement, and wrote
to the Empresse that it was contrarie to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Christ and his Apostles, and contrarie to
the Counsell of <hi>Nice.</hi> He said also, that such new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie
was a very token, that the time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
drew nigh. And <hi>Gregorie</hi> did not onely write
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4397:35"/>
and speake against this arrogancie and pride, but
suffered also great danger (as <hi>Platina</hi> writeth,) and
so did al Rome by the <hi>Lombards</hi> that <hi>Mauricius</hi> the
Emperour made to besiege Rome, because <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
refused to obey the Archbishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi>
as the head of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But although <hi>Pelagius, Gregorie,</hi> and other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, detested and abhorred this wicked arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to be the vniuersall head of the Churche: yet the
bishop of <hi>Rauenna,</hi> began amongst the Latines to
prepare the way to Antichrist,<note place="margin">De gestis Longo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard. lib. 3. cap. 12.</note> as <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi>
saith, and separated himselfe from the societie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches, to the intent he might come to bee a

writeth. And within a short time after, <hi>Boniface</hi>
the third being the bishop of Rome,<note place="margin">In Leon. 2.</note> about the yeare
of our Lord sixe hundred and seuen, <hi>Phocas</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
iudged him to be head of the Church, against
both the bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> &amp; also of <hi>Rauenna,</hi>
and such a sentence was mÃ©et for such an arbitrour.
<hi>Phocas</hi> was a wicked man, a couetous man, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer,

                     <note place="margin">Platina in Bonifac. 3.</note> and this man to make God and

of Rome should be the vniuersal head of the Church.<note place="margin">Paulus Diaconus de gestis Long. lib. 4. cap. 11.</note>
But here was contemned the sentence and doctrine
of Christ and his Apostles, and also the decrÃ©es of the

both partes of arrogancie and vsurpation,

yeares, which decrÃ©ed, that although one seate was
named before the other, yet the bishop of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
seate should not be the chiefest priest, or head of
the rest, but onely he should be called, The bishop of
the chiefest seate. And how much it is against <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi>

                  <p>This wicked sea contended stil after <hi>Phocas</hi> had

the bishops of Rome alwayes subiect to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
as well of <hi>Constantinople</hi> as of Fraunce, for
the time of their reigne: yea, foure hundred yeares
and odde, after the iudgement of <hi>Phocas,</hi> they were
in this obedience, and were made by the Emperors,
vntill the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth, who in the
time of great sedition, translated the Empire into
Germanie, and neuer vsed iurisdiction in Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and kinges, nor yet in the citizens of Rome:

be high bishop of the world) was not knowen to the
old Church: but this was vsed, that bishops were all
called Highe priestes: and that name gaue <hi>Vrban</hi>
the first vnto all bishops, as it is written in <hi>Distinct.
59. cap. Si officia. Anno Dom.</hi> 226. But as for one to
be head of all, it was not admitted. And the GrÃ©eke
Church did neuer agrÃ©e to this wicked supremacie,
nor obeyed it, vntill the yeare of our Lord one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
two hundred and two, compelled therevnto by
one <hi>Baldwine,</hi> that brought the Frenchmen by the
helpe of the <hi>Venetians</hi> vnto <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
one <hi>Alexius</hi> vnto the Empire, vppon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that he should subdue the GrÃ©eke Church to
the Church of Rome. But this came to passe, that
the Pope, neuer after he had gotten by almes and
helpe of princes to be ouer them, passed one iote for
the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> further then he
<pb facs="tcp:4397:37"/>
serued his turne. So that ye may sÃ©e both his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and procÃ©edinges to be of the diuel, which if ye
kill not with the staffe of Gods woord, and beate
him from your conscience, he will double kill your
soules.</p>
                  <p>Nowe within one hundred and fiftie yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Phocas</hi> had made the bishop of Rome head of the
Church, the bishop of Rome contemned the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and deuised to bring the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
into Fraunce, and to giue the king of Fraunce
the same authoritie ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bishop of Rome, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Emperour had, as it appeareth in <hi>Charles</hi>
the great, and his successours a long time: and yet
was the bishop of Rome vnder the princes, and not
(as he is now) an idol exempt from all order and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
For princes made the bishops of Rome,
and all other bishops within their realmes, and so
continued the making of the Pope in the Emperors
authoritie, vntill it was about the yeare of our Lord
one thousand one hundred &amp; tenne. After that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>
the fift being sore molested by sedition moued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him by the Pope <hi>Paschalis</hi> the second,<note place="margin">Hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth here authoritie to electe bishops, &amp; to haue power of bothe swords.</note> was
constreined at length to surrender his authoritie
vnto him, who turned the face of his bishopricke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
manifest warres. What followed when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope
was thus frÃ©e, and liued without obedience to the
Christian Magistrates, I will not in this treatise
make mention, but put you in remembraunce that
for certeintie there followed such trouble amongest
Christian princes, as neuer was before, as it is to
be sÃ©ene by the doing of the wicked man <hi>Gregorie</hi>
the seuenth, who toke then vpon him to haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to vse two swordes, the spirituall and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall,
in so much that <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
thrÃ©escore and two times to make warre in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4397:37"/>
his life,<note place="margin">Alberus Crantzius ecclesiast. histor. li. 6.</note> by the meanes of the bishop of Rome. And
as it is written, this wicked bishop stirred vppe the
Emperours owne brother in lawe <hi>Radulphus</hi> the
Duke of <hi>Sueuia</hi> to warre against him, and sent him
a crowne of Golde with this verse grauen in it, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradedit

say, <hi>Christ gaue the Empire to Peter, Peter giueth it
to Radulphe.</hi> Meaning that Christe had giuen the
Empire worldly to the bishop of Rome, and he gaue
it to <hi>Radulphe.</hi> Ye may sÃ©e what a rodde the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
made for their owne tayle. For, after they
had made the bishop of Rome head of the Church, the
bishops made themselues shortly after the heades of
Emperours and kings. A iust plague of God for all
them that will exalt such to rule, as God said should
be ruled.</p>
                  <p>These bishops be not onely proude, but also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull.
For whereas all the worlde knoweth
the bishops authoritie to come from the Emperour
in worldly things,<note place="margin">Abbas Vs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergensis in suo chro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nico.</note> and not from God, but against
God: this monster <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth saide, that
Christ gaue him the Empire of Rome, and he giueth
it to the Duke of <hi>Sueuia Radulphe,</hi> to kill his good
brother <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth. He that will know more
of this wicked man, and of his brethren bishops of
Rome, let him read <hi>Benno</hi> the Cardinal that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in his historie of the Popes, that he saw of <hi>Iohn</hi>

                     <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth, <hi>Alexander</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde.
But in his olde dayes he sawe and writeth
horrible &amp; execrable thinges of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth.
Yet was Englande free from this beaste of Rome
then, in respecte of that it was before the idol was
expelled in king <hi>Henrie</hi> the 8. time. But <hi>Alexander</hi>
the third, neuer rested to moue men to sedition, vntil
<pb facs="tcp:4397:38"/>
such time as king <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth was content
to be vnder him as other were: And all this suffered
England for Thomas Becket the Popes Martyr.</p>
                  <p>When they were crept vp into this high autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
all their owne creatures bishops of their secte,
Cardinals, priestes, monkes, and friers, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be contented to be vnder the obedience of the
princes: and to say the trueth, princes durst not (in
maner) require it, for they were in danger of goods
and life. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth, was
poysoned by a monke, that poysoned the idol of the
Masse, both a god and minister mÃ©ete to poyson men,
and both of the Popes making. And what conscience
did they make of this thinke ye? Doubtlesse none at
all, for the Pope saith, and so do al his children, that
he can dispense, and absolue themselues, and al men,
from what othes soeuer they haue made to God or
man. This enimie, with his false doctrine, is to be
resisted and ouercome by the word of God, or els he
wil destroy both bodie and soule. Therefore, against
all his craftes and abhominations, we must haue
the Rodd, the Staffe, the Table, the Oyle, the Cup
that Dauid speaketh of, in a readinesse to defend our
selues with all. Now followeth the last part of this

without danger: also that the troubles of this world
be not perpetuall nor damnable for euer, but that
they be for a time onely sent from God, to exercise

learne, that the troubles being ended, we begin and
shall continue for euer in endlesse pleasure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
as Dauid sheweth at the end of his Psalm.
So doeth Christe make an ende with his disciples,
when he hath committed them, for the time of this
life, to the tuition of the heauenly father, whiles he
is bodily absent: he saith at length they shalbe where
he is himselfe in heauen for euer. For in this life, all
be it the faithfull of God, haue consolation in Gods
promises, yet is their ioy very darke and obscure, by
reason of troubles both without and within: out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
by persequution: inwardly by temptation.
Therefore, Christ desireth his father, to lead and
conduct his Church in trueth and veritie, whiles it
is here in fight &amp; persequution with the diuel, vntill
it come to a perfect and absolute consolation, where
as no trouble may molest it. For then, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <hi>The plentifulnesse of

These ioyes in the end of troubles, should giue the

that <hi>The troubles of this present life, be not worthie

               <head>A briefe explanation of the Psalme
generally.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y soule doubtlesse wayteth still
vpon God, &amp;c.</hi> Be my troubles
neuer so great and daungerous:
yet my soule shall trust continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and constantly in the Lorde,
that can and will remedie them.
For he is my strength, and my
saluation: and he is my defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So shall I not greatly fall.</hi> Although good Lorde by
reason of mine infirmitie and sinne, which is in all
men, my soule is weake and fÃ©eble, that it wilbe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with the lightest of all thy troubles, whiche
thou layest vpon man for his sinne: yet, when it
taketh holde of thy mercie, it waxeth strong. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be weake and trembling by reason of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie:
yet doth it not cleane fall from the trust of
constancie and hope.</p>
               <p>And let the wicked imagine their wicked imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
against thy poore seruauntes, O God: yet at
length shall they come to shame and destruction: as
the tottering wall doth fall, and the rotten hedge is
consumed with fire. For that they go about, they
shal neuer bring to passe: because they deuise to put
him to shame, that God hath purposed to exalt and
magnifie. And what so euer doublenesse they vse, to
speake faire with their mouthe, and yet haue false
and hollowe heartes: it shall not bring their intent
to their purposed end. <hi>Sela.</hi> God be thanked, of
whom dependeth al the hope of my saluation. And
he is my strength, my saluation, and my defence: so
that I shal not fall.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, all Christian and afflicted persons
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4397:41"/>
(saith the Prophet) follow mine example, and put al
your hope and trust in the mercie of God: who onely
saue vs from euill, and blesse vs with all goodnesse.</p>
               <p>Powre out therefore before him all your cares
and heauines: and looke assuredly for help from him:
for doubtlesse the helpe of man is nothing worthe.
For, <hi>If man and vanitie were bothe weighed in a
paire of balance: vanitie it selfe would be weightier
then man. How then can so light a thing as man is,
helpe in the time of trouble?</hi> And as a man is but
vanitie, or else rather more vaine then vanitie: so be
al worldly riches that man possesseth, and as little, or
lesse able to helpe an afflicted, as man is vnable
to helpe himselfe.</p>
               <p>And this I knowe (sayeth the Prophete) not by
mans wisdome, but by the mouth of God, that what
so euer helpe man looketh for, besides God: he may
be assured at all times, to be both helpelesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortlesse:
and trusting to God, he shall be at all times
both holpen and comforted. For so saith the Lorde:
whose sayings no power is able to falsifie, nor to
resist.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of the first part (wherein is contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
what the Christian should doe in
the time of trouble) is to be noted,
what it is for a man to haue his soule
wayting still vppon God: or else to
<pb facs="tcp:4397:42"/>
haue silence alwayes in his soule towardes God, in
the dayes of aduersitie. As this Psalme speaketh.</p>
                  <p>When the Christian man or woman in the time
of sorrowe and heauinesse,<note place="margin">When doth the soule of man waite vpon the Lorde in the dayes of trouble or els hath silence?</note> without grudge or impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
looketh for the helpe of God, and giueth not
himselfe to quarelling or complayning of God, as
thoughe hÃ©e did him wrong and punished him too
muche: then doth the soule waite vpon the Lord, or
else hath silence towardes God. As wee maye sÃ©e
by <hi>Iob</hi>: where his soule attended stil vpon the Lord.
When his goodes, cattell, house, and children, were
taken from him, he said after this sorte:<note place="margin">Iob. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord
gaue them, the Lorde hath taken them away: as the
Lorde is pleased, so is it done: The name of the Lord
be blessed,</hi> All this while hee bore the crosse of God
without murmur or grudge: and had his soule still
wayting vpon God, as this Prophet here saith. But
when he was burdened further, and from the sole
of the foote to the top of the head, was stricken with
sores and botches: he cursed the day that he was
borne in,<note place="margin">Iob. 3.</note> and the night wherein he was conceiued,
with many more vnquiet and lamentable wordes,
as it appeareth in his Booke.</p>
                  <p>The like example we haue before of king Dauid
in the Booke of the Psalmes,<note place="margin">Psalm. 31.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Iob. 13. 17.</note>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm. 23.</note> where be these wordes.
<hi>In trouble and aduersitie, I said: I was cast away from
the sight of thine eyes, Ã´ God.</hi> And as <hi>Iob</hi> sometime
saide, If he should die, yet he would trust in the
Lord. So sayde <hi>Dauid</hi> a litle before, If he should goe
in the middest of the shadowe of death he would not
feare. In the whiche Psalme ye may sÃ©e, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
his soule wayted vpon the Lorde: yet in the
31 Psalme his troubles were so great, that in them
he saide, <hi>I am cast from the sight of thee, Ã´ God.</hi> So
that these testimonies and examples of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4397:42"/>
do declare, that to haue the soule to wayte vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Lord,<note place="margin">What it is to haue the soule to waite vpon the Lorde in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</note> is to be assured that God will helpe in
trouble, and patiently to beare the trouble without
grudge, vntill God sende remedie and helpe for it.</p>
                  <p>The second thing to be gathered of the first parte,
is to marke and sÃ©e, that in the verie electes of God,
and most excellent personages amongest holie men:
there is sometime, quiet, patient, and thankfull suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance
of aduersitie strongly, that it sÃ©emeth in the
soule of him that is troubled, there is so constant and
strong faith, that it maketh all sorrowes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
rather pleasaunt and swÃ©ete, then heauie, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denous,
or painefull. At another time troubles sÃ©eme
vnto them so heynous and grieuous, that the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of them is as great a paine, as death: not onely
vnquieting the bodie, but also verie sore vexing of
the spirite, with these and like cogitations,<note place="margin">Psalm. 31. 42. 43. 77. Increase and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of faith in the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Wisdome to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the premisses.</note> 
                     <hi>God hath
cast me out of his sight, God will haue mercie vppon
me no more, My soule is heauie and troubled.</hi> And
this diuersitie of increase and decrease of faith and
hope of holie men and women before our time, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs great wisedome and consolation: wisdome,
in that we sÃ©e, faith and hope be not naturall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
in man, although he be neuer so vertuous, or
neuer so gratiously elected by God, to eternal salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but they be the mercifull giftes of God, giuen
vnto man for Christes sake: and wrought by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghost, aboue mans deseruings.</p>
                  <p>We learne also that the giftes of God,<note place="margin">faith, hope charitie, &amp;c. be not at al times of like strength.</note> faith, hope,
and charitie, patience, and sufferance, with such like
vertues: be not at all times of like condition and
strength in man: but at sometime so strong, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can feare vs: and at another time so weake,
that all thinges do make vs dismayed, and fearefull.
Now and then it is so doubtfull, that we cannot tell
<pb facs="tcp:4397:43"/>
whether it were best to suffer for the trueth: or else
to be released consenting vnto falshoode. Thus
God vseth his giftes in vs, not alwayes after one
sorte, partely for our sinnes: and partely, to proue
vs, and to bring vs to a certeine knowledge of our
infirmitie and weakenesse. From Saule, Iudas,
and Caine, he tooke his spirite cleane: to punishe
their iniquitie, and wickednesse. And from Iob to
attempte his patience, and to make his fÃ©ele, that
of him selfe, he coulde beare nothing.</p>
                  <p>We learne consolation out of this texte,<note place="margin">Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> in this,
that in our troubles the Lord forsaketh vs not, but
comforteth vs.<note place="margin">The Lord forsaketh not his people in trouble. Psalme. 44.</note> And the more our troubles and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities
be: the more is his grace and fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
vs. As the Prophet sayth in another of his
Psalmes, <hi>As aduersities oppressed my heart: so thy
consolations, Lorde, reioyced me.</hi> In the whiche
Psalme ye may sÃ©e, what consolation the afflicted
conscience taketh in aduersities.</p>
                  <p>The Psalme is made against the wicked oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soures,
and persequutors of the poore. Wherein they
say, As the tyrannie of the wicked troubleth vs: so
thy consolations (good Lorde) do reioyce and comfort
vs. and the same sayth Saint Paule to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,<note place="margin">2. Corin. 1.</note>
                     <hi>As the afflictions of Christe doe abounde in
vs: euen so by Christe aboundeth our consolation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is also to be noted, in that the prophete
sayeth: (His soule wayteth vpon the Lorde.)</p>
                  <p>Many men can dissemble iniuries,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 26</note> wrongs, and
oppressions outwardely.<note place="margin">Iohn. 11. 18</note> Some times, when they
be not able to reuenge:<note place="margin">Luke. 19</note> and some tunes, when they
dare not reuenge, for lacke of opportunitie and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
lest more harme mighte insue of that their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.
As the Iewes durst not kill Christ a great
while, for feare of the people: yet were they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4397:43"/>
in their hearts before God, the fact outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not then being don. Some againe reuenge not, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they thinke, dissembled patience will gaine
worldly commodites &amp; riches. Howbeit, this quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
&amp; refraining from reuenging: is nothing worth
before God. But when the hart &amp; soul waiteth vpon
God,<note place="margin">Note.</note> &amp; is contented to be as God maketh it: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
&amp; seruice of the soul, the Lord delighteth in, and
is pleased withall. This is a godlie doctrine &amp; much
to be desired, to haue the minde contented with such
things, as be troublesome and painefull to the bodie
outwardly. And where the minde wayteth not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
vpon the Lorde in trouble: it will appeare
diuers wayes. Sometime, many yeres after the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
is done, the man that suffered the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
reuengeth it wrongfully,<note place="margin">The impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the minde, is many ways kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.</note> and cruelly: as the
Phariseis and the highe priestes, deferred the blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
fact in the killing of Christ, vntil they had gotten
time and opportunitie for their purpose. Sometime
the impatience and vnquietnesse of the minde, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
with checkes and taunting aunsweres vnto
God:<note place="margin">Caine. Gene 4.</note> as when God asked Caine, Where his brother
Abel was? he asked God againe, Whether he were
his brothers kÃ©eper, or no? The same wayes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Pharaoes vnquietnesse.<note place="margin">Pharao. Exod. 5.</note> When God would haue
had him to dismisse his people: he asked, What God
he was, vnto whome he should doe such homage and
seruice? Somtime it appeareth, by desperate weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatenesse of trouble: not considering the
mercie of God that is greater then sinne.<note place="margin">Gene. 4. Abel.</note> As Caines
vnquieted soule for the killing of Abel, brought his
tongue to blaspheme the mercie of God, saying: that
His iniquitie was greater then the mercie of God
could forgiue.<note place="margin">Iudas. Matth. 27.</note> So did the wicked soule of Iudas that
betrayed Christ, make his tongue confesse before the
<pb facs="tcp:4397:44"/>
PharisÃ©es his treason and wickednesse: and neuer
to call vpon Christe for remission thereof.</p>
                  <p>Sometime the impatience of the mind, is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
outwardly: by finding fault with Gods workes.
As when Adams minde was vnquieted for the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the apple,<note place="margin">Adam. Gene. 3.</note> he said vnto God: that his wife the
woman that he gaue vnto him, deceiued him. Achab
the wicked king being impatient,<note place="margin">Achab. 3. Reg. 18.</note> with the scourges
that God sent vpon his Realme, for his owne sinnes
and the peoples: picked a quarell with the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Elias, &amp; saide: that he troubled all his Realme.
So saide the Iewes against Paule:<note place="margin">Iewes. Act. 21. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>This is he that
troubleth all the worlde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is daily sÃ©ene, when so euer the minde and
the soule is vnquieted: the fault is laide vpon Gods
worke. As if the higher powers hang a true man,
and saue a thÃ©efe: deliuer Barabbas, &amp; hang Christ:
streight way the tongue walketh, that He is set in
authoritie by God. In dÃ©ede so he is, but yet to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe
the euill, and to mainteine the good: and not
to molest the good, and mainteine the euill, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
now a dayes is sÃ©ene.<note place="margin">Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gus.</note> Simon Magus shalbe
at libertie: and Simon Peter in chaines. Annas and
Caiphas shall rule like Lordes: Christe and Saint
Paule shalbe ruled, and suffer death: althoughe not
personally in their owne bodies, yet in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and disciples.</p>
                  <p>Let the minde of the thÃ©efe be touched for thefte:<note place="margin">Theefe.</note>
streightway pouertie, the worke of GOD, beareth
the blame.<note place="margin">Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers.</note> Let whoredome vexe the whoremongers
minde: immediately the tongue complayneth vpon
Gods worke,<note place="margin">Couetous men.</note> youth, strength, and such other. Let the
minde be troubled with couetousnesse: by and by
Gods worke, wife, children be alledged for excuse.
For they must be prouided for, saith the couetous
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4397:44"/>
man: when he hath enoughe for himselfe and tenne
times as many moe children, as God hath sent him,
if it were thankfully vsed towardes God, and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
towardes the worlde. So that if any man be
touched with anguish or heauinesse for sinne: imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
the tongue saith, He was borne vnder an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
Planet,<note place="margin">Gene. 1.</note> or in an euill houre, and so findeth fault
with the worke of God, which God made excellent
good. Thus may ye sÃ©e, where as the soule of man
wayteth not vppon God: the impatient man accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
God, and all his workes, both in heauen and in
earth.<note place="margin">Prou. 18. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feeling the rod of God, doe accuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues: acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces to haue merited the same. Mich. 7.</note> But the godly fÃ©eling the rodde of God for
sinne and iniquitie (as GOD neuer punisheth
withoute iuste cause,) he firste accuseth him selfe,
and acknowledgeth his owne offences: and then
sayeth with the Prophete Micheas, <hi>I will suffer the
indignation of God, for I haue deserued it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this wayting vpon the Lorde without qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
and desperate lamenting, exhorted Ieremie
the prophete the children of Israel, for the time of
their being in seruitude and captiuitie of Babylon:
bidding them to plante and grafte trÃ©es, and so to
prouide for themselues vntil the time were expired,
of their affliction and captiuitie.</p>
                  <p>Men may mourne and lament their sinnes and
troubles, that they suffer for sinne: as we may sÃ©e
howe the Psalme of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Psal. 137.</note> conteineth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
and wÃ©eping of the people, that sate heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and lamentably by the riuer side in Babylon.
And the like may ye reade in the Lamentations of
Ieremie. But this mourning was without despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and quarelling, as the letters and bookes do
recorde. Besides these thinges, the cause of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing
and lamenting, whiles their soules waited
vpon the Lorde, differeth from the moste forte of
<pb facs="tcp:4397:45"/>
mourners and bewaylers nowe a dayes. For we
may sÃ©e nowe a dayes, if the wife bewaile the death
of her husbande: it is moste commonly, because she
hath taken from her a louing head and gouernour.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
If the husbande lament the departure of his wife:
it is because he is bereaued of a faithfull healper. If
the sonne mourne for the death of his father: it is
because there is taken from him, not onely his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but also his patrone and defender. If the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes
be sorrie for the taking away of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
it is because they want their daliaunce, sport
and pastime with them, or such other worldly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
If the prince take grÃ©euously, the calling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of his subiecte from this worlde: it is because
he lacketh a trustie souldier, a faithful capteine, a
wise counseller, or profitable officer. If the subiect
lamente the death of his prince: it is because he
hath lost his aduauntage, authoritie, or estimation.
If the seruaunt wÃ©epe for his maister: it is because
with his maister is departed his commoditie, and
trust of wordly riches and friendship. If the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
mourne for his seruaunt: it is because there
is taken from him, a skilfull, a diligente, or a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
doer of his businesse. And such like causes, as
men grÃ©euously of euerie sort fÃ©ele and lament. If
the Parson lament his parishioner: it is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
because he sÃ©eth the breach of an honest hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
decayeth his tenthes and profite. And if the
parishioner mourne for his pastour: most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is, because he loss a good companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> or profitable
friend. If the Bishoppe bewaile the death of suche
as dy in his diocesse: it is most commonly because he
is destitute of suche a one, as fauoured much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to set fourth and doe suche thinges as he worldly
desired shoulde goe forewardes: or else perchaunce
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4397:45"/>
such manner of one as coulde excuse him, what neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
or faulte so euer he shoulde perpetrate or
committe for the time he were in office. If the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesse
be sorrie for the death of the Bishoppe: it
is because the one parte (which is the Clergie) doth
feare, leaste there shall come another, that wilbe
more diligent and quicke in doing his office, and
sÃ©e that they shall do the same. The other partie (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Temporaltie) lamente, because they haue
loste such a one, as peraduenture fedd well their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
with bread and bÃ©efe, or else was so remisse, that
he woulde suffer all sinne vnpunished, and rather
be a bearer of the euill, then a mainteiner of the good.
Nowe this is suche bÃ©ewayling and mourning, as
Ethnickes, Publicanes, and Infidels may haue. But
wherefore the Christian soule that wayteth vppon
the Lord (without quarell or desperation) doth wÃ©ep
&amp; lament: reade you the Psalme before named, and
the lamentations of Ieremie: and there shall you
finde in the Psalme these words: <hi>We sate by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of Babylon and wepte, when wee remembred
thee (Ã´ Sion).</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The chiefest cause of their wÃ©eping was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the worde of God was not preached, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ministred,<note place="margin">Why sate the people by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer side of Babilon</note> nor the Almightie God lauded and
praised in the temple of Hierusalem: as God had
commaunded by his worde. This is a moste iust,
&amp; also a moste worthie cause to wÃ©epe for, whiles
God punisheth vs: that for our sinnes, not onely our
quietnesse &amp; wealth, but also the worde of God (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
is greater) is taken away, and his due honour
giuen vnto idols. <note place="margin">A iust cause of lamen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tation.</note>For the children of Israel percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
that Gods honor was defaced for their sinns,
they wepte as often as they remembred it: as God
giue vs grace to doe the same. The like did Saint
<pb facs="tcp:4397:46"/>
Peter.<note place="margin">Peter.</note> He lamented not, because he leafte all his
goods for Christes sake: but wept that by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall

in the faith and loue of his Maister.<note place="margin">Marie Magdalen. Luke. 7.</note> So did Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

                  <p>Saint Iohn Chrysostome hath a notable saying,
<hi>He that feareth more hell, then Christ: is worthie of
hell.</hi> And that ment the prophet when he cryed out,
<hi>What is there in heauen or in earth, that I preferre
before thee, O Lord.</hi> As though he had saide: There
is nothing can make me as gladde as thy loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
me, nor any thing so sorrie, as thy displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
(good Lorde.)</p>
                  <p>Thus doth the soule of the verie Christian, waite
vpon the Lord in all troubles and aduersities: and
patiently doth beare the punishmentes of sinne: and
not only beare patiently the paine, but also conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
what is the greatest losse that may happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, by reason of troubles. Not the losse of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
richesse, landes, and promotions, nor the losse of
health of bodie by sicknesse, neither the lesse of the
bodie it selfe by death,<note place="margin">What is the gretest losse that a Christian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>sidereth.</note> ne yet the losse of the soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
eternall paines. But the greatest losse that he
weigheth, is the losse of the good will of him that
made him, and of greate mercie redÃ©emed him, and
with much kindenesse alwayes nourished him.<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall son. Luke. 15.</note>
                  </p>

when he had spent all his goodes lecherously,
and brought him selfe to moste miserable pouertie,
&amp; to such extreame famine, that he would haue bene
glad to haue eaten the meate prepared for the pigs,
besides the great heauines of hart, that weighed the
time of prosperitie, and conferred it with his estate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4397:46"/>
of so extreame miserie: yet nothing made him so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and pensiue, as the calling to his remembrance,
howe vnreuerently he had vsed his moste gentle,
louing, and benigne father, who was not onely libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and frÃ©e to his children, but also to his hirelings
that lacked nothing.</p>
                  <p>This consideration of his offence towards his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
made him a great deale more sorrie: then al the

Christian waite vpon the Lord, and then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
consolation shall followe: as it appeareth by
the same prodigal sonne, and by this Psalme of the

crying to lose all her goodes, yea the mantell that
she went in. Thirdly, to putte her life in daunger
with confessing Christe to be her spouse, before such
as hated him mortally. And yet howe did this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

note there is no complaint nor quarell made

here was the wÃ©eping, lamentation, and sorrowe,
that Christ her spouse could not be found. In whose
loue she burned so ardently, that all aduersities
grÃ©eued her not, neither did shÃ©e any thing at all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stÃ©eme

                  <p>The like may ye sÃ©e by the woman of Canaan,

his disciples wer troubled and wearied, by her

no better then a dogge: yet was there neither the
bitternesse of his wordes, nor the inhumanitie of
his Apostles, that she passed for, but she wayted still
vppon the Lorde, and was nothing sorrowfull for
all the sharpe words she suffered: but onely, because
the helpe of the Lord was not extended and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  </p>
                  <p>Firste to knowe by Gods worde,
that God can helpe. The second, that
God will helpe. And the thirde, that
the afflicted is bounde, boldely to require helpe of
God. Whereof the troubled person muste be assured
by the scripture, or else he shall neuer finde conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Now to the firste parte, that God can helpe:
this scripture is to be marked,<note place="margin">God is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</note> that saith, <hi>God is om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,</hi>
that is to witt, able to do all thinges. So
said he to Abraham, when he eftsoones promised him
the land of Canaan:<note place="margin">Gene. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>I am the God omnipotent, walk
before me and be perfect.</hi> The same saide Iacob,
when Beniamin his young sonne, was so instantly
desired by his brethren, to go into Egypt, when they
lacked corne: <hi>My God omnipotent</hi> (saide Iacob)
<hi>can make the prince of Aegypt fauourable vnto you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gene. 43.</note>
So did God tell Moses, that he was the Lorde that
appeared vnto Abraham,<note place="margin">Exod. 6.</note> Isahac, and Iacob, euen
the almightie God. The like is in the same booke,
when God had drowned Pharao and his hoaff:<note place="margin">Pharao.</note> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
gaue thankes,<note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> and sayde, His name was almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<pb facs="tcp:4397:48"/>
Thus in the word of God we may learne euery
where, as well by his name, as by his most meruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
works: that he is omnipotent, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
impossible vnto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">As God is able: so is he willing to saue.</note>Euen so doth the word of God declare, that as he
is omnipotent and can saue: in like manner is he
willing and will saue. King Dauid saith,<note place="margin">Psalm. 26.</note> that He sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
both man and beast. In another Psalme he
saith,<note place="margin">Psalme. 34.</note> God saked him from all aduersities. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
he saith,<note place="margin">Psalme. 36</note> He wil saue all that trust in him. And
not onely saue: but also saue for nothing.<note place="margin">Psalm. 56.</note> So God
saith by the prophet Esaie: <hi>I will saue thy children.</hi>
And in the same booke it is declared, that Gods hand
is not weakened: but that he can saue and wil saue.<note place="margin">Esaie. 49. and 59.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This willing nature of God to saue, is manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opened vnto vs in al the Prophets.<note place="margin">Iere. 15. 23. Ezech. 34. Daniel. 12. Ose. 1. Sophon. 3. Zachar. 8. 9. 10. </note> And in Saint
Matthewe Christe saith:<note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> Hee came to saue such as
were lost. The same is to be sÃ©ene in S. Luke,<note place="margin">Luke 9.</note> howe
that <hi>The sonne of man came not to damne, but to
saue.</hi> S. Iohn the Euangelist saith:<note place="margin">Iohn 3.</note> His comming

all men to be saued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">As God can &amp; will helpe: so doth hee command vs to call vnto him for helpe.</note>Now as the word of God and the examples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in the same, declare that God can &amp; will helpe
in the time of trouble and aduersitie: so doeth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that men be bound, to call and sÃ©eke for helpe
in the time of aduersitie. As we read in Esaie the
Prophet, where God cryeth out, in this sort:<note place="margin">Esaie. 55.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye that
be a thirst, come to the waters, &amp;c.</hi> In S. Matthewe
Christ commaundeth all men that be troubled, to
come vnto him.<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> Also in the Psalmes, He biddeth all
men call vpon him in the dayes of their heauinesse:
and he will heare them, and deliuer them.<note place="margin">Psalm. 50.</note> Againe,
He willeth vs to aske and it shalbe giuen vnto vs.<note place="margin">Matt. 7. 18. Marke. 11. Luke. 11. Ioan. 14. 15 16. 1. Ioh. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe, as these thrÃ©e doctrines are to be marked
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4397:48"/>
in the almightie God, so must they be grounded in
the heart of the troubled person. <note place="margin">God alone is able to saue: and none but he.</note>And first he must
giue this honour vnto God: that he alone is able to
saue, and none but he: as the Prophet Esay sayth of
him.</p>
                  <p>Then being thus persuaded, the afflicted person
will not sÃ©eke helpe at dead Saintes,<note place="margin">Esaie. 45.</note> nor at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
creatures hande:<note place="margin">No helpe to be soght at dead saincts, &amp;c. but onely of God. God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined of himselfe to haue mercie.</note> but at Gods onely. And as
none giueth God the strength able to helpe, but is of
it selfe in God and with God: so is there none that
can giue God a wil to helpe: but he of himselfe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to haue mercie vppon the afflicted, and his
mercie is most prone and readie to helpe the poore
and miserable.</p>
                  <p>Hereof learneth the afflicted Christian, that none
inclineth God to be mercifull, but his owne gentle
and pitifull nature. So that the sinners may bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Christ resort vnto him firste, because he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
it selfe: and not to goe astray to sÃ©eke firste mercie
at dead Saintes handes, and by their meanes at
laste finde God mercifull and readie to helpe him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God: ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie to ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proch to his mercie.</note>And when the afflicted perceiueth, by the word of
God, that he commandeth him to call vpon him and
vppon none other: he may take a courage and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacitie
to be bolde to come vnto him, be his sinnes
neuer so many, horrible, or filthie: yea, if in number

The booke of wisedome sayth euen so,<note place="margin">Sapient. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Although we
haue sinned, Lord we be thine: knowing thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas these doctrines be grounded: sÃ©e
what followeth. In all the depth of anguishe and

                     <hi>Of
<pb facs="tcp:4397:49"/>
him commeth my saluation. He is my strength, my
saluation, and my defence, &amp;c.</hi> The same may we sÃ©e
also in the Dialogue betwÃ©en the Christian soule, or
Christes Churche and Christe, in the booke of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Ballads: were she neuer so blacke and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the sunne, were she neuer so troubled with
the vanities of the worlde, she cried out and saide
boldely vnto Christe,<note place="margin">Cantic. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Drawe me, we will runne after
thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And although the poore wretched soule be enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and compassed about with sinne, troubles and
aduersities, as the faire Lillie is hedged about with
thornes: yet she trusteth in her husband, that he will
helpe her.<note place="margin">Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And in dÃ©ede most comfortably her spouse
Christ comforteth her, with these maruelous words.
<hi>Arise, haste thee my spouse, my faire one, and come.
Nowe Winter is past, the rayne is gone and ceassed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Booke of Solomon is to be read,<note place="margin">Read the booke of Solomons Ballads.</note> to sÃ©e how
mercifully God comforteth a troubled and deformed
soule by sinne: and yet God layeth it not to the soules
charge, that hath Christe to her husband. Also there
is to be sÃ©ene, that the soule is bolde to sÃ©eke and call
for help of God her husband, and goeth to no strange
God for ayde or succour, althoughe she be burned
with the sunne, and a miserable sinner.</p>
                  <p>The like is to be sÃ©ene in the Prodigall sonne.
Although he was neuer so beggerly,<note place="margin">Prodigall sonne.</note> miserable, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
wretched,<note place="margin">Luke. 15.</note> and vnkinde to his father: yet he said,

and against Heauen.</p>
                  <p>The father, when he sawe him, spatte not at him,
reuiled him not, asked no accomptes of the goods he
had viciously spent, laide not to his charge his filthie
conuersation with whores and harlots, neither did
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4397:49"/>
he cast into his tÃ©ethe, howe he had dishonoured him
and his familie: but when he sawe him a farre off,
hee was moued with compassion towardes him,
ranne to mÃ©ete him, tooke him about the necke, and
kissed him. The sonne confessed his fault: and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
minding more the comforte of his lowsie and
beggerly sonne, then the repetition of his transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
commaunded his seruantes spÃ©edily to fetche
him robes and to clothe him, gaue him a ring vpon
his finger, and shooes to his fÃ©ete, killed his fat calfe,
and made merrie and reioyced with his loste sonne,
that he was found againe. Here is the state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a soule, that wayteth (as <hi>Asaph</hi> saith) for a

nowe his stomache yrketh till it be filled with
swines foode: yet more ouer then that, he sawe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
behinde him, nor before him: but miserie and
wretchednesse. Behind him he left al his goods spent
riottously, his estimation, parentage, such frends as
he had: when mony was plentie, lost &amp; also (as farre
as reason could sÃ©e) his fathers vtter displeasure and
the reproch &amp; ignominie of his alliaunce and kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke
purchased for euer. Before him he saw hunger

meate, draffe &amp; chaffe for the sustenance and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
of his piggishe life, in case he might haue
bÃ©ene so mainteyned: yet in the middest of these sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:50"/>
attending in his spirite vpon the mercie of
his father: meruelously in the filthe of a pigges slie,
and in the paines and anguishe of miserie: hearke
what a wonderfull doctrine he bloweth out: <hi>Oh

and I starue here for hunger? I will arise and gette me

                  <p>Whereof is learned,<note place="margin">The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be resorted vnto in the dayes of necessitie &amp; hunger: for he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath the breade of mercy to seede his children.</note> that all penitent Christian

he alone through Iesus Christe, who was killed to
redÃ©eme and saue the penitent faithfull sinners of
the worlde.</p>
                  <p>SÃ©e now how this Prodigall &amp; outragious sonne
knew, why he should sÃ©eke helpe of his father, in the

                  <p>First he knewe his fathers power, and therefore

                     <hi>Oh, how great plentie of bread is there in my

giue him meate sufficient. Next he was assured that
his father was mercifull, and would giue him suche
thinges as he lacked: &amp; being thus persuaded, boldly
he returned vnto his father, and to him he vttered al
his griefe: who was a great deale more prest &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

                  <p>Of the same minde,<note place="margin">The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Canaan.</note> was the woman of Canaan.
For although she founde little comfort at the firste:
yet she argued so from the nature of man to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4397:50"/>
and sayde:<note place="margin">They that come vnto christ must debase the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> selues with humilitie.</note> 
                     <hi>Oh woman greate is thy faith, be it vnto
thee, as thou desirest.</hi> For when she saide the dogges
did eate of the crumbes that fell from their maisters
table: she knewe that she her selfe, and all men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of God, were no more, nor yet so much as dogs
in the respect of man. And when she perceiued, that
man could be contented, to spare his crumbes to the
dogges: she knewe right well, that man was not so
mercifull and liberall vnto dogges, as God vnto sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Wherefore she stoode stil with Christ constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and least not calling, vntill Christe gaue her to
witte, that she was in dÃ©ede a verie well persuaded
woman, both of his power able to helpe, and of his
good will readie to helpe. For in dÃ©ede, although she
was a Cananite, she knewe, that if a man shut not
out dogges from his table, Christe woulde not shut
from his mercie a sinnefull Cananite.</p>
                  <p>The same persuasion made Marie Magdalene

there to receiue and eate of his mercie, to quenche
the hunger and smarte of her sinnes.</p>
                  <p>These examples do declare, why the troubled
may put their trust in God.<note place="margin">God is both om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> Because he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and can doe all thinges: and he is mercifull,
and will help all penitent and faithfull sinners. And
so sayd this Prophete Asaph, <hi>Of him commeth my

                  </p>
                  <p>These thrÃ©e woordes declare meruellousty, the

of him that calleth for helpe.</p>

how strong, firme, and sure, and howe inuincible he
is against all troubles, aduersities, and tempestes,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:51"/>
as well of the bodie as of the soule.<note place="margin">Matth. 7. He that buildeth vpon the rocke is wise.</note> In Saint Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe,
the man that buildeth his house vppon the

what windes soeuer blowe, and what tempestes so

stone.<note place="margin">What is the rocke.</note> The stone is God and his worde, the builder

                  <p>The experience of the same windes and floudes,
we may sÃ©e in the Actes of the Apostles. For when
Peter &amp; the rest builded the house of God,<note place="margin">To builde the house of God: is to teache saluation in Christe.</note> that is to

al Saints &amp; good builders,<note place="margin">If Christe had not bene the rocke of strength it selfe: he had bene cast down.</note> our sauiour Iesus Christ.
When he called the worlde from ignorance to
knowledge, from death to life, and from damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to saluation: there arose such winds and storms,
that, had he not bÃ©ene the rocke it selfe of strength
and inuincible power, he had bÃ©ene ouerthrowen
cleane, and his buildings turned vpside downe. For
before he was of age to be borne,<note place="margin">Christ was slandered before he was borne Matth. 1. 2 Christ per sequuted as soone as he was borne.</note> in his mothers bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel went about to slaunder him as a bastard:
and woulde haue persuaded the same to the godlie
man Ioseph, spoused in marriage to the blessed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
Marie. He had no sooner put his head out of his
mothers bellie: but streight way Herodes sworde
was whette and bent to kill him. Within a little
while after, the diuell stirred vp his owne kinse-folke
&amp; countriemen,<note place="margin">Christes own kinse folke were raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him Luke. 4.</note> to cast him downe from a hill
toppe, and to breake his necke: and at length killed
him indÃ©ede. But what was the outgoing of this
builder? Forsoothe, <hi>Father into thy handes I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
my spirite.</hi> And what was the assuraunce of
his building,<note place="margin">Christe slaine.</note> that is to say, in what suretie stoode his

&amp; great stormes?<note place="margin">Luke. 23.</note> Doubtles,<note place="margin">Christe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciples to the protec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of his Father, Iohn. 17.</note> Christ commended them
to the custodie and protection of his heauenly father
the rocke &amp; sure stone of all saluation: from whome
windes, floudes, temptations, persequution, death,
sinne, nor the diuell himselfe, with all his companie
of wicked spirites, be able to remoue the simplest of
all Christes flocke. In the Reuelations of Saint
Iohn,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> there is a meruellous doctrine, what windes
and floudes shall blowe and ouerflowe this rocke
in the bulding,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> and builders, for the time of this
life. There is a woman that had broughte foorth a
man childe, and by and by there was a foule greate
red dragon with seuen heads and seuen hornes, that
<pb facs="tcp:4397:52"/>
would haue deuoured this childe, before he had come
to his inheritaunce and kingdome appointed vnto
him. And when he saw he could not preuaile against
the childe, he caste out of his mouth water, as it had
bene a greate streame, after the Mother: but there
was giuen her winges to escape. For the rocke that
she was builded vppon, was sure: that what soeuer
windes or waters (that is to say, what troubles so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer)
should happen,<note place="margin">Hee that hath God for his rock, is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of a sauiour.</note> nothing could ouerthrowe her.
And so sayeth Asaph here, <hi>God being my rocke and
sure fortresse, my soule nor my bodie shal neuer be
confounded.</hi> As he declareth more openly by the
two words that followe, <hi>He is my strength and my
saluation also,</hi> sayth the Prophet. As though he had
sayd,<note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of gods strength by faith, to his owne defence.</note> I do not onely knowe God to be sure, strong, &amp;
inuincible: but also I know this his might, strength
and surenesse, is my wealth and my saluation.</p>
                  <p>For many men knowe, that GOD is the rocke
and strength of all powers: but none doeth knowe
that this power and strength, is saluation for him
selfe, but such as be Gods in dÃ©ede.</p>
                  <p>Therefore,<note place="margin">Faith is the gift of God.</note> sÃ©eing this faith that belÃ©eueth God
particularly to saue a priuate person is onely Gods
gifte, and commeth not of man: let vs pray, that
when we sÃ©e howe God hath bene the rocke of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
to others, that he will be so vnto vs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
For it is a singular gifte of God, to say bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
stedfastly, and merrily from the bottome of the
heart vnto him:<note place="margin">Hee that feeleth in himselfe God to be his salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of all.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou Lorde art my rocke, my sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
and my comfort.</hi> And he that fÃ©eleth in him
selfe for him selfe, GOD to be his saluation, hath
suche a treasure, that all treasures besides it, are
nothing to be estÃ©emed: and he will not passe of
goodes, landes, nor life, for this faithes sake.</p>
                  <p>But faith, as long as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth no nearer the hart
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4397:52"/>
then the eare, the lippes, the tÃ©eth, or the tongue: it
is but an easie mater to belÃ©eue. As we sÃ©e these rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers
vp of the Psalmes, &amp; the rest of Gods word, at
this time in the church, where they that say them,
nor they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heare them, vnderstand any thing at all,
or be any deale y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> more edified for that which is done
or said in the church.<note place="margin">The abuse of Gods word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh this vengeance.</note> And I am assured, if the priests
felt in their heartes, the vengeance of God to come,
for this abusing the word of God, &amp; the people knew
what an incomparable treasure they haue lost, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
taking away of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God in the vulgar tonge:
the priest would wÃ©epe water of his eyes as often as
he said his seruice,<note place="margin">Gods word in an vnknowne tongue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the people to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</note> &amp; the people wold sigh ful heauily
as oft as they hard it, &amp; vnderstood not what it ment.
Wherefore let euery man pray to God, that he may
know him, as the Prophet Asaph doth, that he is the
rock &amp; saluation, to him that so calleth vppon him.</p>
                  <p>The thirde word is (<hi>Defence.</hi>) By the which the
Prophet noteth two meruellous doctrines. The one
touching God: and the other touching man. The
thing touching God is this.<note place="margin">Defence. Two doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines.</note> Looke as in himself God
is omnipotent: so is he of power both in body &amp; soule,
to do all things for his creatures in general. And as
generally he can doe all things for his creatures: so
particularly he is saluation, to all that by faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lÃ©eue
in him. And as he is also saluation, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to such as belÃ©eue in him: euen so particularly is
he a defence,<note place="margin">Note.</note> buckler &amp; protection of such as shall be
saued: that neither sinne, the diuel, or any troubles
of the body:<note place="margin">Nothing can hurt him that is in Christ Iesu.</note> nor troubles, doubtfulnesse, anguish, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie,
or heauinesse of minde, shal hurt or danme
him. The doctrine touching man by this word (<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi>)
is this. Looke as the faithfull man hath in
him selfe this generall knowledge with all men,
that God is Almightie to doe all thinges, as he lust,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:53"/>
with his creatures generally: so particularly he
belÃ©eueth, that he is able, and will saue such as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
belÃ©eue their saluation in him.<note place="margin">The faith full belee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth, that as God is able to saue gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rally: so is he to saue particular<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly.</note> And as the
faithfull particularly belÃ©eueth his saluation to be
onely in God: so doeth he also belÃ©eue and challenge
particularly with the rest of his brethren in Christe,
maintenaunce, perfection, and defence from all
misseaduentures, ieopardies and dangers, that may
happen in this life, before he come to euerlasting
ioyes. God (therefore) giue vs grace with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Asaph to say faithfully vnto him, <hi>Thou art my
strength, my saluation, and my defence</hi>: then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we shall be assured of that, which followeth, <hi>So
shall I not greatly fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of these wordes, (<hi>So shall I not greatly fall,</hi> we
be also taught and instructed verie necessarie les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and doctrines. Firste, what difference there is
betwÃ©ene the defence of God towardes his people in
this life, and in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>As touching the defence of God towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in this life:<note place="margin">Defence of God to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards his people in this life.</note> it is meruellously set foorth by Christ
in his prayer, a little before his death: where he
prayed vnto his father, not to take his Apostles out
of this worlde:<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> but to preserue them in this worlde
from sinne.<note place="margin">They that wil liue in Christe must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequution Iohn. 16.</note> So that he woulde his friendes with
Gods defence, shoulde abide for a time in the world.
And what they shuld haue in the world for all Gods
defence, Christe tolde them: <hi>In the worlde</hi> (sayeth
he) <hi>ye shall suffer affliction: and ye shall weepe,
and the world shal laugh.</hi> Againe,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> he said vnto them,
that He sent them foorth as shÃ©epe amongest wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
Whereby we may sÃ©e, that Gods fauour and
Gods defence saueth not his verie elects in this life
from troubles and afflictions. For (Saint Paule
saith,) <hi>As many as will liue godly, shall suffer perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution.</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:4397:53"/>
Therefore the holy Ghost placeth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
congregation, the spouse of Christ (whome God
loueth and defendeth) amongst thornes, and bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
<note place="margin">Cant. 2. Matt. 13. 7, The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is likened to a shipp, a house, &amp; a woman trauelling with child, &amp;c.</note>and sometime likeneth the faithfull congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vnto a ship, tossed vpon the sea with daunger of

bloweth all windes and weather: and sometime to a
woman trauelling with child, before whom standeth
a foule dragon readie to deuour both childe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So that by this prophet Asaphes wordes that
saith,<note place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>He shal not greatly fall,</hi> and by these other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
we learne, that in this life, such as God loueth &amp;
defendeth from the eternall fire of hell, he (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
for this life) vnder great crosses, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
troubles: yet Christ willeth vs to be of good
comfort, for He hath ouercome the world. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

that the strength &amp; persequutions of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked,<note place="margin">Holofer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> be not

                  <p>But there is one learning particularly to be noted
in this similitude of a trembling or tottering wall:
wherewithall the Prophet setteth foorth the fall and
confusion of the wicked, which is this: that when the
wicked persequuteth the godly, &amp; that the least resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world is stirred vp by God against them,
the Lord that stirreth vp the plague to punish them,
striketh also their heartes with such trembling and
feare,<note place="margin">God doth so strike the heartes of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with feare, that one man in a good cause, is able to withstand tenne.</note> that one man in a good cause shalbe able, to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
ten such wicked persecuters, whose conscience
God hath so feared, that they are not able to beare
the countenance of a man: no, not able to ouercome
the terrour of their owne spirite, which beareth them
record, that as they in time past haue fought against
God &amp; his cause: so now God iustly fighteth against
them, both with the feare of hell fire towardes their
soules, and with outward aduersities towards their
bodies. So God said, he would send such trembling &amp;
feare vnto such as neither loued,<note place="margin">Note.</note> nor kept his lawes:
as it is written by the holy Prophet Moses.<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
whereof ye may read also in Daniel the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
that the Emperor of the CaldÃ©es,<note place="margin">Daniel. 5.</note> when he was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4397:55"/>
in the middest of his strength, mirth, banquets, and
iollitie,<note place="margin">A hand writing in the wall feared the Emperour of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees in his most iolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> sawe no more but a poore little hand write in
the wal of his palace, that neuer spake word, shewed
no terrible sight of men of warre, nor gaue any blow
in his palace: yet fell the Emperor into such a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
&amp; feare at the sight thereof, that all his limmes
(in maner) stoode him in no stÃ©ede. Christ neuer gaue
blow, but modestly asked his murderers whom they
sought for: and yet fell they flatt and prostrate to the
ground.<note place="margin">Iohn. 18.</note> So that the wicked persecuters of the godly,
be aptly and properly likened and compared to a tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering<note place="margin">Christ as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his murderers whome thei soght: they fell vppon the ground.</note>
and trembling wall. For as soone as euer the
blastes of Gods ire and iudgement be moued &amp; kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
against them: they be so quiuering and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would take them to be most their frends
that soonest would dispatch them out of the world. As
Christ said aptly of them, they shold pray the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teines
to fall vppon them.<note place="margin">Luke 23.</note> As long as God feigneth
himselfe a slÃ©epe, and suffereth the blessed to fall into
the hands of the wicked to be crucified and slaine, as
they please,<note place="margin">Note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> they be more strong, and more cruel then
Lions: but when God ariseth &amp; taketh the defence of
his poore people, then they be more feareful then the
Hart, or trembling Hare. As we may sÃ©e, when sÃ©elie
harmlesse Iacob,<note place="margin">Iacob.</note> passed homeward into his countrie
from <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> such as he neuer gaue blow nor
spake foule word vnto,<note place="margin">Genesis. 43</note> trembled at his comming, as
though he had bene in battel with thousands of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
The like may we sÃ©e by the brothers of Ioseph
when he spake most gently vnto them,<note place="margin">Ioseph.</note> yea and tolde
them that he was their brother: there was such a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and feare strake their consciences for persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of him,<note place="margin">The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</note> that they could make no word of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.
When the children of Israel should come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the land of Canaan, the Lord said he would sende
<pb facs="tcp:4397:56"/>
before them his feare,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note> to amaze and astonish the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the countrie, that their strength should do them
no harme.</p>
                  <p>The furie of the wicked may sÃ©eme in his owne
eyes to be stable, firme &amp; constant: but in dÃ©ede there
is nothing more trembling nor tottering. As wÃ©e
may sÃ©e at this present day.<note place="margin">They that persequute Christes flocke at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, haue no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance but flesh and bloud.</note> Such as persequute the
liuely and sÃ©elie flocke of Christ, and tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>nously hold
the necke of the godly vnder the yoke of idolatrie:
they haue no grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d, no certeintie, nor any assurance
more then flesh &amp; bloud, that fauour them, by whose
fauour they oppresse the trueth, &amp; persequute the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of it. So that in case flesh &amp; bloud should faile
them, then would they be in such trembling &amp; quiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that they would do whatsoeuer they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to do, to be deliuered from feare and terror.</p>
                  <p>As we may marke and sÃ©e in the bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester

                     <note place="margin">Stephen Gardener. Edmund Boner.</note> and also <hi>Boner</hi> the bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
When king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight suspected them
both to be fauourers of the Pope, (the capital enimie
of Christ and his church) <hi>Winchester</hi> fell into such a
trembling and feare, that with all hast he wrote his

                  </p>
                  <p>I could declare more of their religion to be of the

the bishop of <hi>Duresme</hi> be knowen openly to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world,
by their bookes to be such, I speake onely of them.
When the prophet hath declared that the persequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the godly shall soudenly perish, he telleth the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:4397:56"/>
cause why they shall perish,<note place="margin">Why shal the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quuters of the godly perish?</note> 
                     <hi>Because they deuise how
to put him downe</hi> (saith he) <hi>whome God will exalt.</hi>
And after that the Prophete hath shewed, that the
cause of their fall and punishment, is their conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
against Gods elect: he setteth foorth by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
the wicked vse to depose, persequute, &amp; tumble
downe the people of God: <note place="margin">By what meanes do the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked put downe the people of God?</note>
                     <hi>By lies</hi> (saith the Prophet)
<hi>and by imagining of falshod and vntruth.</hi> And when
he hath declared, that the wicked do purpose, to bring
their case and matter against the godly with lies: he
sheweth after what sort and fashion lies by wicked
men be vsed (<hi>To bring mischiefe to purpose.</hi>) This
is the letter of the Psalme concerning the third part
of it. Now there is in euery of these sentences pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
to be gathered by the reader or hearer of it.</p>
                  <p>First is to be noted the conspiracie and treason of
the wicked against God. If it please the Lord, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and aduaunce one: the nature of the wicked is,
as much to deface that God would haue honoured, as
may be.<note place="margin">Caine. Abel. Genesis. 4.</note> As God bare fauour and aduaunced Abel:
Cain wrought treason and killed his brother, for the
loue that God did beare him. The Lord appointed
Samuel to rule:<note place="margin">1. Reg. 8.</note> the wicked people misliked that,
which God best approued.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 18.</note> God would exalt Dauid:
Saule,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 15.</note> Absolon, and Achitophel, would prefer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Againe, the Lord appointed Noah to teache
the people to beware of the vniuersall floud:<note place="margin">Gene. 6. 7.</note> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
preferred liers, vnto whom God neuer gaue his
holy spirite.<note place="margin">Ierem. 20.</note> God elected Ieremie the true prophete:
the people aduaunced <hi>Passur</hi> the false prophete. The
Lord exalted his deare sonne, and willed the world to
learne of him:<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 17. 28.</note> the people preferred the PharisÃ©es, &amp;
desired the Iudge to hange Christ. God commanded
his word onely to be taught: but the world plucketh
it so downe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> that either they cleane refuse the word,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:57"/>
or els they will haue it none other wise then it is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized,
and made true by man. God saith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>That
which is wisedome before the world, is foolishnes
before him.</hi> The world recompenseth most arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
God, with the like, &amp; accompteth all his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and learning foolishnes, in respecte of worldly
wisedome, counsell, and religion. <note place="margin">What shal become of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers of God.</note>But what saith the
Prophet Asaphe shall become of these Nemrods and
controllers of God? <hi>They shal</hi> (saith he) <hi>quickly fall,
and be destroyed as a tottering wall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we sÃ©e howe controlling, and amending of
Gods workes at length spÃ©edeth: and what is the
end of these persecuting Giants of Gods afflicted.
They fight,<note place="margin">GOD laughteth the intent of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to scorne. Psalme. 2.</note> they fare foule, they moue heauen and
earth to alter the purpose and minde of God: but, <hi>He
that sitteth in heauen laugheth them to scorne.</hi> And
they themselues that thus wickedly vse Christe and
his members, fal downe and come to nought, as old,
rotten, and dustie walles.</p>
                  <p>And in the other part that these shameles tyrants
conspire thus against Christ and his people,<note place="margin">So the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked maye obteine their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: they care not by what meanes.</note> by lies
and falshoode, is declared the filthines of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
that be so farre past shame and honestie, that
they care not (so they may obteine their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,)
howe craftily or falsly they lie or calumniate
any sayinges or doinges of God or man. As the diuel
their father, when God had exalted man into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
he wished him out of it,<note place="margin">Genesis. 3.</note> and began to worke
mans destruction,<note place="margin">By what meanes the diuel deceiued Adam.</note> with calumniating and false ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vppon Gods owne word. When God had set vp
Dauid to reigne: Absolon his owne sonne thinking
the better to pull his father downe, lied falsly vppon
him to the people, &amp; said, that There was no Iudge
appointed in Israel to heare causes,<note place="margin">Dauid. Absolon. 3. Reg. 15.</note> and to end them
betwene man and man. So slaundered he his father,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4397:57"/>
a man of good iustice: and aduaunced himselfe, that
neuer knewe what iustice ment. <note place="margin">Elias. Achab.</note>The good Prophet
Elias likewise, whome God appointed to warne the
people to beware of sinne:<note place="margin">3. Reg. 18.</note> king Achab to disgrace
him, lied falsly vppon him, and said, that He was the
troubler of the common wealth. <note place="margin">Christ. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked sort of the world.</note>So Christ, whom
God had elected to saue the world from death and
damnation: the wicked sort of the world said, <hi>Hee
hath saued others, but he cannot saue himselfe.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note>
God sent him to be amongest the troubled to
comfort them,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> but such as wanted consolation,<note place="margin">Mark. 5.</note> when
they sawe him,<note place="margin">Luke. 8.</note> prayed him to depart out of their
countrie: because with his presence, they loste their
swine. <note place="margin">Paule. Tertullus, &amp;c.</note>God said that Paule was the chosen vessell,
to beare the name of him thorough all the Gentiles:<note place="margin">Actes. 24.</note>
                     <hi>Tertullus</hi> and the other Iewes said,<note place="margin">Whome God do ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>alt to say the truth: the wicked condemne as hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</note> He was one
that molested all the world. Euen so at this time,
there is neither honest nor vertuous man, that God
exalteth to speake the trueth: but the wicked saith,
He is an heretique, a scismatique, &amp; a traitour. But
sÃ©eing it is none other then alwayes hath bÃ©ene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed,
falsly to be layed to such as God loueth: it
must be borne patiently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Howe doe the wicked vse their lyes.</note>But nowe the Prophet sheweth, how these liers
and enuious persecuters vse their lies. <hi>They giue
faire woordes with their mouth,</hi> (saith the prophet,)
<hi>but they curse with their heart.</hi> By these wordes we
may learne, that there are thrÃ©e maner of ways that
lies do harme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Three ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of wais doe lyes harme.</note>The one, when they be openly and plainly vsed.
The other when open falshoode outwardly, is cloked
with pretended trueth. And the third when they be
dissembled outwardly, &amp; yet in the heart they lie hid,
tarying for a time when they may be put abroad, to
do mischiefe, &amp; to worke the destruction of the godly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4397:58"/>
But for as muche as the diuell the father of all
lyes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> knoweth that such as he inspireth with lyes,
can not do harme with his lyes, except they be vsed
as the persons be qualified, amongst whom the lyes
must be sowen: he teacheth his disciples to vse them
as opportunitie and occasion shall serue.</p>
                  <p>Manifest and vncouered lyes he causeth to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">Manifest lyes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</note>

the wicked in their errour, and wickednesse. As for
example.<note place="margin">Example.</note> Absolon and Achitophel tolde the people,
as many lyes (in maner) as they did words,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 15.</note> against
king Dauid: and when they were by Absolons faire
wordes alienated from king Dauid, and bent vnto
his sonne, bicause he promised to vse instice to euery
man and lawfull fauour: after Absolon came to
Hebron, and had of his side Achitophel his fathers
chÃ©efe counseler, he lyed openly, and the people more
and more were stablished in errour and treason.</p>
                  <p>The like is to be sÃ©ene in the booke of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,<note place="margin">Num. 14.</note>
that when such as returned out of the lande of
Canaan, whither they were sent, to viewe the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and strength of the countrie: tenne of the
twelue espies, brought the people into such a terror
and feare, that they thought it impossible to recouer
the land. Thus being in an errour: manifest lyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God,<note place="margin">Moses. Iosua. Caleb.</note> Moses, Iosua, and Caleb, might be vsed

place, and do as much harme, as the diuel requireth
to be wrought by them.</p>
                  <p>As amongest the CaldÃ©es, such as most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

this vse of lyes and falshood, takes place in none but
in such as the diuell (the God of this world) will not
suffer,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> to haue the word of trueth knowne. And this
vse of lyes and flashoode, doeth not trame men vnto
errour and heresie: but stablisheth men in them, that
do not knowe the trueth.</p>
                  <p>There is an other sort of people, which be the
faithfull: at whome the diuel hath indignation, and
laboreth with al diligence to deceiue: against whom
the vse of manifest lyes (he knoweth) can not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile:
for such as doe knowe and loue the trueth, do
abhorre falshoode. Wherefore, if the diuell preuaile
against them: it is by another vse of lyes, then he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to the other sort of the world.</p>
                  <p>This vse of lyes is of two sortes:<note place="margin">The vse of lyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullesse.</note> as we sÃ©e by
the word of God. The one is to make an euill thing
to appeare good, vnder the pretence of good: and a
false thing to appeare true, vnder the pretence of
trueth.<note place="margin">Gene. 3. 4.</note> As we may sÃ©e, how the diuell vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of good and profite vnto Eue,<note place="margin">Eue. Caine.</note> made her eate of

<pb facs="tcp:4397:59"/>
made his subiects traitours. With many more such
examples in the word of God. Whereby is declared,
that the diuell by his disciples, vseth lyes many
wayes:<note place="margin">The diuell vseth lyes many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes.</note> sometime to stablish men in errour, that be
in errour already: sometime to deceiue such as be
in the trueth: but then manifest lyes be not vsed,
but rather lyes conueyed, couered, and cloaked with
the mantell of trueth and veritie: as we may sÃ©e by
the examples before specified: howbeit, many times
this vse of lyes, howe so euer it pretendeth trueth,
can not deceiue men. Then, rather then the diuell
will misse of his purpose: he teacheth an other vse
of lyes, which is more daungerous and painefull to
the godly, then any yet before mentioned of. Of the
which vse the Prophete Asaphe speaketh in this
place,<note place="margin">A peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous vse of lyes.</note> saying: <hi>They speake faire with their toungs,
but thinke euill in their heartes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a perillous kinde and vse of lyes: for it
doeth one of these two great mischiefes, or else both
of them. That is to say, eyther at length it ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the trueth: or else mortally persequuteth the
trueth that will not be ouercome. As we may sÃ©e by
Esau.<note place="margin">Esau.</note> He vsed a great while faire speach and gentle
manners with Iacob his brother: but in his heart
he saide,<note place="margin">Gene. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>If my father dye, I will kill my brother.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
Absolon spake faire to his father,<note place="margin">Absolon.</note> and asked
him leaue to go to Hebron, to pay there the sacrifice
that he promised (whilest he was in Gessur of Syria)
vnto God:<note place="margin">3. Reg. 15.</note> but in his heart he went thither to rayse
king Dauid his fathers subiectes against him. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
came to Christ and saide:<note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Maister, we knowe

there be faultes and falles before God of the mans

damnable nor laide to his charge, for Christes sake:
As Saint Paule writeth to the Romanes.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>An other way it may be taken. That a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
hath testimonie in his spirit by the spirit of God,
that he is so elected, chosen, and ordeined of God to
eternall saluation: that what so euer the world, the

will not giue him licence, nor libertie to sinne: but
rather kÃ©ep him in a feare and loue of the strong and
mightie God, in whose handes he is, and kept from
the great fall of eternall damnation, from the which
he was deliuered from the beginning with God. So
that ye may learne of this place, what perseuerance

in the promises of God: as we sÃ©e by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete.
For after he had borne the crosse of affliction
<pb facs="tcp:4397:61"/>
a little while, and learned the nature of God, howe
mercifull he is to sinners, he saide: <hi>Although I fall,
yet it shall not be greatly.</hi> But when he had tarried
in the schoole of Christe, and learned in dÃ©ede what he
was, and howe that he was able to perfourme his
mercy, he saide plainly: Whatsoeuer, sinne, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
the world, the fleshe, hell, heauen, or the earth
would say against him, he should not fall. These two
interpretations are to be noted. For which so euer
we vse, we may finde comfort, and vnspeakable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation.</p>
                  <p>Now, when he hath declared, that he shal not fall
into Gods eternal ire &amp; displeasure: he sheweth how
this certeintie of eternall saluation came vnto him:
and why God so mercifully and strongly, hath war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and fenced him against all temptations and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilles
of damnation.</p>
                  <p>It is (saith he) bicause God is his health.<note place="margin">Why shal not be godly fall. Health.</note> That is
to say, One that hath not onely taken him from the

                  </p>
                  <p>Then saith the Prophete also,<note place="margin">Glorie.</note> that in God is his
glorie. Of the which worde he noteth two thinges.
The one touching God alone:<note place="margin">Note.</note> and the other touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>The glorie that toucheth God alone, is, that this
troubled Prophete pondered in the heauinesse and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4397:61"/>
anguishe of his minde, the number and strength of
his enimies, the diuel, the flesh, sinne, the world, and
the bitter accusation of Gods lawes, that truely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
and painfully grieued his conscience for sinne.
Of the other side in faith he considered, howe the
scripture declared that God was merciful, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the greatest sinners of the worlde. And he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
also by the word of God, that GOD had made
promise vnto sinners, to be mercifull. He conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
further, that god had many times vsed and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
his mercy towardes sinners. And he founde
likewise by the scripture, that God, to perfourme his
mercy, would not spare his owne dearely beloued
sonne, to redÃ©eme man from his sinne with his own
precious bloud, and painfull death.</p>
                  <p>Thus weighing the strength of the diuell and

in the glorie of God, ioyfully and thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully:
extolling him for his mercy and power, that
hath broken the serpentes head, and spoyled him

<pb facs="tcp:4397:62"/>
at the end of the Lordes prayer,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> when he saith: <hi>For

By the which wordes we knowe, that howe so euer

                  <p>But nowe the Prophete,<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete by faith clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the glory of God<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> to be his glory.</note> by the eye of faith, sÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Of the other part, who can thinke or speake any

he shall take no dishonour nor shame, by all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

my glory, my consolation, and my crowne of
eternall ioyes. For euen as the world persequuteth
me with fire, sword, and all other crucifyings: so I
crucifie the world againe, testifying by the worde of
God, that their liuing is nought, and their faith and
trust worse. So that as they crucifie me with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trouble: in like manner I crucifie the worlde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with the worde of God, and speake against it,
bearing testimonie that it is the enimie of God, and
shall perish eternally. But this I doe (saith Paule)
<hi>bicause I glory in nothing, sauing in Christ crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus doeth the Prophete Asaphe teach all men
to put their trust in Christe, and not in sinfull man:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4397:64"/>
which is not onely vanitie: <note place="margin">Man more vaine then vanitie.</note>but also, <hi>If vanitie were
laid in one balance, and man in the other, yet of both
man were the more vanitie. Therefore man is not
to be trusted vnto</hi>: (saith the Prophet.)</p>
                  <p>And for a further declaration that man is more
vaine, then vanitie: he openly declareth in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of his Psalme, that man is giuen besides vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to wrong and robberie, which two euilles do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
mans miseries.<note place="margin">Why man is more vaine then vanitie.</note> For man is not onely borne
vaine vanitie: but also by processe of time in wicked
liuing, addeth wrong and robberie vnto vanitie, and
so maketh vanitie more vaine and damnable, then it
was before.</p>
                  <p>Nowe this robberie and wrong is done two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of wayes:<note place="margin">Who so trusteth in any thing sauing in God, doeth dishonour God. Wrong done. vnto God.</note> to God, and to man. He that putteth
his trust of saluation in any other thing, sauing in
God: looseth not only his saluation, but also robbeth
God of his glory, and doeth God (as much as lyeth
in him) manifest wrong, as the wicked people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
the Iewes did, that saide, As long as they
honoured and trusted vnto the QuÃ©ene of heauen, al
thinges prospered with them: but when they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
to the true preachers of Gods word,<note place="margin">Ose. 2.</note> they said
al things came into worsse state,<note place="margin">Iere. 44.</note> and that with scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
and trouble they were ouer whelmed.</p>
                  <p>He that putteth also his trust &amp; confidence in any
learning or doctrine besides Gods worde,<note place="margin">What doth he that be leeueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doctrin besides gods word.</note> doeth not
only fall into errour, and lose the trueth: but also as
much as lyeth in him, he robbeth Gods booke of his
sufficient trueth and veritie, and ascribeth it to the
bookes of mens decrÃ©es. Which is as much wrong
to God and his booke, as may be thought or done. In
the which robberie (or rather sacrilege) no man shuld
put his trust, (as the Prophete saith.)</p>
                  <p>An other way,<note place="margin">Wrong done vnto man.</note> wrongs be done vnto man: when
<pb facs="tcp:4397:65"/>
the riche and sturdie of the worlde, by abusing of
friendship, oppresse, robbe and spoyle the poore. And
by his thus doing, first he deceiueth him selfe: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
gotten goods can not long prosper, neither can
any familie aduaunced by fraude, crafte, or subtiltie
long time endure. Then he deceiueth the simple and
poore that trusteth vpon the outward shewe of his
port and estimation: which glittereth in the worlde
as a vaine, glorious, and deceiuable beautie, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
and marketh neither howe wickedly the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the robber and doer of wrong sprang vp, nor
howe miserably God hath ordeined it to fall againe.
But sÃ©eing carnally he sÃ©eth a vaine man in vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
prosper for a time, he trusteth in this vanitie
pampered vp with robberie and wrong, vntill suche
time as vanitie vadeth, and he much lamenteth that
put in vanitie, so much vaine hope. But graunt that
honour and riches by Gods gift and trueth, abound:
yet were they not giuen for men to trust in,<note place="margin">Why ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen vnto man.</note> but for
men to giue GOD more thankes, and to helpe the
poore with them, from iniuries of oppression, and
nÃ©ede of hunger, thirst, and pouertie. Therefore the
Prophete saith, <hi>Although riches doe abound: yet
men should not put their heartes vpon them.</hi> That
is to say, men should not trust in them, nor kÃ©epe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
otherwise, then their vse or kÃ©eping should serue to
the glorie of God: in aboundance to be liberall: and
in time of nÃ©ede to be carefull: not to kÃ©epe them for
a priuate commoditie: but as Iosephe did say, to
saue the multitude from scarsitie and penurie.
Thus doeth the Prophete exhort all men to beware
they put not their trust in men:<note place="margin">Gene. 4.</note> for both they and
all that they haue of worldly things, be transitorie,
vaine, and inconstant.</p>

of iustice to punishe the impenitent sinner. And this
he heard in the time of the Lawe of Nature, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

            <head>Â¶AN EXPOSITION

               <head>THE ARGVMENT.</head>
               <p>THE matter and argument of this Psalme, is a consolation
for them that are wont much to be moued and afflicted,
when they see the vngodly flourish, and prosper in all wealth,
and pleasure: and contrariwise, the godly and good people op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with pouertie, and all other calamities, &amp; afflictions.
As ye may see the Prophet Asaphe intreate of this matter in this
his first Psalme: the same ye may see also in king Dauid, in
his 37. Psalme. Wherein he exhorteth men not to iudge amisse
of God,<note place="margin">Psalm. 37.</note> nor to leaue off godly conuersation, although the best
be punished, and the worst scape quit. These two Psalmes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
of one matter, are to be read and knowen of vs in these
perillous dayes, least the hatred &amp; persequution that happeneth
to Gods truth, and to the louers thereof, might vnhappily make
vs to iudge of God, &amp; to forsake his trueth, as many haue done,
and daily the number of them increase, with the decrease of
Gods honour, and the increase of their owne damnation. For
nowe Christ trieth the chaffe from the come,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> the rust from the

is not worth a hawe. For,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> it is not woordes that proue faith, but

                     <hi>Â¶The plaine explanation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Because the wicked men prosper so well in this
world: the people of God conforme, and applie them
selues to do as they doe, and frame their liues and
manners, vnto the rule and fashion of such wicked
people as prosper. And they sucke and drawe into
their mindes, the wicked mens opinions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersations:
and so replenish themselues with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as the thirstie man doth replenish himselfe with
water. And when the people sÃ©e the best part turne
vnto the manners of the worst, and be as euill or
worse then the worst: they muse and thincke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any God, or knowledge in God, that
suffereth these abhominations. And not onely the
common people (saith the prophet Asaphe,) stoode in
a mamering whether God tooke any hÃ©ede or cared
for the world, sÃ©eing that wicked men did so prosper,
and the godlier sorte so vexed: but I may selfe also
considering these things with my selfe, fell into such
madnesse and error of iudgement, that I had done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
so to applie my selfe to vertuous and godly life:
sÃ©eing I was vexed and turmoyled with continuall
<pb facs="tcp:4397:69"/>
miseries, &amp; sÃ©eing that there was neuer a day, that
did not bring her crosse and trouble to the seruaunts
of God, and vertuous people. These thinges (saith
the prophet,) fondly and foolishly I spake to my selfe
many times: but when I weighed the thing with
more iudgement, and considered the matter more
dÃ©epely with my selfe, I thought, If I thus iudge
and speake of God, doe I not improue, reprehende,
and condemne the life, conuersation, and labours
of all godly men? The which will not be drawen
nor inticed from godly life, and the loue of vertue by
no misaduentures, nor afflictions in this world: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe they iudge that they haue studied, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
godlinesse in vaine, whatsoeuer trouble hath
happened to them in this world. And therfore, when
I assayed to compasse the cause, and veritie of these
thinges: the greatnesse thereof brought me into
much feare, and carefulnesse. And further I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that I could not come to the knowledge of these
thinges, except the Almightie God would reueale,
and open vnto me the mysteries and secretes of his
prouidence, and wisedome: that I might sÃ©e, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
what ende and outgoing these wicked men
should haue, that with most abhomination and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie
in this life had most felicitie, and pleasure.
And by tarrying in the thoughtes, and cogitations
of this case and matter: at last I found, that these
wicked men and women, whose felicitie and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
estate tormented me, their end was most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
full of wretchednesse and paine.</p>

cursed Pharao,<note place="margin">Exod. 5.</note> he asked What God that should be,
that could plague him and his realme? And in the
time of his punishment railed,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 28.</note> and spake most vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently.
Wicked Saule also, when God for his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
punished him: he in despite of God, sought
remedie to withstand the punishmentes of God by
witchcraft,<note place="margin">Trip. Hist.</note> and Nekromancie. And Iulian the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4397:72"/>
when Christ gaue him in the warres his
deathes wound, tooke an handful of his owne bloud,
and hurled it in despite of Christ into the aire, and
said, <hi>Thou hast ouercome thou Galilean,</hi> and so in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie
he called Christ, &amp; Christian men Galileans.
Wherfore, in any case this beginning of the Psalme
is to be marked, and vsed in the time of all mens pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments:
and to say with heart and mouth vnto
the heauenly father, whatsoeuer he layeth vpon vs,
<hi>Truely God is louing vnto me, &amp;c.</hi> And so doth king
Dauid crie out, when God was most seuere and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in punishing both him and his people,<note place="margin">Psalm. 119.</note> saying:
<hi>Thou art iust, (Lord) and right: and iust is thy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
So did the Emperour <hi>Maurice</hi> say, when his
wife,<note place="margin">Carion.</note> and children were killed before his face: <hi>Thou
art iust, Lord, and thy iudgementes are righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Iob likewise was of the same minde,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 2.</note> although his
wife and kinsefolke prouoked him to speake vnpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
and vnreuerently of God: yet he said, that
He and all his were the Lords, and that if he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
them of him, why should not he be contented,
that God should haue them againe at his pleasure?
These two notes are to be marked, and vsed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
happen.<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.</note> First, that God purposeth to bestowe
heauenly pleasures and treasures vppon his people:<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note>
and therefore he wil not reward them with the trash
and wicked Mammon of this life,<note place="margin">Col. 1.</note> and transitorie
vale of miserie.<note place="margin">1. Thes. 1.</note> The second,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> when he punisheth his
in this world,<note place="margin">Iames. 1.</note> it is of loue: and that the person af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
must both take it so,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1.</note> and also saye so with
this Prophete Asaphe, <hi>Truely God is louing vnto
Israel,</hi> (that is to say,) To him that professeth his
religion.</p>
                  <p>The third note is, to marke that God is knowen
and felt in the time of punishment, and persequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:4397:73"/>
to be louing:<note place="margin">Psalm. 119.</note> but of such as be of a cleane heart.
Whereof we learne,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> that all men that beare the
name of Israelites,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 22.</note> and of Christian religion: iudge
neither reuerently nor yet patiently of Gods punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,<note place="margin">Neh. 9.</note>
but such Christian men as be of cleane<note place="margin">Psalme. 18. 91 118.</note>
heartes.<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 12.</note> Out of this place we may learne, the cause
why in this troublesome time,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.</note> so many waxe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and fall from the trueth of Gods word,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.</note> whiles
God is a punishing of vs that haue bÃ©ene vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
vnto him, and did not liue according to his word,
(the Lord forgiue vs.) Doubtles, now they mislike,
and starte backe: no not starte backe, but open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the face of Gods enemies sweare and stare, as
Peter did, (God sende them Peters repentance,)
that they neuer passed, nor cared a iote for Gods
word. And all is, because they be not, nor euer were
of a cleane heart: that is to say, so persuaded in their
heartes, that Gods holy word is the onely trueth,
what punishment soeuer GOD lay vppon them
that professe it. God giue vs this cleane heart, that
we may vnfeignedly say, Doubtlesse the Lord is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vnto his word, and to them that professe it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe
he lay thousandes of crosses vppon them in
this world.</p>
                  <p>Out of this place we be admonished (dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,)
to beware of the greatest, and abhominable
euill (one of them) that can be done against God:
that is to say, witchcrafte, and calculation by Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie,
and such other like. Howe haynous an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is this, when we sÃ©e the heauens raine, the
cloudes wholy bent to stormes and tempestes, the
windes roaring, and in such rage, as all should goe
a sunder, thunder and lighteninges as men won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at: and vnder all these plagues, tempestes and
soule weather, the young springing corne, the swÃ©ete
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4397:73"/>
roote of hearbes, the little withered grasse lye bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
and couered vnder weather and stormes, frost
and snowe, whilest GOD suffereth winter, and
maketh colde to continue. Were it not now witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft
and very abhomination, to say and diuine of
these stormie and winterly tempestes, that sommer
should not be grÃ©ene, parched blades of graine should
not come againe in the haruest to corne: bitten, and
buried rootes, should not at the spring bring foorth
swÃ©ete and pleasant floures: that shaken and wind
torne trÃ©es by tempestes, should not in the calme
comming of the sommer, bud foorth their leaues?
What witche and cursed man would thus iudge of
earthly things, that haue their times of vading and
loosing of all beautie for the sinne of man? If this
be abhomination for the bitternesse and stormes
of winter, to condemne and curse the sommer
to come, bycause sommers fruites, and the sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
beautie be stayned and all defiled with win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
barrennesse, and dimme cloudes: what is this,
but tenne times more abhomination, for the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and stormes of persequution, to condemne and
curse the life to come of Gods people, bicause truthes
fruites, and the resurrections glory be stained, and
all dishonoured with worldly scarsitie, and dimme
persequution? But as Asaph the Prophete saith, <hi>Al
eyes see not these thinges, but such as be of a cleane
heart.</hi> All men haue eyes, for the most part, and all
men haue hearts, but they be such, as the wormes of
the earth, and birdes of the ayre can eate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:
but he that will liue in GOD, and sÃ©e these
things, must haue immortall eyes, and an incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
heart, which commeth by grace in Gods spirit,
to sÃ©e by faith, and honour with reuerence Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as well in the winter and colde stormes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequution,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:74"/>
as in the summer of felicitie and pleasure:
and to remember that all men and women haue this
life and this worlde appointed vnto them, for their
winter and season of stormes. The summer draweth
neare, and then shall we be fresh, orient, swÃ©ete, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
pleasant, acceptable, immortall, and blessed for
euer and euer: and no man shall take vs from it.
We must therefore in the meane time, learne out of
this verse to say vnto God: whether it be winter or
summer, pleasure or paine, libertie or imprisonment,
life or death, <hi>Truely God is louing vnto Israel, euen
vnto such as be of a cleane heart.</hi>

and miserable man is, and how
soone inclined to doe euill. He saith,
that He was ready and prest to haue
slipt from God: euen with the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Gods owne works, when he
sawe God giue vnto the wicked felicitie and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
which things be onely Gods riches to giue to
whome he will. Although he bestowed none of his
vpon the wicked, yet was he offended that he should
bestowe his owne where he lusted.<note place="margin">Matth. 20.</note> The same occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
tooke the workmen in the vineyard, to murmur
against God: as it is in the Gospell of Saint Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe.
So that we be naturally giuen to this, that
God giueth alwayes too muche vnto other, and too
little vnto vs: yea, although he would giue vs all
the world, and yet kÃ©epe any one thing for himselfe,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4397:74"/>
(euen his very Godhed,) in case he wil not giue also
that vnto vs:<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> we be ready to bid him farewell. And
in case he will not also giue vs as muche, as is in
him: such is our nature, that we will by some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
or other sÃ©eke to haue it. As we may sÃ©e, when
he had made Adam, and giuen him both knowledge
and power, aboue all other creatures made for his
vse, bycause he was not made God altogether: he
fell most haynously from God: and slipt not only in
his fÃ©ete: but also in soule and body, to his vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and destruction, and of vs all that come of him.
For this is our condition. Let God giue vs neuer so
much, we thinke it too litle, (except we haue a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
grace to consider it.) And let vs surrender vnto
God neuer so little homage or seruice: we thinke
it all too much. Such is our cursed nature and first
birth, to be ready to slip from God vpon the lighiest
occasion of the world: yea, when GOD doth other
men good,<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> and vs no harme. But this nature we
haue of the diuel our forefather,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8.</note> to disdeine and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne
at other mens profite &amp; preferment, as he did.
For when God made Adam, and put him in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise:
the diuell neuer rested enuying Adams prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
vntil he had brought him to the lesse of altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to slip cleane from the Lorde. This doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
therefore touching the brittlenesse and fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of mans nature, is to be marked: least that
whereas the Prophete saide, <hi>My feete were almost
gone,</hi> we slide and fall altogether from God.</p>
                  <p>There is also to be noted, that the Prophet said,
He was almost gone, and not altogether. Here is
the presence, prouidence, strength, safegarde, and
kÃ©eping of man by almightie God, meruellously set
foorth: that although we be tempted and brought
(euen to the very point,) to perpetrate, and doe all
<pb facs="tcp:4397:75"/>
mischiefe: yet he stayeth vs, and kÃ©epeth vs that the
temptation shall not cleane ouercome vs. And so
Saint Paule saith of Gods prouidence, and present
helpe: that <hi>He will not suffer vs to be tempted fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then we shall be able to beare.</hi> And many times
when we be brought into the greatest daunger and
perill both of body and soule: before we fall and be
ouercome, the Lorde preserueth vs, and preuenteth
the euill.<note place="margin">Gene. 20.</note> As when Abraham went into Egypt, and
perceiued that the Egyptians would put him in
daunger for his wife Sara, (for she was a faire wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,)
he desired her to say, She was his sister: and
by that meanes thought to saue him selfe from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and to winne fauour at the Egyptians handes.
The chastitie of this godly matrone Sara and wife
of Abraham, came into such extreme peril, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Abraham nor she, knewe how to stande fast in
the state and chaste condition of matrimonie: for
she was coupled to the king, as his wife. But least
the woman should haue falne, and her fÃ©ete slipt: the
Lorde rebuked the king, and tolde him, that Sara
was an other mans wife, and vnlawfull for him:
and so, by his merciful defence and goodnesse, kept al
partes from falling in that respect.<note place="margin">Iudith. 13.</note> The like may
ye sÃ©e also in Iudith the godly woman, that without
a singular grace of God, had falne with Dlofernes,
and abused womanhoode, and widowhoode: had not
the Lord stayed in time, the fall was imminent, and
(in manner) at hande.<note place="margin">Iudith. 7.</note> And ye may reade the same
likewise of the people that were within the citie of
Bethulia, at the same time, howe neare they were
falne, when they appointed God a time to help them
the space of fiue dayes: in case he deferred his helpe
any longer, they would yealde them selues into the
handes of their enimies: but God stayed their fall,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4397:75"/>
and that by the handes of a woman. And if there had
not bene more mercy in GOD, then faith in them,
their fÃ©ete had not onely slipt: but also all the whole
lande, countrie, and citie. The like ye may sÃ©e also
in the notable historie of Hester:<note place="margin">Hester. 4.</note> whereas the very
rocke and chiefe stay of the Iewes health Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,
made suite to the QuÃ©ene for Asuerus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
for the life of the Iewes, when sentence and
iudgement was past against them of death. So that,
if faith in the promises of God had not stayed him,
he had slipt and falne downe, to sÃ©e al things against
him, and his countrimen. But before men vtterly
fall, the Lorde is with them, and preserueth them
with his mercy:<note place="margin">Psal. 94.</note> as Dauid saide, <hi>When my feete
were moued, thy mercy (oh Lord) stayed me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thirde thing to be noted of these wordes, is
the manner of the Prophetes speaking, which must
be marked and vnderstoode, or else the reader or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of the Psalmes shall take no profite.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My feete were almost gone, and my treadings had
well nigh slipt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the fÃ©ete he vnderstandeth the minde: and by
the treadings well nigh slipt, he vnderstandeth the
iudgement and wisedome of the minde. As foule and
slipperie wayes be daungerous for the fÃ©ete: so be
the workes of God to the minde, that is not illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with the light of Gods word. And as the slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
and running away of the feete, causeth all the
body to fall: euen so the ignorance of the mind cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
both body and soule to fall, and grÃ©euously to
misseiudge the workes of God. And as the fal of the
body sowceth and defileth it self with mire and dirt:
euen so doth the fall of the minde defile both body
and soule with impatience, and enuious indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at Gods workes. So that the Prophete saith by
<pb facs="tcp:4397:76"/>
these wordes, <hi>My feete were almost gone, and my
treadings had well nigh slipt</hi>: My minde was so
troubled to sÃ©e God suffer the euill in such prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and the good in suche aduersitie, that my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
almost slipt from the right sentence of thÃ©e (O
Lorde:) and very scarsly I auoyded most haynons
sinne towardes thÃ©e, in controlling of thy most wise
and iust doings. If we marked the pithe and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the scripture, we should sÃ©e many thinges
more in our selues, then we doe: &amp; doubtlesse growe
to an excellencie in wisedome, and finde out what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
we be most inclined vnto. Amongst all other,
hatred and indignation of other mens prosperitie is
not the least, nor the most seldomest. And in dÃ©ed the
father of sinne, the diuell, hath that in him. First, he
disdained God, and his felicitie: but he wan nothing
thereby,<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> but euerlasting paines. Then he enuyed
man &amp; his felicitie: yet the wicked spirit gayned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him self, but double damnation, and losse of
vs all. And this sÃ©ede of the diuell descended into our
nature (as we may sÃ©e,)<note place="margin">Gene. 4. 21. 27.</note> and made Caine to kill Abel
his brother:<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> made Ismael, to persequute Isaac: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau,

Aaron and Marie his sister,<note place="margin">Gene. 38.</note> Moses: Iacobs children,

and the members of the diuell and Antichriste
in this our time,<note place="margin">Iohn. 21.</note> the members of Christe. So that
they be not onely almost falne,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> but also (the Lorde
help them, and vs all) altogether sliden to enuie and
indignation, and likewise to violent oppression of
Gods holy word. But let vs not slip ne fall into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,

                  <p>Out of this part is to be noted. First, a great fault
and ouersight in the people of God, for lacke of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and true knowledge: wherein trueth and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
felicitie in dÃ©ede consisteth: the lacke of the which
knowledge, maketh men both impatient, and lewde
iudges of Gods holy workes. The Prophete there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
herein amendeth his owne, and our ignorance,
and willeth vs to knowe perfectly, wherein felicitie
and happinesse doth rest. The Christian must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
and assure him selfe, that the felicitie and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
beatitude of man, is wrought by quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of conscience, and innocencie of life: of which
two partes and vertues, in this tract I will speake
more hereafter, as well what they be, what be the
causes of them: as what is the effect of them. I wil
assure you, if we knowe not these thinges well: our
religion will be but a while permanent, and true
vnto God. To enter therefore into the knowledge of
the matter, wherein the beatitude &amp; felicitie of man
<pb facs="tcp:4397:77"/>
consisteth: it is requisite to cast some cloudes and
darknesse vpon these worldly things that wicked
men possesse, and godly men thinke them thereby to
be happie. Looke as the Sunne at the rising and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
ouer the earth, doth hide and couer the globe &amp;
sphere of the Moone, and darkneth also the light, and
clearenesse of the starres: euen so doth the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of conscience, and the brightnesse of faith and
charitie that dwelleth in the heart of the faithfull,
darken and hide all things that sÃ©eme beautifull and
voluptuous to the world, and carnall lustes of man.
And he that hath a testimonie at home in his owne
conscience, that he is in the fauour of God, will not
greatly passe of other mens iudgements, whether
they saue or damne, laud or disprayse: nor yet great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passe, although he lacke such notes of riches and
glory, as worldly men iudge and knowe felicitie by.
For he that knoweth surely wherein felicitie doth
consist, will not take the worldly opinion of men for
his recorde, nor for his rewarde: neither will he
greatly feare for any damnation or punishment,
that the world can annexe and ioyne vnto his life,
for this mortall time. It is therefore Christianitie
to knowe, that felicitie and beatitude resteth in the
riches of the mind, by Gods grace, wrought by the
holy Ghost, for the merites of Christ.</p>
                  <p>There was amongst the Philosophers great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
of opinions in this matter, wherin felicitie &amp;
beatitude shoulde consist. Some saide it rested in
this, a man still and continually to be voyde from
anguishe and sorrowe. Other saide, it consisted
in the knowledge of thinges. Some saide, in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and voluptuousnesse. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus,</hi>
and such other as were of the sect of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripatets,</hi>
did hold, that a blessed and fortunate life did
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4397:77"/>
consist in honestie, and said, that The same might be
accomplished with the voluptuous pleasures of the
body, and with externall riches, honour, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But both these opinions, and all the rest are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by our sauiour Christ, and his holy word. He
saith,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>This is life euerlasting, that men knowe thee
(O father) the only and true God, and whome thou
hast sent Iesus Christ.</hi> And in an other place he saith,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.</note>
                     <hi>Euery one that forsaketh house, brothers, sisters, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
mother, wife, children, or possessions for my
name, shall receiue an hundred folde, and possesse life
euerlasting.</hi> By these places we knowe, that beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
&amp; felicitie consisteth in knowlege, &amp; working of
Gods will, which be the causes of quietnesse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and innocencie of life: wherein felicitie doth
consist, as I saide before. The right knowledge of
GOD bringeth faith in Christe. Faith in Christe
bringeth tranquillitie of conscience. Tranquillitie
of conscience, by faith worketh charitie and loue, to
do, and worke the will of our heauenly father. This
may ye sÃ©e also in the booke of the Psalmes, that fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
&amp; blisse resteth not in these trifling things that
glitter to the eye, wherewith the Prophete was so
sore offended: but in knowledge and working of
Gods will.<note place="margin">Psal. 94.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou teachest
(Lord,) and whom thou instructest in thy lawe.</hi> And
in an other Psalme he saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 112.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed is the man that
feareth the Lord, and desireth to worke his will.</hi> In
these Psalmes, if ye reade them with iudgement,
and prayer to God: ye shall finde both knowledge
and consolation, farre aboue the common sorte of
such as reade and vse them in the Churches nowe,
to the dishonour of GOD, and to the destruction of
their owne soules. And in this matter of felicitie
and beatitude of man and woman in this life: I
<pb facs="tcp:4397:78"/>
would haue you iudge by the scripture of God, or
else ye shall be deceiued, what it is, wherein it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth,
and what it worketh: for onely the worde of
God teacheth and sheweth it, and nothing but it.
The scripture of GOD plainely declareth, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be profitable: whiche is not honest and
vertuous. And vertue is blessed and very felicitie,
in what condition or state so euer it be: neyther can
it be increased with any externall or bodily goods or
honour: neyther yet can it be diminished with any
aduersities or troubles. And nothing can be blessed,
but that which is voyde from iniquitie, full of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
and the grace of God. As ye may sÃ©e in the booke
of the Psalmes, whereas this matter is plainely set
foorth.<note place="margin">Psal. 1.</note> Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the
counsell of the wicked, nor stoode in the way of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
nor sate in the chaire of scorners. But his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
was in the lawe of God, &amp;c. And in an other
Psalme he saith:<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed are they that be cleane of
life, and walke in the lawe of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of these places we learne, that knowledge and
innocencie of life, worketh felicitie and beatitude.
We must therefore beware, that we iudge not feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie
to be in these inconstant, and vncerteine riches
of the world: but we must contemne them, and also
beware we feare not the trouble that may happen,
for such vertues wherein felicitie doth stand. And
we must vnderstande also, that although these ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
wherein felicitie consisteth: and suche as be
friendes of God dwelleth, be afflicted and troubled:
that neyther the felicitie, nor the person in whome
it dwelleth, is any thing the worse for troubles and
aduersities before God, but rather the better. As ye
may sÃ©e by the worde of God that saith,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed be
ye when men speak euill of you, and persequute you,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4397:78"/>
and speake al euill against you, lying, for iustice sake.
Be glad and reioyce, for your rewarde is great in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
So did they persequute the Prophetes before
you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> And in an other place it is saide:<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee that will
come after me, let him denie him selfe, and take his
crosse and followe me.</hi> The Psalme therfore in this
part, amendeth the iudgement of weake and waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Christian men, that be offended with the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie
of the wicked: bicause they do not know, nor
marke by Gods word, wherein felicitie doth consist,
and that it remaineth in suche vertues as be not
diminished, nor drowned in the aduersities of this
world, what so euer daungers happen. When was
Moses stronger, then when he saw of the one side the
mounteines of Egypt,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> and of the other side Pharao
and his armie, and before him the red sea, and in the
middest of these enimies, he and his people standing
like shÃ©epe, ready for the woolues to be slaine: He
was neuer more strong, nor in this life more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
then at that time.<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> Daniel was neuer better then
amongest the Lions. We must therefore know the
vertues, wherein felicitie doth consist, to be nothing
diminished by sorrowe and trouble: nor any thing
increased by voluptuous pleasures, and brittle ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of this world.<note place="margin">Philip. 3.</note> As S. Paul most godly setteth
foorth in his Epistle to the Philippians: <hi>The things</hi>
(saith he) <hi>that I thought profite and gaines, for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
sake, I esteeme as hurt and damage: for whose
loue, I esteeme all thinges as nothing, so that I may
winne Christ.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> And Moses estÃ©emed the treasures of
Egypt hurtfull, and preferred them not before the
reproches and rebukes of the Lord: neyther thought
he him self rich nor blessed with the riches of Egypt,
ne cursed when he was in nÃ©ede, and lacked them.
Elias the Prophet,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 1</note> if he had considered his nÃ©ed and
<pb facs="tcp:4397:79"/>
daunger, he might haue accounted him selfe very
miserable and vnhappie: but bycause he knewe it
was appointed him of GOD, he complained not of
Gods doings: for he was as well contented to haue
bread from God by the Rauen in the morning, and
water at night from the founteine: as though he
had had all the world. And he was nothing the lesse
blessed, although he was poore, but rather more bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
bycause he was riche to God ward. Reade the
Gospell of S. Matthewe,<note place="margin">Matth. 17.</note> and sÃ©e the practise of this
felicitie. Moses that was so destritute of all worldly
helpe, and Helias voyde of all worldly consolation,
do talke with Christ in the mount of Thabor, where
as Peter would haue tarried with all his heart, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he knewe both Christ, and those that he tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with, in the estimation of this world, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
most vnhappie, and miserable of all men:
yet he sawe, that transitorie honours, riches, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie
holp nothing to the life euerlasting. As Christ
plainly teacheth in S. Luke,<note place="margin">Luke. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Blessed are the poore:
for theirs is the kingdome of God. Blessed be they
that hunger and thirst for iustice: for they shall be
satisfied. Blessed be ye that nowe weepe: for ye shall
laugh.</hi> Therefore the pouertie, miserie, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the Prophete was in, when he spake this
Psalme and most godly Hymne, hindered nothing
at all his felicitie, and blessing of God: but rather
furthered it, if he had wist wherein truely and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
felicitie had consisted: as ye may sÃ©e hereafter, how
he came to the knowledge of it.</p>
                  <p>An other thing is to be noted out of these sixe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
conteyning the third part of the Psalme: <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>. Tim. 6.</note>That
such treasures, riches, and honours, as men set most
by in this world, be rather (vnto men that haue not
grace) lets and impediments to euerlasting felicitie,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4397:79"/>
and to the atteinment of vertue in this life, then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.
As the scripture saith:<note place="margin">Luke. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Woe be vnto you
rich men: which haue your consolation. Woe be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you that are nowefull: for ye shall hunger. And
such as laugh, shal weepe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. Reg. 25.</note> Achab the wicked king not
contented with his kingdome, would take Naboths
vineyard from him: but it had bene better for him
that he had bene a swincheard: for his lands and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
abused, made him to kill an innocent man, and
his true subiect. Plentifulnesse of Gods giftes abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
bringeth contempt of God and man:<note place="margin">Dan. 4.</note> as ye may
sÃ©e how Nabuchodonozer in wealth and riches, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied
the liuing God, and came into beastialitie.<note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> The
children of Israel, when they had filled them selues
with giftes, were not thankfull, but vnthankfull:
and fell from vnthankfulnesse to idolatrie, and all
abhomination. And as men contemne God in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie:
so do they also their neighbours. As ye may
sÃ©e by this part of the Psalme, whereas the Prophet
saith: <hi>Their eyes swell for fatnesse,</hi> that is to witte:
Their riches and honour puffeth them vp in suche
pride, that they contemne and despise all men.</p>
                  <p>The thirde thing to be noted is, that all thinges
that the felicitie and ioyes of wicked men consist in,<note place="margin">Deut. 40.</note>
be but worldly and transitorie thinges,<note place="margin">Psal. 92.</note> and as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeine
as man is him selfe:<note place="margin">Esai. 40.</note> which is to be marked.
Bycause no man can be happie or blessed,<note place="margin">Matth. 6, 1. Pet. 1,</note> by any
such vading and inconstant things: neyther can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man come to the beatitude of ioyes permanent,
by such things as God giueth indifferently, as well
to the bad as to the good, and to the vicious as to the
vertuous.<note place="margin">Eccle. 3. 4. 5.</note> As Solomon in the booke of the Preacher
meruellously setteth foorth, and matcheth equally
the good with the bad, in such things as happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the sunne. <hi>The good &amp; the bad</hi> (saith he) <hi>be rich
<pb facs="tcp:4397:80"/>
and poore, in trouble &amp; in prosperitie, haue frends &amp;
foes, be merrie and sorrie, do liue and dye all in like.</hi>
But neither the things that bring them to life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
nor yet life euerlasting it selfe, be one thing.
For there is nothing that leadeth to euerlasting life
but the knowledge and feare of God, and the doing
of his blessed will: the which vertues come not by
nature,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 8.</note> but by grace. As Solomon declareth: when
he prayed so earnestly to haue wisdome &amp; vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
from God. And as these vertues come not from
nature: euen so be they not the riches of all men, but
of vertuous and godly men only. And as they dwell
&amp; inhabite only in such as feare God: so do they only
conduct, and lead such as be godly (and none other)
to eternall life. The which differeth as farre, and as
much from the wickeds eternall life, as ioy differeth
from sorrowe, ease from paine, plesaunt consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from fierie flames, loue from hatred, God from
the diuell, and heauen from hell. For these riches,
wherwith the vngodly are indued in this life, be not
the things that can make any man blessed or cursed
before God. Therefore no more to be cared for, then
nÃ©ede is to haue them, if GOD will: if not, to lacke
them: to haue them with Gods grace, well to vse
them: or else to pray to lacke them, least they abuse
vs. Better it were to haue too little in the worlde
with Gods fauour: then too much with his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
If we haue meate,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> drinke, and cloath, let vs be
contented with it, as with sufficient things to passe
this life: if any more then these come, to take hÃ©ede
they make vs not to swell in pride, and take from
vs the remembraunce and seruice of God. Oh that
godly eyes would looke vpon this Psalme, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vpon this part of it, that declareth, wherein the
glory, honour, &amp; felicitie of wicked men consisteth:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4397:80"/>
then I know, his eyes shal hardly escape teares and
wÃ©epings, to sÃ©e and heare a wicked and cursed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, pampered with such a sort of vaine flÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges,
that when he woulde most gladly flÃ©e from
sorrow,<note place="margin">Luke. 12.</note> the least be able to carrie him away. Marke
the wicked mans riches, and ye shall perceiue, that
God hath giuen no more, then he hath vnto the clay,
moolde,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> and stonie earth: wherin lyeth both gold and
precious stones. His beautie and amiablenesse of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture

nor the Lillie of the field. His strength much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to brute beastes. His wisedome lesse then horse
or mule, that vse in meates and drinkes ynough for
necessitie, and not too much for sensualitie. If lacke
and nÃ©ede oppresse them, patiently they lacke vntill
order prouide for them: but if the wicked lacke, he
beareth not lacke with patience, nor sÃ©eketh ynough
by trueth. The couragious horse fiercely in fight co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

death: and the mÃ©eke swanne fÃ©eling the

and striueth not, but willingly is contented to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render

what doth the riche wicked man? Forsooth, as the
wiseman saith:<note place="margin">Eccle. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>Oh death, howe bitter is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

Inferiour, with all that euer he hath, to the

the barren clay that he was made of: and the soul
it selfe within that wicked body cursed of God, and
ordeined to eternall paines.</p>
                  <p>Who is he that can reade or behold the state and
honour of man, in whom is not mentioned one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to dwell, without sorrowe &amp; heauinesse? What

a cursed nature is man made of, that can sÃ©e an other
thus pampered vp with Gods displeasure, and can
not rather bewayle and mourne to sÃ©e his brother
by these riches lost, and cast away, then to enuie or
disdeine at his person? Oh woe befall them, that fal
into this sinne of ours, that thus rather with malice
and disdaine, enuie the miseries and curses of God
vpon other: then charitably do goe about to amend
them, or ruthfully to bewaile them? Read (my deare

                  <p>Of the first impediment, whiche is ignorance, is
sprong into the world horrible blasphemie,<note place="margin">Of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce is sprong horrible blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

(as S. Peter saith) out of the traditions of his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.<note place="margin">1. Peter. 1. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die against ignorance.</note>
So that ignorance taketh away the honour of
God, &amp; also the saluation of them that be ignorant.
The remedie against this great impediment is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the reading,<note place="margin">2 Peter. 1.</note> meditating, hearing, and learning of
Gods holy word, whiche is as a candle light in a
darke place, to kÃ©epe and preserue a man from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and peril.<note place="margin">Psalm. 119.</note> And so saith king Dauid, that, <hi>It is a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4397:85"/>
candle vnto his feete, and a light vnto his stepps.</hi> And
in an other place of his Psalmes he saith: <hi>The lawe
of God is so perfect, that it turneth soules vnto the
Lord.</hi> Wherefore (saith he) it is the part of euery
man that wil be vertuous and godly,<note place="margin">Psalme. 1.</note> to haue his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
and cogitations in the law of God both day and
right. And to preserue the people from this horrible
impediment of ignorance, God spake by his prophet
Esaie,<note place="margin">Esaie. 59.</note> these wordes: <hi>My spirite which is in thee, and
my woordes which I put in thy mouth, shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from thy mouth, and from the mouth of thy
seede (saith the Lord) from henceforth for euermore.</hi>
And in the same Prophesie Christ prayeth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
father to seale his word in his disciples,<note place="margin">Esaie. 8.</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the daungerous impediment of mans saluation,
which is ignorance, might be eschewed &amp; auoyded.
The same remedie against ignorance,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.</note> commandeth
Almightie God also by Moses in Deut. and by S.
Paul to the Ephesians,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6.</note> whereas the fathers and the
mothers be not bound themselues alone, to knowe
the lawe of God: but also bound to teach it to their
children, that by ignorance they offend not God.</p>
                  <p>Of the second impediment,<note place="margin">What co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>

of the conscience, and many times also the extremest

an intollerable burthen and vnspeakeable sorrowe,

that the conscience of man admonished by the word
of God, of the filthinesse and abhomination of sinne,
bringeth all the bodie into a trembling and feare,
lest God should vse rather iustice, and iustly punishe
sinne: then mercie, and mercifully forgiue sinne.</p>

may sÃ©e commonly by examples left vnto vs in the
word of God, that where sinne is throughly felt in
the conscience, the feeling sinner is not onely trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
within in spirite, but also outwardly in all the

most manifestly in king Dauid.</p>
                  <p>In what a sea of heauines was king Dauid in his

                     <hi>Why

Psalmes we may sÃ©e, into what trembling and
feare outwardly he was brought by the knowledge
and fÃ©eling of his sinne.</p>
                  <p>In one place he saith, The feare of his sinnes did
not onely ouerlay his conscience:<note place="margin">Psalm. 38.</note> but also crushed
and (in maner) all to broke his bones.<note place="margin">Psalme. 6.</note> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:4397:87"/>
place, His visage was all defaced with wÃ©eping
teares: and so abundantly they gushed out of his
eyes, that he watered, or rather ouerflowed his bed
with them where he lay. Into what horrible cryes
and waylings many times he fell for feare of sinne:<note place="margin">Psalm. 77.</note>
this Psalme and many other doe declare. The like
horrour and feare also of the sight and fÃ©eling of
sinne we sÃ©e to haue bÃ©ene in Saint Paule, when he
cryed out vppon him selfe: <hi>Oh wretched man that I
am, who shall deliuer me from this bodie subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> And Marie Nagdalene with the sight and
fÃ©eling of Gods displeasure against her sinne, made
teares and wÃ©epings enowe to washe the founteine
of mercies fÃ©ete, Iesus Christ. But blessed is that
conscience feared by the Lawe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> whose feare by the
swÃ©ete promises of the Gospel, is turned into mirth:
and blessed be those teares and wÃ©epings, that end

for feare of Gods iudgement, breake out into lowd
cryes for helpe and preseruation: the same anguish
and trouble of minde and of bodie, for feare of Gods
punishment for sinne towardes man, was likewise
in Christ without sinne,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> which said: <hi>My soule is
heauie vnto death</hi>: and in such an agonie was his
bodie, that he burst out and swett both water and

                  <p>So that of this second part, first we learne, that

second part,<note place="margin">Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce betweene the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man. The peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent man.</note> is to declare what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twÃ©ene
the penitent Christian in aduersitie, and the
desperate person that looketh for no helpe, or els the
presumptuous person that contemneth helpe.</p>
                  <p>The penitent afflicted calleth vnto the Lord, and
although he finde his burden neuer so intollerable,
doe wÃ©epe and lament neuer so sore: yet he despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not, but in aduersitie he hath hope, and is not
confounded: as in prosperitie he hath faith, and yet
presumeth not.<note place="margin">The des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat man.</note> The desperate man fÃ©eleth all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and no consolation, is wholy ouercome with
mistrust, ful of incredulitie, and cleane voyd of hope:<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous man.</note>
as Saule, Iudas, and others. The contemner of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
hath hope in prosperitie, with al presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
as Cain and Pharao: and in aduersitie, despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
with all mistrust,<note place="margin">Note. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> &amp; diffidence. The Christian
afflicted, calleth in faith and hope vppon the Lorde,
and is heard: the wicked afflicted calleth not vppon
the Lord, but is cleane reiected and comfortlesse by
Gods most iust iudgement. The Christian afflicted,
sÃ©eth all his sinns lesse then the least mercies of God:<note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>
the wicked afflicted sÃ©eth the least of his sinnes, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the greatest mercies of God. The one, in
trouble by faith glorifieth the Lord,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and by mercie
findeth saluation: the other, in trouble by mistrust
dishonoureth the Lord, and by iustice findeth dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
The one, by troubles thoroughe faith in
Christ, is made like vnto the sonne of God, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be separated from him in eternall life: the other,
by troubles through desperation of Christe, is made
like vnto Sathan, and cannot be separated from him
in eternall death. The one, in eternall life findeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
<pb facs="tcp:4397:88"/>
ioyes: the other, in euerlasting death, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
endlesse paines. Almightie GOD (therefore)
graunt vs grace in all our troubles and afflictions,
penitently and faithfully to call vppon him: and to
finde him merciful vnto vs his wretched creatures,
Amen.</p>
                  <p>The third thing to be noted in this second part is,<note place="margin">Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and mans, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much.</note>
that Gods nature and mans differ much one from
the other. For man (for the most part) is no more
seruiceable vnto God, nor longer friendly vnto man,
then Gods condition vppon the earth is fortunate
and quiet with the world.<note place="margin">Man for the most parte is vnstable &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the world fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth.</note> For if stornies arise for
Gods cause, and troubles happen where quietnesse
erst had place: the men of the world alter their loue,
seruice and reuerence: and will neither make nor
medle with God nor his cause: no, althoughe tenne
thousand idols be brought in for one God: as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe
men haue sÃ©ene in former time. As long as
Christ had a king in this realme to hold of his part,<note place="margin">Idols set vp againe in Queene Maries time.</note>
and that great liuings, gaines, friendship and loue of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world rose for Gods sake, they dissembled towards
his worde, and so long as faire wordes could please
God, he lacked none: but now euen such as God did
most for, doe knowe neither God nor his word: but
had rather heare tenne times spoken of the falsest
tradition that euer man brought into the Churche,
then once of Christes most holy Gospel: so that now
mens natures, for aduersities sake, be cleane turned
from God.</p>
                  <p>How long the loue of man continueth towardes
men, daily experience sheweth within one moneth.<note place="margin">How long mans loue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes man.</note>
If a man fall into trouble for the most iust cause: he
that was his friend, will not onely alter his loue
from him, but also all the notes and tokens of the
same: whereas in prosperitie he was assured both
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4397:88"/>
of friendly words and friendly workes, in aduersitie
he shal find neither words nor workes, except words
and works of displeasure. In prosperitie faire lookes
and amiable countenances were as common as the
cart way: in aduersitie there shall neither looke, nor
countenaunce be shewed, except it be frowning and
bending of browes: yea, and moreouer, aduersitie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
from the dissembling friend, all knowledge that
euer he had of his friend afflicted: that if the poore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
(although he be euen vnder the nose of his
feigned friend) with courtesie and all obeisance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be knowne.</p>
                  <p>Oh God,<note place="margin">God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and helpeth the poore afflicted.</note> blessed be thy name, that withdrawest
neither thy knowledge, loue, nor yet thy helpe from
the poore afflicted, but hearest them, and grauntest
them their godly and honest requestes: as here this
Prophete most godly &amp; comfortably writeth of thÃ©e.
For he saith.<note place="margin">Psalm. 77. Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord shall hearken vnto me: when
I seeke him in the time of my trouble.</hi> And also the
Lord abhorreth not to be present with the afflicted,
be his troubles neuer so great:<note place="margin">Psalme. 91.</note> 
                     <hi>For I am</hi> (saith the
Lord) <hi>with him in trouble, I will deliuer him, and set
him in honour, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this doctrine we learne two things.<note place="margin">God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but for his sinne. Man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth man for trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and not for sinne.</note> The one
that God hateth not the troubled man for his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but for his sinnes. Men doe cleane contrarie for
the most part. For they hate the man for trouble,
and not for sinne. For let the wickedest man aliue
haue prosperitie, and all wicked men will loue him,
for his prosperities sake. God turneth not his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
from man for trouble, but for sinne. The world
for troubles sake will not knowe the most deare and
honest friend: but let the most wicked that liueth by
breath haue prosperitie, and wicked people will not
faile to know him with beck and du-gard, if he come
<pb facs="tcp:4397:89"/>
into companie. Yea rather then faile, the most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedest
man aliue, shall be narrowly sought out, that
wicked men may haue acquaintance of him. But he
that hath God to his friend, is sure of a Sauiour as
well in aduersitie as in prosperitie: as the Prophet
here declareth, which can in troubles send ease, and
in quietnes continue ioyes for euer. To him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be all laude and praise worldes without end,
Amen.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing to be noted in this second part,<note place="margin">Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in prayer.</note>
is the continuance of the faithfull afflicted in prayer
vnto God. For the Prophet saith, that He lifted vp
his hands all night, and waxed not wearie. Of this
continuance in prayer we learne two thinges. The
one perseuerance in prayer, and the other patient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
and willing sufferance vntill God sende
redresse and ease. To the first the Scripture exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs, that we pray both heartily and continually
vnto God: not because he is ignorant of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
but because we should throughly be brought to
vnderstand, that there is none can helpe vs out of
trouble, but hÃ©e: and also that by continuance in
prayer we may the better knowe, and more earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repent our sinns, that be the cause of our troubles:
thirdly, that by often remembrance and diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsalls
of our iniquitie vnto GOD, we may the
sooner bring both our soules and bodyes, into the
seruice and homage of Almightie God, whome we
haue by sinne most grÃ©euously displeased.</p>
                  <p>The second vertue patient expectation in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,<note place="margin">Patient expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
declareth that we be much bound vnto God,
that chasteneth vs in this life: and deferreth not our
punishment to the eternall paines in the world to
come. Also it maketh the minde of man to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the wisedome of GOD, and also the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4397:89"/>
of man, that many times for lacke of patient
expectation and thankfull sufferance, waxeth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of his crosse and punishment, and also murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
against God, bicause he helpeth not when mans
wisedome iudgeth most mÃ©ete to be holpen. But pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
expectation prescribeth God no time, when to
helpe, nor yet meanes how to helpe, but saith:<note place="margin">Matth. 6. 8</note> 
                     <hi>Thy
will be done in earth as it is in heauen.</hi> Also: <hi>Lord,
if thou wilt thou canst deliuer me.</hi> As the Prophete
vseth here in this Psalme, He called and cryed vpon
the Lord all the night, and attended patiently, when
God would helpe, leaning altogether to his blessed
will and pleasure, to doe, or not to doe, as him best
pleased.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere in these verses it appareth what
terrible and fearefull thinges, a man
that is in trouble, shall suffer and be
vexed withall. And the first that the
Prophete mentioneth, is in the end of
the second verse, and it is this: <hi>My soule refuseth
comfort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this aduersitie and anguishe of the soule,<note place="margin">As long as sinn is not felt, man is iocund &amp; pleasant.</note> we
may learne many thinges: First, that as long as
sinne appeareth not, nor is felt, the minde of man is
quiet, iocund, and pleasant: and the mirth and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the minde reioyceth the body, and maketh it
lustie and pleasant: not fÃ©eling at all the breache of
Gods commanundements,<note place="margin">2. Samu. 1.</note> neither passing any thing
at all of sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> nor euill conuersation: but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in things that displease God,<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> then in any
vertue or honestie. But when trouble, sicknesse, or
death commeth,<note place="margin">When the horrour of a mans sin is felt to desperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> no world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioyes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> comfort the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted person.</note> then most commonly, though men
sÃ©e not the horrour of their sinnes to repent: yet fÃ©ele
they the horrour thereof to desperation: and that
once felt in the soule, all the ioyes of the worlde can
not comfort the troubled person. As Adam with all
the solace of Paradise could not reioyce, when his
soule felt the abhomination of his offence towardes
God. Caine could neuer plucke vp merrie counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
for the cruell killing of his brother Abel.<note place="margin">Gene. 3. 4.</note>

her: nor the poore woman that was taken in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4397:90"/>
could this Prophetes spirite take any consolation,<note place="margin">Psal. 77.</note>
as long as his sinnes were felt and not pardoned.
Whereof followeth this saying: A small trouble of
conscience putteth away all ioy and mirthe of the
world. Wherefore it is wisedome and also the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of all Christian people, to auoyde sinne and the
enimitie of God, which onely troubleth the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
and to put the body to all paines possible, yea,
and to death it selfe, rather then to put the soule in
daunger towardes God:<note place="margin">1. Tim. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> as Saint Paule writeth
to Timothie his disciple: and not without cause.
For as the spirite that contemneth God, and fÃ©eleth
(for his contempt) Gods displeasure, can not take
comfort, but is full of anguish &amp; heauinesse inward,
and in the outward man full of paine and sorrowe:<note place="margin">Esai. 66.</note>
so likewise shal the soule in the life to come inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fÃ©ele vnspeakable grudgings and sorrowes,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.</note> and
outwardly the vnquenchable and euerlasting fire of
hell.<note place="margin">The dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest frends of Christe be not voyde of trouble &amp; anguish of minde for their sins. Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And here is to be noted that the very elect and
dearest friendes of Christe, be not frÃ©e from trouble
and anguish of minde for their sinnes, perpetrated &amp;
committed against God. But this is a consolation,
that the elect, as they finde anxietie and anguish of
minde for sinne in this life: so in this life is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce
that is troubled, by grace quieted, that it may
after this life finde eternall rest. And it is a common
order and ordinarie way,<note place="margin">An ordina<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ri way that God vseth to call sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, and from repentance to forgiue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse.</note> whereby GOD vseth to
bring the sinner to acknowledge and repent his sin,
and so from knowledge and repentaunce to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse
of his sinne: to shewe and set before the
conscience of the sinner, his sinne: as the example of
king Dauid and others do declare. <hi>My sinne</hi> (saith
Dauid) <hi>is alwayes before me.</hi> As though he had said:
In case I coulde hide mine iniquitie from all the
world,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> yet can I not excuse it before God, nor hide it
<pb facs="tcp:4397:91"/>
from mine owne conscience. And euery mans sinnes
thus open before God, and knowne and felt in his
own conscience, bringeth the soule into this discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and heauinesse, that it refuseth all consolation
and comfort: as this Prophet Asaph sayth meruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
in this second verse of his Psalme.</p>
                  <p>There is to be noted out of this comfortlesse spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of the Prophete Asaph,<note place="margin">Two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts.</note> an other most necessarie
doctrine for euery Christian creture, which is this:
that there is two manner of discomfortes, or two
sortes of heauinesse in the word of God, that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to leade vs in the time of this wretched life:
as there is in it also two manner of consolations.
There is two manner of brightnesse and clearnesse,
and two manner of darknesse and obscurenesse in it:
as it shall appeare in the treatise of this Psalme
hereafter. And bycause the diuersitie is not marked:
the worde of God doeth many times, and in many
places and persons, no good at all.</p>
                  <p>There is a discomfort inwardly, and a discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
outwardly in the scripture.<note place="margin">An inward discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte.</note> The discomfort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
is, when the sinneful man or woman sÃ©eketh
and suffereth the same discomfort in his soule, that
the lawe of GOD doth open and proclame against
him for his sinnes committed against God and his
lawe: so that, as the lawe commaundeth after this
sort:<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Agite poenitentiam, Repent ye</hi>: so the man that
is commaunded by the lawe to be sorie and heauie
for his sinnes,<note place="margin">Mark. 1.</note> is sorrie and heauie in dÃ©ede, by the
working of Gods spirite:<note place="margin">Gene. 3. 4.</note> as we may sÃ©e in Adam,
what inward feare and discomfort he had,<note place="margin">2. Samu. 11</note> when he
heard the voyce of God after the doing of his sinne:
Caine the like,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> Dauid the same,<note place="margin">Act. 9.</note> with Peter, Paule,
and others in the word of God, This discomfort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
is felt of al Gods elect, that be able to learne
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4397:91"/>
and knowe the nature of Gods lawe, and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and curse of God vpon sinne.<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> For this is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
commaundement to all fleshe borne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in sinne:<note place="margin">Mark 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Agite poenitentiam, Repent ye.</hi> It is
also many times felt of suche as dye,<note place="margin">Saule and Iudas.</note> and liued wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly.
As Saule and Iudas,<note place="margin">1. Samu. 31.</note> whose spirites in their
discomforts refused al consolation,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> and so dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
comfort in great anguishe and perturbation of
minde.<note place="margin">Mark. 14.</note> But that is not generall in all wicked and
damned persons: for many times they fÃ©ele no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort,
nor heauinesse of spirite inwardly in this
world: but God, of his vnspeakable wisedome and
iustice, maketh them (for their sinnes) aliue, and in
securitie of conscience,<note place="margin">Pharao.</note> to goe to hell. As Pharao,
whilest he followed the Israelites in persequution
into the red sea,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> soudenly was drewned. Chore, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
and Abiron, whilest they were doing their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
God killed them,<note place="margin">Num. 16.</note> in opening the earth that
swallowed them aliue downe into hell. Nowe this
inwarde discomfort,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 5.</note> although it eude not in ioye,
but onely in such as belÃ©eue their sinnes to be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in the death and passion of Christ: yet we sÃ©e by
the examples of the scripture, that both good and bad
suffer and fÃ©ele this, that their spirite will take no
comfort.<note place="margin">Outward discomfort</note> But nowe as concerning outward and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
discomfort: which is felt as well of such as
haue the word of God, as such as haue not the word
of God, but only the lawe of nature. As we may sÃ©e
in the time of the lawe of nature, how Noah shewed
the discomfort of all men, and the destruction of the
world for sinne:<note place="margin">Gene. 5. 6.</note> but this discomfort did not enter
into the spirites of the hearers. Christ complaineth
of the same, that the people had both discomfort and
comfort preached vnto them: and yet they receiued
none of them both. <hi>To whome</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>should I</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4397:92"/>
                     <hi>compare this generation? It is like boyes that sit in
the streates and cry vnto their fellowes, and say: We
haue played vpon our tymbrels to you, and you haue
not daunsed: we haue soung mourning songs vnto
you, and ye haue not wept.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 11. Luke. 7.</note> God by his Prophete E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saie
saith the same:<note place="margin">Esai. 65.</note> 
                     <hi>All the day long haue I exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
foorth my hand vnto an vnfaithfull and intrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

or gently offered vnto the Iewes, it came no
further then the outwarde eare.<note place="margin">Esai. 53. 6.</note> Whereof both the
Prophets and Christ him self grÃ©euously complaine,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note>
in this sort:<note place="margin">Iohn. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>They haue eares and heare not, and they
haue eyes and see not.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> Saint Paule rebuketh men
also,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> that by the lawe of nature knewe good, whereof
they should haue reioyced: and euill, whereof they
should haue lamented, and yet did not. And to leaue
off the examples of our fathers mentioned in the
scriptures: we may sÃ©e the same by daily experience
amongest our selues. We reade in the booke of God,
we heare by preaching, we knowe in our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
the displeasure and anger of God, against
vs for our sinnes. God outwardly sheweth vs the
same with many horrible plagues: as by sicknesse,
warre, sedition, scarsitie, enimitie, and hatred, by the
deliuerance and surrender of a whole realme (to the
vtter destruction thereof) into the handes and rule of
a straunger, and by the deliuery and giuing ouer of
Christian soules into the hands and rule of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
Pope, and his wicked Cleargie: and yet
this discomfort commeth no further, then our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
eare. If Asaph the authour of this Psalme
were amongest vs, he would say, His spirite would
take no consolation. And this is an horrible plague,
that wÃ©ekely this Psalme is read amongest the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Cleargie, and yet it bringeth their spirites to no
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4397:92"/>
sorowe nor fÃ©eling of God displeasure. Wherefore
our owne experience teacheth, that there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and an outwarde discomfort in this Psalme,
and in the rest of Gods most holy word. The one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
sinners fÃ©ele, and by it amend their liues: and
the other some wicked men fÃ©ele, and yet despaire:
but of the most part of the world, it is not felt at all.
Whereof commeth the contempt of God,<note place="margin">Sinne not felt, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tempt of God, &amp;c.</note> the loue of
our selues and of the world, and the losse of our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
soules in the world to come. Let vs therefore
marke the scripture that teacheth this discomfort,
and pray to God, that as we sÃ©e it in the letter: so we
may fÃ©ele it in the spirite. Of the two maner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations,
it shall be saide in the next verse: and of
the brightnesse and darknesse also, in the Psalme
hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Nowe in the trouble of the spirite is an other
thing to be considered, whereof the text also maketh
mention: that is, howe the discomfort of the spirite
had continuaunce all the night. Whereof is to be
gathered the greatnesse of discomfort. For as the
night is a very image of death, and the bed a very si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of the sepulchre and graue: euen so is the
discomfort of the spirite in the night, that will not
suffer the body to take rest, but to be vnquieted with
it selfe.<note place="margin">Vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the spirite is a veri image of eternall death.</note> The which vnquietnesse of the spirite, is a
very similitude and image of eternall discomfort in
the world to come, that both body and soule, whiche
were created first to inherite the heauenly blisse, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fall of Adam, should rest by night, (as king
Dauid saith) and after this life,<note place="margin">Psal. 104.</note> for sinne vnforgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
should for euer be disquieted in the vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
fire of hell.</p>
                  <p>Here may we learne the circumstances and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<note place="margin">The cause of al trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is sin.</note>
how the trouble of the Prophet Asaphes spirite
<pb facs="tcp:4397:93"/>
was increased.<note place="margin">Psal. 39.</note> It was trouble ingendered by sinne,
(the occasion onely of al mens miseries,)<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 7. 8</note> opened and
reuealed vnto the conscience by the law, condemned
by iustice to eternall fire, and it continued al night:
yea,<note place="margin">The night represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth hell prison. The bed represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the graue. The sheets of mans fleshe is earth.</note> how much more, the scripture declareth not. In
the which night, the darknesse thereof represented
vnto his eyes outwardly, the horrour of hell prison:
and also his bed, the graue and sepulchre, wherein al
flesh is clad, after the spirite departeth. The shÃ©etes
of mans flesh after this life, be nothing but earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
and earth vnderneath: as whilest it liueth, it
is clad with such vaine thinges as grow vpon the
earth.</p>
                  <p>This whole night in discomfort of the spirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
two notable things.<note place="margin">Two thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be noted.</note> First, howe earnestly
God is angrie in dÃ©ede with sinne, that putteth man
to such long paine for it. And the next, howe grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a God he is, that will not yet suffer the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
spirite to despaire in his discomfort, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
meruellously in the next verse.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>3 When I am in heauinesse I wil thinke vpon God:
when my heart is vexed I will complaine. Sela.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Whilest Asaph was thus troubled in spirite, he
remembred the Lord,<note place="margin">No co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>fort to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted but GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> and called vnto him for helpe.
First, out of this verse it is to be considered, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can quiet the comfortlesse spirit, but GOD a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
But for as much as it sÃ©emeth by the partes of
this Psalme that followeth, that this verse came in
by occasion, rather then to shewe a full remedie for
the Prophetes trouble: I will not write what I
thinke thereof, but deferre the remedie against trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to such other verses as follow: bycause the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
saide before, that his spirite could take no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4397:93"/>
and that a great many of troubles followe,
as the Psalme declareth. It sheweth, that he was
not able to beare the troubles of the minde alone,
without the inuocation and helpe of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
before he expresseth by writing al his troubles:
he writeth also, howe in the middest of them, he did
remember and put his trust in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Out of this we learne, howe necessarie it is in
time at the beginning of troubles and temptations,
to remember the Lord, and to cal vnto him for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
For the more temptations doe growe without
present assistance of Gods grace, the greater is the
damnation, and the more is the daunger thereof: as
we may sÃ©e in the examples of the scripture.</p>
                  <p>Adam fell into anxietie and discomfort of spirite,<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note>
and God immediately tolde him of his fault, and by
Gods grace his discomforted spirite was quieted in
the promises of God:<note place="margin">Note.</note> Caine by the murther of his
brother Abel,<note place="margin">Gene. 4.</note> felt the discomfort of the spirit, and by
neglecting of Gods calling, dyed in the same.<note place="margin">2. Samu. 12</note> Dauid
being admonished by Gods grace, found rest for his
vnquieted spirite:<note place="margin">1. Samu. 31</note> Saule in deferring the remedie
of Gods grace, died comfortlesse. Peter, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
through Gods grace with one looke of Christe,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note>
put away discomfort: Iudas with contemning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
admonitions, dyed in horrible despaire.</p>
                  <p>Whereof we learne to beware, (as much as may
be,) that temptations growe not so farre, that Gods
admonition, or the remembraunce of Gods name be
forgotten: but that we doe in the middest of discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
(as Asaph the Prophet did,) remember and cal
vpon the Lord for help. There is also by this reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
of God, in the discomfort of the spirite, to
be noted, what a vanitie all the world, and worldly
things be for man in time of trouble, when God shal
<pb facs="tcp:4397:94"/>
shew and reueale vnto man his sinnes.<note place="margin">What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> Asaph was.</note> This Asaph
(as we reade in the scripture) was a man, whom for
his vertues and good qualities, king Dauid appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be a Musician for the comfort of many, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the building of the temple of Hierusalem:<note place="margin">1. Paral. 6.</note> Yet
nowe, (as we sÃ©e) he is not able to solace him selfe
with his Musicke, nor yet with any worldly thing:
but this onely comfort is in the Lord. And here the
Prophete declareth the truth of Christes sentence,
written in S. Luke:<note place="margin">Luke. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>What doth it profite a man to
winne all the worlde, and to loose his owne soule?</hi>
What externall riches can comfort the inward spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
troubled with sinne and transgression of Gods
lawe? None at all doubtlesse: as the scripture she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
examples euery where.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Al king Dauids king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was not able to appease his troubled and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted
spirite, when he said to his troubled soule:<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 43</note>
                     <hi>Why art thou so heauie and sad my soule, and why
doest thou trouble me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nowe, this one thing more I will marke in this
verse, and no more, bycause it is more fully vsed by
the Prophete for the comfort of discomforted spirits
in the verses that followe.</p>
                  <p>I sayde, there was two kindes of consolations in
the word of God.<note place="margin">Two kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solations in the worde of God.</note> The one outward in the face and
lesson of the letter: and the other inward, in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
and fÃ©eling of the spirite. And of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision
must great hÃ©ede be taken. For it is not euery
man that readeth and heareth, that Christe dyed for
the remission of sinne, that shall haue the consolation
of the redemption promised in Christes bloud. For
we sÃ©e and reade, (God giue vs grace to learne it,)
that Adam caused his sonnes to heare of his owne
fall in Paradise, and the redemption of his fal in the
bloud of Christe to come,<note place="margin">Gene. 4.</note> as Abel his yonger sonne
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4397:94"/>
right wel perceiued: yet did Caine, hearing the same
consolation, perish in his sinne. There was consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and rest promised vnto all them that came out
of Egypt: but none tooke the benefite thereof, but
Iosua and Caleb. There was in the outward letter
promised consolation vnto all Abrahams children:<note place="margin">Who be the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</note>
but none receiued the commoditie thereof, but suche
as in spirite followed the fayth of Abraham. The
scripture saith in the letter, that GOD would all
men to be saued: yet we sÃ©e such as followe not the
spirite offered,<note place="margin">Consolati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on offered vnto Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in K. Edwardes dayes.</note> be damned. God by his worde in the
time of holy and blessed King Edward the sixt, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
consolation vnto all this realme: yet none shall
inioy it, but suche as in their spirites haue learned,
kept, and do followe the word of consolation. So our
Sauiour Christ in S. Matthew doth say: <hi>Not euery
man that calleth me, Lord, Lorde, shall enter into the
kingdome of God</hi>: but he that followeth in Christ
Gods commaundements.</p>
                  <p>There be a great many at this day (as there were
before our time,) that knowe and speake of such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
as is conteined in the letter, &amp; vtter barke
of Gods worde: but in their consciences they fÃ©ele
not in dÃ©ede the consolation thereof.<note place="margin">Iudas.</note> As Iudas prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
abroad with the rest of his companions, conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the lost shÃ©epe of the house of Israel: but he
shewed vnto others that he felt not him selfe. So did
the Phariseis,<note place="margin">Phariseis.</note> when the scripture was read euery
Saturday in their Synagogues, shew that Messiah
should come to redÃ©eme the worlde: yet they them
selues (for the most part) felt not the consolation in
dÃ©ede, that the scripture did testifie of Christ. Euen so
at this present, many reade this Psalme (and daily
almost in the letter,) whereof if it be in Englishe, he
that vnderstandeth not but the English toung, sÃ©eth
<pb facs="tcp:4397:95"/>
great consolation in the letter, and also in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Asaph, that vsed the Psalme: yet when nÃ©ede
should be, the inward consolation of the Psalme, of
many is nothing felt. The cause is, that either they
vnderstand it not, or else marke it not: eyther they
thinke (as the Papistes doe teach) that to say or sing
the Psalme without vnderstanding and fÃ©eling of it
in the spirite, is sufficient for the worke it selfe, and
that it pleseth God <hi>Ex opere operato,</hi> as they terme it.</p>
                  <p>It is too euident, and also too horrible, (if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God,) that men be contented only with the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
consolation conteined in the word of God. For
if they heare that Gods commaundements be true,
and full of consolation, they be contented to heare of
them in the letter or by speach, and neuer learne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
or fÃ©ele them by heart. The like is in the Articles of
our Christian religion. They be thought to be true
and godly: and yet the most part that so iudge, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
learne them nor fÃ©ele them in their conscience:
Wherefore they doe outwardly and inwardly as
much idolatrie, contrarie to their CrÃ©ed, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of men, as can be deuised: for their
consolation of faith is no more but such an outward
knowledge, as the most men hold withall, without
any proper iudgement, or singular fÃ©eling of their
owne spirites.<note place="margin">Prayer.</note> The same is likewise in prayer. For
in the externall letter, there is so much consolation
as may be: but in the heart of him that prayeth, is
there no vnderstanding nor fÃ©eling of the consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
that outwardly is spoken and talked of. Therefore,
marke this order of the Prophete Asaph. He sayde,
that His spirite could take no consolation in all the
night time, whilest he helde vp his handes. And as
there is not only discomfort and vnquietnes spoken
of, but also felt: not onely noted and written in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4397:95"/>
letter of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> Psalme, but also throughly felt inwardly
in the spirite with heauinesse and anguish, without
comforte and consolation: so in this verse is there
consolation in the letter, in the voice, &amp; in the mouth
mentioned of, &amp; inwardly the same consolation felt
in the spirite. And as outwardly Gods displeasure
troubled him: so inwardly Gods holy name &amp; promi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
comforted him. And this is to be noted, least we
should heare of consolation outwardly, or reade it in
the booke of the holy Bible: and yet inwardly ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fÃ©ele nor knowe any consolation at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Man in trouble without Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>serable.</note>In the end of this verse is put this worde (<hi>Sela.</hi>)
And it doth note vnto the Reader or Hearer, what a
miserable and comfortlesse thing man is in trouble,
if God be not present with him to help him. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
put as a spurre &amp; pricke for euery Christian man
and woman, to remember and call vpon God, in the
days of their troubles. For as the Iewes say, where
so euer this word (<hi>Sela</hi>) is, if doth admonish and stirr
vp the Reader or Hearer, to marke what was saide
before it: for it is a worde alwayes put after very
notable sentences. Then followeth the rest of suche
paines &amp; troubles, as this Prophet suffered, whilest
the Lord laide his crosse vpon him: after this sort.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so feeble I
can not speake.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Before, he saide his spirit could take no consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was a grÃ©efe vnspeakable. For no thought
is able to comprehend the anguish of the mind, much
lesse is the toung able to expresse it. But now he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
a further increase of discomfort, and saith: that
The terrour of his mind was such, that he was not
only comfortlesse, but the Lord also to the increase of
sorrowe, kept slÃ©epe from him. And as the greatnesse
<pb facs="tcp:4397:96"/>
of Gods punishment, suffered him not to slÃ©epe: so
would it not permit him to speake,<note place="margin">Note.</note> but made him
speachlesse: such was the great punishment of God
towardes him.</p>
                  <p>Here is the tyrannie and violence of sinne to be
perceiued and sÃ©ene:<note place="margin">What sinn worketh in man.</note> which is first in this verse to be
noted. It taketh all mirthe from the spirite, and
bringeth in heauinesse and discomfort. It taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
slÃ©ep, and placeth for it tediousnesse and sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
watch. It taketh away also the speache of the
tong, and leaueth the man mute and speachlesse. If
sinne can do so painful things in the body and soule,
whilest they be yet conioyned together, and there is
hope of remission: what can it doe, when the one is
in the earth, and the other in hell separated, or else
both of them conioyned againe in the resurrection
of the wicked, where there is no hope of redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>,
but assuraunce of euerlasting paine? Besides this, it
is to be noted in this verse,<note place="margin">A peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious iuel.</note> conteyning the increase
of the Prophetes heauinesse, what a precious iewel
man or woman hath: that hath a quiet heart and
peaceable conscience. For where so euer they be,
there be all the members of man &amp; woman, wholy
bent vnto the seruice and honouring of God. The
eyes shall neuer be turned from their seruice: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall the toung ceasse (if it be able to speake) to
sound foorth alwayes the glory of God. As Dauid
saith:<note place="margin">Psal. 25. 121.</note> 
                     <hi>Mine eyes be alwayes towardes the Lord.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:<note place="margin">Psa. 123. 131</note>
                     <hi>I lifted vp mine eyes vnto the Lord. As the
eye of the handmaide attendeth vpon her Maistres:
so our eyes attend vpon the Lord.</hi> Againe:<note place="margin">Psal. 132.</note> 
                     <hi>Mine eyes
Lord be not proud.</hi> And in another Psalme he saith,
There should come neither slÃ©epe ne slumber in his
eyes, vntil he had prouided a place for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> arke of God
to rest in. In case the spirite be troubled, or in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4397:96"/>
of Gods lawes, not liking his holy deuises:
the eyes be eyther troubled with ouermuch watch,
(as in this Psalme we sÃ©e:) or else bent to sÃ©e vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the lustes and concupiscence of the flesh and the
world. Wherefore Dauid prayed the Lord,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> to turne
his eyes that they looked not vpon vanitie.<note place="margin">Prou. 17.</note> For the
eye of him that hath not a right spirit, is insatiable.
And many times the eye (wheras the spirit is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the fauour of God) abhorreth Gods owne good
giftes. As the eyes of the Israelites lothed Manna
in the desert, saying: <hi>Our eyes see nothing but Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>:<note place="margin">Num. 11.</note>
euen so the toung also of the godly spirited man
will sound the glory of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 35. 39. 71.</note> as king Dauid vsed his
toung, and will not hinder it by naughtie speach.</p>
                  <p>If the spirite be voyde of Gods feare, then doth
it speake of malice falsly to slander the good, as king
Dauid doth declare: or else for tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>bling or quaking,<note place="margin">Psal. 6. 12. 14. 140.</note>
it can speake nothing at all, as ye may perceiue by
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet Asaph in this place. He that will therfore
consider accordingly, the greatnesse of this feare in
the spirite, and howe it taketh away the office of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
member externall: doubtlesse must labour to
haue the spirite that Dauid prayeth,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> in this sorte:
<hi>Cor mundum crea in me deus, &amp; spiritum rectum innoua
in visceribus meis, Create in me a cleane hart, O Lord,
and renue in me a right spirite.</hi> In the which verse
the Prophete prayeth first, to haue such an heart, as
by faith in Christe may be cleane and purged from
sinne: and next, to haue a certeine and sure spirite,
that doubteth nothing of Gods promises towardes
him. For, such a spirite within the body of man or
woman, maketh the heart so ioyfull, that no sorrow
can molest it: and it strengtheneth so euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that they will be giuen to nothing so much as to
the seruice of God. But if the spirit be wicked, dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="tcp:4397:97"/>
the outwarde members will serue nothing but
iniquitie: if it be troubled, the outwarde members
can not be quiet. For as the soule giueth life to the
body:<note place="margin">Note.</note> so doth the vertue of God in the soule, drawe
the outward partes of the body vnto the obedience
of vertue. And contrariwise,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 8. 12.</note> the vice of the soule
draweth the members of the body vnto the seruice
of sinne and iniquitie. And as the eares and eyes of
man were made by God,<note place="margin">Vnto what vse the eys &amp; eares of man were created.</note> to be instruments to heare
and sÃ©e Gods will and pleasure,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> &amp; by them (sith man
fell in Paradise) knowledge might come into the
soule and spirit of man, by hearing Gods word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
&amp; sÃ©eing his sacraments ministred: so by them
abused, in hearing and seeing of sinne and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
there entreth into the soule much vile filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and transgression. The Prophete Asaph (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
doth admonish vs to beware that we bring not
our spirites into discomfort, by sinne and transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Gods lawes: for if we do, whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offence
be done in the spirite, by the euill that naturally is
in it, by originall sinne, by the temptation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
or by the meanes of any member of the body:
doubtlesse the trouble of the spirit shal not only take
away the office of the members, (as ye sÃ©e in this
place the speache of the toung, and the closing of
the eyes, be taken away:) but at the length also,
God shall make the same body and the same mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to rise againe at the generall resurrection,<note place="margin">Iacob. 19.</note> and
they shall suffer with the wicked spirite eternall
paines.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> Let this doctrine therefore teach all men to
knowe and fÃ©ele the crueltie of sinne, that so paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
vnquieteth doth body and soule, and think that
if these grudgings, discomforts, terrours and feares
be so great, that death it selfe is more tollerable and
easie to beare: howe much more intollerable and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4397:97"/>
vnspeakeable be the paines of hell, which God hath
ordeined for all impenitent sinners?<note place="margin">Esaie. 66.</note> After this verse
of trouble and anguish,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> whereas we sÃ©e slÃ©epe taken
from the eyes, and speach from the tongue: followeth
next, how these great sorrowes were mollified and
somewhat diminished.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>5 I haue considered the dayes of old: and the yeres
that be past.</p>
                     <p>6 In the night I called to remembrance my song,
and communed with mine owne heart: and my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
searched diligently.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>I did (sayth the Prophet) in this great discomfort
and heauinesse, consider with my selfe the times and
worlds of old, wherein the Lord had holpen and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
my fathers before my time, from such trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
as I am in, and also from greater. And in the
night, while I was slÃ©eplesse, I remembred that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times I lauded and exalted the goodnes of God in
my Psalms and Hymns, giuing him thanks for his
great mercie and goodnes vsed towards his Church
at all times: and in remembring Gods accustomed
clemencie and pitie, my spirite was much giuen to
debate thinges.</p>
                  <p>Out of these two verses we may note diuers doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
for our consolation in the dayes of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.<note place="margin">Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in trouble.</note>
And the first (after my minde) shalbe concerning
the two brightnesse and the two darkenesse in the
word of God. The one brightnesse is in the letter
outwardly, and the other brightnesse is in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
and heart of the reader of the Scripture. This
brightnesse or claritie of the letter is this, when by
reading, hearing, or thinking of Gods word: men
learne and knowe that God made all thinges, and
<pb facs="tcp:4397:98"/>
that he preserueth all thinges, and that Iesus Christ
his onely sonne is the mediatour betwÃ©ene God and
man, and that he pacified Gods iust ire against man
by his bitter death and passion. Also he knoweth by
the externall histories of the Scripture, that GOD
hath deliuered many times his people from dangers
and perils, in maner impossible to be holpen.</p>
                  <p>This claritie and brightnesse of the Scripture,
although it be necessarie: yet it is not sufficient: for
if standeth alone in bare and naked knowledge, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
before God saueth no, neither illuminateth the
man that hath the knowledge in a sufficient claritie
and brightnesse of faith, and of Gods promises due
in Christ vnto faith.<note place="margin">Gene. 12. 13. 15. 16. 17</note> As we may sÃ©e, how the children
of Israel had the external claritie and brightnesse of
Gods promises vnto Abraham, Isahac, and Iacob,
that they and their posteritie should inherite y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lande
of Canaan, that flowed with all plentie and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
yet notwithstanding such as came out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
for the most part,<note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> perished in the desart &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.
The Phariseis and learned men amongest
the Iewes,<note place="margin">Mich. 5.</note> had the clearenesse and brightnesse of
Christes comming,<note place="margin">Matth. 2.</note> &amp; of the place he should be borne
in, and told in that part the trueth vnto Herod: yet
did they for all this knowledge and claritie, abhorre
Christ when he came, and put him to death most
wrongfully. The people in like sort saw an external
brightnesse in Christ,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> that by his miracles and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
they thought him worthie to be made a king:<note place="margin">Mark. 15. Luke 20. Iohn. 19. Iohn. 6. Luke 4.</note>
and yet for all this, they cryed out against him: <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifige
eum, crucifige eum, Crucifie him, crucifie him.</hi>
The diuel himselfe said he knewe who Christ was,
the sonne of the most highest: and yet for all this
knowledge and clearenesse shall he neuer be saued.<note place="margin">Matth 7.</note>
And Christ himselfe also perceiued that this external
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4397:98"/>
brightnesse was amongest a great many that called
him Lord, Lord: Yet notwithstanding he said, they
should not enter into the ioyes of heauen. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be there very many at this present time, that
sÃ©e the claritie and brightnesse of Christ outwardly
in the letter, and yet follow it not here in liuing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall they haue the effect of their knowledge in
the life to come: for their clearenesse is onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
without fÃ©eling or practise of the brightnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly:<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note>
which deserueth more stripes then obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or darkenesse doth.</p>
                  <p>There is another claritie or brightnes, which is
an inward vnderstanding and spirituall knowledge
and sight of Gods trueth, which no man hath but he
that is possessed with the spirite of God: that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
he readeth in Gods word himselfe, or heareth
preached of other men, he vnderstandeth it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
vnto it gladly, and willingly. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
God spake vnto Adam,<note place="margin">Genes. 3.</note> and his wordes made
him afeard, so that he trembled for feare. Christ spake
vnto Paule, and he fell downe flatt,<note place="margin">Actes. 9.</note> and could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the peril of Christes voyce: So that as the lawe
rebuked sinne in the voice and letter, it wrought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
rebuke and discomfort in the hearts of Adam and
Paul, and made them afraid inwardly, as the voice
and letter was terrible outwardly. Wherefore they
had not onely an externall clearenesse of Gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
against sinne, but also an internall sight and fÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the same, as the Scripture doth record.</p>
                  <p>The like is also in the promises of God, when
they be preached or read, that promise remission of
sinne. The inward claritie and brightnesse of the
same, is to fÃ©ele priuately euery man and woman in
his owne conscience (through faith in Christ) that
the same promises doe apperteine and belong vnto
<pb facs="tcp:4397:99"/>
himselfe. As the Prophet Abacuc saith:<note place="margin">Abacuc. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>The iust
man liueth by his owne faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> Also Christ said
vnto the woman of Canaan, that it was not good to
cast the bread that apperteined to the children, vnto
dogges:<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> she said, <hi>Yes Lord: for the dogges do eate of
the crumbes that fall from their maisters table.</hi> And
so doth Christ himselfe vse the brightnesse of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
to Marie Magdalene:<note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy sinnes be forgiuen
thee.</hi> Applying the clearenesse of the letter, vnto the
inward comfort of her soule.</p>
                  <p>The same is likewise meruellously expressed in
the common crÃ©ede, whereas euery man saith: HÃ©e
belÃ©eueth in God the father, God the sonne, and God
the holy Ghost, and that he belÃ©eueth the remission
of sinnes: meaning, that whosoeuer saith his crÃ©ed,
should sÃ©e &amp; feele in his soule the claritie and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his saluation, that is conteined in the letter
and wordes of the crÃ©ede. But this clearenesse is not
sÃ©ene of all men, nor yet of the most part of men: As
Christ declareth:<note place="margin">Matt. 20. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Many be called and fewe chosen.</hi>
Many say: Lord, Lord, and fewe doe the Lords will.
Therefore Christ saith meruellously concerning the
claritie and brightnesse of Gods word inwardly, in
S. Luke: <hi>Blessed be they that heare the word of God
and keepe it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 11.</note> By the which words he declareth, that
many heare and sÃ©e the outward light and trueth of
Gods word: but very fewe there be that sÃ©e the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
light and profite thereof. Of this is learned
what the cause is that Christians beare the name of
Christ, and yet be not Christes in dÃ©ede: for because
a great many be contented with the name, and few
do vnderstand what the name truly and verily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
in it.</p>
                  <p>And as there is in the Scripture this double
brightnesse, whereof the one lyeth in the letter, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4397:99"/>
many sÃ©e what it meaneth by the externall word,
and the other lieth in the meaning of the letter, and
is perceiued onely by such as haue the spirit of God:
so is there two kindes and sortes of darkenesse and
obscuritie in the Scripture: the one in the letter, and
the other in the sense and taking of the letter. The
outward obscuritie is to be sÃ©en in such as contemne
the word of God, and wil not read it nor heare it. As
the Turkes and heathen, and also the common sort
that beare the name of Christe, be christened in
Christes name, and outwardly be taken to be very
Christians in dÃ©ede, and yet they know not so much
as the letter of Christs lawes, that prescribeth them
what they should doe, and what they should not doe.
And this obscuritie is a brutish, beastly, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
darkenesse.</p>
                  <p>The other is obscuritie or darkenesse inwardly
in the text.<note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie.</note> For although the letter be well knowne,
and the sound thereof sÃ©emeth to be plaine: yet the
sense is not so common nor so manifest as the letter
soundeth. Wherevppon S. Paule bindeth all men
in the vnderstanding of the letter, vnto the Analogie
and proportion of faith, that no one place be taken
contrarie to many places. Whereof was gathered
the abridgement of our common CrÃ©ede, accepted at
all times and of all Christian men, for an infallible
trueth: so that whosoeuer belÃ©eued it, was accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a good Christian man. And of this obscuritie of
the Scripture in the sense and spirite, is risen this
troublesome contention about transubstantiation
of bread and wine in the sacrament of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and bloud. For the vngodly sort would haue no
substance of bread and wine to remaine in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and yet a corporall presence of bodie and
bloud: contrarie, not onely to the articles of our
<pb facs="tcp:4397:100"/>
faith,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> that telleth vs he is in heauen, and shall abide
there vntil he come to iudge the quick and the dead:<note place="margin">Marke 14.</note>
but also contrarie to many other places of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note place="margin">Luke. 12.</note>
And this is no new thing,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 11.</note> to haue and record
the text and letter of the Scripture, and yet lack the
effect and the very consolation of the Scripture in
dÃ©ede.<note place="margin">Actes 3.</note> For here in these two verses the Prophet A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph
doth record and remember Gods doings merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully<note place="margin">Coloss. 3.</note>
in time past, and yet taketh no more consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof: then he findeth in the barke of the letter,
or in the rehearsall of the histories. And the same he
doth of his owne Psalmes and Hymnes, wherof he
maketh mention, and yet by the same meane his
spirite is brought into no further considerations of
Gods trueth then it was before: with much heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and sorrow, as the verses following do declare:
So that in the affliction of the spirit he could repeate
and cal to his remembrance the truth, how God had
delt mercifully with his forefathers, but felt not at
that present the like mercie of God towardes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
neither could he sÃ©e nor fÃ©ele for his consolation
the ease and succour of Gods promises which he saw
in others: as all the electes of God at lengthe shall
doubtlesse fÃ©ele: As it is said by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Psalm. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>Sicut
audiuimus, sic vidimus, As we haue heard, so haue wee
seene</hi>: and at length (as the Psalme saith) he felt him
selfe. Whether he wrote the Psalme of his own sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
and troubles, or of the sorrows and troubles
of the Israelits, it maketh no matter: let euery man
in that case vse his owne iudgment, so that he mark
the doctrine of the Psalme.</p>
                  <p>There is to be noted of these verses also this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
that what soeuer trouble y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit was brought
vnto, whatsoeuer watch had taken his eyes, &amp; what
soeuer vehemencie of disease had taken his speach
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4397:100"/>
from him: yet vnder all these crosses he cursed not
God, nor grudged against his plagues, but as a man
contented, gaue himselfe to record and to call to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
how God was wont to be vnto men afflicted,
and tooke accompt how in times past he had spent
his yeares, and found that he had made certeine
Psalmes or Hymnes to the glorie of God, and to the
praise of his holy name. Of the which we learne not
onely patience in the time of trouble and persequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but also how to spend our youth and transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
life in doing or making some thinges, that may
be recordes and remembrances when we be gonne,
that we liued here to serue God, and not to serue our
selues. And it is a great helpe and no small consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for a man that is in trouble &amp; heauines, to thinke
that he in his life before sought the glorie of God: &amp;
that testimonie of conscience is more worth in the
time of trouble, then all other mens dÃ©edes for him.
Not in that his sÃ©eking Gods glorie &amp; setting foorth
of the same, can be his gage and raunsome before
God: but because it is a very testimonie, that God
once loued him, and gaue him of his blessed spirite,
to indite something to Gods praise and honour. And
as godly Psalmes and vertuous Hymnes, be testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of a vertuous spirite: so be wanton and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous
ballads, records of a vicious and sinnefull
spirite. And as the remembrance of good &amp; vertuous
workes in the time of sicknes and trouble, be ioyful
and comfortable: so is the remembrance of wicked
doinges sorrowful and painefull.</p>
                  <p>We be therefore taught by this Prophete to be
circumspect and warie, how we accumulate &amp; heape
vppon our soules infidelitie, and the wicked workes
thereof: for as they be the only cause of trouble, so do
they not onely worke trouble, but also increase trou-
<pb facs="tcp:4397:101"/>
and augment the heauinesse of the spirit and paines
of the body, as is declared meruellously by the graue
and profound sentences following. Wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
what it was that his spirite searched so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
for. It was this.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>7 Will the Lord absent himselfe for euer? and wil
he be no more intreated?</p>
                     <p>8 Is his mercie cleane gone for euer? And is his
promise come vtterly to an end for euermore?</p>
                     <p>9 Hath God forgotten to be gratious? And will
he shutt vp his louing kindnesse in displeasure?</p>
                     <p>10 And I said, It is mine owne weakenes: but the
right hand of God can chaunge these thinges.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>These verses declare what mindes and cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do happen to men that be in sicknes or trouble:<note place="margin">The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled spirite is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note>
and how grÃ©euous they be vnto the patient.</p>
                  <p>Out of these verses first we sÃ©e a common rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
of the great terrour and feare of the fÃ©eling of
Gods displeasure and anger towards the wofull spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
for sinne. The first meditation of the sinnefull
spirite was this: <hi>Will the Lord absent himselfe for
euer?</hi> This may be vnderstood two maner of wayes.
For this English word (<hi>euer</hi>) hath two meanings
in the Hebrue tonge. Sometime it is taken for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and time euerlasting:<note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>brance of Gods iustice for sinne: is greater paine then the death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</note> sometime for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
yeres, and the life of men. If it be taken in this
place for time euerlasting, the sorrowes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
were the greater, when he reuelued with his
spirite, that God iustly for sinne might cast him into
euerlasting paines: the remembraunce whereof is
greater paine, then the mortall death of the bodie. If
this word (<hi>euer</hi>) be taken for a certeine time, and the
life of man, then meaneth the Prophet thus: Will
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4397:101"/>
God as long as I liue absent himselfe? And thus
continue me in heauines of spirite and sorrowes, as
long as I liue? Which sense soeuer be taken, there
be profitable thinges to be learned of it. But I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the latter sense to be the better for diuers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
First in this, that the Psalme conteineth the
complaint and prayer of the Prophet, a man of God,
that cannot be brought to this desperation, that he
should be cast away for euer from the fauour of God
vnto eternall paines. And the text that saith: <hi>It is
mine owne infirmitie, and the right hand of the Lord
can chaunge this</hi>: doth beare with this latter sense
and explanation. For the words be of great weight,
and of meruellous wisedome and consolation, and do
declare, that although the Prophete felt the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God against sinne, and was in a meruellous
terror &amp; feare with the horror and sight of his sinns:
yet the spirite of God did testifie with his spirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that
he was the child of God,<note place="margin">A godly consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and that it was a paine and
punishment of the soule and body, and not a despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and thorough casting away and absenting of
Gods mercie. For the very electes of God be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
so ordeined,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 10.</note> so preserued and kept, that nothing
is able to take them out of Gods hand. For the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men in the Scripture, did reioyce, with the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Gods certein promise: and did not presume
to do euill, as S. Paule in sundrie places doth giue
testimonie: Once to the Romanes, where as he felt
and perceiued the filthines of sinne, &amp; the iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God against the same:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> as it appeareth by
his wofull crie and complaint, <hi>Oh wretched man
that I am, who shall deliuer mee from this body sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
vnto death?</hi> He felt (as we may perceiue) the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
burden and weight of Gods displeasure, and yet
in the midst of terror and feare, he stayed assuredly in
<pb facs="tcp:4397:102"/>
the mercie of God through Christ.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 15.</note> And the same he
writeth also to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.</note> &amp; to his disciple Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie:
that his death was at hand, &amp; that he knew
(although his quarell were neuer so good,) that he of
himselfe was a sinner, and by sinne worthie reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; casting away from God: yet he said that Christ
had in kÃ©eping for him a crowne of iustice, whiche he
should assuredly receiue at the day of his death. God
is contented that his chosen people, shall suffer and
beare the burden and heauinesse of temptation and
feare of euerlasting paine,<note place="margin">Genes. 3.</note> as Adam did first in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
Dauid many times,<note place="margin">Psalm. 42. 43.</note> Iob, and others: yea
Christ himselfe,<note place="margin">Iob 3.</note> that said his soule was heauie euen
vnto death,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> which made him sweat both water and
bloud.<note place="margin">Nothing can hurt him that is in Christ Iohn. 6.</note> But these temptations and terrors shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ouercome and cast away the person that hath his
faith in Christ: for none is able to take his shÃ©epe out
of his hand. Yet God withdraweth his hand many
times, and suffereth his to be tempted and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortlesse,
and as it were cleane ouerthrowen: not that
in dÃ©ede their election can be altered,<note place="margin">Note.</note> or they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
left comfortlesse vntill the end of their liues,<note place="margin">Iob. 3. 42.</note>
but for a time: as ye may sÃ©e by Iob, who spake as
horrible words, and as desperatly as might be. Yet
sÃ©e in the end of his booke, and marke what a ioyfull
outgoing his grÃ©euous temptations had. What pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
cryes were these of Christ our Sauiour vppon
the crosse? <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
me?</hi> Yet the end was, <hi>Father into thy handes I
commend my spirite.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 27. Marke. 15. Luke 22. Iohn. 19.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm. 34. Actes. 14.</note>It is written that we must enter into heauen by
many troubles. <note place="margin">The trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the minde is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</note>Now, of all troubles, the trouble of
the minde and of the spirite is the greatest. Who
then can enter into heauen without such troubles?
Doubtlesse no man. For the iudgement of God must
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4397:102"/>
begin at his house, as Saint Pater saith: That is to
say,<note place="margin">1. Peter. 4.</note> None shall in this life more fÃ©ele Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
for sinne in the spirite,<note place="margin">Prouer. 12.</note> nor suffer more aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the bodie,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> then such as be of Gods owne hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and very electes. Wherefore we be admonished
in the troubles and sorrowes that this Prophete A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph
susteined in his soule that could not rest, and in
his bodie that could not slÃ©epe nor speake, that good
men be not frÃ©e from aduersitie,<note place="margin">God hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a time to trie vs.</note> and that aduersities
(be they neuer so great) shall not separate men from
God for euer, but for a time he punisheth sinne and
hideth the consolation of God from vs: As the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith:<note place="margin">Esaie. 54.</note> 
                     <hi>For a time, a little while I haue forsaken
thee, but I will gather thee together in wonderfull
mercies. In a short time of my wrath I hidd my face
a while from thee, but I will haue mercie vppon thee
for euer: saith the Lord thy redeemer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All men that shall profitably knowe and fÃ©ele the
certeintie of Gods promises in this life, and enioy
them in the life to come, shall be troubled with some
paine of doubtfulnes of them,<note place="margin">Genes. 3.</note> before he come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
For as by sinne death entered into the flesh,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note>
and also the flesh is subiect vnto sicknesse and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie:
so is there entered into the soule and powers
thereof,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 8.</note> by reason of sinne, great imperfection. As
the minde of all men is burdened with ignorance,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note>
the heart with contumacie,<note place="margin">Psalm. 53.</note> and the will with fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse,
so that as they be before regeneration
and knowledge of God in all godly matters starke
blind, very obstinate, and naturally altogether fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
euen so after regeneration and the knowledge
of God, they continually resist and fight against the
spirite, not onely of man, in whome these powers
dwell:<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> but also against the spirite of God,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
and leadeth the spirite of man to eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:
<pb facs="tcp:4397:103"/>
So that it is not man that is able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the wickednesse of his owne soule.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 2.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sÃ©eing life through grace dwelt in a bodie natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
full of sinne, Saint Paule said,<note place="margin">Galath. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>I doe liue: yet
not I, but Christ liueth in mee.</hi> So this Prophete
Asaphe sÃ©emeth in wordes to be starke dead from
grace,<note place="margin">Psalm. 77.</note> but it was not for euer: for he felt the spirite
of God that told him, that such heauie and vngodly
thoughtes of his spirit came of his owne infirmitie,
and that Gods right hand could alter and chaunge
them. And this is the difference betwÃ©ene the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the godly and vngodly: as it is wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sett foorth in the Psalme next before this sauing
one, where it is said:<note place="margin">Psalm. 75.</note> 
                     <hi>There is a cuppe in the Lordes
hand full of redd wine, and hee powreth out of it, but
the wicked shall drinke the dregges thereof, and the
vngodly of the earth shall receiue the bottom of it.</hi>
The cuppe in the Scripture is taken many times
for aduersitie,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> whereof God filleth a quantitie and a
certeine measure vnto all his electe and chosen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes:<note place="margin">Marke. 14.</note>
but the wicked shall drinke the bottome
and all,<note place="margin">Esaie. 66.</note> and neuer come to rest nor ease.<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Out of this temptation we may learne how foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and how impatient we be. When God sendeth
troubles,<note place="margin">Prouerb. 3</note> we thinke such to be best at ease that want
them:<note place="margin">Apoca. 3.</note> whereas the Lords booke declareth, that it is
necessarie,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> and also very expedient, that we should
haue them. Againe, there is to be noted how that the
Prophet in the cogitations of his minde,<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no mention of the griefe of the body.</note> maketh no
mention of the griefe of the bodie, whereof he spake
before at the beginning of his troubles. For in the
second and fourth verse he declareth how he held vp
his handes all night, cryed with his voyce vntill he
was speachlesse, and lay waking &amp; could not slÃ©epe.
Of the which sorrowes now he maketh no rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4397:103"/>
but saith: his spirite was searching and inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
Whether God would absent himselfe for euer,
with diuers like interrogatories of Gods nature, as
followe in the Psalme. Whereof we learne the
vilenesse of our owne nature, and also the treason
and subtiltie of the diuel. For as long as we sinne,
we haue such delight and pleasure therin, as though
it were but a play to transgresse and breake Gods
holy commaundementes.<note place="margin">Note.</note> But when sickenesse and
trouble haue layed the wicked the bodie abedd.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> and
made it weake and fÃ©eble:<note place="margin">Gal. 2. 3.</note> our conscience is waked
by the Lawe of GOD, and we put in such terrour
and feare, that nothing can quiet vs. Also, as long
as we doe sinne, the diuel beareth vs in hande that
God is so mercifull, (doe what we will,) that hÃ©e
will not be angrie: but when sicknesse or death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uadeth,
then turneth the diuel his tale, and persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
with vs, that GOD is onely extreme iust,
and nothing at all mercifull. And this griefe of
the minde is so sore and vehement, that all the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the bodie sÃ©eme nothing in comparison there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
as we sÃ©e in this place by the holy Prophete A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph,
that was very sore vnquieted in his bodie, yet
did his spirite make no accompt of it, but still hÃ©e
stayed and staggered, trembling and quaking at the
heauinesse and sorrowe of the spirite, that could not
fÃ©ele, for the time of his trouble, any certeintie or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
in the promises of God.</p>
                  <p>Of this we be admonished, that whatsoeuer we
haue, if Gods fauour lacke, we haue nothing able to
reioyce vs. And of the other side, if we lacke all
thinges, and haue assuredly Gods fauour, there is
nothing able to make vs heauie and sorowfull: As
we see king Saule, hauing a noble kingdome, and
lacking the fauour of God, was alwayes vnquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<pb facs="tcp:4397:104"/>
Poore Dauid hauing the grace and fauour of
God, was quiet and contented with all thinges, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>If God will, he may restore mee: if he will not,
his will be done.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Reg. 16. 1. Reg. 24. 2. Reg. 16. 15. 2. Tim. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The assurance of Gods promises made Paule
glad to die: and the mistrust &amp; desperation of Gods
promises,<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> made Iudas wearie to liue. The certein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Gods trueth made Saint StÃ©euen quietly to
die in the assurance of eternall life:<note place="margin">Actes 7.</note> the vncerteintie
and doubtfulnesse of Gods mercie caused Saule to
die in the feare of eternall death.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 31.</note> Riches of this
world be treasures muche estÃ©emed and made of:
friendes and louers much sought for and warily
kept, and health of bodie highly regarded and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with much care: yet, if the soule be destitute of
the assurance of Gods grace, the rest sÃ©eme to be of
no valure at all.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 16.</note> As we sÃ©e, Saule in his kingdome
with riches, strength, and friendship: yet his minde
vexed still an euill spirite, and Gods spirite depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
his sorrowes were incomparable. So that we
learne that not onely the goodes apperteyning to the
body be nothing worthe, whereas the spirite wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the grace of God: but also, whereas the spirite
is troubled, the goodes of the bodie be little felt and
nothing passed of: as we sÃ©e by this Prophet in this
Psalme.</p>
                  <p>The other part of his cogitations in the time of
his sicknesse was this: <hi>Will hee be no more intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</hi>
This grÃ©euous temptation, whether GOD
would be intreated to forgiue sinne any more, may
haue two vnderstandings: The one generally, and
the other particularly. Generally in this sort, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God once offended, will be mercifull and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
or not? Particularly, whether God, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is mercifull, will forgiue the priuate man, that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4397:104"/>
sÃ©eketh by saith, mercie, as he hath in time past for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen
al men that asked it with repentance in faith?
The first sense and taking of the text generally, is
meruellous wicked and blasphemous, to thinke
that God once offended with any man, will neuer
for giue againe? Of this opinion was Caine,<note place="margin">Genes. 4.</note> when
he said his sinnes were greater then they might be
forgiuen: and he thought God would be no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
because he iudged his fault greater then the
mercie of God that forgiueth faultes. And whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
this iudgement of the spirite is, this sentence
is verified: God will be intreated no more.</p>
                  <p>And as euery man that is priuatly thus minded,
that his owne sinnes be greater then can be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
euen so hath he the like minde and iudgement
also of all other mens sinnes that be like vnto his,<note place="margin">A wicked iudgment.</note>
thinking them to be greater then they may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen.
For he that despaireth of his owne faultes,
cannot thinke well that other mens faults as great
as his owne,<note place="margin">Matth. 27. 26.</note> be remissible. As Iudas that hanged
himselfe for betraying of Christe, could not thinke
well of Peter that denied Christ: but rather iudged
of Peter as he did of him selfe, saying: God will be
intreated no more.</p>
                  <p>Of this wicked iudgment of Gods mercie, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will be intreated any more of a sinner, after
that he hath sinned: I wil speake no more. But they
that lust to read how horrible a thing it is, may haue
many Psalmes that do declare it: namely Psalme
10.<note place="margin">Psalme. 10<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and 73.</note> and 73. In the one of them it is said by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
that God hath forgotten the earth, and careth
neither for the godly life of the godly and vertuous,
nor the vngodly life of the vngodly and wicked. And
in the other Psalme they make a doubt, Whether
there be any knowledge in God of man and of his
<pb facs="tcp:4397:105"/>
life, or not. But these sortes of people be too horrible
and blasphemous, and not to be rehearsed or muche
spoken of.</p>
                  <p>The other sense of this place that is more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
is the better sense for the argument and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Psalme: that is, to aske whether God
will be intreated no more, as touching the remission
of his owne sinne: or els whether God will be no
more mercifull to helpe him out of trouble, that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
and particularly suffereth the trouble. And
this question so asked, is very common and familiar
to the Christians, and putteth them to great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and heauinesse. As we may sÃ©e that this Prophet
Asaphe considered the yeares before him, and what
God did to his elders, and found that they receiued
remission of their sinnes, and great benefites in this
world at Gods hand. So do a great number of men
in hearing and reading the Scripture of God, sÃ©e
and perceiue the remission of many mens sinns, and
how mercifully God delt with them: yet when they
fÃ©ele their owne sinne, and suffer their owne crosse
and trouble, they haue much a doe, and with great
difficultie doe they belÃ©eue that God will be as good
vnto them, being priuate sinners and priuately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
as he was vnto the great number of those, of
whom they read in the Scripture, that God forgaue
them their sinnes, and preserued them in most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and daungerous troubles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A whole man can giue good counsel to the sicke: but being sicke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply the same to his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort.</note>Therefore, this is a common wisedome and daily
experimented sentence, <hi>Omnes, cÃ¹m valemus, bonum,
consilium aegrotis damus. When other men be sicke, we
can giue good counsell patiently to beare it.</hi> When
other men be afflicted and troubled, we can speake
of many meanes to quiet them. When they be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mistrust of Gods promises, we can comfort them
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4397:105"/>
with many arguments of faith: but most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if we be sicke our selues, troubled, or in mistrust
of Gods promises, we can ease or comfort our selues
very little. And good cause why: for God that giueth
of his owne gist and only frÃ©e liberalitie, wisedome,
knowledge, learning, and consolation: giueth also
the grace that the saide vertues may worke their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
and expell the infirmities and diseases,
wherefore these wisedomes and vertues were ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
As it is meruellously noted of Saint Paule:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>I
haue planted, &amp; Apollo hath watered: but God gaue
the increase.</hi> The word of God is a meanes to teach
truth,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> and to condemne falshood: to place vertue, and
to remoue vice:<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 28.</note> to giue consolation, and to banishe
and put away diffidence and mistrust: but God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
and worketh the effect thereof.<note place="margin">Act. 16.</note> Meate is made
to preserue the body: but if God giueth not strength,
it misseth the purpose.<note place="margin">Prou. 21.</note> The horse and man be means
to ouercome: but in battell God giueth the victory.
The preacher preacheth Gods word: but God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
and teacheth the mysterie therof. Man heareth:
but God giueth the vnderstanding. Asaph remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Gods workes, and had in minde his own god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Psalmes: but God must giue the consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>. He
sawe the trueth, and knewe that God was faithful:
but the ioy and profite thereof, lay in the distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and gift of God: as we may wel perceiue by this
sorrowfull interrogatorie: <hi>Will he be intreated no
more?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of this part we learne howe we ought,<note place="margin">When we heare or reade gods promises, wee ought to pray.</note> when
we reade or heare Gods promises for our saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to pray: and howe necessarie a thing this prayer
is that godly men made in the scripture: <hi>Lord help
my incredulitie: Lord increase our faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark. 9.</note> The poore
man that heard and sawe Christes mercy and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie<note place="margin">Luke. 17.</note>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4397:106"/>
in healing of others, desired also helth for his
owne childe, Christe saide: if he belÃ©eued, all things
were possible: the poore man sayd: <hi>I beleeue Lorde,
helpe mine vnbeleefe.</hi> The Apostles, when they
heard Christe speake of forgiuenesse of one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they sayde: <hi>Increase our faith, good Lord.</hi> As
though they had sayd: Except thou giue vs strength
to belÃ©eue and credite thy godly lessons: we shal take
no commoditie nor profite by them. Therefore let
the preacher of God, the reader of Gods worde, the
hearer of Gods worde, &amp; the thinker vpon the same,
many times before, also whilest they be speaking,
thinking, reading, or hearing of Gods word, pray in
their spirits, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God may work in them
the thing, wherfore the word was instituted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> or else we shall be (as Saint Paule
saith) alwayes learners, and yet neuer come to the
knowledge of the truth.</p>
                  <p>And I do verily thinke, and am truly persuaded,
that for lacke of earnest and continuall prayer, with
lifting vp of my heart vnto God, whilest I preached
his most holy word vnto the people, God iudgeth me
not worthy to sÃ©e such fruites of my labours as I
hoped for. And for this, that the people did not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
pray, to vnderstand Gods pleasure by his word
preached, they be accounted vnworthy of such salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as GOD did offer them by his worde, and the
true preaching of his mysteries. Let all men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pray to God in Christ, that they may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the hearing, recording, remembring, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of Gods word. For notwithstanding they haue
amongest them the booke of God: yet shall they be
troubled (without Gods singular grace) with one of
these two euils: either to mocke and scorne at the
scripture, caring not whether they learne it or no:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4397:106"/>
or else when they haue learned it, to dout whether it
be true or no. And then followeth these questions:
<hi>Will God absent him selfe for euer?</hi> And, <hi>Will God
be no more intreated?</hi> with such other doubtes as do
followe in this Psalme: with much heauinesse vnto
the spirite where such demaundes rest &amp; haue place.
Then followeth the third demaunde by this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Prophete: <hi>Is his mercy cleane gone for euer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here in this demaund first be two things to be
noted: The one declaring a fault in the Prophetes
faith: and the other expressing a veritie in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
knowledge. The fault in his faith, was to
doubt or to stande in a mamering of Gods mercy,
which is most sure and endureth for euer and euer:
and to aske this question, Whether his mercy were
cleane gone for euer? The veritie of his knowledge
was to iudge and say, that It was his mercy that
forgaue sinnes, and not his or any other mens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
that could deserue the pardoning of sinne: As
ye may sÃ©e how sinneful Saule for his sinne,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 15.</note> thought
to haue appeased God with sacrifice,<note place="margin">Luke. 18.</note> and the proude
PharisÃ©e with his pretenced good workes. But here
in this knowledge, that the Prophet complained of
the departure of Gods mercy, is set foorth, that only
mercy appeaseth Gods ire in Christ, for the sinne of
man.<note place="margin">Exod. 34.</note> And what works so euer be done, except Gods
mercy pardon the sinne,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 7.</note> they all can neyther please
God,<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 51. 56. 85.</note> nor quiet the conscience and troubled spirite of
him that doth the workes.<note place="margin">Psal. 130. 143.</note> As it may be sÃ©ene in the
example of Sainte Peter, and the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
When that Saint Peter walked vpon the sea
comming towardes Christ,<note place="margin">Matth. 14.</note> and felt the wind strong
and tempestuous, he beganne to feare: and when he
beganne to sincke, he cryed: <hi>Lord saue me.</hi> And the
Lord put foorth his hande and tooke him, &amp; sayd vnto
<pb facs="tcp:4397:107"/>
him: <hi>Thou of little faith, why doubtest thou?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we sÃ©e, if GOD did helpe vs no more of his
mercy,<note place="margin">Note.</note> then our owne merites deserued, or else no
more then the gifts of God, faith, hope, and charitie,
as they be qualities in vs: we should surely perish.
Therefor this place of the Prophete Asaph, where
he demaundeth this question: Whether Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
be gone for euer? doth teach vs, that of all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
we should be most assured of this: that onely
mercy is the help of mans troubles and damnation.
But as I saide before, there were two maner of cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
and brightnesse in the word of God: so nowe
I say,<note place="margin">Two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> there is two manner of mercies of God men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the scripture: The outwarde mercy is in
the letter which men reade and sing euery day, and
speake and talke of: but the other is inward.</p>
                  <p>When that men can not fÃ©ele Gods mercy in their
conscience, as they heare it spoken of, and as they
reade it in the booke, they be troubled and full of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
and paine: and as long as they be in this case,
without Gods mercy, they can do nothing that ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
GOD, or content them selues. But as soone as
the spirite is assured and fÃ©eleth, that GOD for his
mercy doth forgiue and forget the iniquitie that the
spirite and body haue committed and done against
God, it reioyceth and is so glad, that it will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that, which pleseth and is acceptable vnto
God, and in Christ shall content and quiet his owne
conscience. As for example: Adam before he inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
felt the mercy of God promised in Christe,<note place="margin">Gene. 3.</note> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
and remit his sinne and offence: in what hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse
was the poore man? He hid him selfe, and
could not abide the voyce of the liuing God: for he
felt that his doings pleased neyther GOD nor him
selfe. But when grace had assured him of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4397:107"/>
he fell in the spirit to quietnesse.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> For where the
spirite of God testifieth and beareth record with the
spirite of man, that he is the childe of God, there is
ioy and consolation, with this ioyfull song and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie:
<hi>Abba pater,</hi> Father, father: So that where so
euer this song is felt in the spirite: there are suche
ioyes as no toung can expresse: as all the booke of
Solomons ballads meruellously doe declare. And
wheras the mercy of God is not, there is eyther ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination
of sinne, and continuance therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any feare or grudge of conscience at all: or else
such heauinesse of spirite, that desperation vtterly
quaileth, and oppresseth the spirite for euer. Yet shal
the spirite &amp; soule of man fÃ©ele this for a time, while
God hideth his mercifull face: <hi>Is his mercy cleane
gone for euer?</hi> Which cogitations of the minde, be
full bitter and sorrowfull: as all men of GOD doe
knowe that haue felt them, and as the Prophete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
in the processe of his Psalme, in this sorte:
<hi>And is his promise come vtterly to an end for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?
Hath God forgotten to be gratious? And wil
he shut vp his louing kindnes in displeasure?</hi> These
demaundes and questions of his owne minde and
spirite that was troubled, be no more in effect,
then troubles that he named before. But in this
that he calleth the trouble by so many names, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
that his spirite was for the time so disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the paines in maner could not well be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and expressed. As it is to be sÃ©ene always when
the minde of man is brought into an excellencie and
profoundnesse of mirth or sorrowe: then it is so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished
with the vehemencie of them both, that the
toung is not able to expresse the inward ioy, nor the
inwarde sorrowe, as it is to be sÃ©ene as well in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
writers, as in the holy word of God. Reade ye
<pb facs="tcp:4397:108"/>
the 18.<note place="margin">Psal. 18.</note> Psalme of king Dauid, which he soung to the
Lorde when he was quit and deliuered from all his
enimies, &amp; ye shall sÃ©e what shift and copie of wordes
he vsed to name God, &amp; to expresse what he thought
of God in his heart, and with what Metaphors he
expresseth the strength of God, that ouercame al his
enimies, the Psalme is to be read and marked. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
reade ye these Psalmes 42. 43.<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 43</note> where ye shall
perceiue the prayer of Dauid, wherein is described
a vehement agonie and most bitter battel betwÃ©ene
faith and desperation: and there mark, what words
he hath found out, to expresse the sorrowes of his
heart, that was so sore put in doubt by desperation
and weaknesse of faith. <hi>The Harte</hi> (saith he) <hi>being
wounded, was neuer more desirous to come to the
water: then my soul desireth to come to thee Ã´ God.</hi>
And at length, when he can finde no more wordes to
vtter the pensiuenesse of his heart, he turneth his
wordes inward to his owne soule, and asketh why
she is so heauie and sad. Ye may sÃ©e also the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same ioyfull and sorrowfull spirites in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads
of Solomon, and in the lamentations of Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
the Prophete. In the one it sÃ©emeth, that the
soule annexed vnto Christ, is in such ioy as the tong
can not expresse it: and in the other for sinne, the
soule is afflicted in such sort, that it can not tell how
to expresse the heauinesse thereof.</p>
                  <p>There is to be considered also in these demaunds
of the Prophete, that he made to him selfe in his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
(as the text saith, he reuolued the matter with
his owne spirite) this doctrine, howe easie a thing it
is to teach and comfort other men, and howe hard a
thing it is for a man to teach and comfort him selfe
in the promises of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> S. Paule found fault there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall,
and saide to the Iewe: <hi>Thou teachest an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4397:108"/>
man &amp; teachest not thy selfe.</hi> And Iudas went
foorth with the eleuen other of his fellowes, to teach
Gods mercy in Christ vnto the lost shÃ©ep of the house
of Israel:<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 27</note> but he neither followed his own doctrine,
nor yet tooke any comfort of remission of sinnes in
the promises of God, but hanged himselfe desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Wherefore it is very expedient for eueryman
and woman that hath learned, and doth knowe the
truth of God, to pray, that they them selues may fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the truth: and for such as knowe and teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the consolations of the scriptures of God, that
they may with knowledge of them fÃ©ele them in
dÃ©ede, and with speaking of them to others for their
learning, they may speake them to them selues for
their owne edifying.</p>
                  <p>But doubtlesse it is an easie matter for a man to
speake of comfort and consolation to others: but a
hard thing to fÃ©ele it him selfe. Vertue is soone spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of to other mens instructions: but the putting
thereof in practise and vre, is very hard: yea, not
only in the scholer that is taught, but also in the
maister that instructeth. Beware of despaire, can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man say: but to eschue despaire in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictes
of the minde, is an harde matter. Reade
the booke of the Psalmes well, and ye shall sÃ©e the
experience thereof to be most certeine and true. In
the 62.<note place="margin">Psal. 62.</note> Psalme, ye shall haue this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all men: <hi>Trust ye alwayes in him ye peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>:
yet when it came to the triall in him selfe, ye
may sÃ©e with what heauines and great trouble of
mind, he came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trust in the Lord. Ye may learne
by these Psalmes indited by king Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. 41. 43</note> that easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he taught Gods religion, and how men should
put their trust in the Lord: and yet how hard it was
to do and practise the thing himselfe that he taught
<pb facs="tcp:4397:109"/>
vnto others?<note place="margin">Psal. 73. 77</note> Asaph also declareth the same. For in
the 73. Psalme, he teacheth what men should thinke
and iudge in aduersitie: that God would be good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Israel. But in this Psalme he himselfe being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the rod and persequution of God, is come to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning
and demaunding: <hi>Will God absent him
selfe for euer? Will he be no more intreated? Is his
mercy cleane gone for euer?</hi> with many other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes,
declaring vnspeakable troubles and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
of the minde: before it be brought to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
consent and full agrÃ©ement vnto the promises of
God. So that we sÃ©e the excellent Prophetes, and
most vertuous organes and instruments amongest
sinfull men, knewe it was an easie matter to speake
of faith &amp; vertue: and yet a very hard thing to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
true faith, and to exercise vertuous liuing.</p>
                  <p>Saint Paule sheweth the same to the Romanes
to be in him selfe.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> For he had more adoe in Christ to
get the victorie of sinne in him selfe, then to speake
of the victorie vnto others by mouth: and more adoe
to mortifie and kill the fleshe, and to bring it in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
to the spirite, then to practise the death of the
flesh in him selfe,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.</note> and to followe the spirit. He spake
and vttered with his mouth most godly doctrine,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 8.</note> to
the destruction of sinne:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> but with what prayers,<note place="margin">Gala. 5.</note>
teares,<note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> and clamours to God, he did the same in him
selfe,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> read 2. Corinth. 12.</p>
                  <p>The olde saying is,<note place="margin">To such as haue wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stled with sin, and in Christ got the vpper hand, Gods preceptes be easie &amp; sweete.</note> Knowledge is no burthen, and
in dÃ©ede it is a thing easie to be borne: but to put
knowledge in experience, the body and the soule shal
finde paine and trouble. And yet Christes wordes
where he saith, <hi>My yoke is light, &amp; my, burden ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
be most true to such as haue wrestled with sinn,
and in Christ got the vpper hand. To them (I say)
the precepts of vertuous liuing be easie and swÃ©ete,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4397:109"/>
as long as the spirite of God beareth the ouer hande
in them. But when faith waxeth faint, and the flesh
strong, then can not the spirit of God command nor
desire any thing,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> but both body and soule be muche
offended with the hearing therof, and more grÃ©eued
with the doing of it. S. Peter likewise maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same. For when Christ bade him followe
him, (meaning that he should dy also for the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of his word) he liked not that:<note place="margin">Iohn. 21.</note> but asked Christe
what Iohn should do, being (doutlesse) in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie,
when Christ tolde him that he should suffer
the paines of death. But here are to be noted two
things: The one, that as long as affliction is talked
of generally, &amp; other mens paines spoken of, so long
can euery man and woman heare of affliction: yea,
and commend the persons that suffered affliction,
as we sÃ©e at this day. All men be contented to heare
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Christ,<note place="margin">We can praise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men for wel do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, but we be loth to put it in experience our selues.</note> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> martyrdome of his Saints,
and of the affliction and imprisonment of his godly
members: but when the same or like should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
and practised by our selues, we wil none
of it, we refuse it, and we abhorre it: yea, so much,
that where Christ, and those Saints (whose names
be most common and vsual in our mouths,) suffered
the vilest death that could be deuised: we will not
suffer as much as the losse of a frend, or the deceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
goods of this vnstable and transitorie world: so
that in the generalitie we be very godly, and can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
al godly martyrs and sufferers for Gods sake:
but (alas) in the particularitie we be very vngodly,
and will followe no martyr, nor suffer at al. Also, as
long as we be without danger for Christes sake, we
can speake of great daungers, and say, that we will
suffer all extremitie and crueltie: but when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to passe, that an enimie to God and his worde
<pb facs="tcp:4397:110"/>
shall say in dÃ©ede, Forsake thy religion, or else thou
shalt dy (as Christ said vnto Peter,<note place="margin">Iohn. 21.</note> When thou art
old, an other shall girde thÃ©e, and leade thÃ©e whether
thou wouldest not:) then a litle threatening of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, stark quayleth this man that said he wold
suffer al troubles:<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> as Peter said, If he shuld loose his
life, he would not refuse his maister, but when an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yea, a poore maide but asked him, Whether he
were one of Christes seruants, and made no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
at al of losse of life or goods: he would not hazard him
selfe to beare so much as the name of Christes disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Thus we sÃ©e the vilenesse &amp; frailtie of our owne
nature, how weake we be to suffer in dÃ©ede, when of
necessitie we must beare the crosse, and can by no
means auoyd it. How troublesome also it is both to
body and soule, this Psalme &amp; place of the scripture
declareth: and therfore in the end of these temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is put, <hi>Sela.</hi> A worde that maketh as it were,
an outcry against the corrupt nature of man for sin.
As S. Paule said:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>I know that there dwelleth in my

the word is put there to cause the reader or

thereof. As the Prophete him selfe doth in

                     </gap> infirmitie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
it occupieth not only the body: but also the soul. For
he saith, These cogitations and questions (as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the doubtfulnesse of Gods mercy) were the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and actes of his mind: so that both his body and
soule were comfortlesse. And good cause why: for in
both of them were sinne and abhomination against
God. And of these two partes of man, the body &amp; the
spirit, came these dubitations of God and of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
The which fruites of corruption, ingender

the wisedome of the fleshe sÃ©ene to be very enimitie
vnto God, working continually the breach of Gods
commaundements, and the destruction of mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
as much as lyeth in it. But in the second
part of the verse is life, &amp; the occasion thereof: which
is a sure trust that God can remoue despaire, &amp; put
in place therof,<note place="margin">The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of mans help is Gods right hand</note> faith, hope, &amp; sure confidence. And the
occasion of this helpe is not mans merites, but the
right hand of God: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, Gods power inclined
to saue man by mercy. Of this doctrine be certeine
things to be marked of euery reader &amp; hearer of this
Psalme. First, in this verse is declared how man
taketh consolation in time of his trouble, which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
4. part of the Psalme, &amp; in the same part the Psalme
endeth. He saith, It was his infirmitie, that made
him to question &amp; demaund in his spirit so doubtfull
<pb facs="tcp:4397:111"/>
things of God, and of his promises. Whereof we
learne, that consolation beginneth where sorrowe
and heauinesse is first felt: for the spirit can take no
solace by Gods promises, vntill suche time as it fÃ©e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
by Gods lawe, how sinnefull it is for the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
thereof.<note place="margin">Prou. 18.</note> Therfore Solomon saith: <hi>The iust
man is the first accuser of him selfe.</hi> And so doth the
Prophet Asaph in this place confesse, that these cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and profound thoughts against God, came
of his owne infirmitie and sinne. And the knowlege
of a mans owne wickednesse from the bottome of
the heart, although it be a shame to speake or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the vilenesse of sinne, wherewith sinner
hath most grÃ©euously transgressed Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes:
yet is this knowledge and confession of
our sinne and iniquitie very necessarie, and is (as it
were) an induction to the remission thereof:<note place="margin">True con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of sinne is in manner an induction to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission thereof.</note> as it is
to be sÃ©ene in this Prophet, and in the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.
For here is first confessed, that all sinnes in
him came of his owne infirmitie: and all conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
against sinne, came of Gods right hand. And
the Prophet Dauid sayth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> he was in like trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for sinne:<note place="margin">Psal. 74. Psal. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>I determined</hi> (saith he) <hi>to confesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
my selfe, mine owne iniquitie: and thou Lord
forgauest the wickednesse of my sinne.</hi> But here is
to be noted in this, that the confession of sinne is (as
it were) an induction and beginning of consolation:
that confession of sinne is not the beginning of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
except he that maketh the confession be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
in his heart of Gods promises in Christe, that
of mercy in Christes death, his sinnes be forgiuen:
as ye may sÃ©e in these two Prophetes. The one said:
It is mine infirmitie the worketh this doutfulnes
in my soule. And the other saide: I determined to
condemne my selfe of sinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:4397:111"/>
Thus farre it is death, and an increase of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in Gods promises, and an induction to despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
to fÃ©ele sinne, to bewayle sinne, to speake of
sinne, and to remember sinne. But whereas know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and confession hath a certeintie and assurance
of Gods forgiuenesse annexed vnto it, there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and knowledge of sinne, partly a beginning
of consolation against sinne.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> I call it partly, or as an
occasion, bycause first of all,<note place="margin">1. Samu. 15.</note> God by his word, or by
his punishments,<note place="margin">2. Samu. 12</note> through the operation of the holy
Ghoste, openeth the soule of the sinner, to sÃ©e and
know his sinne: also to tremble and quake at sinne,
rather then to hate and abhorre sinne. And from
these principles and originalls, commeth the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and lowly confession of sinne, not to man, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God: except it be such an open sinne done against
man, as man knoweth of that the sinne is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against.<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 18.</note> Then must the offender of man also,
reconcile him selfe to man that is offended,<note place="margin">Iacob. 5.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the commaundement of God.<note place="margin">Luke. 7.</note> Therefore we
must marke what confession and acknowledging of
our owne infirmities is. For euery confession is not
acceptable before God, nor the beginning of consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
as these examples declare. Iudas saide openly
in the face of the court (where Christe our Sauiour<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note>
was arraigned) that he had offended in betraying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
bloud:<note place="margin">Mark. 15.</note> but there followed no faith nor hope of
forgiuenesse: So that for lacke of faith in Christes
bloud, desperation and hanging of him selfe ensued
his confession. Whereby it is euident, that confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sinne without faith, is nothing worth, but a
testimonie of a desperate mans damnation.</p>
                  <p>King Saule,<note place="margin">1. Samu. 15.</note> after long impulsion by the Prophet
Samuel, was brought to confesse that he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in preseruing aliue Agag king of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Amalekites,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:112"/>
and the fattest of his cattell. <hi>I haue offended</hi> (sayth
Saule:) <hi>for I haue broken and transgressed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 77.</note> But what followed? Gods
right hand can remedie my sinne,<note place="margin">Psal. 32.</note> as this Prophete
Asaph saith? or, God hath forgiuen the iniquitie of
my sinne,<note place="margin">Luke. 18.</note> as Dauid sayde? er else: <hi>God be merciful
vnto me a sinner,</hi> as the Publicane sayd? No, but
this ensueth:<note place="margin">Sual wold haue Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel to beare his sinne.</note> 
                     <hi>I Pray thee</hi> (sayth Saule to Samuel)
<hi>beare thou my sinne.</hi> In this mans confession of sin,
was not the beginning of consolation, but of more
sorrowes: for his heauinesse from that day more
and more increased,<note place="margin">1. Samu. 31.</note> with his sinnes: vntill he was
slaine.<note place="margin">Matth. 9.</note> And the cause thereof was this. He would
that Samuel being but a man,<note place="margin">Luke. 5.</note> should haue pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his sinne:<note place="margin">Mark. 2.</note> whereas none can doe it but God, as
it is notably to be sÃ©ene in king Dauid. For when
he sayde, he had offended the Lord, Nathan the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
sayde:<note place="margin">2. Samu. 12</note> 
                     <hi>And God hath taken away thy sinnes.</hi>
Wherein is declared, that the minister can but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
to the sinner, that God in Christe forgiueth
sinne. So that we sÃ©e Iudas confession of sinne was
nothing worth, bycause he found no fayth nor trust
for the remission thereof: and Saules confession
was of no valure, bicause he trusted and desired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
at mans hand, and not at Gods.</p>
                  <p>Yet in Saules confession was some thing good,
in that he confessed (although it were long first and
in manner wrested out of his mouth by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Samuel) his fault to God: and in that point
he did as Dauid did,<note place="margin">Psal 51.</note> who sayde: <hi>I haue offended the
Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Samu. 12.</note> And this is to be noted,<note place="margin">Esai 63.</note> bycause nowe adayes
men be taught to confesse their sinnes to the Saints<note place="margin">Ecclesi 9.</note>
departed,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 8.</note> that knowe not what the outward works
of men be vpon the earth:<note place="margin">Papisticall confession.</note> much lesse the inward &amp;
sinfull cogitation of the heart. So that in this part,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4397:112"/>
the Papists confession is worse then Saules: and in
the other part it is like.<note place="margin">1. Samu. 15</note> For as Saule trusted to the
merites of Samuel, and would haue him to beare
his sinne:<note place="margin">Oh blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</note> so do the people trust, that the Priestes
hand vpon their head, &amp; the penaunce inioyned them
by the Priestes, shall be a cleane remission and full
satisfaction for all their sinne: but before God, their
sinnes be as much forgiuen them as Saules were,
that is to say, nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>But wheras sinne is knowne and confessed from
the very hart,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1.</note> vnto God, although it be a bitter thing
and also a shamefull thing,<note place="margin">Psal. 130.</note> to fÃ©ele and beare Gods
displeasure for sin, the burden wherof is very death,
and more grÃ©euous then death it selfe: yet whereas
confidence and trust in the mercy of God is annexed
with it, there followeth great consolation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
As it is to be sÃ©ene in this Prophet that spake
with a strong faith boldly: <hi>The righthand of God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
chaunge these things.</hi> So that the latter part of this
verse hath more comfort, then the first part hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort.
And it is a plaine doctrine, that although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
sinnes of man be many &amp; horrible:<note place="margin">Esai. 1.</note> yet be they fewer
and lesse in estimation many thousande foldes, then
Gods mercies. Death is declared in the first part of
the verse, in this, that mans infirmitie is not onely
sinful in body &amp; soule, but also doutful of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
&amp; holy promises: Yet in the second part by grace
is set foorth life, and cleane deliuerance from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
of the diuel, the seruitude of sinne, the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the lawe, and the infirmitie of nature, by the
strong and mightie power of God, whose mercy in
Christ is alwayes ready to helpe poore afflicted and
troubled sinners.<note place="margin">Ezech. 18.</note> After this confession of sinne, and
the great confidence that the prophet had in God for
his mightie power and mercies sake,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 1.</note> that was both
<pb facs="tcp:4397:113"/>
able by power and redy with will, to help and reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
this troubled spirite, and great aduersities of the
Prophet: he goeth foorth in the consolation, &amp; taketh
yet more and more of Gods benefites, vsed in times
towardes such as were afflicted, after this sort.</p>

                     <p>17 The cloudes powred out water, the ayre thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and thine arrowes went abroad.</p>
                     <p>18 The voyce of thy thunder was heard round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
the lightenings shone vpon the gound, the
earth was moued and shooke withall.</p>
                     <p>19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy pathes in the great
waters, and thy footsteps are not knowne.</p>
                     <p>20 Thou leadest thy people like shepe, by the hand
of Moses and Aaron.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Of these meanes howe men take consolation in
aduersitie, that the Prophet nowe maketh mention
of: first we learne, what difference is betwÃ©ene the
consideration of Gods works aduisedly &amp; by faith: &amp;
the consideration of Gods workes rashly &amp; without
faith. The which diuersitie is to be sÃ©en in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
For the one part, as touching the remembring
of Gods workes out of faith and in faith, he spake
before in the second verse, and in the fourth verse,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4397:113"/>
how that he considered the workes and old doings of
the Lord when he was troubled. But, as ye haue
heard, because his spirite was in a doubtfulnesse and
mamering vppon the certeintie of Gods doinges: he
felt no consolation thereof, but much heauinesse and
anguish of minde. For those demaundes: <hi>Will God
absent himselfe for euer? Will he be no more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
and such like heauie and doubtfull complaintes,
could neuer procÃ©ed but from a sorrowful and much
troubled conscience. But now, after that Gods spirit
hath wrought in his spirit this assurance and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that God can in him chaunge the conditions
of his miseries (as ye may sÃ©e,) he maketh no more
complaint of doubtfulnesse, neither remembreth any
more the fearefulnesse of his conscience: but goeth
foorth with repetition and rehearsall of all thinges
comfortably, how that God in time past holpe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
spirites and afflicted personages, that put their
trust in him. So that of this we learne, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
hath a sure faith in God, taketh consolation of
Gods word and workes. And such as haue not first
true faith in God, cannot in the spirite receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of Gods word or workes. Outwardly men may
meruel at God and his worker, but inwardly it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
not the heauinesse, nor yet quieteth the grudge
of conscience.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore,<note place="margin">Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prayer.</note> it behoueth vs all, that we pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
vnto GOD, to giue vs faith to belÃ©eue his
word and workes, when we heare, read, or sÃ©e them:
For the word and workes of God do nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the vnfaithfull,<note place="margin">Esaie. 65.</note> as we may sÃ©e by the Scripture:
where God saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> He stretched foorth his hand al day
long to a people that belÃ©eued not:<note place="margin">Esaie. 6.</note> for such as haue
eares &amp; heare not,<note place="margin">Iohn. 12.</note> eyes &amp; sÃ©e not, be rather the worse
for Gods word &amp; workes then the better. Ye shal sÃ©e
<pb facs="tcp:4397:114"/>
where the spirite of Dauid was replenished with
faith, he was in assured and ascerteined of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
helpe, that he said he would not feare, although
a thousand men inuironed and compassed him round
about:<note place="margin">Psalme. 3.</note> No, he would not feare, thoughe he should
walk in the shadow of death.<note place="margin">Psalme. 23.</note> At another time, when
faith quailed and waxed faint, he was trembling in
his spirite, and fearefull in his bodie: as we may sÃ©e
when he felt his spirite waxe faint, he said:<note place="margin">Psal. 6. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>My soule
is troubled very sore, and my bones be weakened.</hi>
And in other of his Psalmes he sheweth,<note place="margin">Psal. 42. 43</note> that his
soule was very heauie and comfortlesse, and could
take no consolation.</p>
                  <p>Also when the spirite is assured of Gods grace,
then the eyes cannot looke vppon any worke of God.
but the mind taketh by the contemplation and sight
thereof, vnspeakeable consolation: As Dauid decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in his Psalmes, and saith, He would sÃ©e the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
the workes of Gods fingers, and would marke
how one day was an induction to an other: and how
the heauens praised the Lord.<note place="margin">Psal. 8. 19. 148.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>At an other time, when the consolation and life of
the spirit was ouer whelmed with troubles, he could
not sÃ©e at all with his eyes: but cryed and complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that he was starke blinde.<note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note> And also in that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous
Psalme in number 88.<note place="margin">Psalme. 88</note> whereas prayer is
made to be deliuered from the horrour and fÃ©eling of
sinne, the Prophet saith, that his eyes waxed dimme
and blinde. The same is to be sÃ©ene likewise in the
crosses and afflictions that God sendeth. As long as
true faith and confidence remaineth in the heart, all
troubles be wellcome and thankfully taken: as we
read. When Iob had newes that his goods and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
were taken from him,<note place="margin">Iob. 1. 2.</note> in manner soudeinly, he
most patiently said: <hi>God gaue them, and God hath
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4397:114"/>
taken them away, as God would so it is done.</hi> But
when faith quailed, and the spirite was troubled,
then followed these impatient wordes:<note place="margin">Iob. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>I would my
sinne were layed in one balance, and my paine in an
other.</hi> As though God had layed more vppon him,
then he had deserued. When the spirit was quieted,
for all his pouertie and nakednesse, he reioyced and
was contented with his birth and comming into the
world, and also with the state in the world appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto him by God, saying:<note place="margin">Iob. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Naked I came out of
my mothers bellie, and naked I shall depart hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi>
But when faith fainted, then came out these
woordes:<note place="margin">Iob. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The day, the night, and the time be cursed
wherein I was borne.</hi> With many more horrible
wordes, as the text declareth. So that we sÃ©e, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Gods spirite wanteth, there is no learning nor
consolation to be had of any thing: as it is opened
in this Psalme, in that at the first time the Prophet
recorded Gods workes, and was so troubled in his
minde, that he occupied his cogitations this way:
<hi>Will God be no more mercifull? Hath God shut vp
his mercie in his ire?</hi> But now in the second record
of Gods workes, he beginneth his entrance cleane
contrarie, and saith: Gods right hand can chaunge
his sorrow, and turne his heauines into mirth. And
vppon this ground and sure hope of Gods promises,
he procÃ©edeth foorth to a consideration and dÃ©epe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of Gods factes, in this sort: <hi>I will remember the
workes of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this verse and in the next folowing it, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
thrÃ©e kinde of words: <hi>remembrance, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and speach.</hi> By the first we learne that it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nothing to read or heare Gods word, except we
remember it, &amp; beare it away with vs. By the next
we learne that it auaileth vs not, to learne and beare
<pb facs="tcp:4397:115"/>
the word of God in remembrance, except by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and thinking vppon it, we vnderstand what it
meaneth. And by the third we learne, that neither
the remembrance it, nor the vnderstanding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
profiteth, except we teache and instruct other in
the same, of whom we haue charge, if we may.</p>
                  <p>Now to consider further, we sÃ©e how the Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
with this word (<hi>Remembrance,</hi>) whereof it
appeareth that he had learned before out of Gods
word, Gods nature towardes penitent sinners to
forgiue them: and towards wilfull, obstinate, and
impenitent sinners to be a iust iudge to punish them.
Here is the ignorance of all people condemned, that
neuer learne to know Gods word in sicknes, nor in
health: but when they be troubled or sicke, they send
for such as they thinke and fansie haue learned and
doe remember how Gods word doth comfort in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie.
And then, if he that is sent for be not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Gods word, he cannot remember how God is
wont to comfort the troubled or sicke: then all that
euer the sicke man heareth of an ignorant comforter
or counseller, is as clene voyd of consolation or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
as though he had neuer sent for a counseller or
comforter. For no man can haue more of another,
then the other hath himselfe, which is neither know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
counsell, nor consolation out of Gods word.
Therefore he is not able to giue knowledge, conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
nor comfort to another.</p>
                  <p>If the Prophet Asaph, had bÃ©ene as the most part
of people now a dayes be, that fall sick and into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
kinds of trouble, &amp; had sent for an ignorant foole,
(which commonly is called a ghostly father,) he had
bÃ©ene in as good taking as these wretched soules be,
that bÃ©eing comfortlesse sÃ©eke comfort where none
is to be had, sÃ©eke knowledge where none is, &amp; sÃ©eke
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4397:115"/>
counsell where ignorance aboundeth. Let all men
therefore remember this verse, that when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
was in trouble, he remembred the wisedome
and meruellous workes of God: (for he knew them
before:) so let all men and women learne, before they
come into trouble, a true knowledge of God, that in
the time of trouble they may remember it to their
consolation. But now to the second word, where he
saith, He will meditate in all the workes of God.</p>
                  <p>Here is another notable doctrine, that neither the
learning of Gods word, nor the remembrance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
profiteth any thing, except it be vnderstanded and
applied to the vse that God hath appointed it for.
And here be two sortes of people wonderfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
The one sort be those, that for custome or
bondage to their profession, doe learne without the
booke a great part of the Scripture: or els by daily
vse in singing or saying their seruice (as it is called)
they learne to sing and say a great part of the Bible.
But this auaileth nothing, nor they vnderstand it
not in the sense and meaning that the holy ghost ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it for: nor perchaunce the Grammaticall
construction therof. And these remembrances of
Gods word, be nothing but lippe labour, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of God with the mouth,<note place="margin">Esaie. 29.</note> but the hart is farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
which before God is in vaine,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> and of no estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The other sort of people be such as professe the
Gospell, that haue learned much, and can remember
much, but follow very little: so that they be nothing
the better for it.</p>
                  <p>The third word is, that the Prophet saith, He
wil speake of God and his works, as outwardly and
inwardly he remembreth them, and with his spirite
doth meditate them: as it is likewise the part and
duetie of all Christian men so to doe. For as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lÃ©eue
<pb facs="tcp:4397:116"/>
in the heart to iustice:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> so wil they confesse it to
saluation, as S. Paule saith to the Romanes.</p>
                  <p>Here in this word be thrÃ©e sortes of people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.<note place="margin">Three sortes of people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note>
The one that wil not confesse and teach the
trueth for feare of loosing their aduauntage. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will not confesse and teach the trueth for slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnesse
and slouth. And the third will not confesse
and teach the trueth for timiditie and feare.</p>
                  <p>In the first sort be such as know doctrines for the
soule, or medicines for the body, and yet because they
gett gaine thereby, they would not haue too many
know thereof, lest their owne gaines should be the
lesse. As we fÃ©e, such a one as knoweth a good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode
and order to teach, would be lothe it should be
common, because his estimation and gaine, (as he
thinketh) should diminish &amp; decrease. The excellent
Physician would not haue his cunning common,
least many men, as cunning as he, should part his
gaines amongest them.</p>
                  <p>The second sort of men be those that come to great
liuings by their learning,<note place="margin">Note well.</note> and when they haue the
reward of learning, they teach no more, as bishops
and ministers of the Church: whome the Prophet
calleth dumbe dogges that cannot barke,<note place="margin">Esaie. 56.</note> their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
be so choked with the bones of bishoppricks and
benefices. I speake of such as knowe the trueth and
loue it, and not of such as neither know it nor loue
it. For although those men speake but seldome, yet it
is too much: for better it were neuer to speake, then
to speake falsely.</p>
                  <p>The thirde sorte be our Nichodemes,<note place="margin">Nichode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</note> that can
speake of Christ in the night, or to their friends, but
openly they will confesse nothing with the mouth,
nor doe any thing outwardely for feare of the
world, that should sounde to Gods glorie. And these
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4397:116"/>
men be assured they shall haue their rewarde:<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> that
Christe will denie them before his father which is
in heauen. Of this we learne wherein our professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
consisteth.<note place="margin">Wherein doth our profession consist.</note> First, to learne Gods worde. Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily,
to beare it in our hearte and remembraunce.
Thirdly, to vnderstande it. And fourthly, to speake
of it to the glorie of God, and the edifying of our
neighbours. And Gods word this wayes vsed, shall
kÃ©epe vs humble and lowely in prosperitie, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and strong in aduersitie. But in these two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
be more wordes necessarie to be considered, if we
will take consolation in aduersitie. The first, <hi>I will</hi>
(sayth the prophet) <hi>remember the works of the Lord,
and that of olde time, (or from the beginning.)</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
<hi>I wil think also of al the works of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this that the Prophet sayeth,<note place="margin">We ought not to be ignorant of any booke in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> He will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the workes of the Lorde of olde time, or from the
beginning, we learne that it is expedient to know,
or at the least way,) not to be ignorant of any
booke in the scripture. For where as we finde not
consolation in the one, we may finde it in the other.
And where he sayth He wil remember all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> works
of the Lord (meaning as many as the scripture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
mention of:) we be instructed, that we cannot
sÃ©e these works for our erudition, neither yet giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
almightie God thanks, except we learne them from
one of his bookes to the other. And here is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that sÃ©eing we be bounde to knowe and to be
thankefull for all the workes of God conteined in
the scripture, we be muche in daunger, as well for
ignorance as vnthankefulnesse, that we knowe not
the principall workes of our owne creation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
We be therefore admonished, to haue
bookes to read the works of God, and to be diligent
to ask better learned then we be, what Gods works
<pb facs="tcp:4397:117"/>
doe meane. As the children by Gods law vs bound to
aske the parents,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 6. 31.</note> &amp; the parents bound by the same
to teach them: then shall both fathers and children
finde comfort and consolation against all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in the time of trouble and heauinesse. As we sÃ©e
this mans remedie (by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirite of God) riseth from
recording, meditating, and speaking of Gods word
and workes.</p>
                  <p>Here hath this Prophete meruellously opened,
howe a man in trouble commeth to consolation
and comfort. First, that the spirite and heart of man
must haue such strong fayth, as may credite Gods
power, and also his good will: and belÃ©eue that God
both can and will for his truethes sake, helpe the
troubled conscience. Therefore Solomon giueth a
godlie and necessarie commaundement:<note place="margin">Prouerb. 4</note> 
                     <hi>Keepe thy
heart with all circumspection, for of it proceedeth
life.</hi> So did Dauid, when the Prophet Nathan had
made him afraide for the murder of Vrias, and the
adulterie with Bersaba, his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>science was in great
anguishe and feare, and among other thinges that
he prayed for to God,<note place="margin">Psalm. 51.</note> he desired that God would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and make him a newe heart: that is to witte, to
giue him such a stedfast and burning fayth, that in
Christe his sinnefull heart might be purged. And
secondarily he prayeth, to haue so right and sure a
spirite, that shoulde not doubt of Gods sauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
him. Thirdly, that God woulde alwayes
preserue his holy spirite with the heart regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that from time to time, the heart might be ruled
in obedience towardes God. Fourthly, he prayeth
to be lead with a willing spirite, that quietly and
patiently he may obey God in aduersities, without
impatience or grudge against God. And, where as
this knowledge and fÃ©eling of the favour of God is
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4397:117"/>
in the spirite, there followeth recording, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of Gods works, meditating and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vpon heauenly thinges: and the tongue readie
also to speake foorth the glory of God, to Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and praise, and to the edifying of Gods people
and congregation, after this sorte.</p>
                  <q>13 Thy way oh God is in holinesse: who is so great
a God, as God, euen our God?</q>
                  <p>Here is a consolation much worthie to be learned
and receiued of all troubled men: and it is this, To
vnderstande and perceiue,<note place="margin">Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that all the doinges and
factes of Almightie God be righteous, although
many times the fleshe iudgeth, and the tongue spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the contrarie, that God should be too seuere, and
punishe too extremely. As though he did it rather of
a desire to punishe, then to correct or amend the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
punished. As we sÃ©e by Iobs words, that wished
his sinnes layed in one balance,<note place="margin">Iob. 6.</note> and his punishment
in another balance: as though God punished more
extreamely then iustly. The same it sÃ©emeth king
Dauid also felte, when he sayde:<note place="margin">Psalme. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Howe long Lorde
wilt thou forget me, for euer?</hi> With like bitter spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in the scripture: complayning of Gods iustice,
iudgement and seueritie.<note place="margin">Ierem. 20.</note> The same we reade of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie
the Prophete, He spake Gods word truely,
and yet there happened vnto him wonderfull great
aduersities: the terrour whereof made him curse
the day that he was borne in. And doubtlesse, when
he sayde, <hi>Why haste thou deceiued mee Lorde?</hi>
he thought, God was rather too extreame, then iust
in his punishment,<note place="margin">Passur.</note> to afflicte him in aduersitie, and
to suffer Passur the high Priest and his enimie to
be in quiet and tranquillitie.</p>
                  <p>This prophet Asaph was before in great trouble,
<pb facs="tcp:4397:118"/>
as ye heard), and especially of the minde, that self
not a sure trust and confidence in Gods mercie: and
thought of al extremities that to be (as it is in dÃ©ed)
the greatest, a minde desperate and doubtfull of
Gods mercie: yet nowe he saith, <hi>God is holie in his
way, and all that he doeth is right and iust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We learne hereby, that the potte can not say to
the Potter,<note place="margin">Ierem. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Why hast thou made me after this sorte?</hi>
Neither may the mortall man,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> in whom is nothing
but sinne,<note place="margin">Potter.</note> quarel with the Lord and say: What lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou vpon me? But thinke, that although he had
made vs both blinde, lame, and as deformed as mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
yet had he made vs better then euer we deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
And in case he layd all the troubles of the world
vppon one man: yet are they lesse then one sinne of
man doeth deserue. Thus hath the Prophet learned
nowe and felt, and sayth: <hi>The doinges of God be
holie and right, and there is none to be compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him</hi>: and sheweth the cause why none is to be
compared vnto God. In the declaration whereof, he
continueth seuen verses, and so maketh an ende of
the Psalme.</p>
                  <p>The first cause why he sayeth none is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vnto God: is this.</p>
                  <q>14 Thou art the Lord that doth wonders, and hast
declared thy power amongest people.</q>
                  <p>Firste he noteth generally that God is the doer
of wonders,<note place="margin">God is the doer of wonders.</note> and miracles: and afterwardes he
sheweth, wherein God hath wrought these mirac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
Of this we learne thrÃ©e doctrines. The one, that
some men knowe generally,<note place="margin">Three do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</note> that God worketh all
thinges meruellously. The second, that other some
knowe that God worketh in some men meruellous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4397:118"/>
The third, that other also knowe that God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in themselues meruellously.</p>
                  <p>Of the first sort be such as know by Gods works
generally, that God hath, and doth dispose all things
vpon the earth, and nothing hath his beginning nor
being but of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> of whome Saint Paule speaketh
to the Romanes, that by Gods workes they knewe
God, and yet glorified him not. Of the seconde sorte
be suche, as more particularly knowe and speake of
Gods miracles:<note place="margin">Genes. 7.</note> as suche be, that reade how God of
his singular fauour preserued Noah &amp; his familie,
and drowned all the world besides:<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> how he brought
the children of Israel out of Egypt, and deliuered
the people from the captiuitie of Babylon, with such
like: and yet when they be in troubles themselues,
these meruellous workes and mercies shewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others, cannot comfort themselues. Of the thirde
sorte be suche, as knowe generally the meruellous
workes of God, and perceiue that in some God is
particularly mercifull: and from some he findeth
it in him selfe singularly the mercie of GOD, and
from the remembraunce of Gods benefites vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
he findeth in him selfe the working of Gods
mercie, and findeth in his conscience such comfort in
dÃ©ede, that he remembreth others before him, that
had of Gods mercies in their time of troubles.</p>
                  <p>The moste parte of men consider generally,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that
God is the worker of miracles:<note place="margin">The true Christians take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of gods miracles wrought vppon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> the common sorte
of Christians consider, that God hath wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
particularly vpon others: but the verie elects
and Christians in dÃ©ede, sÃ©e the miracles of God
wrought particularly vpon others, and take conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
singularly of Gods mercies themselues. As
we sÃ©e this Prophete meruellously declareth Gods
wonders, &amp; putteth the generall working of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:4397:119"/>
miracles betwÃ©ene a singular working of wonders:
and a particular working of wonders.</p>
                  <p>The generalitie is this: <hi>Thou art God that doth
wonders, and hast declared thy power amongst peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
The singularitie and particularitie of Gods
working of wonders, is the one before, and the other
behinde. The singularitie is in this, that he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
that is was his owne infirmitie, that made him
doubt of Gods promises: &amp; yet Gods singular grace
made him singularly fÃ©ele &amp; perceiue that God sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
would be good vnto him. The particularitie
is in this, that he saith: With Gods right hand God
deliuered the posteritie of Iacob and Ioseph<note place="margin">Iacob and Ioseph.</note> from
the seruitude of Egypt, &amp;c. The way to consider the
meruellous works of God is a profitable considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; sight of them, as wel to know them, as to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
better for them. For there is no man can take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
or profite by Gods goodnesse shewed vnto a
multitude, except he singularly receiue gaine therby
him selfe. As we sÃ©e, when a whole multitude was
fed meruellously with a fewe loaues and fewer fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note>
(almoste fiue thousande people,) he taught the
consolation and health of mans soule in his owne
bloude:<note place="margin">Euery man must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue for himselfe.</note> but none was the better for it, but suche as
belÃ©eued euerie man for him selfe that which Christ
spake. The miracles and mercifull helpe of Christe
vnto others, had nothing profited the poore woman
of Canaan:<note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> excepte she her selfe had bene partaker
of the same. And as it is in the workes of God, that
doe comfort the man afflicted: so is it in the workes
of God, that bring men into heauinesse and sorrowe
for sinne.</p>
                  <p>Generally, the worde of God rebuketh sinne,
and calleth sinners to repentaunce: particularly it
sheweth vnto vs, howe that Dauid, Peter, Marie
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4397:119"/>
Magdalen and others repented. But to vs those sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
and repentaunce do no good:<note place="margin">Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> except we euery
man singularly, repent and be sorrowfull for his
sinnes. For it is not another mans sicknesse that
maketh me sicke,<note place="margin">Notable doctrine.</note> nor another mans health that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
me whole: no more is any other mans repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
my repentance, or any other mans fayth my
fayth: but I must repent, &amp; I must belÃ©eue my selfe
to fÃ©ele sorrowfulnesse for sinne by the law, &amp; remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
therof by faith in Christ. So that euerie priuate
man must be in repentaunce, sorrie with the true
repentaunt sorrie: and faithfull, with the true
faithfull. For as God himselfe is towardes man: so
be all his workes and promises.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For looke to whom
God is mercifull, to the same be all his promises
comfortable: and to whom God is seuere and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
to the same Gods threateninges be terrible,
and his iustice fearefull. As king Dauid sayeth,<note place="margin">Psalme. 18.</note>
                     <hi>With the holie, thou wilt be holie: and with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent;
thou wilt bee innocent: with the chosen,
thou wilt be chosen: and with the peruerse, thou wilt
be peruerse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such as followe vertue and godlinesse,<note place="margin">To whom God is mercifull, and to whome se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere.</note> God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth

manners, and by false doctrine decline from the

persons repent, God wil spoyle them from all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of trueth: and being blinde and destitute of
knowledge, permitte them to the power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of most filthy lustes, and abhominable desires.
So that such as would not loue the beautie &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of vertue, shal tumble &amp; wallowe themselues
like swine, in the filth &amp; vomit of sinne: of the which

                           <desc>â¢</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> Saint
Paule speaketh in the Epistle to the Romanes. For
<pb facs="tcp:4397:120"/>
this is to be noted, looke as euerie man is: euen so he
thinketh of God. And as the good and godlie man
thinketh well of God: so doeth he euill and wicked
man thinke euill of God.</p>
                  <p>Some thincke that man and all worldly thinges
be ruled and gouerned by God, with greate iustice
and inscrutable wisedome,<note place="margin">A wicked iudgment of Gods doinges.</note> with all mercie and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
Others thinke that GOD ruleth not this
world, and worldly things: and in case they thinke
he doe, yet do they condemne his administration and
rule, of iniustice and parcialitie: because God doeth
as it pleaseth himselfe, and not as man would haue
him doe. And vpon these diuersities of iudgements
in mens mindes: God is to the godly, mercifull:
and to the vngodly, seuere and rigorous.</p>
                  <p>If the spirite of man iudge truely and godly of
him, by and by the spirite of man shall perceiue and
fÃ©ele the heauenly influence of Gods spirite, stirring
and impelling his spirit to all vertue and goodnesse.<note place="margin">Oh horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
If the spirite of man be destitute of spirite of
God, and iudge peruersly and wickedly, the spirits
of man shall fÃ©ele the lacke of Gods spirite, and true
iudgement, to blind the eyes of his mind, &amp; cast him
self into al abhomination &amp; sinne: as the iniquitie of
the man iustly hath deserued. Of the which thing
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth this, that as the vertue &amp; godlinesse of godly
men daily increaseth: euen so doeth the iniquitie and
abhomination of the vngodly also increase.<note place="margin">Lokewhat preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence God obteineth of man: the same place hath man with God.</note> And looke
what place and preeminence God obteineth with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man: in the same place and preeminence is the
man with God. And suche as doe godlie after Gods
worde, honour and reuerence the almightie God:
iudging aright of Gods might and prouidence: they
giue moste humble thankes vnto the mercie of God:
that alone, and none but he, can teach or instruct the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4397:120"/>
mind of man in true knowledge, nor incline his will
to godlie doings, nor inflame the soule with all her
powers to the desire and feruent loue of godlinesse
and vertue. As we sÃ©e by this prophete Asaph in this
place, that as long as his spirite, wanted the helpe
of Gods spirite, it iudged doubtfully of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and promises: but, when the spirite of God had
exiled and banished doubtfulnesse, and placed this
strong fortresse of confidence,<note place="margin">A stronge fortresse.</note> (<hi>The right hande of
GOD can chaunge this my wofull and miserable
estate,</hi>) with the iudgement and fÃ©eling thereof, he
was rapte and stricken with a meruellous loue of
Gods wonders: and repeated them with greate ioy
and consolation, what God had done generally to
all men: after that, what he had done to some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men, and priuat nations: naming Iacob &amp; Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,
whose ofspring and succession he brought out
of the lande of Egypt, as it followeth in the Psalme.</p>
                  <q>15 Thou hast mightily deliuered thy people, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the sonnes of Iacob and Ioseph. Sela.</q>
                  <p>Of this verse we learne two consolations. The
one, that euerie Christian troubled, may sÃ©e his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and also his betters troubled:<note place="margin">Two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations.</note> not that it is a
comforte to a man that is afflicted, to sÃ©e another in
trouble: but to marke that God loued none so well,
but in this world he sent trouble vnto,<note place="margin">Whome God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</note> and excepted
not his dÃ©ere sonne. Wherefore, it is a consolation to
the afflicted, to be made like vnto the godly fathers,
(that were before his time) by tribulation: and to
remember, that although all Christian men be not
brought vnder the captiuitie of Pharao in Egypt,<note place="margin">Euery Christian member hath an Egypt and a Babylon.</note>
nor vnder Nabuchodonozer in Babylon: yet there is
an Egypt and a Babylon for euery Christian mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
that is to say, the captiuitie of sinne, the bondage
of the fleshe, the seueritie of the lawe, the daunger of
<pb facs="tcp:4397:121"/>
the worlde, the enimitie of Infidels, the treason of
dissembling friends, the wickednesse of ciuil &amp; diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
ordinaunces, the dissimulation of hypocrites,
the periurie of inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>stant persons, the breach of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
promises, the inconstancie of the weake, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Papistes, the loue of man, &amp; the hatred of God,
with many others: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ignorance of Gods lawes,
rebellion of the heart against it, frowardnesse of the
will to consent vnto it, diffidence &amp; mistrust of Gods
mercie, boldnesse to sinne in the time of health, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and mistrust of the remission thereof in sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
loue of vice and sinne, hatred of vertue and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
souden falling from grace, slowe rising vnto
it againe, lothsomnesse to die mortally, readinesse to
liue wickedly, sorrowfulnesse to forsake this world,
great delight to vse it euill whiles we haue it, lothe
to sÃ©eke heauenly thinges, glad to sÃ©eke earthly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
nothing fÃ©eling the pouertie and trouble of the
soul, alwayes grudging at the pouertie and trouble of
the body, with innumerable other captiuities that
euery Christian is intangled withall, as euery man
may iudge by his owne life.</p>
                  <p>The next consolation is to sÃ©e the trueth of Gods
helpe promised to all men, when they be troubled, to
haue bÃ©ene declared opened, and verified in others,
in time past.<note place="margin">The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in trouble.</note> For, this is the greatest consolation
that can be to any man, in trouble, or in sicknesse:
when he is assured of such help, and such medicines,
as neuer were vsed, but did helpe the afflicted, and
heale the sick. Now, against all the troubles of man,
and also against all the sickness of man. God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
his present and helping mercie: the which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
and helpe neuer failed, but did helpe as many
as put their trust therein. Therefore doth this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Asaphe, establish and assure himselfe of Gods
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4397:121"/>
helpe, against his grÃ©euous temptations and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
that he suffered, by recording that his greefes
were no greater, nor his troubles more daungerous
then Iacobs, Iosephes, and their posterities: nor yet
so grÃ©euous.<note place="margin">From the greater to the lesser.</note> In so much that, sÃ©eing the mercie of
God could helpe the greater troubles in his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors:
he could helpe and ease the lesse in him that
was presently troubled. And bÃ©eing so assured of
Gods helpe, he spake at the end of this verse, (<hi>Sela</hi>:)<note place="margin">Sela.</note> as though he had said. It is most true that God can
help and comfort me: as he holpe and comforted my
forefathers. And for the better consolation and more
firme assurance, he sheweth, how meruellously he did
helpe the posterite of Iacob &amp; Ioseph, after this sort.</p>
                  <q>16 The waters sawe thee, oh God, the waters saw
thee, and were afraid: the depthes also were troubled.</q>
                  <p>In this that he saith, The waters were afraide,
when they sawe God.<note place="margin">Vnto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible thinges be attributed sensible qualities.</note> First the maner of speach in
the Scripture is to be noted, that attributeth vnto
insensible things, sensible qualities: as in this place
is attributed vnto the water sight and feare, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in dÃ©ede properly the water cannot sÃ©e nor feare.
But, when the Scripture vseth any such phrase or
speache, there is to be marked diuers doctrines of
edifying.<note place="margin">Three doc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trines.</note> First of GOD, then insensible creatures,
and thirdly of man, for whose sake the Scripture
sometime speaketh vnto insensible creatures, as
though they were sensible, and worketh miracles in
them for the instruction and amendement of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and reasonable man.</p>
                  <p>The learning touching God is,<note place="margin">The first doctrine touching God.</note> that he worketh
his will, and vseth his creatures, as it sÃ©emeth vnto
his wisedome inscrutable most mÃ©ete and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
<pb facs="tcp:4397:122"/>
as here he troubleth and altereth the condition
of the seas and waters.<note place="margin">Gene. 1.</note> These waters were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God, in the third day of the creation, to be in
one place, and was called The Sea, a pleasaunt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a beautifull thing to sÃ©e: and God said, <hi>It
was good,</hi> as the effect thereof sheweth in dÃ©ede: for
it nourisheth the earth with necessarie moysture, by
priuie veines and secrete passages, secretely passing
through the earth. And when the floudes, that doe
moysture the earth, haue done their office, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
into their old lodging, the Sea againe: from
whence riseth the matter of showres and raine to
moisture from aboue, that flouds beneath cannot be
conueyed vnto. And it serueth for transporting the
necessaries of one realme to the other, quietly suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ships of passe with great gaine &amp; pleasure.
These and many more commodities God worketh
by this insensible creature, when it is calme and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigable:
but when he moueth it with his winds and
tempestes, it is so horrible in it selfe, that no man
may, without perill and death, trauell within it, so
raging and feareful is that pleasaunt element of tho
water, when God moueth it. It hath (by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment)
his time of calme, and time of storme:
time to profite men,<note place="margin">Time.</note> and time to vndoe men: time to
be a refuge for men in the dayes of peril, and time to
be a graue and sepulchre for men: time to conioyne
strange nations together, and time to separate them
againe: as it pleaseth the creator Almightie God to
appoint and direct it.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine that toucheth the insensible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it selfe,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine tou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ching the insensible creature.</note> is: that it can be no longer calme, nor
any longer troubled, then it pleaseth the heauenly
gouernour to dispose it. And here is to be noted, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such men as attribute stormes and calmes to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:4397:122"/>
Fortune:<note place="margin">Psal. 29.</note> whereas onely the voice of the Lord mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
tempestes, and sendeth faire weather. It is also
a doctrine against all men, that do thinke the waters
and seas may be moued, and ceasse at their owne
pleasure: which is contrarie to this Prophets doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,<note place="margin">Psal. 77.</note>
that saith: <hi>The waters sawe the Lord &amp; were
afraide.</hi> So that their trouble riseth from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of the Lord, and they cannot do what
they lust,<note place="margin">Psal. 114.</note> but what God biddeth them to doe. It is
godly set foorth afterwardes in another Psalme,
wherein the passage of the children of Israel is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
as it is in this Psalme.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine touching man,<note place="margin">The third doctrine touching man.</note> in this verse, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of mans obstinacie and stubbernesse. The
insensible creature the water, that lacketh both life
and reason, at euery commandement be as the Lord
their maker commaundeth them to be. With euery
tempest they be troubled, and with euery calme so
plaine and quiet: that it sÃ©emeth rather a stablished
land, then a variable sea.<note place="margin">Oh rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of man.</note> But let God send his word
vnto man, and the contentes thereof threaten the
tempest of all tempestes, eternall death, hell fire, and
Gods euerlasting displeasure: yet man will not
heare nor sÃ©e them, nor yet be moued any thing at
all.<note place="margin">Insensible creatures shall be a condemna<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion vnto man.</note> Or let God gently and fauourably offer his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
vnto man, and by his word exhort him neuer so
much to repentance: it is for the most part in vaine.
Therefore God by his Prophets Moses and Esaie,
called Heauen and Earth to witnesse against mans
stubbernesse and hardnesse of heart.</p>
                  <p>There is also out of this trouble of the water, this
doctrine to be learned: how to receiue consolation,
and how to learne feare by the creatures of God that
beare no life, and yet be thus troubled. Consolation
in this sort: When the penitent man that suffereth
<pb facs="tcp:4397:123"/>
affliction and trouble, sÃ©eth vnsensible thinges mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and vnquieted that neuer offended,<note place="margin">Marke most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.</note> he shal iudge
the lesse wonder at his owne trouble. When he sÃ©eth
that a sinner, and wretched offender of God, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
he shal learne feare. When he sÃ©eth God doth
punish his creatures that neuer offended, for the
sinne of man: what punishment is man worthie to
haue, that is nothing but sinne it selfe? And what
feare should this bring into Christian mens consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,<note place="margin">The diuell &amp; man be only diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to God.</note>
to knowe that no creature deserueth punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no creature disobeyeth God: but the diuel and
man? Oh what man or woman can with faith looke
vpon the least flowers of the field, and not hate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?
In Summer time, when men shall sÃ©e the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
and gardens so meruellously apparelled with
flowers of euery colour, so that he shall not be able
to discerne, whether their beautie better please the
eye, or their swÃ©ete sauour the nose:<note place="margin">Oh take heed mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man.</note> what may they
learne, in thinking of themselues (as the trueth is)
that there is nothing in them but filth and sin, that
most heynously stincke before the face of God? And
when man shal perceiue that flowers vade,<note place="margin">Consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and loose
both beautie to the eye, and swÃ©ete sauor to the nose,
that neuer transgressed: what may miserable man
thinke he is worthie to loose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is nothing but sinne,
and euer offendeth? Againe, when man shal perceiue
that God thus meruellously, after long Winter
and great stormes, doth raise out of the vile earth so
beautifull flowers, plantes, and trÃ©es: what consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may the man take that hath his faith in Christ,
to thinke that all his sinnes in his precious bloud be
forgiuen: and after long persequution &amp; cruel death,
he shall come to eternall life. After this sort did the
Prophet consider the workes of God, &amp; the troubles
of his creatures, &amp; receiued great consolation therby.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:4397:123"/>
In the end of this verse the Prophete sayth,<note place="margin">Deapthes.</note> 
                     <hi>The
deapthes were troubled.</hi> In the which words he hath
aptly shewed the mightie power of God, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
how the record of Gods fact may be his conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
In this that he saith, <hi>The deapths were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>:
there be diuers vnderstandings. If the meane
of the seas, when they are troublesome &amp; tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by soule weather, he speaketh rather after the
iudgement of such (as suffer the trouble and peril of
the waues,) that thinke at one time they fall to the
bottome of the sea, &amp; at an other time they be rather
vpon high mounteins then vpon the waters, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
thereof be so extreme: yet in dÃ©ede, the bottome
of the seas be not felt, neither doth the shippe that is
saued descend so farre: but the tempestes be so sore,
that it sÃ©emeth to the sufferers thereof, that no extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
can be more. In this sense it serueth meruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
the Prophetes purpose.<note place="margin">A goodly similitude.</note> For as they that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the tempestes of the sea, thinke there could be
no more extremitie then they susteine: so doe they
that suffer the tempest of mistrust and despaire (for a
time) of the conscience, thinke they could endure no
more extremitie of conscience: whereas in dÃ©ede,
if God should suffer them to fÃ©ele the extremitie, it
were eternall death: as the extremitie of the sea in
tempestes, is shipwracke and losse of man and goods.
But if it be vnderstoode as if standeth in the letter,
then hath the Prophet relation to the mightie hand
of GOD, that brake the red sea euen vnto the very
bottome,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.</note> and also the water of Iordane:<note place="margin">Iosua. 3.</note> that his
people might haue both a nighe way, a safe way, &amp; a
glorious way towards the land that the Lorde had
promised them. And then in this sense we learne,
that although water and winde, with all troubles
else, couer the face of the earth, in the bottome of the
<pb facs="tcp:4397:124"/>
sea, and is not possible to come to the vse of man: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
so the troublesome temptations, and great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of Gods wrath against sinne, couereth the soule
of man, that vnto the iudgement of the flesh, it shall
neuer come to haue the vse and fruition of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fauour againe. <note place="margin">Oh the mercifull goodnesse of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man inscrutable</note>But nowe, as we sÃ©e by miracle,
God maketh drie the deapthe of horrible seas, and
turneth the bottome of them to the vse of man: so
doeth he in the bloud of Christ (by the operation of
the holy ghost) drie vp and cleane lade out, the ponds
and dÃ©ep seas of mistrust &amp; heuines out of the soule,
and turneth the soule it selfe to the vse of his owne
honour, in the ioyes euerlasting. And as the water
couereth the beautie of the land: so do sinne &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
couer the image and beautie of mans soule
in this life. But as with a worde God can remedie
the one: so with the least of his mercies he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
the other. And for the better experience and
more certeintie thereof, we sÃ©e it proued by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Asaph, in this place. For the ground was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more ouerwhelmed with water, nor the bright
Sunne with dimmie cloudes: then was this poore
Prophetes spirite, with heauinesse and sorrowe of
sinne and temptations. Therefore he fÃ©eleth howe
God easeth the heart, and recordeth howe he bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
floudes and waters, to make his people a way
to rest and tranquillitie.</p>
                  <q>17 The clouds powred out water, the aire thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and thine arrowes went abroad.</q>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Noah.</note>The Prophete remembreth the meruellous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vndation
and drowning of the worlde, in the dayes
of Noah, that drowned all the world for sinne: sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
such as were in the Arke or Ship with Noah.
And he remembreth also the horrible thunder that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4397:124"/>
was heard of the people,<note place="margin">Gene. 7.</note> when God gaue his lawe
vnto them vpon mount Synai.<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> Likewise, he calleth
to remembrance the plagues of Egypt,<note place="margin">Note.</note> wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
God punished Pharao,<note place="margin">Exod. 5. 6. 7 8. 9. 10. 11.</note> his people, and the whole
land: which paines and plagues he calleth (after the
phrase of the scripture) arrowes and dartes. These
remembraunces may be comfortes to the hearers,
and to the readers, two manner of wayes. First, in
this, that God (when he punisheth) punisheth iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
as he did the whole world for sinne.<note place="margin">God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for sin.</note> Whereof
the Prophete gathereth, If sinne iustly merited, doe
trouble all the generation of man: it is no great
meruell, though sinne trouble me, that am but one
man, and a vile sinner. If sinne brought all flesh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
death, sauing those that were in the ship: is it any
meruell, though sinne make me to tremble &amp; quake?
Againe, If God, when he gaue the lawe of Moses,
and to the people, spake out of thunder, declaring
what a thing it was, to transgresse that lawe, in so
much, that al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people were afraid to heare the Lord
speake,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> and desired that Moses might supplie his
roome: what meruell is it, that my conscience trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth,
fÃ©eling that my soule hath offended the lawes
of God? And if Pharao and his realme were sore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of Gods outward plagues: what cause haue I
to feare the inwarde dread and sorrowfull sight of
sinne, shewed vnto me by Gods lawe? So that we
may take this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>solation out of this place, that God
is a iust Iudge to punish sinne:<note place="margin">God is no tyrant.</note> and not a Tyrant,
that punisheth of affection or wilfull desire. And so
saide Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 10. 119.</note> When so euer, or howe so euer thou
punish, (let men say and iudge as they list,) thou art
iust,<note place="margin">God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> and righteous be all thy doings.</p>
                  <p>The other consolation is, that in the middest of
all aduersities, God preserued penitent and faithfull
<pb facs="tcp:4397:125"/>
sinners. As in the time of the vniuersall floud, the
water hurted not Noah, nor suche as were in the
ship. In the time of Pharaos plagues, the Israelites
tooke no harme. At the giuing of the lawe, the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
perished not with lightening and thunder. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
so, sorrowes and anguish, diffidence and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of faith, they are plagues and punishments for
all men by reason of sinne: yet penitent sinners, by
reason of faith in Christ, take no hurt nor damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by them. As it appeareth by this Prophete that
was troubled in the spirite and in the body, as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellously
as could be: but yet in Christ escaped the
daunger,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> as all men shal do that repent and belÃ©eue.
Whereof we learne, that as the rayne falleth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
and yet bettereth no earth to bring foorth her
fruite, but such as is apt to receiue the rayne (stonie
rocks and barren ground being nothing the better:)<note place="margin">Hebr. 6. 10.</note>
euen so doth the plagues and rayne of Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
plague all mankinde, but none be the better
therefore, but such as repent and bewayle their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that gaue GOD iust occasion thus to punishe
them. The same is to be considered also of the verse
that followeth, which is this.</p>
                  <q>18 The lightening shone vpon the ground, the earth
was moued, and shooke therewithall.</q>
                  <p>By these manner of speaches, <hi>The lightening
shone, and the earth quaked</hi>: the Prophete setteth
foorth the strength and might of Gods power, and
willeth men to loue him and to feare him: For he
is able to defend and preserue his faythfull, and to
punish and plague the wicked. And the like he sayth
in the verse following.</p>
                  <q>19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy pathes in the deep
waters: and thy footsteps are not knowne.</q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:4397:125"/>
He taketh comfort of this miracle, that GOD
brought the Israelites through the red sea,<note place="margin">The Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites were conducted by God, through the red sea.</note> in this,
that the waters knewe the Israelites, &amp; gaue place
vnto them, that they might drye footed goe through
them. But when king Pharao and his people would
haue followed in the same path, persequuting Gods
people, the sea would make no way for him, nor yet
shew the steppes where the Israelites troade,<note place="margin">Pharao &amp; his were drowned.</note> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed
them in most desperate deaths. So in
the seas of temptations,<note place="margin">Exo. 14.</note> suche as put their trust in
the Lorde,<note place="margin">Psalm. 121. 125. 13. 46. 54. 71.</note> passe, and neuer perish by them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
such as put not their trust in the Lorde, perish in
temptations: as Pharao and his armie did by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And the next verse that concludeth the Psalme,
sheweth by what meanes the Israelites were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
God saued in the red sea: by the handes of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Aaron, as it appeareth.</p>
                  <q>20 Thou leadest thy people like sheepe, by the hand
of Moses and Aaron.</q>
                  <p>Of this verse the afflicted may learne many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations.<note place="margin">The best is not able of himself to resist temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>
First, that the best people that be, are no
better able to resist temptations: then the simple
shÃ©epe is able to withstande the brier that catcheth
him. The next, that man is of no more abilitie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of temptations, then the poore shÃ©epe is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyd
the brier,<note place="margin">Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde. They that doe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can take no harme.</note> being preserued only by the diligence
of the shÃ©epheard. The thirde, that as the shÃ©epheard
is carefull of his intangled and briered shÃ©epe; so is
GOD of his afflicted faithfull. And the fourth is,
that the people of Israel could take no harme of the
water, bycause they entered the sea at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.
Whereof we learne, that no daunger
can hurt, when God doth commaund vs to enter
<pb facs="tcp:4397:126"/>
into it: and all daungers ouercome vs, if we choose
them our selues,<note place="margin">Math. 14.</note> besides Gods commaundement. As
Peter,<note place="margin">Math. 16.</note> when he went at Gods commandement vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the water, tooke no hurt: but when he entered
into the Bishops house, vppon his owne presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was ouercome, and denied Christ. The Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
when they fought at Gods commaundement,
the perill was nothing:<note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> but when they would doe it
of their owne heades, they perished. So that we are
bound to attend vppon Gods commaundement, and
then no daunger shall destroy vs, though it paine vs.</p>
                  <p>The other doctrine is in this,<note place="margin">Such as be ministers of the Church, ought to attend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon the voyce of God.</note> that God vsed the
ministerie of Moses and Aaron, in the deliuerance of
his people: who did commanded them to do nothing,
but that the Lord did first bid. Whereof we learne,
that such as be ministers appointed of God, and doe
nothing but as God commaundeth, are to be follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.
As S. Paule saith, <hi>Followe mee, as I followe
Christ.</hi> And these men can by the word of God giue
good counsell,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.</note> and great consolation, both for bodie
and soule: as we perceiue this Prophet, in marking.
Gods doinges vnto the Israelites, applied by grace
the same wisedome and helping mercie vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
to his eternall rest, through Iesus Christ in the
world to come, To whome with the father and
the holy Ghost, be all laude and praise
world without end. Let all
Christians say,
Amen.</p>
