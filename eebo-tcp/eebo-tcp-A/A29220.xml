            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Pon Wedneſday laſt (being the 20. of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant June, 1649.) <hi>Richard Brandon,</hi> the late Executioner and Hang-man, who beheaded his late Majeſty, King of Great Brittain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life; But during the time of His ſickneſſe, his Conſcience was much troubled, and exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perplexed in mind, yet little ſhew of repentance, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his ſins, and by-paſt tranſgreſſions, which had ſo much power and influence upon him, that he ſeemed to live
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56544:3"/>
in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they in him. And upon Sunday laſt, a young man of his acquaintance going in to viſite him, fell into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, asked kim how he cid, and whether he was not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in conſcience for cutting off of the Kings head?</p>
            <p>He replyed, yes! by reaſon that (upon the time of his try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and at the denouncing of Sentence againſt him) he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a vow and proteſtation, <hi>Wiſhing God to periſh him body and ſoul, if ever he appeared on the ſcaffold to do the act or lift vp his hand againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further acknowledging, <hi>That he was no ſooner entred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcaffold, but immediatly he fell a trembling, and hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince continued in the like agony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He likewiſe confeſſed, that he had 30. pounds for his pains, all paid him in half Crowns, within an hour after the blow was given, and that he had an Orenge ſtuck full of Cloves, and a handkircher out of the Kings pocket, ſo ſoon as he was carryed off from the Scaffold, for which Orenge, he was proffered 20. ſhillings by a Gentleman in White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, but refuſed the ſame, and afterwards ſold it for tens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Roſe-mary Lane.</p>
            <p>About 6 of the clock at night, he returned home to his wife living in Roſe-mary lane, and gave her the money, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That it was the deereſt money that ever he earn'd in his life, for it would coſt him his life.</hi> Which propheticall words were ſoon made manifeſt; for it appeared, that ever ſince he hath been in a moſt ſad condition, and upon the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties firſt ſcourging of him with the Rod of meekneſſe, and the friendly admonition of divers friends, for the calling of him to repentance, yet he perſiſted on in his vicious Vices, and would not hearken thereunto, but lay raging and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſtill pointing ☞ at one thing or another, which he conceived to appear viſible before him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56544:3"/>About three dayes before he dy'd he lay ſpeechleſſe, utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many a ſigh and heavy groan, and ſo in a moſt deſparae manner departed from his bed of ſorrow. For the buriall whereof, a great ſtore of Wines were ſent in, by the Sheriff of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and a great multitude of people <hi>ſtood</hi> wayting to ſee his Corps carryed to the Church-yard, ſome crying out, <hi>Hang him Rogue, bury him in the Dung-hill</hi>; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers preſſing upon him, ſaying, <hi>They would quarter him, for executing of the King</hi>: Inſomuch, that the Church-wardens and Maſters of the Pariſh were fain to come for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of them, and (with great difficulty) he was at laſt carryed to White-chappell Church-yard, having (as it is ſaid) a bunch of Roſemary at each end of the coffin, on the top thereof, with a Rope tyed croſſe from one end to the other.</p>
            <p>And a merry conceited Cook living at the ſign of the Crown, having a black Fan (worth the value of 30 ſhilings) took a reſolution to rent the ſame in pieces, and to every feather tyed a piece of pack-thread dy'd in black Ink, and gave them to divers perſoas, who (in deriſion) for a while, wore them in their hats.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given thee an exact account and perfect rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the life and death of <hi>Richard Brandon,</hi> to the end, that the World may be convinc'd of thoſe calumnious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ann erroneous ſuggeſtions, which are dayly ſpit from the mouth of Envy, againſt divers perſons of great worth and eminency, by caſting an <hi>Odium</hi> upon them, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of the King; it being now made manifeſt, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Executioner was the only man that gave the farall blow, and his man that wayted upon him, was a Ragman li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Roſemary Lane.</p>

                  <p>VPon a late diſpute and engagement between the two Navyes at Sea, great was the reſolution and gallantry on both ſides; and for the ſpace of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours the Victory ſeemed doubtfull; but in the heat of the Conflict, Divine providence proved a Banner to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments party, and Fortune ſo attended their ſeverall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their heroick atchievements, that they ſoon became Victors over their inſulting Enemies, and in a ſhort ſpace diſpierſed that formidable Fleet, who for many moneths have lain raging upon the Neptune Seas, and forbed the two unfortunate Princes to take ſanctuary in Harbours; ſo that now the Citiſens of <hi>London</hi> may receive comfort from the Ocean, and the Marchants and others proceed unanimouſly in free Trade and Commerce without fear or moleſtation; The faciliating whereof, may cauſe thouſands to rejoyce, and ſing hallelujah, for the vanquiſhing of this potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; it being affirmed, that ſince our firſt engagement with them, we have re-taken above 30 ſhips and prizes, 200 pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordnance, and at leaſt 400 priſoners.

Therr is a Col. left in the <hi>Hague,</hi> who is to buy arms for ten thouſand men. There paſſing a boat from England to Oſtend, with divers Engliſh they were ſet upon by ſome Engliſh, who lie there and rove to get booty.

There is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure taken, that letters between Newcaſtle and this place going for Scotland, were intercepted and opened, which is likely to procure the like, and is already threatned; diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is apt to catch: Dr. Sibbald the Phiſitian, is diſcharged of his impriſonmen. upon the Fine of 500.

            <p>One thing I had almoſt forgotten, which may give ſome ſatisfaction to the Reader, <hi>viz.</hi> That a little before the death of the aforeſaid <hi>Richard Brandon,</hi> he being in ſome diſcourſ with a neighbour, touching his executing of the King, ſaid, That euen at the very point of time when he was to give the blow, a great pain &amp; ache took him round the neck, and hath ever ſince continued, and that he never ſlept quietly in mind ſaying, that his Majeſties denying to forgive him, when he fell down upon his knees unto him, hath very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his conſcience, and that he was afraid to walk along the ſtreets, or to go to his bed and ſleep without a candle bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The other fellow that was upon the Scaffold, that went in the name of his man, was one <hi>Ralph Jones</hi> a Rag-man, who liveth in Roſemary Lane; and he who now takes his place (as Executioner) is one <hi>William Loe,</hi> a Duſt carryer, and cleaner of the Dunghils.</p>
