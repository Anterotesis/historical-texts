            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS FOR THE TRYAL OF THE Earl of Torrington BY IMPEACHMENT BY THE Commons in Parliament, Rather than any other Way.</head>
            <p>THat the Nation is Obliged in Honour, Justice, and Prudence, to have the Miſcarriage of our Fleet in the late Action at Sea, throughly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and duely Puniſhed, I preſume no Man will deny.</p>
            <p>And as to the Queſtion, Which way this May and Ought to be done?</p>
            <p>That it <hi>May</hi> be done in Parliament, I conceive cannot be denyed, without ſuppoſing a very great Defect in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Government; as if it were not ſufficient to correct ſo notorious a Miſcarriage: and I know none who do deny it.</p>
            <p>And that it <hi>Ought</hi> to be done at the Proſecution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, I am clear of Opinion, for theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p n="1">I. That Way is Plain, and free from all thoſe Doubts and Queſtions, which may ariſe upon the Stat. of H3. <hi>C.</hi> 2. or and other Statute.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It being a Caſe, wherein not only this Nation, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>other States, viz.</hi> all our Confederates, are concerned, it ought in Honour and Reſpect to them to have the moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Determination that may be; and not be left to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of any Inferiour Authority; as if the Miſcarriage of ſome ordinary Officer, or ſome Cauſe of common or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Concern was to be determined.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50524:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
III. It is notoriouſly known to be the Deſire and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only of the Seamen, but generally of the People of this Nation, that Juſtice be done in this Caſe; and therefore their Repreſentatives, who are Elected and Intruſted to act for them, are obliged to demand Right on their behalf in a Caſe of ſo great Importance: And the Neglect hereof may juſtly be reſented by thoſe who choſe them.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Hononur of the State and Government is concerned to expreſs their juſt Reſentment of ſo great a Diſhonour done to both Nations: And it might be looked upon as a plain Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Unſettledneſs and Diſagreement among our ſelves, if both Houſes do not declare their Unanimity therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe may be added,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. Whereas Puniſhments do principally reſpect the Future, to prevent the like Miſchiefs for the time to come; and it is more than poſſible that ſo great a Crime was not committed without ſome Temptation from others; It is therefore poſſible that the Admiral may be able by ſome Diſcoveries to do ſuch Service to the King and Nation, as may in part expiate his Crime, and deſerve ſuch Mitigation of the Sentence, as is out of the Power of an Inferiour Court, and fit to be conſidered only in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. It being a Crime of ſo great Publick Concern, and He being a Perſon of that Quality, it is fit the Tryal ſhould be, not on a Ship at Sea, where few Perſons can come, but as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as may be, in the View of all People, that the Juſtice of the Proceedings may be viſible to all; that ſo the People may have no Cauſe to Murmur and Complain in caſe he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, nor He or his Friends have the Confidence to do it in caſe he be Condemned.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Of the Officers in the Fleet, thoſe who fought not are generally ſuſpected by the Seamen and the People; and thoſe who fought 'tis likely may be ſuſpected by him and his Friends: So that of them it will be hard to ſelect ſuch as are free from all Suſpicion of Partiality on the one ſide or the other.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The Motion in the Houſe for Tryal by Impeachment in the Name of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> may be of good Uſe to diſcover the Diſpoſition of many Members of Parliament to the Common Cauſe; and give tbe People, who are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well affected to it, occaſion to make a better Choice of ſome of their Repreſentatives another time.</p>
