            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

my body so obnoxious: but I love not
to complement so far, as to furnish

done hitherto: but I myselfe have

not yet deserv'd to challenge so
much credit to my self, without any

the <hi>Parlement</hi> considering anoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
customes, agreed only to send
their Deputies thither in their
blacks, the rather to elude the
new Oath pretended to be offer'd
them. These addressed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their <hi>Majesties,</hi> assuring
them of their Allegeance, and
beseeching the King to come and
sit on his bed of Justice (as the
<hi>Royall Throne</hi> in the <hi>Parlement</hi> is
there stiled.) In fine these Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are accepted in the forme as
they are rendred, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
is granted.</p>
            <p>But ere these <hi>Deputies</hi> part, the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> has other busines
with them, which neither any
scruple within his spirit, or gout
within his shoe can hinder him
from bringing. He acquaints
them therefore that in the time
of the King his Brother, he had
brought to the Parlement a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29804:8"/>
and made semblance
of approving it, that he might
not be taxed with disobedience:
but in truth that he judged that
Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be defective, &amp; not
observable: especially in that
part which restraines the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the <hi>Qu. Regent,</hi> to whose
prudence he intended to be the
first that should remit the sum of
the <hi>Government,</hi> without whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
limitations: and tells them
further, that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condè</hi>
was also of the same mind. Indeed
they both knew how intimately
the <hi>Queene</hi> might be grieved,
that, contrary to former prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
her <hi>Regency</hi> was so restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and hamper'd by the King
deceased, and therefore sought
by the freeing of her interests to
clear their own: for the same
prescript forme of <hi>Government</hi> did
equallize them (the <hi>First Princes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29804:8"/>
of the Blood,</hi> notwithstanding
their prerogatives in the custome
of that Kingdome) with the other
Councellors, and, it may be when
accounts were cast, render them
much inferiour: for if all results
were to passe by plurality of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
t'was easy to be ghessed, that
the <hi>Card. Mazzarin,</hi> the <hi>Secretary</hi>
de <hi>Chauigny,</hi> and the <hi>Chancellour
Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uier</hi> might joyne together
for their common interest and
sway all affaires at their owne
pleasure. This was a notable
stroke of the <hi>Princes,</hi> that looked
like a generous action, and was
received with good applause as
most agreeable to the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> which had ever
been a <hi>pure Monarchy:</hi> but there
was another fate in it, then they
expected, though at first it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to run luckily.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Monday</hi> following,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29804:9"/>
which was the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> and

and herselfe at his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand;
accompanied with the

where the <hi>Yong King</hi> first
broke up silence with these words
<hi>Messicurs,</hi> I am come to see you

My <hi>Chancellor</hi> will tell you the

            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>The death of <hi>my Lord</hi> the late
<hi>King,</hi> although it has not at all sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
me, by reason of his long
weaknesse, yet has it fild me with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29804:9"/>
so much griefe, that hitherto I have
been uncapable of comfort, or of
councell: and although the affaires
of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> should require a
continuall application to suffice to
all occasions both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
my affliction has been so
great, that it has put me beside the
thinking what J were to doe, till
to'ther day that your <hi>Deputies</hi> came
to salute the <hi>King</hi> my <hi>Son</hi> and
bring their protestations of <hi>Loyalty
and Obedience</hi> to him, beseeching
him to come and sit on his Throne
of Justice, and take the place of
his <hi>Ancestors,</hi> which act is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as a marke of <hi>Royalty,</hi>
which I were willing to doe this day
to testify to this Company, that on
all occasions I shall be well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to serve my selfe of your <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,</hi>
praying you to give unto
the <hi>King my Son</hi> and unto <hi>Me</hi> such
as you shall judge in your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29804:10"/>
to be most conducible to the
<hi>good</hi> of the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi>
resuming the Speech, addressed
it to the <hi>Queen,</hi> remonstrating to
her.</p>
            <p>The satisfaction which all the
<hi>Kingdome</hi> ought to have of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as he had sufficiently signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the <hi>Deputies</hi> of <hi>Parlement</hi>
the last <hi>Saturday,</hi> when he told
them that the whole <hi>honour</hi> of the
<hi>Government</hi> was due not only to
her <hi>Condition</hi> as <hi>Mother</hi> of the
<hi>King;</hi> but also to her <hi>merit</hi> and
<hi>virtue:</hi> and that the <hi>REGENCY</hi>
being conferred on her by the order
of the late <hi>King,</hi> and afterwards
verified in <hi>Parlement</hi> in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
he did not desire any other
part in affaires then what should
please her to impart to him, not
pretending to any vantage from
whatsoever particular clause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29804:10"/>
in the foresaid <hi>Declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Condè</hi> applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the generosity of the <hi>Duke,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
withall, that it was not only
profitable, but also necessary
to the good <hi>government</hi> of the
<hi>STATE,</hi> that the cheife authority
should not be divided.</p>
            <p>Then succeeded the <hi>Lord
Chancellor,</hi> and after him <hi>Monsieur
Talon,</hi> the <hi>King's Advocate,</hi> whose
formall speeches cannot be
brought into our lists, without
breaking them. At last, the
<hi>Chancellor,</hi> rising from his Seat
goes to the <hi>Royall Throne,</hi> and
Kneeling there expects the <hi>Kings</hi>
opinion from the mouth of the
<hi>Queen,</hi> who excused her Selfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that she had no other
then the sense of the <hi>Parlement.</hi>
Whereupon returning to hisSeat,
and asking the opinion of the
rest, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> added,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29804:11"/>
that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

subscribed to them, but for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
&amp; not to contradict the
<hi>King's</hi> will, though he ever thougt
they could not be put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and as he had, for his owne
particular, quitted all pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in it; so now it was his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the whole authority
should be committed to the
<hi>Queen.</hi> The <hi>Pr.</hi> of <hi>Condè;</hi> and all
the other <hi>Nobles, Officers,</hi> and

vote: and so the <hi>Chancellor</hi> (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,

his mind) pronounced the <hi>arrest</hi>

Mazzarini</hi> with the <hi>Secretary de

count it safe to delay any time of

agreeing wtih the reputation of our

he found true with others; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
with the Duke, whose
native ardor arising from a <hi>French,</hi>
a youthfull, and a Royal blood,
sent such spirits to croud that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
unto reason which disswaded
Fighting, and opened the Files to
the contrary; that hardly any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
could gain access, which
did not come with the sound of

reasons, which of themselves
would not serve them above the

half way, so he, to shew himselfe
the fitter Moderator, propounds a
seeming middle way, but indeed
a certain one, to engage <hi>de l' Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital,</hi>
and his other Field-Officers
in a necessity of encountring. He
tels them, hee would march the
Army as farre as the Wood (for
<hi>Rocroy</hi> stands upon a Green, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd
on all sides with a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
place of tenne miles diameter)
and there that they might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

power to fight, or to doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,

            <p>Which being the issue of that

to clear the way before
their Army, and feize himself of
such Posts as he should find conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for disposing of the maine
Body which was to follow after.
Whereupon hee pusheth through
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:29804:26"/>
few of the Enemies Guards, and
enters into a Plain of a mile and

               </hi>
might easily have prevented him,
if they had Marshalled there first,
and guarded onely two Passes,
which were so straight that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee, nor the rest of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
could have advanced through
them in any order: Or if they
had faln on them while they were
encumbred, have gotten a great
victory. But this omission was
imputed afterwards (as men are
ingenious to find out faults for the
unfortunate, and virtues for the
prosperous) to an over weening
fancy, which made them either
ignorant, or negligent of the
<hi>French</hi> motions, perswading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may be therefore fear'd to draw
off at any distance from the place,
lest the <hi>French</hi> Cavalry should find
means to effectuate that design.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gassion,</hi> being thus advanc'd to
amuse the Enemy, and by accost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nearer to inure his own men to
be more confident, and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with danger, marches on
with twelve Troops of Horse to
goe and view the Huts of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and what extent they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed,
whereby hee soon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
that General <hi>Melo,</hi> as if he
sleighted this shew as a meer bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
did but slowly rouse to put
his people in Battalia, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as a safe time, dispatcheth
notice to the Duke to hasten his
advancement with the rest of the
Army; who no lesse impatient of
all delayes, was gone afore with a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29804:27"/>
small party of Horse to pry and
learn the site of the places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts;
but immediately upon
this advice inorders the Marquis
of <hi>Géures</hi> to march afore diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with the Vantguard, to secure
yet further the passage to the rest:
But it was so troublesome, that
afore the <hi>French</hi> Army could get
well through, the <hi>Spanish</hi> was
come up in set Squadrons ready
to charge them, which made the
<hi>Duke</hi> push his Van the more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to get room, obliging the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to quit a certain emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
which they had first got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>The Captains that had been met
in <hi>Melo</hi>'s Praetorium to advise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Battel were diversly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
particularly the Camp-Master
General, the Count of

experience, delivered this as his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29804:27"/>
sence: That it would be the best
way to guard their station onely
til General <hi>Bek</hi> should arrive with
his supplies of four thousand men
more, but a few houres then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
and at night to entrench
themselves, that so the Enemy
might not venture to come on till
they were ready for them without
apparent hazzard. But the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour

to have already the over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Adversary, and the
taking of opportunity by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
to be necessary to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
disposed himselfe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prepare for the Battel.</p>
            <p>The two Armies being come
within Musket-shot, saluted one
another with loud out-cryes, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Hats in the air, and their
Montiers in one anothers faces:
And as if the manner of managing
each Army had been debated in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29804:28"/>
the same Council, and Fortune
resolved to put them on even
termes before the Combat, they
both deferred the decision of the
quarrel till the next day, beating
as it were an <hi>alta</hi> by mutual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
and that (which the
oldest Souldier did admire) with
so much quiet on both sides (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that their Cannon began to
parley before the evening, to the
greater damage of the <hi>French,</hi>
that were the worser furnished of
Artillery) that a false Allarm did
not passe all night between them.
The Duke though he would faine
anticipate <hi>Bek,</hi> yet could not come
up to engage, because his left
Wing had yet but a dangerous
station among the Marshes. The
same respect to <hi>Bek</hi> made the
<hi>Governour</hi> entertain the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
being herein, it may be,
the more unhappy, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:29804:28"/>
entirely followed his owne
inclination of buckling sooner
while the <hi>French</hi> were encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd,
nor yet the counsel of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,</hi>
to entrench himself: but
being still tenacious of his first
conceipt, lest the <hi>French</hi> should
get more succours to pass into the
Town, he by night withdrew his
Army nearer to it, and brought
himselfe to want such roome as
before he had commodious for
him.</p>
            <p>The Marshal <hi>de Gassion</hi> made a
better use of the darknesse, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
his right Wing (a stratagem
which hee said hee had learned

the untrustinesse of the ground,
and promising to conduct them
the next day to the head of their
Enemyes. A thing that assured
his Souldiers to him; endearing
his courage to their affection, and
their endeavours to his utmost
service. But when the Armyes
met again the next morning, that
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> houted to the <hi>French</hi>
with opprobrious language, the
tydings of their <hi>King's</hi> death,
which indeed the <hi>French Generals</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:29804:29"/>
had received over night, with
order (as 'twas reported) not to
venture on a Battel; but they so
prudently dissembled it, that this
stratagem was deaded (like a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non

incredulity of the Souldiers; and
so now nothing else remained but
the chocque it self.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Cavalry (in all six

the whole Army (except a Body

to sacrifice their lives to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for the expiating of their

They maintained their ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
2 houres, having sustained

hold it out till the whole dispute
might be re-co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menced, and force

marching, he sends command to
General <hi>Beck</hi> to flank them with
6000 men, and wait upon their
motions: who now ghessing at
the true designe, crossed the <hi>Meuse</hi>
at <hi>Namur</hi> cutting thereby a nearer

accosted them that before they

            <p>This exploit suffic'd the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
for this Campagne, &amp; the
<hi>Lords States</hi> found themselves so

the applications of the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador

scarce prevaile with them from
unseasonable reclaiming of their
army to winter quarters, a thing
which strangely disgusted the
<hi>French</hi> Ministers, to see how little
their confederates esteemed the
common cause, while they loved
so well their money, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they would receive it in
nothing else but Franks of weight,
which they might returne with
most advantage in the species of
their owne Countrey, And when
they had received it against the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:29804:39"/>
common enemy, employ'd it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to counter-balance their
friends prosperity, as if they more
desired to gage their progresse,
through jealousy of the future,
then advance their owne interest
with present acquisitions. And
these misprisions were the more
augmented by their starting back
from the articles already made
with <hi>France,</hi> alleadging that the
Queen being to pay them certain
summes according to the treaty,
which she could not doe but by
authoritie of the young King, it
should be necessary to renew the
overtures of agreement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
though they did not shew
themselves obstinate, but at last
complyed with the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
in confirming the last
treaty; yet they gave the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
to observe their coldnesse,
and thereby to move with them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:29804:39"/>
the more instantly, to sever them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the <hi>French</hi> interests,
and treat apart their owne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of peace with the King of

forme of message, which
the Count brought with the Kings
declaration (according to which,
notwithstanding, she had confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him in her Council) intended
to chastise him with the veirges
of Royall eyes, or he having pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
to sit in Council covered,
did frie (as we say) in his own
grease by the dayly kindlingof his

answerable regard or estimation:

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine, he was so much perplexed,
that he could not refrain to ease
his mind in the breast of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor;
who thereupon preaching
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29804:46"/>
to him of the vanitie of all wordly
happinesse, or Court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>favour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with an exhortation to
him to think of another way of
employing his devoirs, for the
good of Christendome, by promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the generall peace, and
insted of that office of Secretary of
the King's commandments, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himself to become a Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary
of the Crowne, at the
<hi>Munster</hi> treaty. Which done, this
Father (<hi>Amelot</hi> of the order of the
Orators) informes the Countesse
of <hi>Brienne,</hi> what thoughts and
resolutions were working in the
mind of the Secretary <hi>de Chavig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
who being a Lady of high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,
&amp; of a present and subtle spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
applauded these his purposes,
advising the Father to keep him
still intent upon them. And a
while after this, she sends in hast
for the Priest again, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29804:47"/>
to him, under the seale of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy,
this intelligence, which she
said she had heard herselfe in the
Queens Cabinet, from her owne
mouth, that the Qu. intended to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>move
the secretary <hi>de Chavigny</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his place, &amp; therefore out of good
affection, to prevent any such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome
accident, she had took
that care to get a timely meeting
with him (the said father) that
by his meanes some notice of it
might be conveighed to the Count
to make his best advantage of it.
Nor were these tidings any soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
trilled in his eare, but they
found a ready credence, and as
soone imported his passion with
the fear of such a slurre, the doubt
of removal from all other publick
managements, and loosing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument
(which they use in
<hi>France</hi> with Royall priviledge) of
his decession, so that hastening to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:29804:47"/>
the Cardinal, he importunes the
favour of him, to obtaine a licence
for him from the Queen, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit
his charge of Secretary, and
he omitted no argument to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wade
him: yet (not prevailing)
would not faile to satisfie his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
but accordingly procures a
liberty for him to transferre his
office to the Count of <hi>Brienne,</hi>
re-imbursing himself of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that he pretended.</p>
            <p>But afore this businesse was well
ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>complished, <hi>Chavigny</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
himselfe better, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his resolution, employed his
principall friends, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> towards
the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> to help restore
him to his former station. But
the Queen answered, that she
could not so disparage herselfe
and government by admitting an
imputation of feminine inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:29804:48"/>
that he demised his charge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to the Count of <hi>Brien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi>
against her will, and now that he
had the grant of it, she would not
hear of any retractation, yet she
condescended, at the instance of
the Cardinall, to salve his Honour,
in the nominating of him for one
of her Plenipotentiaryes for the
generall peace, which did a little
palliate the reputation of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
from the piercing aire of
court-talke, that being a person of
spirit &amp; policie, he should be so tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan'd
between a Priest &amp; a woman.</p>
            <p>A sleighter cause then, this did
almost occasion a great embroile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for one night when the
Dutchesse of <hi>Montbazon</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells
at her house, she caused one
of her waiting Gentlewomen to
take up two love-letters, that fell
from the Marquis of <hi>Coligny,</hi> a
Cosin &amp; a confident of the Duke of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:29804:48"/>
               <hi>Anguyen,</hi> and so consequently of his
sister the Dutchesse of <hi>Longueville,</hi>
and thence conveighing them to
her owne chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had them read
before many Gentlemen perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, that that Lady had direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to the Marquis (which was
thought to be of envy, because she
had a picque at this (which was the

The Princesse of <hi>Condè</hi> having

<hi>she was most willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
thereunto, since for her
Majestyes pleasure and the welfare
of the Kingdome she was to sacrifice

Dutchesse of <hi>Montbazon,</hi> (having
laid aside her mourning for that

with her hair, her eyes &amp; her black

came close up to the Princesse, and
after mutuall salutations began to
read a billet tied to her Fan in
these precise termes. <hi>I come to

Princesse interrupted her, saying

<hi>Madam, I am come hitherto
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29804:50"/>
protest to you, that I am most innocent
of the basenesse, wherewithall I am

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nour,
that can affirme such a calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
and if I had committed any
fault in this sort, I should submit
readily to any penalty, that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
should appoint me, nor should I
ever appear in the sight of the world,
without having askt you pardon.
And I beseech you to beleeve, that I
shall not at any time faile in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
which I owe, and that conceipt
which I have of the virtue and merit
of</hi> Madam de Longueville. To
which again the Princesse answered,
<hi>Madam, I axcept readily of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
which you give me of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no share in the slander divulged,
referring all to the Command which
the Queen has herein laid upon me.</hi>
Which thus ended, the Lady of
<hi>Montbazon</hi> turned to the Princesse
and after a short discourse, tooke
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29804:50"/>
her leave, with the like haughtines,
as she shewed at her first entrance.</p>
            <p>And it soone appeared, that
these greifes were but sleightly
skinned; for a while after when
the Queen was invited by the
Dutchesse of <hi>Chevreuse</hi> to a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet,
in her garden, she would
have had the Princesse to have
gone in with her; but she refusing
to come where the Dutchesse of
<hi>Montbazon</hi> was, her Majesty sent
courteously to the said Dutchesse,
to desire her, that she would be
pleased to withdraw herselfe,
wherin when she discover'd a great
reluctancy, the Queen herselfe
withdrew, much altered, and
gave order forthwith to the secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<hi>de Guenega ud,</hi> to intimate to
her in her name, that she abstain
from Court: and she indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
nothing lesse, prevented
that order; retiring to her place
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29804:51"/>
at <hi>Rochefort,</hi> about some 30 miles
from <hi>Paris:</hi> but thither 'tis sent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her, that she doe not stirre
from thence without precise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from her Majesty.</p>
            <p>This gave pretences to the
Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> to get some
blades about him: especially since
'twas commonly said in <hi>Paris,</hi> that
the Marquis of <hi>Coligny</hi> being now
on his returne from the Campe at
<hi>Thionville,</hi> intended to retort some
iujuryon of Madam <hi>Montbazon</hi> for
the blemish wherewithall she had
asperst him. Nor was that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
rumour of a vaine surmise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for as soone as the Marquis was
arrived, he sent a challenge to the
Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> as the chiefe of all
that justifi'd that Ladyes quarrel,
wherein he fell twice wounded to
the ground and was permitted by
the like generosity of the Duke,
which scorn'd at first to serve it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:29804:51"/>
self of the prerogative of his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and quality, to rise again.
But yet at last, though the Duke
had received a sleight wound in
his right shoulder, he buckled a
gain so strictly with his defier,
that he forc't him to part with
his sword, and aske his life of him,
though it could not much availe
him, for (God not being so intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
he died shortly after of the
hurts received in this encounter.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Chavigny</hi> was
now providing for his journey, &amp;
whether it were for a faire diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
or for curiosity to see some
of his choicer utensills, especially
a couple of stately court-cupboards
of white and gilt plate, or rather
intended by the Queen and Card.
as an Honour to him, Her <hi>Majesty</hi>
came to entertain herself with the
said Count at the Castle of <hi>Boisde
Vincennes,</hi> whereof he was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29804:52"/>
but in the middle of this
treatment arrives <hi>Beaufort,</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
(as 'twas surmised) a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
alteration in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
when he mist the Cardinal
there, to whom he was become
diffident, and towards whom he
had an ill eye, as the obstacle of his
designes, while certain Cavaliers,
suspected to be set by him to kill
his Eminency, scouted in little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:29804:56"/>
good successe at first promising

Whereupon, according
to appointment, the Marquesse
of <hi>Mortara</hi> issues out of <hi>Fraga,</hi>
with a body of 2500 horse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Lerida,</hi> a place whereof the

their sollicitude that way, and
otherwise to pay themselves by
surprising some of their enemys
in the quarters thereabouts,
which taking effect, as it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,

that His King did not make

his Enemeies. This allarme
sounded high at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where
the Vice-roy, for want of expected

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29804:56"/>
ready to put himselfe into the
field with forces able to wage his

while the countrey was in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger: and they again
from him, their backwardnesse at
such a time, to lend their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
towards the paying of his
armie, whereby he got from them
a summe of 50000 Crownes, and
then put himselfe on the way to
<hi>Lerida,</hi> to provide for its securitie
and that of <hi>Flix,</hi> which two he
most feared. And once, when he
went out with a party to cleer the
Coast, he fell foule on a greater

by nature bold and froward
was trap't in the middle of them,
his followers routed, and himself

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29804:57"/>
having been by good fortune un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known

            <p>The Vice-roy was sufficiently

them to battle: but he returnes

with his forces backe to <hi>Leri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
and shortly after to <hi>Barcelona,</hi>
to their great disgust there, and
the Governour of <hi>Monçon</hi> was left
to make his owne conditions, as
he did very honorably: and this
exploit (which made way for that
of <hi>Lerida</hi> the next year) sufficed
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for this Campagne,
returning to their winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

            <p>In our way from hence to <hi>Italy</hi> we

for some new favour from
their fortune, as usually happens
at such junctures, if before he
saw himselfe duely placed in his
charge, he had not seen his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
successefull in the field by the
taking of <hi>Villanuova d' Asti</hi> (a
place which bridled <hi>Asti,</hi> the only
prise which the <hi>French</hi> had made
the last Campagne in lieu of the
<hi>Tortona</hi>) and now at liberty to
employ their entire forces with
the <hi>Savoyards</hi> on some other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise.</p>
            <p>And first they attempted <hi>Ales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandria,</hi>
securing all the advenues
about the place with about 8000
foot, and 4000 horse excepting
only one quarter reserved for the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:29804:59"/>
Marquis of <hi>Ville,</hi> who was now
ready to returne thither from <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanuoua,</hi>
with 2000 foot more: but
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took that nicke of
time to reinforce that garrison,
though before well enough provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(but that the Prince trusted
somewhat to his intelligence with
in it) with 1000 more both horse
and foot, which obliged them to
give over that designe, as not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
so that now it returned to
the Council what exploit to try
next, <hi>Valenza</hi> was most in their
eye, but their forces scarce suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
because to straiten that they
should be held to maintaine
their siege in two quarters on the
opposite banks of <hi>Po;</hi> and <hi>Breme,</hi>
though a noble prize, was too
strongly fortified. Wherefore the
result fell on <hi>Trino,</hi> a place that
might be more commodiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
a and being neare their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:29804:59"/>
friends, might better subsist there
with their armie, and free them
from the ordinary annoiances,
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> turned on
them from that Hold: yet neither
could they now wind their march
with such traines though they divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and went about; as to seduce
their enemy: or prevent his put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in 200 dragoones, and Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassiers
the same night that they
came to blocke it, making up in
all a garrison of 1500 foot, and
300 horse, under the command of
the Baron of <hi>Vatteville</hi> their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>
            <p>While the Prince, with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the
Vicount (now Marshal) of <hi>Turenne,</hi>
employed themselves in this Siege,
they appointed Monsieur <hi>de Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unges,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Casale,</hi> with a
part of that garrison, and other
levies made about the Country
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:29804:60"/>
adjacent to take in <hi>Camin</hi> a little

moneths, (when those within hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

river to hinder any succours. The
garrison had 800 foot in it without

their owne defence, till they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
did accidentally set fire to a
mine of their enemies which blew
up the miner and two other work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
but made such abreach upon
themselves, as forced them also to

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:29804:61"/>
the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>League</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned.
And however
among the infinite revolutions
that every age produceth, there
remaines but little record to
posterity; save only where a lavish
sword does engrave its owne
tracke in indelible characters;
yet in those emergents, which
have gnaw'd their passage by the
teeth of time, and travell through
the joints of severall coalescent
fortunes, there are left (though
in lighter mould) more curious
signatures of humane passions to
be observed.</p>
            <p>When this quarrell first began,
and the <hi>French</hi> to intercede in it,
the Cardinall of <hi>Richeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u</hi> was at
the helme, and he in a bad opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the Pope: so that after
the breach of the treaty at <hi>Castel-G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
orgio,</hi> the <hi>French &amp; Ecclesiasticks</hi>
did recriminate one another, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:29804:61"/>
the Pope charged <hi>Richelieu</hi> and
his instrument <hi>de Lionne,</hi> to
study rather to imbroile all things,
then to pacify: and he every where
declaimed against the <hi>Barberini,</hi>
and wrote in his owne defence
against the Cardinall <hi>Spada,</hi> who
had been the <hi>Popes</hi> Plenipotenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly
at that treaty. But when the
cardinall <hi>Mazzarini</hi> was come to
the Goverment: the Pope and the
<hi>Barberini</hi> consider'd him as a great
confident obliged to them for his
advancement, and bore a better
eye to any overtures that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from that crowne.
And he, that had not so much
quick-silver in his humour, as his
predecessor applied himselfe the
more seriously to gaine this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as a notable point to illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the reputation of that crown
and accredit himselfe in his owne
Country. Wherefore considering
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:29804:62"/>
that although the Marquis of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenay's</hi>
returne, did somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the <hi>French</hi> interposition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
new request; yet <hi>Mons de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onne,</hi>
by reason of disgusts that had
passed, could no more continue a
gracious person in the way of
mediating, he procures the send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Cardinall <hi>Bichi,</hi> then in
<hi>France,</hi> in a noble way, and full
commission to be the Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary
of that crowne, and its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
between the parties: which
by reason of the Quality and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of the person, an <hi>Italian,</hi> a
Cardinall, the most accort and
full of Gentilesse of any other,
was generally accepted with these
Princes, and all proceedings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a peace, left in suspense till
his arrivall, though <hi>de Lionne,</hi> and
the other <hi>French</hi> Ministers, did
nothing slacke their wonted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
to promote them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:29804:62"/>
And this was a quick in centive to
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to thrust in between
this juncture, and get the standard
of his auhority erected first on
the temple of peace; (especially in
that countrey where his awe had
formerly borne so high, that the
Princes of it durst not dispose of
their subjects, of their children, or
of their own persons without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of his Council: &amp; the <hi>French,</hi>
that were his competitors, had not
a foot of land in it, besides their
late acquists, that yet were under
contestation) but many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
did still create him new
impediments.</p>
            <p>And first, that through the
whole Pontificate of this Pope,
which nowhad lasted 20 years and
upwards, there had been <hi>perpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uae
simultates</hi> betwixt him and the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> these declaring him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
to their interests, as in effect
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:29804:63"/>
his Nephews were constant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisans
of the other side. Then,
that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador and
the Cardinalls, that were depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
of that Crown, had divers
Moneths since (and before <hi>Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi>)
retir'd in disgust from <hi>Rome</hi>
(because the <hi>Portugall</hi> Ambassador
(<hi>Lamego</hi>) pretending to be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and by assistance of the
<hi>French,</hi> repulsing the <hi>Spaniard's</hi>
violence, and endangering his
Person in a street encounter,
were countenanced more then
He) whereby there rested a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
strangenesse on all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposalls,
with such a distance,
that every overture tooke wind
before it tooke effect: whereas the
<hi>French</hi> were still at hand to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
all their instances with life
and presence towards the <hi>Pope,</hi>
towards the <hi>Republick,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the respective <hi>Princes.</hi> Add
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:29804:63"/>
to these, that it was so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any resolutions or patents
could come from <hi>Spain;</hi> that those
which at last arrived to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
of <hi>Naples,</hi> to the Governor of
<hi>Milan,</hi> to their Ambassador at
<hi>Venice,</hi> to the Cardinalls <hi>Monti,
Cueua,</hi> and <hi>Albernoz</hi> were all stale
and importune: and so according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were their Ministers treated by
the Cardinall <hi>Barberino,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
nothing else but good
words to them, and old rejected
propositions, which had first been
in the <hi>French</hi> hands, and could not
be adjusted. And when they
complain'd to the League of their
non-admission to be Mediators;
not withstanding their Masters
good will, and right of neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to interpose in all good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffices,
they receive in answer:
that it was not their part to offer;
but accept conditions from the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:29804:64"/>
part of Rome, and that they were
ready to hear any, that should
bring the fairest termes of peace,
which they had had before in
ampler manner from the <hi>French</hi>
Ambassador: and therefore gaind
no more but complement, and to
be made acquainted civillyas they
proceeded.</p>
            <p>Besides these, there were two
other obstalces, close: but more
insuperable: the first, that the
King of Spain sent not any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
on that purpose, whereas
the French had first recalled the
Marshal <hi>d' Extrée</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had incurred disgusts
there, and sent the Marquis of
<hi>Fontenay</hi> in his sted, on this very
errand: and when he also was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusted,
and gone from <hi>Rome,</hi> they
soon procured his re-calling; and
the better to promote his applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
dispatched first <hi>de Lion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:29804:64"/>
and then <hi>Bichi,</hi> to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
them with the other parties:
which were otherwise accepted,
then the Agents or Ambassadors of
the Vice-roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Milan,</hi> whose power in
any emergent difficulty should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
to the Council at <hi>Madrid.</hi>
The other, that when the <hi>Pope</hi>
would have joined with the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards</hi>
to chastise the <hi>French,</hi> when
their Ambassador had retir'd and
left him hardly pressed by the
League, there were no aides or
Compliances to be got from them
(as the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> did also
find, notwithstanding promises to
keep him from accepting the
<hi>French</hi> proffers, who as readily
suppy'd him both with men and
money) whether for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
or because reduc't to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
frugality to make both the
ends of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:29804:65"/>
and lend besides an help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand to <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereas they
saw, to their great jealousy, a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of <hi>French</hi> both in Popes and
leagues service, not knowing how
they might be bestowed either in
the warres, or after a peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bichi</hi> arrived in <hi>Iune</hi> to execute
his commission, and first takes a
Passe of the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> to
conduct himself from <hi>Genoua</hi> to
<hi>Parma,</hi> where that Duke being
then absent, the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi>
took occasion to invite him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to complement, and prepare
him for certain private interests,
which he desired to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in the treaty of peace;
but thought it not then time to
discover himself freely, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to take any cognisance, onely
to sound his intentions, &amp; take the
altitude of his aims, which were

at other pretensions that he had

his way to <hi>Bondeno,</hi> a town of the
state Ecclesiastical, where the D.
of <hi>Parma</hi> was, having taken it in
the war, and treats with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the propositions which had
already been sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to
him, by the Marquis of <hi>Fontenay;</hi>
but he found him most determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
now the terme assigned at
<hi>Castel-Georgio</hi> was expired, to
hearken to no depositing; but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
restitution: wherein ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
well inform'd himself of his
disposition, he goes to <hi>Corraro,</hi> the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Proveditor at <hi>Finale,</hi>
from whom he could onely get
thus much in general terms, that
the colleagues did desire a firme
and durable peace, and that the
late treaty at <hi>Castel-Georgio</hi> did
admonish them to proceed with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:29804:66"/>
circumspection. Whereupon he

that the Grand Duke might not

and when he arrived there, his

When he came to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines,
they ordered the <hi>Podestà</hi> of

force the <hi>Bavarians</hi> out of <hi>Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
and seize themselves of their
quarters: that so they might not
onely subsist themselves; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
the burden of those Soldiers
on the estates of their own Elector,
and so oblige him to hearken to
a peace, and raise themselves to
the higher reputation, within <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>

            <p>The arrivall of the Count of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:29804:78"/>
               <hi>Ranzaù</hi> (making the army up some
14000 men) was very troublesome
to the thoughts of the Marshall of
<hi>Guebrian,</hi> least he, being a great
favorite of the Cardinal's, should
be sent as his controller, and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
disgrace should happen, to be
his successour, which apprehension
became disastrous to his conduct:
for although he were more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
then any other, of the danger
of passing too hastily to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side of the <hi>Rhine:</hi> yet the sense
of <hi>Ranzau,</hi> being followed by the
officers under him, imposed a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eessity
on the Marshal to put it in
execution: so that on the first
day of <hi>Novemb.</hi> they began to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
by a bad token; for the sky,
that was clear before, mantled on
a sudden, and fell in continued
folds of snow for a moneth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which made the ways so deep
that the Cannon was not drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29804:78"/>
without great dificulty: and
Generall <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a,</hi> whom the Marshal
sent before to discover and cleer
the coast, though he had been, at
other times, a vigilant &amp; a valiant
Captain, was at night surprised
in his Quarter, by one Coll. <hi>Sporch,</hi>
a Captain before of no note; and
his men, which were the double
number, routed by 600 of this
<hi>Sporch's,</hi> with the prise of 800
horse. Which news being brought
to <hi>Guebrian</hi> did so amuse him, that
he said publickly: that such a Capt.
that had given so signall proofes
of his valour, in 30 severall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and above, which he could
reckon, should be so surprised and
beaten by one Coll. <hi>Sporch,</hi> did
confirme in him his former doubts
that, what had been prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the councill, would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in the event, and with that
he went to hear Masse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:29804:79"/>
The squadrons of <hi>Ranzau</hi> were
but ill provided for the warfare
of a <hi>German</hi> winter: and many got
away from the army. Nor was
the scarcity of bread a small disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to it, which the beaten Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
put among the baggage; but
the rest that carried it in their
Knapsacks spoil'd by the weather;
so that once again, <hi>Guebrian</hi> devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to assigne them to their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
but <hi>Rantzau</hi> again prevailed
with him to assault <hi>Rotweil,</hi> a
place fortified with towers and a
dry trench without bulwarks: and
the Snow continuing the Cannon
was not yet arrived at the Campe;
so that the defendants repulsed all
assaults with great slaughter, and
prolong'd the time till the <hi>Bavari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
had united all their forces to
come and succor it: so that once
again the Gen. mov'd with the
Count of <hi>Ranzau</hi> to withdraw
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:29804:79"/>
their army: but with the like suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
as he had done before.
Wherefore applying his utmost
diligence to prosecute the storme,
and direct the mines with one of
the ordnance (that were since com
in) he was stricken by a Cannon
shot in the right arme, which
proved mortall to him, and grive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the soldiery (he being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
one of the prime Captains
of the age) who notwithstanding,
after 14 dayes spent in this siege,
constrained the delivery of this
place.</p>
            <p>But least the death of <hi>Guebrian</hi>
should seeme to contibute to the
glory of <hi>Ranzàu,</hi> while he leads the
army further to <hi>Tutlinghen,</hi> the
<hi>Bavarians</hi> come upon him on the
sudden, by the benefit of a wood
near at hand, and having surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the artillery, unexpectedly
turned it against the city, and then
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:29804:80"/>
blockt it up, holding all the
Souldiers within it, Prisoners. On
which noise, Generall <hi>Rosa</hi> hastens
with his Cavalry to the Head-quarter:
but finding his attempt
too late, and the <hi>Bavarians</hi> set
in battel, he went to return to
<hi>Rotweil:</hi> but before he could
recover it, he finds it reprised by
his enemies. The other Quarters
of the <hi>French</hi> Army were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powr'd
