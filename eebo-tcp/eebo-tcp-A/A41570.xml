            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Examination and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Colonell Goring, touching the
late Conſpiracie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving been told there was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to unite the Forces of our
<hi>Armie,</hi> and to put it into a poſture
of being <hi>able,</hi> if not of purpoſe
of being <hi>willing,</hi> to interpoſe in
the <hi>proceedings of Parliament:</hi> I hearkned to
the <hi>propoſitions</hi> of ſolliciting a <hi>redreſſe</hi> for the
miſeries of the <hi>Souldiers,</hi> being the firſt ſtep to
this, in reſpect of the preſent neceſſities of it,
not any future conſequence of trouble to thoſe
that were to procure our reliefe.</p>
            <p>But, leſt the manner of asking this, or the
effects of it being obtained, might be leſſe juſt
then the thing it ſelfe which was deſired, and I
might be involved in their <hi>crimes,</hi> that had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ends perhaps then meerly <hi>the redreſſe of our
Armies grievances:</hi> I thought it not unſafe, to
take ſome witneſſes of mine integrity along
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108712:3"/>
with me, and ſpoke to a noble <hi>Lord</hi> the very
ſame day, when I aſſured <hi>him,</hi> there were ſome
<hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Armie</hi> that were leſſe thought on,
that had greateſt zeale to the proceedings of
this <hi>Houſe,</hi> And I thought there would be an
occaſion to let him know more of it.</p>
            <p>Within few dayes after this, M. <hi>Iermyn</hi> and
I were admitted into a conſultation, where
wee were tyed to ſecrecie by an <hi>Oath,</hi> in the
company of thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> I have named
in my <hi>Depoſitions,</hi> where their <hi>purpoſe</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to us in ſome <hi>propoſitions,</hi> which were to
this effect.</p>
            <p>1. Putting an <hi>Armie</hi> into a Poſture to ſerve
the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Sending a <hi>Declaration</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
containing, That no <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould
bee made contrary to any former <hi>Act</hi> which
was expreſſed, That the Epiſcopacie ſhould be
kept up as it is now.</p>
            <p>3. And that the <hi>Kings revenue</hi> ſhould be
<hi>eſtabliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:108712:3"/>
            <p>This I thought unlawfull for our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings;
ſince I thought they intended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
the <hi>determinations</hi> of this <hi>Houſe;</hi> and, it
belongs to an <hi>Armie,</hi> to <hi>maintaine,</hi> not to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive</hi>
Acts of State.</p>
            <p>I objected therefore againſt the <hi>propoſitions,</hi>
and preſſed more the <hi>Follies</hi> and <hi>Difficulties,</hi>
then the <hi>illegalities</hi> of them; not onely becauſe
I thought <hi>Reaſon,</hi> a greater Argument with
them, then <hi>Conſcience,</hi> but becauſe I am ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
of the two, to bee thought a worſe
<hi>Common-wealths man,</hi> then a Souldier, and in
that quality, could procure moſt credit to my
words: And I endeavoured to ſhew them, that
as the <hi>Deſigne</hi> would be impious, if their moſt
<hi>Deſperate Counſell</hi> had beene followed, ſo it
would have beene the weakeſt that ever was
undertaken, if it were admitted.</p>
            <p>And whereas I am ſaid to have a part in
this <hi>violent Counſell;</hi> till the day before this
meeting, I never heard word of it: I knew
not when I came to the Roome, whether theirs
were not the ſame with the other; this they
may witneſſe for me; and that I declared, that
I would have to doe with neither, And that I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108712:4"/>
expreſſed a Contempt of our meeting in that
manner.</p>
            <p>But I relye upon the <hi>Teſtimonie</hi> of ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Lords</hi> of his <hi>Majeſties Councell,</hi> and others,
how I proteſted againſt all thoſe <hi>violent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells,</hi>
even in the birth of them, and with what
pity I looked towards the perſon of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,</hi>
and the whole Kingdome, in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>I appeale alſo to <hi>them,</hi> and to ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of this Houſe, what my carriage was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
theſe Gentlemen that were embarqued
in theſe undertakings, intending rather to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a miſchiefe by abandoning their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells,</hi>
then to ruine them, by diſcloſing them.</p>
            <p>But miſtake me not, for had I knowne of
any former plot proceeded in, that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger,
or diſturb the quiet of his <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> or
the peace of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> I ſhould not have
beene contented with declaring mine owne
<hi>Innocencie,</hi> nor have ſtayed till the Command
of this <hi>Houſe,</hi> or an Oath, extorted from mee a
Diſcovery; But by a haſty, open Declaration,
have broken the Lawes of <hi>Amity,</hi> and <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
and all former tyes, to preſerve the duty of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108712:4"/>
a ſubject; and as freely expoſed the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>All,</hi> to the view of the world, as I
have beene tender in publiſhing theſe <hi>purpoſes,</hi>
even to my neereſt friends, which had waight
enough to cruſh nothing but the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of it. And certainly, if they had ſtayed
where I left them, there was no <hi>concluſion</hi>
at all.</p>
            <p>It appeares, there were two ſeverall <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
digeſted by others before they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to me, and I knew not, whether
my hearkning to them were a <hi>fault,</hi> but I am
ſure it was a <hi>misfortune.</hi>
