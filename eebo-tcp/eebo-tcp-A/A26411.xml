            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Earth, Earth, Earth,</hi> Hear the Word of the Lord, <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 29. To Thee O <hi>Richard Brown</hi> I speak, in the Words of the great <hi>Iehovah,</hi> given in into his Servants and Prophets by his Eternal Spirit; by vertue whereof, thus saith the wisest of men, <hi>The <hi>Merciful</hi> man doth <hi>good</hi> to his own Soul, but he that is <hi>cruel, troubleth his own flesh.</hi>
               </hi> O man, consider thy wayes, what hath been thy Work, for these many years last past? What good didst thou do to thine own Soul, in thy mercy thou shewedst to the <hi>Kings</hi> Friends at <hi>Abington?</hi> Were not thy tender mercies there, the mercies of the wicked, even meer cruelty? <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 17. And now the Tide is turn'd, art thou ready to say of thine own Violent Actings, as once old <hi>Iacob</hi> did, of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levies</hi> cruel dealings against the <hi>Shechamites,</hi> Gen. 49. 7. <hi>Cursed be mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for it was fierce, and my wrath, for it was cruel?</hi> Or rather, art
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53930:3"/>
thou not going about to plaister up that old inveterate, malignant, and festred Sore, with a far worse Plaister, than was the Sword that made that Wound; So that it may be said to Thee, in the words of the Prophet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 23. <hi>Can the</hi> Ethiopian <hi>change his skin, or the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard his spots?</hi> no more canst thou do good, that hast been accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do evil; Art not thou now with double and triple diligence, breathing out Threatnings and Slaughter <hi>(Saul</hi>-like) against the Church of God, as if they had been, or at present were the Kings greatest Enemies; but hadst thou ever been a Scholar in Christs School, and hadst been tutored by his Usher, that Holy Spirit of Truth, whose Fruit is, <hi>Love, Ioy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentlenesse and Goodnesse, Meeknesse and Temperance;</hi> Thou wouldest then have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out a far easier Lesson, than <hi>Cruelty, Violence, Malice</hi> and <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;</hi> and wouldest also have experimentally known, that Christs Laws, teach the best Loyalty to Earthly Princes, and the purest Love to our very Enemies.</p>
            <p>And now I speak of <hi>Love,</hi> give me leave (O <hi>Richard Brown)</hi> to speak some few words in love to Thee, who appearest by thy violent Actings, to be a bitter Enemy to <hi>King Iesus,</hi> in persecuting him in his Members; and therein pretendest thy self to be a great Friend to <hi>King Charles;</hi> the contrary whereof, I hope will be manifested here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in this discourse, in its due place.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, in love I shall let thee know, my End of this my <hi>Alarm,</hi> that so I might prove my <hi>Thundering</hi> to be natural, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting as well of <hi>Lightning</hi> (if possible) to the enlightning the eyes of thy understanding; as well as to shew Thee the Judgements of God against thy Violent and Inhumane Dealings; to which purpose, I am at this time, come to <hi>beat up thy Quarters,</hi> and in Christian Love to deal with Thee; and (to speak after the manner of men) <hi>like a Consciencious Lawyer, to lay before Thee, the worst of thy Case; like an <hi>Honest Physitian,</hi> to shew the True state of thy Body; like a <hi>careful Chyrurgian,</hi> to search thy noysome and festred Ulcers</hi> to the quick; <hi>and with that charitable <hi>Samaritan,</hi> Luke</hi> 10. 34. <hi>pour in Wine and Oyl, that thy Wound may be both searched and supled, that so, if possible, thy Soul may be saved in the day of the Lord.</hi> And herein I shall follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Lord himself, <hi>Isa</hi> 1. who that he might the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <hi>Israel</hi> to a <hi>thorow Reformation,</hi> and a perfect Return to him, his God; he first layes before him, the evil of his wayes, telling him, as I by his assistance in his words shall tell Thee, <hi>That from the Crown of thy Head, to the Sole of thy Foot, there is no whole part in Thee;</hi> thy Head is Sick, and thy Heart is Faint, thy Hands are full of Blood;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53930:3"/>
Therefore <hi>Wash thee, make thee Clean, put away the evil of thy Doings, cease to do Evil, learn to do Well, seek Iudgement, relieve the Oppressed, Iudge the Fatherless, and plead for the Widdows;</hi> keep men no longer in thy cruel Custody, to make so many Fatherless and Widdows, as it is at this day, in keeping those many poor, Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t harmlesse <hi>Baptists,</hi> and others under restraint, in doing which, thy danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I shall lay down before Thee, by <hi>Thundring</hi> out the <hi>Iudgements of God, against such Violent and Oppressing Actors;</hi> that so, as in a Glass, thou mayest clearly read thy self, both what <hi>thou art,</hi> and what thou <hi>shalt be,</hi> or what will hecome of Thee.</p>
            <p>And then give thee in some Clear, Bright and Glorious Flashes, of Pure Gospel Lightning, to enlighten thy Inward Man, in order to thy Recovery out of this thy Miserable, Poor, Blind, Naked and Despicable Condition, even to the <hi>Translating thee out of the Kingdom of Darkness, into the Kingdom of Gods Dear Son; unless thou beest want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order whereunto, I shall once more cry out and say, O <hi>Earth, Earth, Earth, <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord; for thus saith the Lord by his Prophet,</hi>
               </hi> Isa. 33. 1. <hi>Wo <hi>unto</hi> Thee <hi>that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; that dealest Treacherously, and they dealt not Treacherously with Thee; when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled, and when thou shall make an end to deal Treacherously, they shall deal Treacherously with Thee:</hi>
               </hi> For God is a just God, and many times deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the Sons of men, by the Law of Retaliation; for <hi>Adoni-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek</hi> said, <hi>Threescore and ten Kings, having their Thumbs and their great Toes cut off, gathered their meat under my Table; as I have done, so God hath done to me,</hi> Judges 1. 7. And <hi>Nathan</hi> said unto <hi>Divid, Seeing thou hast killed</hi> Uriah <hi>the</hi> Hittite, <hi>with the Sword of the Children of</hi> Ammon; <hi>Therefore the Sword shall never depart from thy House,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 9.</p>
            <p>So also saith <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Agag,</hi> King of the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 33. <hi>As thy Sword hath made women Childless, so shall thy Mother be Childless among women;</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> liewed <hi>Agag</hi> in pieces before the Lord in <hi>Gilgal:</hi> Therefore <hi>Wo</hi> unto them that <hi>decree unrig hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Decrees,</hi> and that write <hi>grievousnesse,</hi> which they have <hi>prescribed,</hi> to turn away the <hi>Right</hi> from the poor of my people, that <hi>Widdows</hi> may be their <hi>Pray,</hi> and that they may <hi>Rob</hi> the Fatherlesse, <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 1, 2. Therefore hear what the Lord saith by his Prophets, to Thee and all Oppressors; <hi>What mean ye, that ye <hi>beat</hi> my people to <hi>pieces,</hi> and <hi>grind</hi> the face of the <hi>Poor,</hi>
               </hi> saith the Lord of Hosts? Isa. 3. 15. <hi>Hear ye this all ye that forget God: and the fool hath said in his Heart, There</hi>

               <hi>is no God.</hi> And what hast thou said, O <hi>Richard Brown?</hi> hast not thou said, as he hath said? And are not his Actings, as thine? <hi>For they are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doth good. The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the Children of Men, Ps.</hi> 14. 1, 2. <hi>to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God;</hi> but ver. 3. <hi>They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> Vers. 4. <hi>Have all the workers of iniquity, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? who eat up my People, as they eat Bread, and call not upon the Lord. For they have corrupted themselves, their <hi>Spot,</hi> is not the <hi>Spot</hi> of his <hi>Children,</hi> they are a <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>a crooked</hi> Generation,</hi> Deut. 32. 5. <hi>A <hi>sinful Nation,</hi> a People laden with Iniquities, a seed of <hi>Evil-doers,</hi> Children that are Corrupters; they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards,</hi> Isa. 14. <hi>Yea, <hi>they have deeply Corrupted themselves, as in the dayes of</hi>
               </hi> Giliah; <hi>Therefore he will remember their Iniquities, he will visit their Sins,</hi> Hos. 9. 9. For they have shamed the Counsel of the Poor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Lord is his Refuge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold thy self, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> see what thou art now doing; <hi>For the <hi>wicked</hi> watcheth the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and seeketh to Slay him,</hi> Psal. 37. 32. <hi>Yea, <hi>he Plotteth against the Iust, and Gnasheth upon him with his Teeth,</hi>
               </hi> Vers. 12. Yea, they have <hi>Drawn out their <hi>Sword,</hi> and bent their Bow, to cast down the Poor and Needy, and to slay such as are of an upright Conversation.</hi> But hear, O ye Seed of God, what the Spirit saith; And see, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> what thy Reward shall be; and so it shall be with all Persecutors and Persecuting Spirits; <hi>Their Sword <hi>shall</hi> enter into their own <hi>Heart,</hi> and their <hi>Bows</hi> shall be <hi>broken,</hi>
               </hi> Vers. 15. <hi>For the Armies of the Wicked shall be Broken; but the Lord shall <hi>uphold the Righteous,</hi>
               </hi> Vers. 17. Therefore <hi>depart from Evil, and do Good, and dwell for ever; for the Lord loveth Iudgement, and forsaketh not his Saints:</hi> But the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Wicked shall be cut off,</hi> Vers. 27, 28.</p>
            <p>Therefore, O <hi>Earth, Earth, Earth, <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord;</hi>
               </hi> For saith the Prophet, Vers. 35. <hi>I have seen the Wicked in great Power, and spreading himself like a Green Bay-Tree;</hi> Yet <hi>(notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> or for all that) <hi>he passed away;</hi> and <hi>lo,</hi> he <hi>was not:</hi> Yea, <hi>I sought him, but he could not be found;</hi> for the <hi>Wicked shall perish,</hi> and the <hi>Enemies of the Lord, shall be as the <hi>Fat of Lambs;</hi>
               </hi> they shall <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume (yea)</hi> into <hi>smoak</hi> shall <hi>they consume away,</hi> Vers. 20. For the <hi>Transgressors shall be destroyed together,</hi> and the <hi>Hand</hi> of the <hi>Wicked</hi> shall be <hi>cut off,</hi> Vers. 38.

            <p>But instead of shewing persons wherein their failing lies, thou hast violently haled poor Innocent Persons to Prison, who did not injure nor wrong Thee in the least; in which Actings of thine towards them, Thou hast used so much rigor, as that thou hast done it, even with much <hi>Indignation,</hi> even to the <hi>grinding of thy Teeth;</hi> So that thou hast <hi>done that</hi> which caused God once to <hi>complain against Israel of old,</hi> Amos 5. 7. <hi>who turned Iudgement into Wormwood,</hi> and caused Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse to cease in the Earth; Thou hast <hi>not at all</hi> shewn Mercy: Threfore, O <hi>R.

in this Nation, that can wash their hands of <hi>Roomes Traditions,</hi> to shew any such Warrant from Gods Word in the least; for, as I shewed to the King in my <hi>Fanaticks Mite cast into His Treasury</hi> (in the first <hi>Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> in Pages 12. and 13. and in the last, in Pag. 9. and 10.) that a <hi>Minister</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is not to be as a General in a <hi>Army,</hi> to <hi>Frighten, Beat,</hi> and <hi>Fight</hi> men into Faith; but as an Embassadour, to perswade, to Invite, gently to treat with, and to intreat into the way of God; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Evangelical,</hi> or Gospel, but the way of force being <hi>Diabolical</hi> and of the Devil; and whilst they are made believe they are doing Gods Work (for saith Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 2. <hi>the time will come that when they shall kill you they shall think they do God</hi> good <hi>service)</hi> They are then <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing</hi> themselves to be <hi>Drudges</hi> to that <hi>Evil One;</hi> for so saith the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 10.

            <p>But here some may object and say, That this is a Text out of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations</hi> is very <hi>Mysterious,</hi> and the Text may mean <hi>something else.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Answer, That I judge it is meant <hi>literally,</hi> and that it shall be <hi>Actually performed,</hi> as we see in a Measure it is at this day; the which is a great <hi>Confirmation</hi> of my <hi>Faith</hi> in the Truth of it; So that what I have seen, and felt, and heard, that Declare I, as in <hi>other,</hi> so in <hi>this case;</hi> and therefore I shall farther Answer, that though the <hi>Devil,</hi> hath not as I know off, nor ever had <hi>any Power, Actually</hi> as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>Officer,</hi> as a <hi>Mayor,</hi> or <hi>Iustice</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> so to do; yet <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally</hi> he may <hi>so do, in</hi> and <hi>by Men</hi> that are so <hi>Commissionated;</hi> and although I cannot <hi>truly say,</hi> that ever any <hi>Mayor,</hi> either of this or any other <hi>City,</hi> or any <hi>Iustice</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> of this, or any other <hi>City, Town,</hi> or <hi>Borrough,</hi> was <hi>ever</hi> a <hi>Devil simply so considered;</hi> yet I must take leave to <hi>think</hi> who is in Men, when they <hi>Act</hi> so <hi>contrary</hi> to the very <hi>Heathen,</hi> and have not learned, or rather by <hi>reason</hi> of much <hi>Blood-shed,</hi> are <hi>hardened</hi> and <hi>blinded,</hi> that they <hi>cannot see</hi> how to act as <hi>meer natural men</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> that <hi>walk onely by the Light of Nature;</hi> Even to <hi>do by another,</hi> as <hi>freely,</hi> as they would have <hi>another do by them:</hi> So that though I cannot say, that any <hi>Mayor,</hi> or <hi>Iustice,</hi> is a <hi>Devil;</hi> yet I can safely, and upon a good account, say with our Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 2. That there <hi>are some who walk according to the course <hi>of this World,</hi> according to the Prince of the Power of the Ayre, the spirit that now worketh</hi> (I pray mind it) the spirit that <hi>now Worketh in the hearts of the Children of Disobedience.</hi> And there are some <hi>that are led Captive by the <hi>Devil</hi> at his Will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26. And such shall fall upon the People of God when the <hi>Devil,</hi> their Master, hath a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53930:8"/>
Signed, and <hi>not before;</hi> for the <hi>Devil</hi> knew <hi>Iob</hi> long before he <hi>could</hi> do <hi>him any harm;</hi> for the Lord said unto Satan, <hi>Hast thou consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> my <hi>Servant Iob, that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect</hi> and an <hi>npright man, one that feareth God and Escheweth Evil,</hi> Job 1. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Then Satan answered the Lord and said, Doth Iob fear God for nought? hast thou not set an Hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side, thou hast blessed the Work of his hands? and his Substance is increased in the Land:</hi> therefore we find that the Devil said, <hi>Put forth thine hand now, and touch <hi>All</hi> that he hath and he will curse thee to thy Face: And the Lord said unto Satan,</hi> Behold, <hi>All that he hath is in thy Power, onely upon him put not forth thine hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, or when he had his Commission Signed Satan went out from the presence of the Lord, and the <hi>next</hi> news we hear of <hi>Iob,</hi> the <hi>Sabeans</hi> are <hi>Commissionated</hi> by this <hi>General, the Devil,</hi> to <hi>take away,</hi> to <hi>kill</hi> and to <hi>slay;</hi> for so saith the Text, vers. 14. <hi>And there came a Messenger to Iob and said, Thy Oxen were Plowing, and the Asses feeding beside them, and the <hi>Sabeans</hi> fell upon them, and took them away; yea they have slain the Servants with the Edge of the Sword, and I onely am escaped to tell thee:</hi> and the Devil being in a rage against this good man, vers. 16. <hi>The fire of <hi>God</hi>
               </hi> (saith the Servant) <hi>came down from Heaven, and hath burned up the Sheep, and the Servants;</hi> And in vers. 19. The <hi>Winds smote the four Corners of the house, wherein his Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were, and killed them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence I would note, That <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> though the <hi>Creatures of God,</hi> yet when the <hi>Devil</hi> hath a <hi>Commission,</hi> they are in his <hi>Power,</hi> and in his <hi>hands</hi> to <hi>bring his Design about;</hi> as that <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> his <hi>Instrument,</hi> shall <hi>be by him also Commissionated,</hi> Revel. 13. 13. <hi>to call for fire from Heaven, in the sight of Men.</hi> I hint this the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the time I judge is <hi>very neer,</hi> when that shall be <hi>Acted forth,</hi> that so those that see it may be <hi>confirmed</hi> and <hi>strengthened</hi> in the <hi>present Truth;</hi> for the <hi>Image</hi> shall be made of the <hi>Beast, that had his wound by a sword, and did live;</hi> and that when it doth come, yea may know it to be <hi>of the Devil</hi> that grand <hi>Impostor,</hi> and not of God; though that <hi>fire,</hi> as this in <hi>Iobs</hi> case, shall and did come down <hi>from Heaven.</hi> But to proceed;</p>
            <p>And the next newes also that <hi>Iob heareth, is,</hi> That the <hi>Devil Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers</hi> the <hi>Armies <hi>of the</hi> Caldeans, <hi>who come forth in three Bands, who also killes, slayes and takes away; And if the Devil will do any thing to the Person of Iob, he must</hi>
               </hi> Cogg for <hi>a new Commission,</hi> and when
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53930:9"/>
he hath it, <hi>he must not touch</hi> Jobs <hi>Life.</hi> Job 2. 4, 5, 6. By <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>which Commission,</hi> he presently brings him full of <hi>Boyles, <hi>from the Crown of the Head to the soal of the Feet;</hi>
               </hi> yea he brings him as low as possible he can, even to the very next door to death; he brings him as near to it, as we use to say, almost as four pence to a Groat even to the Dunghill, <hi>yet his Life he must not touch;</hi> And whilst <hi>Iob</hi> yet <hi>holdeth his integrity, the Devil comes into his Wife,</hi> to perswade him to <hi>Relinguish his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi> and to let go his <hi>Integrity,</hi> that so he might have his End; as I sear he hath in this time of tryal, into <hi>many a Proud, Covetous, Carnal, Faithless Woman,</hi> to <hi>perswade</hi> their <hi>Husbands</hi> to <hi>Swear</hi> or Ingage themselves out of Prison; contrary to the <hi>Requirement</hi> of the Lord Christ, Matth. 5. 34. <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> Rather then lose <hi>outward Pomp, Pleasure, Pride, Profit, Preferment,</hi> and what upon an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward account, is to preserve an outward being;</hi> little considering what will be the <hi>Bitterness</hi> of it hereafter.</p>
            <p>From which case of <hi>Iob,</hi> before I go farther, I would have all men in <hi>Christian Love to take notice;</hi> especially <hi>Londons Trades-men,</hi> that <hi>Buy</hi> and <hi>Sell,</hi> and <hi>get great Gain;</hi> I say, I would have them and all to take notice,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Devil knowes <hi>how</hi>
               </hi> Men have their <hi>Incommings, <hi>how</hi>
               </hi> they are <hi>preserved,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> they are <hi>blessed;</hi> who could give so Ready an account to God of what <hi>Iob</hi> had, both at <hi>home</hi> and <hi>abroad,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> all was <hi>preserved;</hi> and that they a voyd his Baits in their Traid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both in Buying and Selling.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Observe, That whilst Men <hi>act</hi> in the <hi>fear of God doing good, <hi>having</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>Eschewing Evil,</hi> that then God <hi>taketh special notice</hi> of them, and <hi>Hedgeth them about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Observe, That the <hi>Devil</hi> hath <hi>no Power</hi> on <hi>such Persons,</hi> neither <hi>He</hi> nor his <hi>Instruments, <hi>till God give them a Commission.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That if <hi>such Persons,</hi> keeping close to their <hi>God, by fearing him,</hi> and <hi>Eschewing evil,</hi> should be by the <hi>Commission of God under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> or <hi>his Instruments hands,</hi> that then they should <hi>not be cast down;</hi> but take notice, that it is but for the <hi>Tryal</hi> of <hi>their Faith, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of their Graces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore; first, I would beg all Gods People, in all cases <hi>to keep close to God, in his own way, fearing him, and avoiding all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil;</hi> that so God may <hi>keep close</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>blesse them</hi> with all <hi>Blessings, both Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> and might <hi>Hedge them about on every side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That if God should <hi>Suffer</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> or his <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53930:9"/>
to cast any of them into <hi>Prison,</hi> That then <hi>Iob</hi>-like they <hi>hold their Integrity,</hi> to the <hi>advancing</hi> of <hi>Gods Glory,</hi> and the <hi>Eternal Benefit</hi> of <hi>their own Souls; for Blessed is he that <hi>Indureth</hi> Temptation, for when he is tryed, he shall receive a Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promised to them that <hi>Love him,</hi>
               </hi> James 1. 12. <hi>For they that shall be with the Lamb, are <hi>Called,</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>Chosen</hi> and <hi>Faithful,</hi> Revel. 17. 14.</p>
            <p>Again, We see that King <hi>David</hi> himself, though a <hi>Man after Gods own heart,</hi> became an Instrument in the hand of the <hi>Devil, Satan,</hi> or that <hi>evil one,</hi> to bring <hi>down Gods wrath</hi> upon <hi>Israel,</hi> even to the Destruction of <hi>threescore and ten Thousand,</hi> in three dayes time; as I shewed fully in my <hi>Fannaticks Mite cast into the Kings Treasury,</hi> in Page 51, 52. of the the <hi>first Impression,</hi> and in the <hi>Last Edition,</hi> in Page 38, 39. from 2 Sam. 24. compared with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1. Yea, and also the Lord Christ saith to his People, <hi>that they shall be haled before Kings, Rulers and Magistrates, for his Name sake,</hi> Mark 13. 9.</p>
            <p>And as that <hi>Evil one</hi> makes use of <hi>Kings, Rulers, and Magistrates,</hi> good Men and wicked Men, some by one means, and some by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to punish Gods People: So, secondly, he maketh use of <hi>Learned Men, gifted Men,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> as his <hi>Instruments,</hi> to seduce and draw off, if possible, from the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and from the <hi>Truth</hi> as it is <hi>in Iesus;</hi> And such are called, <hi>Bewitchers, Seducers, Deceivers, False Teachers,</hi> and <hi>false Apostles:</hi> And all this he doth by these <hi>Instruments,</hi> that he may bring poor Souls to Himself; for saith that Servant of the Lord, <hi>such are false Apostles, Deceitful Workers, Transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ; and no marvel, for Satan himself is Transformed into an Angel <hi>of Light;</hi> therefore it is no great thing if his <hi>Ministers,</hi> be <hi>Transformed</hi> into the Ministers of <hi>Righteousness;</hi> Yea,</hi> such of which there are many, whom the Lord Christ telleth us off, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22. who in that day will say unto him, <hi>Lord, have we not <hi>prophesied</hi> in thy Name, and in thy Name cast out <hi>Devils,</hi> and in thy Name done many <hi>Wonderful Works?</hi>
               </hi> who shall say unto them, <hi>I Professe I never knew you, Depart from me you Workers of Iniquity;</hi> So also saith the Apostle, 2 Pet. 2. 1. <hi>But there were false Prophets among the People as also there shall be <hi>false Teachers</hi> among you, who shall privily bring in <hi>Damnable Heresies;</hi>
               </hi> yea, so saith our Apostle, Acts 20. 29. <hi>Know this also that after my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, shall <hi>greedy Wolves</hi> enter in, not sparing the Flock; also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away Disciples after them,</hi> &amp;c. Such whom he telleth us, do <hi>lie in wait to deceive,</hi> Ephes. 4. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53930:10"/>
And thus we evidently see, the <hi>Devil</hi> hath his <hi>Civil,</hi> and his <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Instruments;</hi> his <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and his <hi>Temporal Engines,</hi> that if he cannot get men to relinquish the Wayes of God, by a <hi>Persecuting Hand,</hi> then he striveth what he can to poyson them with <hi>False Doctrine, Errours</hi> and <hi>Heresies;</hi> and the one he endeavoureth to do generally at all times, the other, but when he hath a Commission: So that it may be said to <hi>Persecutors,</hi> yea, and to the <hi>Devil</hi> himself, as once the Lord Christ said, <hi>That he, nor they, can do nothing, except it be given them from above,</hi> John 19. 11. For as the Devil must have his <hi>Commission Signed,</hi> before he or his <hi>Instruments</hi> can Act any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods <hi>People;</hi> So,</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is <hi>Limited;</hi> for, ye <hi>shall have Tribulation ten Dayes,</hi> ten Dayes is his time <hi>Limited;</hi> And as I said before, I Judge, and that upon an Experimental Account, that this Text is meant Really and Actually, that it shall be performed; So I fear, that some that have Experienced it so to be, have and do own it strictly in the Sence of Ten Natural, or Artificial Dayes, following one successively after the other, consisting of twenty four hours a piece; or else they would not have made so much haste out of Prison as they did, some by <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and others by <hi>Engaging,</hi> to the <hi>Dishonour</hi> of that God they serve, the Blemishing of his <hi>Truth,</hi> and the Disencouraging and stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, of weak, single-hearted Souls, and the great burthen of their Brethren under the same Sufferings; For we are not to <hi>Limit the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One of Israel,</hi> how long his ten Dayes shall last, or in what Sence it is meant: Some through Mercy, lay above <hi>ten Weeks,</hi> and had <hi>ten Moneths</hi> been added to those <hi>ten Weeks,</hi> and <hi>ten Years</hi> to those <hi>ten Moneths;</hi> they durst not in the least have entertained a Thought, to have gained their Enlargement, to the Dishonour of their Master, by <hi>Swearing</hi> to <hi>King Charles,</hi> contrary to the Law of <hi>King Iesus,</hi> who saith <hi>(Mat.</hi> 5. 34.) <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> As to the <hi>ten Dayes</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, we know it possibly may be some Years, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was, who had worn out two Years at <hi>Rome,</hi> after he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to <hi>Cesar,</hi> where the story of the Scripture leaveth him under Bonds, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 30. But Gods time of Deliverance, is the best time for deliverance; through Mercy some have had it; and therefore I am Desirous that others should wait for it.</p>
            <p>But this was, and is the great <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> of some of <hi>Gods People,</hi> that the Devil is <hi>Limited,</hi> as to his <hi>Power,</hi> as well as to his <hi>Time;</hi> He can go no farther than his Bounds; <hi>For all that he hath, is in thy Hand,</hi> said God to the Devil; <hi>Onely upon himself put not forth thy Hand,</hi> Job 1. 12. And <hi>Satan</hi> appeared before the Lord <hi>a second</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:53930:10"/>
               <hi>Time,</hi> Job 2. 3. And the Lord said unto Satan, <hi>Hast thou considered my Servant Iob,—who still holdeth his integrity, although thou movedst me against him without a cause.</hi> From whence, I for my own part, have great cause to Rejoyce, yea and I do Rejoyce, in that Causelesly I and others of our Judgement were haled to Prison, and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Printed as <hi>Traytors,</hi> and that by the Good Hand of our God upon us, our Innocency is cleared, and we cleared without <hi>Fees;</hi> I say again, it was the Good Hand of our God upon us, and we must to his Praise, acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>But to our Matter: The <hi>Devil</hi> hath done what he can to <hi>Iob,</hi> and yet <hi>Iob</hi> holds <hi>his Integrity;</hi> But the Devil will not so leave him; for saith the Devil, <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his Life; put forth now thine hand, and touch his bones and his flesh, and he will Curse thee to thy Face.</hi> And the Lord said unto Satan, <hi>Behold he is in thy Hands, but save his Life.</hi> Here is a new <hi>Commission,</hi> and a new <hi>Limitation;</hi> whence we may still take notice of the Providential Care, that the Great God hath of his poor Faithful Ones; for saith our Saviour, <hi>Are not two Sparrows sould in the Market for one Farthing, and not one of them shall fall to the Ground, without your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? But the very Hairs of your Head are all numbred,</hi> (pray mind it) are all <hi>Numbred; <hi>Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more</hi> Ualue <hi>than many</hi> Sparrows;</hi> Doth God take care for Oxen? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9. Doth God take care for <hi>Sparrows?</hi> And will he not take care for you, if you in his strength, stand firm to his <hi>Requirements,</hi> O ye of <hi>Little Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God gives his Servants <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> and God requires an <hi>Improvement</hi> of those <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces,</hi> that so he may have the <hi>Glory</hi> of them: And therefore the next thing considerable in the Text is, <hi>That the Devil shall cast some of you into Prison <hi>ten Dayes,</hi>
               </hi> that you <hi>may be <hi>Tried;</hi>
               </hi> mind it Souls, it is that you may be <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And now Friends, look to your selves, you that were not willing in times of <hi>Prosperity</hi> to keep close to the Words of Christs <hi>Patience,</hi> will hardly with <hi>Patience</hi> lie in a Prison, or a dark Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in this hour of <hi>Temptation,</hi> that shall come upon all the World, <hi>to try them that dwell upon Earth,</hi> to try those that live upon the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Vanities of the Earth, upon Creatures, and Creature Comforts; I say look to it, for I am verily perswaded, and that by the Word of the Lord, that God hath yet a finer seive to bring his people thorow; And as I said in my <hi>Fannaticks Letter,</hi> in page 19. <hi>God is now going to gather Congregations out of Congregations, and Churches out of Churches.</hi> Oh! how many are there that have already <hi>fallen</hi> through this <hi>Course Seive,</hi> and these no mean Ones neither! This little Ridling time, me-thinks it seems to me like the Dragons Tail, spoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 4. That

            <p>O Friends Consider, whether the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>King Iesus,</hi> who laid down his <hi>Life</hi> for you, that you might <hi>Live to Eternity,</hi> or the <hi>Wrath</hi> of <hi>King Charles,</hi> hath been most taking upon your Affections?

               </hi> Deut. 32. 29.</p>
            <p>O Consider what your Actings have been! may not the Lord Christ say to you, as once he said to his Disciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 40. <hi>What, could you not watch with me one hour?</hi> What, could ye not hold it out with the <hi>Foot men?</hi> how think ye you will be able to run with the <hi>Horse men?</hi> And may not I say to you, in the words of our Apostle, Gal. 5. 7, 8. <hi>You did Run well, who did hinder you, that ye should not obey the Truth?</hi> This perswasion cometh not of him that called you, who said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> Oh Consider, Friends, the saying of our Apostle, in <hi>vers.</hi> 9.

            <p>Yet herein I would not be mistaken; yea I say again, I would not herein be mistaken; for I do not in the least perswade to <hi>Rebellion</hi> against <hi>King Charles,</hi> to Gratifie <hi>King Iesus,</hi> for that is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Law; But I would have them, in obeying <hi>King Iesus,</hi> to obey <hi>King Charles;</hi> and in obeying <hi>King Charles,</hi> to obey <hi>King Iesus:</hi> As thus, I would have them obey <hi>King Iesus,</hi> in all his <hi>Laws, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, Ordinances and Appointments;</hi> not Fearing <hi>King Charles,</hi> nor his <hi>Proclamations;</hi> And yet I would have them, according to the <hi>Requirement</hi> of that Servant of <hi>King Iesus, <hi>Rom.</hi>
               </hi> 13. 7. <hi>To Render to King Charles, <hi>Custom, Tribute, Fear,</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi> I would have them Obey <hi>King Iesus,</hi> and to be so careful to avoid <hi>Forswear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as not to <hi>Swear</hi> for <hi>that Yesterday,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> to <hi>Day,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> to <hi>Morrow; for</hi> to <hi>Day,</hi> and <hi>against</hi> to <hi>Morrow,</hi> as it is at this day with Thousands; But I would have them so to avoid the danger of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing</hi> in every Case, as that I would have them in no Case to <hi>Swear at all;</hi> according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Iams</hi> 5. 12. The which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53930:12"/>
in my <hi>Fannaticks Testimony</hi> against <hi>Swearing, is cleared;</hi> And yet I would have them, according to the <hi>Requirement</hi> of <hi>King Iesus</hi> to be as faithfull in their <hi>Yeas</hi> and <hi>Nays,</hi> to <hi>King Charles,</hi> yea and Faithfuller too, than those his Subjects, that <hi>Ram, Dam, Rend, Tear, Swear</hi> and <hi>Forswear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would also have them so fear <hi>King Iesus,</hi> as that I would not have them fear <hi>King Charles;</hi> for Rulers are not set up for a <hi>Terrour</hi> to <hi>good Works,</hi> but <hi>to the Evil,</hi> Rom. 13. 3. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: for he is a Minister of God to thee for good; but if thou do that which is Evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the Sword in vain; for he is the Minister of God, a Revenger to <hi>execute wrath upon them that do <hi>Evil,</hi>
               </hi> Rom. 13. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>But here me-thinks, I hear multitudes will be ready to object and say; <hi>If King Charles was set up for this end, and had the Sword of Iustice for this Cause put into his hands, why is it as it is with us at this day? Why are we in several Goales, and Dungeons in most Counties in</hi> England, <hi>when we are found no evil Doers? when they have nothing against us in any thing save in the matters of our God; who saith by his Son, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> Nay, why are, and have been several Imprisoned that have sworn? And why have some Persons been forced to pay Fees as Traytors, though they have Sworn before they were put into Prison, and not taken from Meetings neither, but from their own habitations, if the Magistrate, as the Scripture saith, be set up to be</hi> a praise to them that do well? <hi>why were we thus rudely Hurryed? Why, cryes out several in</hi> Newgate, <hi>are we thus cruelly Imprisoned by <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> and kept in without Tryal? Why were we, cry out some thirty of them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to</hi> Newgate <hi>the</hi> 10th. <hi>Day of Abib</hi> Exod. 13. 4. <hi>or the first Month, from our peaceable Meeting out of</hi> Beech-Lane, <hi>by the</hi> City Marshal <hi>and the</hi> rude Rabble, and <hi>saw not the face if a Magistrate till the Eighteenth day after, that we were carryed before him; the tenderest of whose Mercies are</hi> meer Cruelty: <hi>I say, if serving of God peaceably and quietly, with</hi> Reverence and Godly Fear, <hi>be</hi> good <hi>in the</hi> Sight of God: <hi>How can those answer the turning the Edge of the Sword of Iustice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, before the great</hi> Jehovah, <hi>who put that Sword into their hands?</hi> and if so, <hi>Why are the poor peaceable People of God, that are no</hi> Turkish slaves, <hi>but the</hi> free born Commoners <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>thus enslaved? Why must the</hi> Sword <hi>of</hi> Oppression <hi>thus be suffered in the hands of <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> instead of the sword of Iustice? Why are the several</hi> Justices of Peace, <hi>in the several</hi> Counties <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>thus suffered to disturb</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53930:13"/>
they may have the <hi>Word of God</hi> for their <hi>Warrant,</hi> as a Foundation of their Faith herein; for saith the Apostle, Rom. 14. 23. <hi>Whatsoever is not of Faith, is Sin. <hi>For Faith is the full perswasion of the heart of Man, grounded upon the Promises of God, and wrought in us by the Spirit of God.</hi>

            <p>So that if thou hast not a <hi>Word of God</hi> for thy <hi>Warrant,</hi> as a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Faith herein, thy <hi>Faith</hi> is no more Faith but Fancy; and therefore have a care Soul, who ever thou art, though never so great; I say again in the fear of the Lord, have a care, that the Lord say not one day to you, that are thus found persecuting his People for worshipping him (not at all harming you) as once he said by his Prophet to <hi>Israel</hi> of old, Isai. 1. 12. <hi>Who hath required this at your hands;</hi> Why have you En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared, Inslaved, Imprisoned, and evilly Intreated my People; when I have done so much for you, when I have given you so much <hi>Liberty,</hi> so much <hi>Freedom,</hi> so many <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Injoyments?</hi> and can ye not suffer the <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Body,</hi> of which my Son <hi>Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Head,</hi> no <hi>Liberty</hi> at all? When <hi>King Charles</hi> wanted his <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> Wealth, Liberty, Subjects, Armies, Arms, Ammunition, Magazines, and Store-houses, Sumptuous and Fair Buildings, Parkes and Chases, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, Fields and Pastures, Ships and Shipping, with all that He hath, and all that He doth enjoy; and all this He hath by His own shewing, again and again, from the hands of our Father, that <hi>Loved us and gave his Son to Die for us;</hi> yea, He hath what He hath from the hands of our Father, who is so to us by Promise; not onely by <hi>Creation,</hi> but also by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi> and <hi>Adoption;</hi> yea, we have his Word for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18.

we (were it our Principle) be but half so Tumultuous as these are, that at every turn have to do with us, we should then be looked upon as very dangerous Persons &amp; such as there might be some colour of Imprisoning; but, blessed be the Lord, we are not such, and yet are and have been Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned: and in <hi>Kent</hi> several have been Haled away to <hi>Maidestone,</hi> who now lie there; and our Brother <hi>Crosse,</hi> who a short time before with his own hands, presented a moderate and an honest <hi>Petition</hi> into the <hi>Kings</hi> Hand, in order to the procuring a <hi>Liberty</hi> according to the <hi>Kings Promise</hi> again, again, and again; but we see the Conclusion is a <hi>Prison,</hi> a <hi>Dungeon;</hi> but this I am confident of, that he that fitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens doth <hi>laugh</hi> such <hi>violent Actions</hi> to <hi>scorn,</hi> and the <hi>Actors</hi> of such <hi>Oppressions,</hi> he will have them in <hi>Derision;</hi> yea I say again, the Lord will have them in <hi>Derision,</hi> for so saith the Lord by the Mouth of a <hi>King,</hi> Psal. 2. 1. &amp;c. <hi>Why do the Heathen rage, and the People Imagine a vain thing? the Kings of the Earth set themselves, and the Rulers take Counsel together against the Lord, and against his Anointed; saying, Let us break their Bonds asunder, and cast away their Cords from us.</hi> But in the midst of all these Contrivances, as in <hi>Belshazzars</hi> case, <hi>Dan,</hi> 5. 5. there is a <hi>Hand-writing</hi> in the way, that will cause some <hi>Trouble,</hi> the which I cannot but declare, and it is no more but the words of the Text; for saith the Spirit of the Lord in <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>He that sitteth in the Heavens shall <hi>Laugh</hi>

            <p>But give me leave in Christian Love to go on to give this <hi>Caution,</hi> in the words of the same Man of God, in <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Be wise therefore, O ye <hi>Kings,</hi> be Instructed yea <hi>Iudges</hi> of the Earth;</hi> ye <hi>Iudges</hi> before whom the peaceable People of God often in your Circuits are Haled; And you <hi>Iudges</hi> of the Earth that are to Seal Decrees against them; I say again, take good heed in Gods fear, what ye do to them; for saith the Prophet to the People of God, and that to their great comfort, Zach. 2 8. <hi>He that toucheth <hi>you,</hi> toucheth the <hi>Apple of his Eye;</hi>
               </hi> a tender place, a choice thing, yea, they are his <hi>Sons and Daughters,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18. His <hi>Iewels,</hi> Mal. 2. 17. His <hi>choice ones,</hi> that shall be <hi>his; such as he himself will spare, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you will not spare them, look to it, the Lord will have you in <hi>Derision,</hi> the Lord will <hi>Laugh</hi> you to <hi>scorn;</hi> O then be instructed ye Judges of the Earth, for ye <hi>judge not for man, but for the Lord;</hi> And will you not spare the peaceable Sons and Daughters of God, that he would have spared? If <hi>King <hi>Charles</hi>

            <p>O Friends, Consider, what are your Fears? what are your Doubts? Did ye <hi>not run well</hi> in a Sun-shiny day, <hi>who did binder you?</hi> you lay all your Confidence in an Arm of Flesh, and is it vanished with it? Shall so many of us come out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> with <hi>Israel</hi> of old? And shall our Carkastes fall thus as did theirs in the Way? Shall but some few <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebs</hi> and <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> enter into <hi>Canaans Glory</hi> of the old Stock? <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 22, 23, 24. What need we Fear, are not all our Hairs numbred? Can the <hi>Two Witnesses</hi> be <hi>Slain,</hi> till the <hi>Forty and Two Moneths be expired,</hi> and their <hi>Prophesies fulfilled?</hi> Doth not the Nation ring of your <hi>Apostacy</hi> in this Cloudy Day? Do not that People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> upbraid us with your backslidings in one County, and another, a third, and more?</p>
            <p>O <hi>Friends,</hi> It is the burthen of my Soul, to hear such Actings as I hear; and that my rejoycing towards you, and on your behalfs, in my <hi>Fannaticks Letter,</hi> in page 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is to so little purpose; I well ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it might have proved an Instrument in Gods Hand of much good unto you; but I fear it was much slighted and undervalued, because it <hi>dropped not</hi> from a <hi>tall Cedar,</hi> but <hi>sprung</hi> up from so <hi>mean and low a shrub:</hi> But to such Souls, I must say in the Words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 28, &amp;c. <hi>Hast thou not known? Hast thou not considered? Hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creatour of the ends of the Earth fainteth not, neither is weary? There is no search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Understanding; He giveth power to the faint, and to him that hath no might, he encreaseth strength: Even the Youths shall faint, and the Young men shall utterly fail; But they that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with Wings of Eagles, they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk, and not be faint, for of a Truth, God is no respecter of Persons, but in every Nation, he that feareth Him, and worketh Righteousnesse, is accepted of him,</hi> Acts 10. 35.</p>
            <p>And now, why should I much wonder to see such Apostatizing times, when the Lord by his Servant telleth us, <hi>That day shall not come, except there come a falling away first;</hi> at whose coming he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self putteth it to the Question, <hi>Whether he shall find Faith on the Earth?</hi> Luke 18. 8. And this is the use, that through mercy, I make of these times; I see hereby, my Saviour was a <hi>True Prophet;</hi> And this is a Confirmation to me, that I am in the Truth, in which time I also see and feel such <hi>Halings</hi> before <hi>Magistrates</hi> to <hi>Prison,</hi> in this time when <hi>Iniquity doth so much abound.</hi> And</p>

Secondly, This leads me out of my self, to stand by the strength of Him that is Mighty, by whose strength onely I have yet stood, and still hope to stand; It was by his strength, that I lived and survived the dampnesse of the Dungeon, void of Light or Air, those ten Weeks together; It was by his help, that our Consciences were kept unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed; and by his help it was, that way was made for us, in the Hearts of the greatest of the Nation, to Release us without <hi>Fees;</hi> It is by the help of <hi>Iosephs</hi> God, that was with him in the Prison, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. that it was so well with us as it was; It was by the help of <hi>Daniels</hi> God, that sent his <hi>Angel</hi> to shut the <hi>Mouths</hi> of the <hi>Lions,</hi> that we were preserved from harm, amongst a company of rude people, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> and others; it was by the help of the God of <hi>Shadrach, Meshach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> that we came out of our <hi>Dungeon</hi> without harm; And by the help of him that walked with them in the <hi>fiery Furnace,</hi> it was, that we were constantly refreshed, comforted and supported; it was by the help of him that <hi>turned again</hi> the <hi>Captivity</hi> of <hi>Iob,</hi> that we were brought again from our Captivity; it was by the help of him, who inabled <hi>David</hi> to break through a <hi>Troop,</hi> and to leap over a <hi>Wall,</hi> that we are at present Escaped from the Guards of <hi>Souldiers,</hi> that watched our Gates night and day; it was by the help of him who sent his <hi>Angel</hi> to strike off <hi>Peters</hi> Chains, and to open the <hi>Prison-doors,</hi> that we were inlarged; it was by help of him whose grace is sufficient for poor Souls, that we were supported in our Spirits; Yea, it was by the good will of him that <hi>burned</hi> in the <hi>Bush,</hi> that our Zeal for the <hi>Cause</hi> of Christ, was and still is continued. Oh then, let me beg you in Gods Fear, not to droop in this Cloudy day, for there is no <hi>Crown</hi> but for the <hi>over-commer,</hi> no <hi>Reaping</hi> but for him that doth not <hi>faint;</hi> Oh then let the hands hanging down, and the feeble knees be strengthened, and held up, and look up and lift your heads, <hi>for your Redemption draweth nigh,</hi> the day of Jesus is at hand, the Kingdom of God is even at the door; for <hi>yet a little while and he that shall come, will come and will not tarry, and the Iust must live by Faith.</hi>

            <p>And now <hi>Rich. Brown,</hi> I would have thee know, that though I speak to my <hi>Brethren</hi> in this <hi>City</hi> &amp; <hi>Nation,</hi> in some part of my Discourse, yet it is not besides my business; for thou well knowest, that it is the nature of an <hi>Alarm</hi> so to do, to Rouse <hi>Friends</hi> as well as <hi>Enemies;</hi> I shall Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to thine own Practice herein, that when thou gavest an <hi>Alarm,</hi> to <hi>Oxford, Wallingford, Banbury,</hi> or any other of the <hi>Kings Quarters;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou didst not as well therein mind thy Friends of their <hi>Duties,</hi> as well as thou didst desire to put the <hi>Kings Friends</hi> to hardship, and

            <p>And if thou seem to take Exceptions at my saying, we are as <hi>good Friends</hi> to <hi>King Charles,</hi> as those thou so dealt withall.</p>

            <p>And now, O <hi>Mayor,</hi> I would have thee seriously to consider, what,

my End intended in this my Giving thee this <hi>Alarm,</hi> is; and if thou doest not know, as I fear thou doest not, in the singleness of my soul, I shall let thee know, it is not for any <hi>Revenge</hi> I bear thee, for God is my <hi>witness <hi>I lie not,</hi>
               </hi> I do it not for any such End, but that if possible, thou mightst, make <hi>a right Improvement</hi> of it; and that thou mightst for the time to come, even <hi>quit thy Self like a Man;</hi> yea, that thou quit thy Self as thou pretendest thy Self, as a <hi>Christian;</hi> that so thou wouldst in the Spirit of Love, Meekness, and Moderation, if thou hast it, instruct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are out of the way; and not to cause them to say of thee, as the <hi>Indians</hi> said of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that were once so cruel to them, That if a <hi>Spaniard</hi> went to Heaven, they did not desire to come there; Yea, I say, I shall let thee know, that as the Lord Christ, intendeth not a destruction to that Soul, that he requireth his Church, should be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up unto Satan; but that it should be for the destruction of the flesh, or of that fleshly part, that caused him so to offend; that so the Spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. Even so it is with me, it is in Love I bear to thy soul that I do it, and for the ease of Gods People; and therefore I shall let thee know, that a <hi>desperate Wound</hi> must have a <hi>desperate Cure;</hi> for Extreams must have Extreams to Cope withall, and Ulsers must have flesh to feed upon, not skin: It is neither <hi>Smoothing</hi> nor <hi>Soothing</hi> thee up in thy condition, that will do thee any good, but harm; therefore in the faithfulness of my Soul, I must tell thee, that thy condition is not to be dallyed withall; And as the <hi>honest <hi>Lawyer,</hi>

And take that advice of the Prophet, Isai. 55. 6. <hi>Seek the Lord whilst he may be found, and call upon him whilst he is near.

made use of that against <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Debauched persons,</hi> who imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iohn Watts</hi> and others in that County, and <hi>William Iefferyes, Matthew Caffin,</hi> and our <hi>Brother Millar,</hi> with others, were questioned upon that <hi>Proclamation</hi> also, as <hi>evil doers,</hi> in the West Countrey, near <hi>Dorchester:</hi> So that common Proverb in them is fitly to be applied, which saith, <hi>It is an easie matter to find a stick to beat a Dog withal;</hi> yet if <hi>King Charles</hi> had not made <hi>that Proclamation</hi> against our <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>harmless Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> ye had missed of your cruel and malicious Ends: And I must plainly say, that if he had not made it, he had shewed some respect to us, for then he had continued us as he found us, till a <hi>Parliament</hi> had restrained us; but the making of this, and refusing to take it off, till a <hi>Parliament,</hi> looks with such a dreadful face, as that it hath frightned many a poor weak soul into a perswasion to <hi>Swear,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement</hi> of Christ, who saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Swear not at all, but let your <hi>Yea</hi> be <hi>Yea,</hi> and your <hi>Nay Nay,</hi> for what is more than this cometh of evil,</hi> or of that evil One; For saith he, <hi>Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> So that our <hi>Yeaes,</hi> and <hi>Nayes,</hi> should. be more than other mens <hi>Swearings;</hi> and therein we should be as faithful to <hi>King Charles</hi> in what we undertake, as our Brethren of <hi>Holland</hi> are to their States.</p>
            <p>But see, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> whether thy violence herein, doth not evidence thee to be one that is acting in the fruits of the flesh, the consequences whereof are very dangerous; for saith our Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>The works of the flesh are manifest,</hi> some of which are these, which are so predominant in thee, even <hi>hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife,</hi> and <hi>envyings, of which I have tould you in times past, that <hi>they that do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </hi> Thou that art so eager to force persons to <hi>Swear</hi> against the <hi>Pope,</hi> dost thou fight with <hi>Roms</hi> Engines, <hi>Imprisonment, Banishment,</hi> the <hi>Gallows, Fire</hi> and <hi>Faggot?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let me ask thee, O <hi>R. Brown,</hi> Where are thy sences? Dost thou pretend to own the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> Eph. 6. 15. the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and yet actest so contrary to them all? Dost thou think rational men have not their eyes in their heads, because thou art blind? Wilt thou with the <hi>Ideot,</hi> think every one a <hi>Fool,</hi> when he is the greatest or most apparent one himself? Wilt thou with the <hi>Drunkard,</hi> think that every man else is Drunk, when drink hath jostled out his <hi>Reason?</hi> Dost thou well know thine own Opinion, as to God &amp; his Truth, so as that thou canst say, this or that is <hi>Error?</hi> or rather doth not thy actings discover, that thy Religion is as those <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was in <hi>K.

times? now for this, and then for that, and then again for the other.</p>
            <p>Again, Consider I beseech thee, whereabout thou art; as for thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I query whether thou art not yet to choose it? I fear thou art as uncertain to that, as thou art in thy acts of <hi>Violence,</hi> and <hi>War:</hi> Once for the late <hi>King,</hi> when upon his Birth-days, and other such Festivals, thou hadst thy vain-glorious Bonfires in Loyters, that must Sail up to <hi>White-hall</hi> with Wind and Tyde currently, to let <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi> and his Courtiers know, that there was one <hi>Richard Brown</hi> of <hi>White Friars,</hi> a <hi>Woodmonger,</hi> that did Honour him, his Birth, Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Progeny: But so soon as the Tyde is Turned, and when both Wind and Tyde is against <hi>King Charles,</hi> his Heirs and Successors, House of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Bishops;</hi> then, Who but <hi>Major General R. Brown</hi> engaging eagerly against the House of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> House of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Bishops?</hi> And now that the Wind and Tyde are come about again, who but <hi>R. Brown?</hi> who more busie than he? who more double diligent? who more officious to frighten great eminent men of parts and abilities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perswasion (as he did <hi>Ieremieh Ives)</hi> to <hi>Swear,</hi> if not to <hi>Forswear?</hi> as in my <hi>Fanaticks Testimony</hi> against <hi>Swearing</hi> is evident; with what is also judged a Reason of it in thee, as in <hi>Page,</hi> 45. So that here is <hi>up</hi> and <hi>down,</hi> and <hi>down</hi> and <hi>up</hi> again; One time for a <hi>King, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> then against them, and now for them again; and none of all this without <hi>Swearing:</hi> So that here is <hi>Swearing for,</hi> and <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against,</hi> and <hi>Swearing for</hi> again; And because thy Throat is so open a Sepulchre, thou art mad, and wilt Imprison all, both young and old, rich and poor, that cannot <hi>swallow <hi>Oathes</hi>
               </hi> as greedily as thy Self; So that here is one thing and another, and what you will, and for what you please, if you please but to conferre <hi>Honours, Profits,</hi> and <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> upon him, provided you be but of the strongest side, for that hath been the course all along: So that generally men, to save their own stake (as we use to say) will <hi>Swear</hi> for that <hi>Power</hi> one Week, Moneth or Year, which the next, or so soon as it stands with their own Interest, they will be ready both to <hi>Pull down,</hi> and <hi>Swear against:</hi> So that who but <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> when <hi>King Charles</hi> the First was in Power at <hi>White-Hall?</hi> but when the same <hi>King Charles,</hi> was at <hi>Holmby House</hi> a Prisoner, who but <hi>Major General <hi>Richard Brown,</hi>
               </hi> in full Commission against him? and who else must be sent as one of the Commissioners to treat with him?</p>
            <p>But, Consider of thy cruelty, in all thy undertakings, Dost thou not think O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> that men have their eyes in their heads? do not all men generally know, that <hi>Persecution</hi> is one of <hi>Romes <hi>horrid, impious,</hi>
               </hi> and most <hi>abominable <hi>Bratts?</hi>
               </hi> For in her shall be <hi>found the</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53930:19"/>
               <hi>Blood of the Prophets and of Saints, and all that were slain upon the earth,</hi> Revel. 18. 24. For <hi>I saw the Woman drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Iesus</hi>—Revel. 17. 6. And therefore, may I not say to thee, as once the Lord Christ said to <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn, Luk.</hi> 9. 55. who when the <hi>Samaritans</hi> would not receive them, they <hi>queried</hi> with him, whether they should not call for fire from Heaven, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, and consume them? To whom the Lord Christ made this reply, saying, <hi>Ye know not what spirit ye are of; for the Son of Man came not to destroy mens lives but to save them.</hi> Therefore, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> examine thy spirit, and see whether it be from Christ or not; <hi>For a Kingdom divided against it self cannot stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how can men profess themselves to be Christs Disciples, and yet when they <hi>kill, banish,</hi> or <hi>hale to prison</hi> for the name of Christ, they think they do God good service? Can these things stand together? are these things agreeable to the mind of God upon a Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? Examine thine own heart, and try thine own wayes, and as thou professest thy self to be a Christian, lay thy Actings to the Rule of Gods Word, try and examine them according to that saying of our Apostle, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1.—<hi>Try the spirits whether they be of God?</hi> But if, upon a Scripture account, thou art not willing to enter into judgement with thy self, then be perswaded to try thy self by that Light within, as that People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> require their Hearers; Even by the Light of Nature, that which men have given them to witness for or against them, that which will either <hi>accuse</hi> or <hi>excuse,</hi> even that Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness-bearer, spoken of by our Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. which Light is to be followed by those that have not the written Law of God to Regulate them; and therefore we shall read the Text thus, <hi>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law</hi> (written) <hi>do by <hi>Nature</hi> the things contained in the Law</hi> (written) <hi>these having not the Law</hi> (written) <hi>are a Law unto themselves, which shews the work of the Law</hi> (written) <hi>to be written in their hearts, their Conscience also bearing them witness, and their thoughts in the mean while accusing or excusing one another:</hi> So that that which doth <hi>accuse</hi> or <hi>excuse,</hi> is <hi>Conscience,</hi> or <hi>that Light within;</hi> so that by their rule, <hi>Conscience,</hi> or <hi>the Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> is Christ; because it doth make manifest, and so they run it up; That which doth make <hi>manifest</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Light,</hi> and this <hi>Light</hi> is <hi>Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ; Christ</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> is one, and cannot be divided; and so that <hi>Christ,</hi> or their <hi>Light within them,</hi> is in them their <hi>hope of glory.</hi> I say again to thee, <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> Didst thou but act and walk as the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> didst thou but walk just according to the <hi>Light</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:53930:19"/>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> thou wouldst not dare to act as thou hast and dost.</p>
            <p>And seeing <hi>Conscience</hi> is that which doth either <hi>accuse</hi> or <hi>excuse,</hi> and that thou hast and dost that which in <hi>Conscience</hi> ought not to be done; let me in plainness tell thee, I fear thy <hi>Conscience</hi> is <hi>asleep;</hi> I say, it is to be feared <hi>Conscience</hi> is and hath been a long time in a deep <hi>Lethargy;</hi> therefore jogg it, rouse it, awake it, tell it, it hath slept long enough, and that thou hast need of it, for thou hast an <hi>Alarm</hi> from one of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Zion,</hi> that telleth thee thy Condition is sad, and that he is such an one unto thee, as once the Lord Christ was to the Woman at the <hi>Well</hi> of <hi>Samaria, Iohn</hi> 4. 17, 29. that he is down-right with thee, and telleth thee in plainness of speech what thou hast done, and what is thy danger, and what thy <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>violence</hi> will bring thee to.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Conscience</hi> is throughly awaked, ask it seriously, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it to satisfie thee plainly, whether it doth judge, that thou thy self couldest be willing to be served, as thou hast served many a poor man, yea many a miserable poor man, that thou hast cast into Prison? And were thy Children tender and young, as possible some of theirs are, at thy poor, empty, and naked house, crying out for bread; and thou kept in Prison not in a capacity to gain thine own nor theirs, even to the wounding of thy Soul, and to the great burthen of thy Spirit; Ask thy <hi>Conscience</hi> also, whether it ought not to make scruple of an <hi>Oath,</hi> especially in <hi>Swearing</hi> for and against? and whether thou could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est be willing to be forced to <hi>Swear</hi> one day for this thing, and another day against that same thing? Ask it also, whether it could be willing to be forced to go to such a Worship as is meerly <hi>Formal, Carnal,</hi> and in a great measure <hi>Papal,</hi> when it is really convinced of the contrary? and whether it could be willing to be forced to maintain an <hi>Antichristian Ministery,</hi> in opposition to the true Ministers of Jesus?</p>
            <p>I say again, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> if thou art not willing to act as a Christian upon a Scripture account, then rouse up, and awaken thy <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> and act but like a meer Heathen; and confident I am, thou wilt find more comfort in it in the conclusion, than thou wilt in thy present actings by many degrees.</p>
            <p>For now thou art <hi>Persecuting</hi> the <hi>People of God,</hi> not knowing in what Relation they stand to the great God, and his Son Jesus Christ; for as the whole bulk of mankind was in a lost condition, and as our first Parents sold us all, by reason of their first transgression; so God found a way out of his meer Love, to buy us again to himself; for so saith our Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. <hi>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God both in your bodies and in your spirits, which are Gods.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. <hi>Ye are bought with a <hi>price,</hi>
               </hi> be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53930:20"/>
not the <hi>servants</hi> of <hi>men;</hi> And he that bought us, saith by his Son, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and yet thou dost imprison men and women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will not serve men in <hi>Swearing</hi> for them, and when they would have them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We <hi>cost God dear,</hi> even his <hi>own Son, Tit.</hi> 2. 14. yea, the <hi>precious blood of that Son;</hi> For so saith the Text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>For ye are not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation, received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious Blood of the Son of God, as of a Lamb without blemish, and without spot:</hi> Yea, by the <hi>Blood of him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own Blood,</hi> Rev. 1. 5. and Rev. 5. 9. and Heb. 9. 12, 13, 26.</p>
            <p>And so, First, We are his <hi>Portion;</hi> for the <hi>Lords People</hi> are his <hi>Portion, Deut.</hi> 32. 9. <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 12. And now <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> consider what thou art doing, thou art squandring away the <hi>Lords Portion;</hi> thou wert bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by many degrees be doing something else, for the very <hi>hairs</hi> of their heads are all <hi>numbred,</hi> Matt. 10. 30. and he that <hi>toucheth them, toucheth the apple of Gods eye,</hi> Zech. 2. 8. Yea, so saith the Prophet <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Deut.</hi> 32. 10. speaking of Gods People; he found them in a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart Land, in a waste howling Wilderness,</hi> he <hi>led them about and instructed them,</hi> he <hi>kept them as the <hi>apple of his eye.</hi>
               </hi> And this was the Prayer of <hi>David</hi> when he was in distress, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 8. <hi>Keep me, (O Lord) as the <hi>apple of thine eye,</hi> hide me under the shadow of thy wings.</hi> Mens Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we know, are to be employed for the benefit of the Owners, and the People and Portion that cost God so dear, should be improved for God, by setting forth his glory in their several and respective <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and increasing their number; But thou hast shut up their <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and shut them up into <hi>Prison-holes,</hi> and <hi>Dungeons:</hi> O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> how wilt thou answer the <hi>Lord Iehovah,</hi> for these thy cruel dealings? O in the fear of the Lord, consider thy ways, and the Lords Patience yet towards thee! should the Lord be but as cruel to thee as thou art to his <hi>Portion,</hi> his poor, peaceable, innocent, harmless People; What dost thou think would become of thee to Eternity? Turn back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the <hi>Law-case</hi> in <hi>Page</hi> 32. and read thy doom, what it will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou agree with him, whom thou hast thus made thine Adversary, even <hi>quickly whilst thou art in the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As they are his dear <hi>Portion</hi> by Purchase, so they are his <hi>Heritage, Ioel</hi> 2. 17. and God by his Spirit in his servant, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. requires those that are the <hi>Elders</hi> over his People, that they <hi>Lord it not overGods Heritage,</hi> as the <hi>Parish-Priests</hi> use to <hi>Lord</hi> it over their <hi>Flocks,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> were wont to <hi>Lord</hi> it in their <hi>Dioces:</hi> But consider O <hi>R. Brown,</hi> since thou wert <hi>L. Mayor,</hi> how thou hast <hi>lorded,</hi> nay <hi>tyrannized</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53930:20"/>
over Gods <hi>Heritage,</hi> whom thou by the Lord never hadst an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to overlook, nor watch over; therefore see the danger thou art in for thy so doing, as well as others in all other <hi>Heathenish</hi> Nations; for saith the Lord, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 2. <hi>I will gather all nations, and bring them down into the Valley of Iehoshaphat, and will plead with them there; for my People and for mine Heritage, whom they have scattered among the Nations.</hi> Yea I say, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> that God will reckon with thee for those that thou hast Imprisoned, by which meanes thou hast scattered the Flock, and dispersed, derided, and despised Gods <hi>Heritage;</hi> For thus saith the Lord, <hi>Vers.</hi> 11. <hi>Come ye Heathen,</hi> (and I say) O <hi>Lord Major of London,</hi> that hast not acted so well as most of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> unless thou <hi>Repent,</hi> thou also shalt there be Reckoned withall; and that Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be terrible, for <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. <hi>The Lord shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Ierusalem, and the heavens and the earth shall be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi>—And Vers. 19. <hi>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom a desolate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, for their <hi>Uiolence</hi> against the Children of Iudah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land:</hi> then beware, O <hi>BLOODY MAIOR.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, And as Gods People are the <hi>Portion</hi> and <hi>Heritage</hi> of God, so they are the <hi>Vinyard</hi> of God; for so saith that Kingly Prophet, <hi>Ps.</hi> 80. 15. They are <hi>Gods Vine, &amp; the Vinyard which his own right hand hath planted;</hi> Yea, so also as saith that Evangelical Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>I will sing a song to my welbeloved, a song of my welbeloved, touching his vineyard my welbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill, and he fenced it, and gathered out the loose stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest Vine.</hi> And Vers. 7. <hi>The Vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Iudah are his pleasant plant.</hi> And, saith the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Behold, I will make Ierusalem a burthensome stone, and a cup of trembling unto all the people round about;</hi> and vers. 3. <hi>I will make Ierusalem a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome stone for all people, all that burthen themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.</hi> Then let all Persecuting spirits have a care, how they tread down Gods Vineyard, for saith the Prophet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 10, 11. For <hi>Chaldea shall be a Spoil, all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the Lord; Because ye were glad, because ye rejoyced, O ye <hi>Destroyers</hi> of my People:</hi> Then have a care of thy self, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> for God will have a <hi>Controversie</hi> with thee, for thy treading down his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> for he is the <hi>Husband-man;</hi> yea so saith our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 1, 2. <hi>I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Husband-man; every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh it away.</hi> So that thou art but a drudge, a servant to lop off the fruitless branches; and therefore know, that thou art not set on work
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53930:21"/>
either to cut off fruit-bearing-branches, nor the Vine, but thou beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest thy self hitherto, as if thou wert set on work to <hi>root up the Vine,</hi> even <hi>King Iesus;</hi> and therefore know, that in the midst of thy fury thou mayest make more haste then good speed; and therefore in the Name of the Lord, I am come to let thee know, that this Stone <hi>cut out off the mountain without hands,</hi> Dan. 2. 34. this <hi>Stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the Head of the Corner,</hi> and <hi>this is the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it is marvellous in our eyes;</hi> Therefore have a care of being too sie with him; for <hi>whosoever shall fall upon this stone, he shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder;</hi> Yea, so saith our <hi>Vine, Matth.</hi> 21. 42, 44. Then have a care of thy self, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> for if he fall upon thee, he will break thy <hi>Lordship</hi> to pieces; for he shall fall on the feet of the Image, and break it to pieces, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As <hi>Gods People</hi> are his <hi>Portion,</hi> his <hi>Heritage,</hi> and his <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> so they are his <hi>Sheep</hi> and his <hi>Flock;</hi> for he is <hi>our God, and we are the People of his Pasture, and the Sheep of his hands,</hi> Psal. 95. 7. For know ye, (yea I say again and again, know ye, ye <hi>Persecutors)</hi> Know ye, <hi>that the Lord he is God, it is he that hath made us, and not we our selves, we are his People and the Sheep of his Pasture.</hi> And thus he led his <hi>Flock</hi> of old by the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Psal.</hi> 77. 7. Thus did he by, and to his <hi>Flock</hi> of old under that <hi>Legal dispensation,</hi> and he shewed himself valiant for his <hi>Flock</hi> and his <hi>Sheep,</hi> and that by the hands of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> Witness those ten <hi>Plagues</hi> he brought upon that Oppressing Tyrant, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for saith the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 7, 8. <hi>I have surely seen the Affliction of my People which are in Egypt,</hi> (yea and so he doth in <hi>England,</hi> for it is not fair pretences that can blind his eyes, or stop his ears) for (saith he) <hi>I have heard their cries, by reason of their Task-Masters,</hi> (that would violate their Consciences) <hi>for I know their sorrows, and am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians;</hi> and he is the same God still, for he can both see, hear, and will in his due time deliver: For they are his <hi>Sheep,</hi> and if they can but behave themselves like <hi>Sheep,</hi> if they can but suffer their Wool to be torn off their Backs, by such <hi>Bryary Brambles</hi> &amp; <hi>Thorns</hi> as thou art, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> if they can but according to the Requirement of that <hi>Shepherd and Bishop of their souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 25. <hi>that great Shepherd of the Sheep,</hi> (who became so) <hi>through the Blood of the everlasting Covenant,</hi> Heb. 13. 20. I say, if they can but follow his example, who left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an example for them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. who although he was the great Shepherd, yet he was <hi>oppressed</hi> and <hi>afflicted,</hi> and <hi>he opened not his mouth;</hi> Yea, <hi>he was led as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before the</hi>

            <p>Then first consider, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in those <hi>ten Plagues</hi> he suffered in his own Country and Habitation, after he had contrived the ruine of Gods People, when he himself sought to bring Gods People at an <hi>under,</hi> he himself was suddenly brought Low, Exod. 1. and Exod. 7. and 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, Chapters, and whilst he still retained his <hi>Malice</hi> against them, Gods <hi>Iudgements</hi> are renewed; when he pursues Israel to <hi>destroy</hi> them all, God utterly ruines him and all his that prusued them, and that most Miraculously; for the Red Sea was before them, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Host behinde them, and now in all probability the People of God must perish; but <hi>Israel</hi> waits upon God, and God most Miraculously <hi>devides</hi> the <hi>Sea,</hi> and causeth <hi>Israel</hi> to go over dry-shod; But when <hi>pharaoh,</hi> his Host and his.

I answer to their shame, No; he turned not his Back upon his God, nor upon the waiting upon his God in his constant course, times, place, and manner; For as soon as <hi>Daniel</hi> knew that the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> was <hi>Signed,</hi> he went into his <hi>House,</hi> and his <hi>Windows being opened</hi> in his <hi>Chamber</hi> towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he <hi>kneeled upon his knees three times a day,</hi> and <hi>prayed</hi> and <hi>gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime;</hi> It is worthy our serious consideration, <hi>as he did <hi>Afore time,</hi>
               </hi> so he doth <hi>now,</hi> the Kings Royal <hi>Decree</hi> altereth not his serving his God, nor the fear of the <hi>Den</hi> of <hi>Lyons,</hi> but he prayes and gives thanks three times a day, as he did <hi>afore-time;</hi> whereupon faithful <hi>Daniel</hi> must be cast into the <hi>Den</hi> of <hi>Lyons;</hi> but that God sent his <hi>Angel</hi> to <hi>shut</hi> the <hi>mouthes</hi> of the <hi>Lyons,</hi> that <hi>Daniel</hi> so constantly and faithfully <hi>served,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> must be released: But shall his Accusers escape? No, for they dig a pit for another; but are fallen into the ditch that they have digged; for no sooner <hi>Daniel</hi> out, but his Accusers in; for saith the Text, <hi>The King Commanded, and they brought those that had Accused</hi> Daniel, <hi>and</hi>

            <p>And that I may the better set home the certainty of this truth upon thy heart, O <hi>Richard Brown;</hi> I shall lay before thee something out of the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that so thou mayest see how the <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of God have all along followed <hi>Tyrannical Oppressors,</hi> even to the advancement of his own Glory and his Peoples good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eusebius Pamphilius,</hi> in his first Book, of the Life of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the 50. <hi>Chap.</hi> telleth us, that the Emperour <hi>Maximinius</hi> was a great <hi>Persecutor</hi> of the People of God, insomuch that he exprest his rage against them with great fury; but before he could satisfie his thirst with the Blood of Just and Religious men, God began to lay <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> on him, and began to invade his body, that so he might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his mind; for an <hi>ulcerous Fistula</hi> did breed in his <hi>secret parts,</hi> which in time did eat into his bowels, having a number of <hi>wormes,</hi> which did breed in it, and yeeld a deadly stinck—insomuch that he became a <hi>Lamentable spectacle</hi> to all men: thus being full of pain and misery, and troubled in Conscience for <hi>Oppressing</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> presently in all haste, he confessed his fault to God, and commanded them to make their accustomed Supplications and Prayers for him to God.</p>
            <p>And thus we see God many times meets with men for their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actings against his <hi>People,</hi> as he did of old, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. 14, 15. when he <hi>suffered no man to do them wrong,</hi> yea (when he) <hi>reproved <hi>Kings</hi> for their <hi>sakes,</hi> saying, Touch not mine Anointed, and do my <hi>Prophets</hi> no harm.</hi> And let me tell thee O <hi>Mayor,</hi> I am perswaded it would be a benefit to thy soul, if God should so gently lay his hand on thee, that so thou mightest know thy self, and know his peaceable people; but the Lord is now giving thee a <hi>Warning</hi> by me his unworthy servant, then slight it not; I say as thou tenderest thine own <hi>preservation,</hi> and as thou pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest thine own peace, be at peace with the peaceable People and <hi>Flock</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>ulcerous Fistula</hi> in <hi>Maximinius</hi> becometh not a full cure to his Soul, nor a through means of the curing of his inveterate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant mind; But <hi>Pharaoh</hi>-like, he begins again, suddenly after a little ease, to disturb the People of God afresh, who, saith the said Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53930:25"/>
in the 51. <hi>Chapter,</hi> of his said book, <hi>striving to exceed others in wickedness,</hi> began to invent new wicked projects against them; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Christians to death by fire and sword, by barrels full of nails, by exposing them to wild beasts, or casting them into the sea; and besides all this, he invented a new kind of <hi>torture,</hi> which was to put out their eyes; so that multitudes of men, women and children, had their eyes put out; first with hot Irons, and afterwards were tortured in divers strange manners; for which Gods <hi>Revenge</hi> afterwards overtook him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For bringing an Army into the <hi>Field,</hi> to fight against an Enemy, who wanting the assistance of God, he was overthrown; and so putting off his Royal apparel, which, saith the story, he was unworthy to wear; he thrust himself among the common Souldiers, and afterwards be took himself to flight; and having disguised himself in the habit of a Serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he hid himself in Towns and Villages; but he could not hide himself from the watchful eye of Divine Providence; for after he thought himself in safety; he was stricken with a thunder-bolt to the ground, his body being so withered and shrunk up with it, that it could hardly be known to be the same, for it looked like a dried Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass.</p>
            <p>And, saith the said Author in his 52. <hi>Chapter,</hi> when <hi>Maximinius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to plague the Church of God more vehemently; his <hi>Eyes drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> out of his <hi>head,</hi> and he was left stark blind; and that punishment which he had invented against the <hi>Christian <hi>Martyrs,</hi>
               </hi> the same by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice, was inflicted on himself; who at last living in this miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner, he began to confess and acknowledg the Christians God; affirming, that he had found by experience, that the Christians God was the true God.</p>
            <p>And seeing God is so Just, and so Severe a God, let me in his Name, and in his Fear desire thee, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> to consider of thy <hi>violent actings;</hi> and know, that he is the same God still; and is as <hi>Powerful</hi> as ever, and as <hi>Iust</hi> as ever, and as <hi>Severe</hi> as ever, and as <hi>Loving</hi> to his own People as ever; then be more moderate to his People, lest he be as Just, and as Severe to thee as he hath been to others; For saith the Prophet <hi>David,—Evil shall hunt the <hi>Uiolent man,</hi> to overthrow him,</hi> Psal. 140. 11. <hi>For the <hi>Wicked</hi> through the pride of his countenance will not seek after God,</hi> Psal. 10. 4. <hi>God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> For <hi>his ways are always grievous: thy judgements and far above out of his sight,</hi> vers. 5. <hi>He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity,</hi> vers. 6. <hi>His mouth is full of cunsing, and deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and violence,</hi> Vers. 7. <hi>He lieth in wait secretly, as a Lion in his Den; he lieth in wait to catch the Poor, he</hi>

               </hi> the Lord, and if ye so do, <hi>though your sins were as scarlet, they shall be as wooll; though they be as crimson, they shall be as snow;</hi> For God is a merciful, a loving, and a tender-hearted God to poor sinful souls; who, if ye will believe himself, saith, <hi>As I live, I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, but that the wicked turn from his ways, and live; Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</hi> Ezek. 33. 11. <hi>For if the wicked will turn from his all sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live, he shall not die: All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him; in his righteousness that he hath done, he shall live,</hi> Ezek. 18. 21, 22. For, <hi>The Lord is long-suffering to us-wards, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. O then, <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> and all <hi>persecuting</hi> and <hi>violent spirits,</hi> in the fear of the Lord, be perswaded by the Lord, to cast away from you <hi>all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart, and a new spirit; for why will ye die?

See the willingness of an offended God, to be friends and at peace with an offending soul; nay, he thinks much of every <hi>minutes time</hi> that ye spend, before ye come to him; For hear how he crieth out, by that Wise man, saying, <hi>How long,</hi> (I pray mind the tearms) <hi>How long <hi>ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity, and ye scorners delight in scorning, and fools hate knowledge? Turn ye at my reproof:</hi>

               <hi>I will give you my Spirit, that shall lead you into all truth,</hi> John 16. 13. whose operation in you, will produce other effects, then <hi>Envying, Slandring,</hi> and <hi>casting into Prison, Strong-holds,</hi> and <hi>Dungeons;</hi> for the fruits thereof, are, <hi>Love, Ioy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Temperance;</hi> So that if your sins were never so <hi>Red,</hi> though they be of never so deep a dye, yet forsake them; and the <hi>Blood</hi> of a <hi>Crucified Iesus</hi> shall <hi>cleanse you from all sins,</hi> 1 John 1. 7. <hi>For he is the Propitiation for our sins, and not for ours onely, but also for the sins of the <hi>whole World,</hi>

For, for my own part, I my self have been as <hi>Zealous</hi> as thou canst be; and had I had but as much Power as thou now hast, I do really believe, (unless <hi>Conscience</hi> had flown in my face) I should have done as much as thou hast done; And I knowing thy conditon by mine own, and by comparing my <hi>past,</hi> with my <hi>present</hi> Condition; I <hi>could do no less in Christian love than what I have done;</hi> For I through mercy have taken out this Lesson, in what the Lord requireth me, in what he said to <hi>Peter,</hi> that when I am <hi>Converted,</hi> I should <hi>strengthen</hi> my <hi>brethren:</hi> And herein I desire to do by <hi>another,</hi> as I would have <hi>another</hi> do by me; And I would, if another saw me running headlong to destruction, that he should let me know the danger; that so I might, if possible, escape and avoid it.

And <hi>herein was the Love of God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested towards us, because that God sent his onely begotten Son into the World, that we through him might live,</hi> 1 John 4. 9. For, saith our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>Iesus Christ came into the World, to Save sinners, of whom <hi>I am Chief,</hi>
               </hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Iesus; who gave himself a Ransom for all, to be testified in due time,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6. <hi>Who came to Seek, and to Save that which was lost,</hi> Luk. 19. 10. Who was <hi>that Lamb of God, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the sins of the World,</hi> John 3. 29. <hi>For God so loved World, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that Whosoever believed in him, should not Perish, but have everlasting Life: For God sent not his Son into the World, to Condemn the World, but that the World through him might be Saved,</hi> John 3. 16, 17. For, vers. 14. <hi>As Moses Lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, so also must the Son of Man be Lifted up; that Whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him should not perish, but have Eternal Life: And this is Life Eternal, that they might Know thee the onely True God, and Iesus Christ, whom thou hast sent,</hi> John 17. 3. <hi>But he that saith he Knoweth him, and Keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2. 4. So that, to <hi>Know</hi> God, upon a Scripture account, is to <hi>Obey</hi> God. For <hi>Samuel</hi> said unto <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 14. 22, 23. <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in <hi>Obeying</hi> the voice of the Lord? Behold to <hi>Obey</hi> is better than <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and to <hi>Hearken</hi> than the <hi>fat of Rams;</hi> but <hi>Rebellion</hi> is as the Sin of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and <hi>Stubbornness,</hi> is as <hi>Iniquity</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </hi> So we see evidently, that what God Requireth from a Soul, if that Soul do not Obey God in that Requirement, God looketh upon that Soul to be a Rebel against him. And this is that which maketh many a poor man lie in Prison at this very day, that dares not transgress the Requirement of the Lord Christ; lest they be found Rebels against Christ, who saith <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Swear not at all.</hi>

            <p>O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> it is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 8.

But if thou hast any other end in what thou doest, Thou mayest go on and please thy Fancy, if thou wilt, and fulfil thy Lust if thou pleasest, but thou shalt miss of thy End, to attain Glory, if that be thy End; For if Gods Glory, the Good of thine own Soul, and the Benefit of Others, be not thine End, then thy End to Eternity will be but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable; For God made Thee, and I and All Men, for his own Glory; in producing of which, he hath promised us <hi>Glory;</hi> But if God be not <hi>Glorified by us,</hi> he will be <hi>Glorified upon us;</hi> For, God will not want his great End.</p>
               <p>Therefore, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> be perswaded in Gods Fear, and as thou tenderest the Eternal good, benefit, and welfare of thine own Soul, to consider thy End, and thy End; thy End what it is, in doing what thou doest do, and thy End what it will be, if thou yet continuest doing what thou hitherto hast done.</p>
               <p>And if thou shalt be willing to such a <hi>Treaty,</hi> possibly it may be, that which (experimentally I have known with others) may tend to thy <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> in order to thy <hi>Reformation;</hi> that so thou mayest be wrought up to a <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Mind</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> when thou shalt be <hi>Transformed into the Likeness of Gods dear Son;</hi> that so thou mayest be <hi>translated</hi> into his <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> here, in order to thy <hi>Reigning</hi> with him in <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter. And this, O <hi>Richard Brown,</hi> the Searcher of all hearts knoweth, is my chief and ultimate End, in this my <hi>Alarm;</hi> even thy souls good to Eternity.</p>
               <p>But if thou shalt refuse to answer my Desire in this my <hi>Parley,</hi> but wilt still go on in thy <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Oppression,</hi> I shall without <hi>Violence,</hi> or the least force of Carnal Weapon, make a Peaceable <hi>Retreat,</hi> and Retire into my Closet, where my Soul shall weep in secret for thee, and al <hi>Tyrannical Oppressors;</hi> and shall cry out in the Words of Him, who went up and down doing Good, who left Himself as a Pattern for us to walk by; Who said of them that Crucified Him, <hi>Father <hi>forgive</hi> them, they <hi>know not</hi> what they do.</hi>
