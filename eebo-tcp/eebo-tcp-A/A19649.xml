         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>September</hi> laſt,
I with others, was by ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Authoritie, appointed to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fer, with ſuch of your ſort,
as at that tyme, were in her
Maieſties priſons, of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalſey
&amp; the white Lion, in
Sowthwark, reſtrained of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
for refuſing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
themſelues to that order of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is now
publique in this Realme of England. And according to
our duety in that behalfe: Maiſter <hi>Henrie Tryp,</hi> and I, did
(as we were required) make our ſpedy repaire, firſt to the
one priſon, and then to the other. And after ſome confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
had with certain that were cloſe priſoners: we came
to confer with one Maiſter <hi>Thomas Povvnde</hi> Gentleman,
in the lodging where he then laye. And finding him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather
vnwylling to enter into any conference by
ſpeaches, becauſe (as he ſayd) he feared to fall into daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Lawe therby: I aunſwered, that he ought to haue a
better opinion of her Maieſtie, (by whoſe appointment,
we were come to offer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference) then to thinke that ſhe
would ſend vs, to entrap him, or any other her ſubiects.
For ſhe needeth not to ſeeke more aduantage againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, then that which already by their diſloyall
behauiour they haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her. So that if ſhe would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
againſt them in rigour of lawe, and not in mercie:
ſhe might cut their heads from their ſhoulders, and make
no more to doo with them. But being deſirous, by ſome
meanes to bring to paſſe, that they might become as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
ſubiects to her, as ſhe both hath and dooth ſhew
her ſelfe a louing Prince to them: ſhe would not abridge
<pb facs="tcp:9597:3"/>
them of lybertie (which for good and iuſt, yea neceſſary
cauſes, ſhee is now enforced to doo) but that ſhee would
withal prouide, that by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with ſuch as be learned,
they might either be drawn from their errours: or els be
found to be obſtinate and wilfully blinde. But none of
theſe ſpeaches could mooue maiſter <hi>Pownd</hi> to like of any
conference by ſpeaches. Yet notwithſtanding, he ſayd he
was ready to confer by wryting, and offered ſo to doo.
Whereunto I aunſwered, that we had no commiſsion to
deale that way: but yet if he would write, I promiſed to
aunſwer him in writing. Vpon this he pulled a Pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phlet
out of his boſome (the copie wherof I haue cauſed to be
ſet before mine aunſwer) &amp; called in ſuch as he thought
meete to heare it read. And after he had read it: he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it to me to be aunſwered. And this was done the. 7.
day of <hi>September.</hi> The ninth of the ſame month, I began
to ſhape him an aunſwer: and finiſhed the ſame with as
much conuenient ſpeed as I could, being letted with buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
beſides that buſines, enough to occupy ſom ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly.
But by Gods helpe, the time was not long before
the aunſwer was finiſhed. But in this meane whyle (I
know not by what occaſion) Maiſter <hi>Povvnd,</hi> was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to another priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, further of: ſo that I could not come
to delyuer mine aunſwer to him, neyther did I thinke it
meete to be ſent to him immediatly from me, becauſe I
vnderſtoode, that the right Reuerend Father the Lorde
Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> had commaunded him to be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thence. I did therefore reade, in the hearing of as
many of your ſorte, as I then found in the Marſhalſey,
bothe the Reaſons contayned in Maiſter <hi>Povvnd</hi> his
Pamphlet: and alſo mine aunſwers to the ſame. Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that with as much ſpeede as I might, I would ſend
bothe to my ſayd Lord the Biſhop, with my Letters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
him, at his diſcretion, eyther to ſend mine aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to Maiſter <hi>Pownd:</hi> or els to cauſe him to be brought
back againe to the Marſhalſey, whether I might repaire,
<pb facs="tcp:9597:3"/>
to proceede in conference with him by writing. But my
ſayde Lorde, being oppreſſed with other affaires more
waightie: and thereby enforced to commit this buſines
to ſome other, that were not ſo carefull for the diſpatch
thereof, as I would they had. And I my ſelfe alſo (not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
vnoccupied otherwiſe) did not, (as in dutie I
ought) call vpon my ſayd Lord, but ſuppoſing that mine
aunſwer had beene ſhortly conuayed to Maiſter <hi>Povvnd,</hi>
(becauſe I heard not of his returne to the Marſhalſey) I
reſted, looking to haue receyued ſome replie from him:
tyll at the laſt (euen in the Moneth of <hi>December</hi> laſt)
I heard that the Copies of his Pamphlet were made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to many of your ſorte, with great brags, that the
reaſons therein contayned are vnaunſwerable. Yea, and
ſome of our ſide, were required to aunſwer them, euen as
Maiſter <hi>Povvnd</hi> had required me. Whereupon, repayring
to my ſayd Lorde the Bishop: I receaued my ſayde aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
againe the 4. of this Ianuarie, with his allowance to
publish it in Printe, together with the Copies of Maiſter
<hi>Povvnd</hi> his Pamphlet, and the breefe aunſwer that Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Trippe</hi> wrote, after I had finished mine, as by the ſame
may appeare. And this was thought needefull to be don,
becauſe the Copie of Maiſter <hi>Povvnd</hi> his Pamphlet is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made ſo common: our annſwers being as yet, made
knowne but to fewe. And that you may haue that firſte
in ſight that you like beſt: I haue cauſed the Printer to
place the Copy of Maiſter <hi>Povvnd</hi> his Pamphlet, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
after this short Epiſtle. Reade theſe Reaſons for
your pleaſure, and our aunſwers for your profite. And if
you miſlike with our aunſwers, replie, if you can. You
shall finde them of our ſide, that will deale with you,
faithfully and freendely too. Be not obſtinately, and
wilfully blinde: leaſt you doo thereby prouoke (yea and
enforce) our mercifull Prince, contrary to her naturall
inclination, to deale with you in Iuſtice without mercie.
<pb facs="tcp:9597:4"/>
Though we haue great cauſe to thinke that you (all the
ſorte of you) doo hate both: our Prince and vs, for that
Religion which bothe ſhe and we do profeſſe: yet I dare
aſſure you, that bothe ſhe, and all the Honorable &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>2 The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe the holy Scripture
(as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth)<note place="margin">The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Reaſon.</note> is very full of harde and déepe
anyſteries, in ſo much that when <hi>Honoratus</hi> ſayd to him
(as many vnlearned men ſay now a dayes) that he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
it well enough without helpe of any inſtructor.
Say you ſo (ſayth he) you would not take vpon you to
vnderſtand ſuch a Poet as <hi>Terence</hi> is, well, without a
Maiſter? and dare you ruſhe into the holy Scriptures
which are ſo full of Diuine myſteries, without a
Maiſter? and dare you ruſhe into the holy Scriptures
which are ſo full of Diuine myſteries, without a guide?
All Hereſies (ſayth he) come of nothing elſe, <hi>Niſi dum
ſcripturae bonae intelliguntur non bene:</hi> But whyle the good
Scriptures are not well vnderſtoode: Héerto alſo S.
<hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle Cap. 3. beareth witneſſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
That many miſunder ſtood S. <hi>Paule</hi> in many harde
places peruerſly to their owne perdition: But then you
will ſay, the harde places may eaſely he vnderſtoode by
conference of other Scriptures. Well, admit a chyldiſh
reaſon for a worde or two, That becauſe they might ſo
be among the humble minded, therfore they muſt néeds
be ſo, though men be neuer ſo peruerſe: Yet giue mée
leaue to poſe you then one Queſtion farther to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quick.
Howe is it poſſible to knowe by any conference of the
Scriptures, which is Canonicall Scripture and which
is not? certainely, if any Infidell would deny the olde
Teſtament (as ſome Heretikes in time paſt haue done)
and I praye God there be not many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Atheiſtes at this
day in England, which be farther gone yet then they:
Yea, if ſuch a one ſhould deny all the newe Teſtament
alſo, we haue no ſure Anckor holde againſt him but the
Reuelation of God, by tradition to his Church, which
is the pyllor and ſure ſtay of trueth, which <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi>
well ſéeing, thought he might be bolde to ſay, with due
<pb facs="tcp:9597:5"/>
reuerence to God, and holie Scripture bothe: I ſhould
not beleue the Goſpell except the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church
did moue me thereunto, meanyng that the tradition of

of God, in whom the holie Ghoſte dwelleth, muſt iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly
moue vs to credite that, whiche their authoritie doth
commaunde vs to giue credite vnto. Therefore let any
man beware of fliyng from the Churches Iudgement,
to the Scripture onely, leaſt the Scripture it ſelf ſhould
vtterly bee denied, as by ſome <hi>Atheiſtes in Englande</hi> (as
I heare ſaie is alreadie: And then might ſuche Infidels

content to gouerne hym ſelf orderly by the lawe written,
whiche (as his wiſedome) thinkes is plaine enough. And
truely no wiſer be thei but muche more to bee laughed to
ſcorne whiche will haue the Scripture to bee the onely
Iudge for euery man to appeale vnto, and refuſe all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the Churche in expoundyng thereof: for who
knoweth not that the Arrian Heretickes, brought fortie
places of Scripture for their horrible Hereſie, more then
the Catholikes had againſt theim, but all falſely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode,
whiche when it is ſo miſunderſtoode and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,

be out of doubt the Deuill doeth ſpeake vnto vs by their

            <p>6 The ſixt reaſon moſt waightie of all is this: becauſe
if you will refuſe the authoritie of the Churches abſolute

ſeeme plainly to denie the holy Ghoſte to be the Spirite
of truthe, whiche vppon the Apoſtles and all the faithfull
was ſent doune with viſible ſignes, and with his Church
is promiſed to remaine vnto the worldes ende: by these
wordes of our Sauiour, <hi>I will aske my Father, and he
ſhall ſend you an other comforter, to tarie with you for
euer, the ſpirite of truth:</hi> And a little after thus. <hi>The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſte the comforter, whom my Father will ſende in

the ſureſt Iudge, and none ſhure but the Churche, for all
men in doubtes of Scripture, becauſe it hath a promiſe
that it ſhall neuer erre in iudgement, whiche is notably
confirmed by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſaiyng. <hi>This is my coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt
with them ſaieth our Lorde, my ſpirite whiche is
in thee, and my worde which I haue put in thy mouth
ſhal not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth
of thy ſeede, nor of thy ſeedes ſeede, now, nor euer to
the worldes ende.</hi> O moſt comfortable promiſe, that the
Spirite of truth ſhall neuer departe out of the Churches
mouth. O fit Iudge appointed to be Iudge of Scripture
for our profites, without preſumption. Remember then
I praie you, what a ſottiſhe opinion this is which is held
to the contrarie, that euery priuate man, whom belike
you wil imagine to be one of the Church, ſhall haue good

<hi>Emaus,</hi> for that thei were ſo dull and harde to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that whiche the Prophetes had ſo plainly ſpoken.
<hi>Ought not Chriſte</hi> (ꝙ he) <hi>to ſufter theſe thinges, and ſo
to enter into his glorie?</hi> As though he ſhould haue ſaied:
are you ſo doltiſhe and blockiſhe, that you vnderſtande
not ſo plaine ſpeeches as the Prophets haue vſed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
the ſufferyng es of Chriſte?</p>
               <p>And appearyng to them afterwardes, as thei were
altogether in <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> He telleth them, that of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
all muſte bee fulfilled, that had beene written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
him, either in the lawe of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> in the Prophets,
or in the Pſalmes. And that thei might vnderſtande the
Scriptures, he did then open their vnderſtandynges:
Whereby it appeareth, that it was not the hardneſſe and
deepeneſſe of the miſteries (wherewith, as you ſaie the
<pb facs="tcp:9597:10"/>
Scripture is full) that helde them from the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
thereof: but the dulneſſe of their owne vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng,
becauſe thei were as yet but carnall: and therefore
coulde not perceiue thynges belongyng to the ſpirite of
God, as Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> hath written.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> The naturall man,
doeth not perceiue theſe thynges that doe belong to the
ſpirite of God. Not that we bee of our ſelues, as of our
ſelues,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.</note> ſufficient to thinke any thyng, but our ſufficiencie
is of God. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now, for that whiche you haue cited, out of <hi>Austine,</hi>
concernyng the reprehendyng of <hi>Honoratus:</hi> I would
gladly knowe of you, what <hi>Honoratus</hi> it was that you
ſpeake of. One there was of that name, to whom Sainct
<hi>Austine</hi> wrote his .120. Epiſtle. But that <hi>Honoratus</hi>
was not like to vſe any ſuche ſpeeche to S. <hi>Austine.</hi>
Neither doeth Sainct <hi>Austine</hi> in that Epiſtle, vſe any
ſuche ſpeeche to hym, as you ſaie he did. But in the laſte
ende of the Epiſtle, Saint <hi>Austine</hi> ſheweth hym ſelf to
be of an other mynde, then (by your reporte) your <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
ſeemed to be. For he ſaieth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Habes librum, &amp; ſi prolixum, tamen, quantum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtimo
non ſuperfluum. &amp;c.</hi> Thou haſte here a Booke
(ſaieth Sainct <hi>Austine</hi>) whiche though it be long: yet,
as I thinke, it is not ſuperfluous. But doe thou loue the
Eccleſiaſticall writinges alſo, and thou ſhalte not finde
many thynges, which thou ſhouldeſt neede to ſeeke for at
my handes. But by reading and ruminating or cuddyng
(if thou doe alſo purely praie vnto the Lorde, that is the
giuer of all good thinges) thou ſhalt learne throughly, all
thoſe thynges, or vndoubtedly very many of thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that are worth the knowyng, rather by his inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then by any mannes admonition: Although, euen in
the ſame thyng wherein wee doe with right iudgement
allowe that man that doth outwardly admoniſh vs well:
what other thing doe we, then teſtifie that we haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
light that doeth teache vs, and is our Maiſter?
<pb facs="tcp:9597:10"/>
Thus farre <hi>Austine.</hi> Lette your freendes iudge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be likely, that this <hi>Austine,</hi> and this <hi>Honoratus,</hi>
would vſe ſuche ſpeeches the one to the other, as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte
yours to haue doen.</p>
               <p>One other <hi>Honoratus</hi> there was, to whom our S.
<hi>Austine</hi> wrote his .161. Epiſtle. This man helde with
<hi>Donatus:</hi> and in that Epiſtle Saint <hi>Austine</hi> doeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte
hym, to render a reaſon quietly in writing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the name of the Church ſhould at that time remaine
onely among the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was alſo a thirde, <hi>Honoratus,</hi> to whom our
S. <hi>Austine</hi> wrote his .179. Epiſtle. This man Saint
<hi>Austine</hi> calleth brother and fellowe Biſhop, and doeth
inſtruct hym at large in the libertie of fliyng perſecution:
wherein he vſeth not one worde, that maie bee wreſted to
that meanyng that you haue reported.</p>
               <p>But you will ſaie, there is yet one other, to whome
Saint <hi>Austine</hi> wrote his Booke, <hi>De vtilitate creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suche an <hi>Honoratus</hi> there was in deede. But when
you ſhall reade that Booke with more indifferent iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
you ſhall not finde, that <hi>Austine</hi> to bee of your
mynde. Not muche before that place that you take holde
of, writing of the truth of the Scripture, and noting that
we ought to loue the Scripture before wee learne it: he
writeth thus. <hi>Quicquid eſt (mihi crede) in Scripturis
illis, altum &amp; diuinum eſt. &amp;c.</hi> Beleeue me (ſaieth Saint
<hi>Austine</hi>) whatſoeuer thyng is in the Scriptures, the

diſcipline that is moſte meete for the refreſhyng and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoryng
of myndes: and vndoubtedly, ſo moderated, that
euery manne maie drawe therehence, enough to ſatiffie
him ſelf, if ſo be that he come to drawe after a deuout and
Godly ſorte, as true Religion requireth. And immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly

By that interpretation that you make of the wordes

the groſſe errour, of buildyng Chriſt his Churche vpon
<hi>Peter</hi> the man,<note place="margin">Aug. de ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni. ſer. 13.</note> and not vpon Chriſt the Rocke: not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng,

               <p>I might here take iuſt occaſion, to rehearſe all thoſe
errors, that haue bene, and are holden by your ſorte, and
aſcribe them all, to that whiche S. <hi>Austine</hi> ſpeaketh of
in the wordes that you cite: that is. That by your ſort, the
good Scriptures, are not well vnderſtanded. But ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
to be breefe, I paſſe them ouer.</p>
               <p>To proceede in mine Aunſwere: you eatche holde of
S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And he muſt needes helpe you to face out your

beare you recorde, that the Scriptures are full of harde
and deepe miſteries, as you haue taught S. <hi>Austine</hi> to
ſaie. But when the place that you cite ſhalbe weighed,
with indifferent iudgement: it will be founde that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
meanyng, was not as you take is to be.</p>
               <p>Sainct <hi>Peter</hi> hath written thus. But wee looke for

wherein dwelleth righteouſneſſe. Wherefore belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
ſeeyng that ye looke for ſuche thinges thee dilligent,
that ye maie be founde of hym in peace, without ſpot, and
blameleſſe. And ſuppoſe, that the long ſufferyng of our
Lorde, is ſaluation: euen as our beloued brother <hi>Paule</hi>
(accordyng to the wiſedome giuen vnto hym) wrote to
you, as one that in al his Epiſtles, ſpeaketh of thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
amongſte whiche, ſome thynges are harde to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanded,
whiche thei that bee vnlearned and vnſtable
doe peruerte, as thei doe alſo other Scriptures to their

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9597:11"/>
If you reade theſe wordes of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Greeke
tongue (wherein the Apoſtle wrote them) you ſhall finde
that the Relatiue <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is of the newter gender, and cannot
by the rules of Grammer, agree with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whiche
is of the feminine gender. Wherefore, it muſt be Engli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
thus. In, or amongſt which thinges or matters that
<hi>Paule</hi> wrote of, and not, in thoſe Epiſtles that he wrote:
as in your application of <hi>Peters</hi> woordes, you ſeeme to
vnderſtande him to meane. But peraduenture, you haue
no good likyng of the Greeke Text, neither of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
tranſlations. I will therefore ſet doune the wordes
of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> euen as I finde them in the tranſlation, that
is allowed in the Counſell of <hi>Trent:</hi> and as thei be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in an old written Bible that I haue in Parchment, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
I knowe not how many hundred yeares paſt. Thus
are thei written in the Bible. <hi>Propter quod chariſſimi,

would tranſlate them into Engliſhe, thus. Wherefore,
dearely beloued, waityng for theſe thinges, giue your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to be founde vnto hym in peace, beeyng without
ſpot, and vndefiled: and thinke that the long ſufferyng of
our Lorde, is ſaluation, euen as our moſte deare brother
<hi>Paule</hi> (according to the wiſedom that is giuen vnto him)
hath written to you, euen as in euery Epiſtle, ſpeakyng
in them of thoſe thinges, amongſt whiche are ſome thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that are harde to be vnderſtanded, whiche vnlearned
and vnſtable menne, doe depraue, euen as thei doe other
Scriptures, to their owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p>I truſt you doe ſee now, that we neede not that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb facs="tcp:9597:12"/>
whiche you doe call childiſhe, and is not indeepe ſo
childiſhe, but that it hath in all ages been (and is ſtill) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
amongſt the learned, for the beſte rule in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng
of places of the Scripture, wherein is any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie.</p>
               <p>But now you doe begge (or rather take) leaue, to poſe
vs one queſtion furder, to the quicke. And thus you ſaie.
How is it poſſible, to knowe by any conference of the
Scriptures, which is Canonicall Scripture, and which
is not? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You ſeeme to bee perſwaded that this queſtion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
to the quicke in deede. For you affirme plainly, that
if any Infidell, Hereticke, or Arbeiſt, ſhall denie any
parte of the olde or newe Teſtament, or the whole olde
and new Teſtament (as in tymes paſt ſome haue doen.)
&amp;c. We haue no Ankor holde againſt ſuch, but onely the
Reuelation of God to the Churche, by Tradition, which
Churche is the piller, and ſure ſtaie of truth. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, that the Church is the Piller and ſure ſtaie
of truthe, as Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> writeth.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> But that this truth
is reuealed to the Churche by Tradition (as you write)
that I denie. For God hath taught, (and doth ſtill teach)
the truthe to his Churche, by the worde of truth, and not
by Reuelation or Tradition. And that worde of truthe is
ſufficient, and needeth not that any thyng ſhould bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to it: either by Reuelation, or by Tradition. Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
there is an horrible curſſe pronounced againſt all ſuch as
ſhall adde any thyng to in.</p>
               <p>The true Catholique Churche, is in deede the Piller
and ſure ſtaie, whereon, that truthe that is taught by the
worde of truthe, doeth ſtaie. For that worde of truthe, is
the voyce of her Sheepeheard, and ſhe delighteth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
that voyce: but the voyce of a ſtraunger ſhe can not
abyde to heare. The truthe taught by the voyce of her
Sheepehearde, ſhe laieth vp in her harte: and all her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
is to lette men ſee it, in her life and conuerſation,
<pb facs="tcp:9597:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that ſéeing her good lyfe, they may be occaſioned therby,
to glorifie her ſpouſe Chriſte, and his and her heauenly
Father.</p>
               <p>This is that authoritie, that S. <hi>Austine</hi> ſayth, moued
him to beléeue the Goſpell. And this authoritie cauſed
him to write thus, againſt that Epiſtle of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi>
which the <hi>Maniches</hi> called theyr foundation.<note place="margin">Tom. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Ego veró
Euangelio non crederem, niſi me Catholicae Eccleſiae

the Goſpell, except the authoritie of the Church dyd
mooue me thereto.</p>
               <p>Not many lines before thoſe words, S. <hi>Austine</hi> ſayth
thus to the <hi>Maniches. Apud vos, vbi nihil horum eſt,
quod me inuitet ac teneat. &amp;c.</hi> That is: Amongſt you,
where no part of that thing is, which might allure and
holde me, there ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth only a promiſing of the trueth:
which vndoubtedly, if it be ſhewed foorth ſo manifeſtly,
that it may not be doubted of: it is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all thoſe thinges that doo holde me in the Church.</p>
               <p>I pray you (Maiſter <hi>Pownde</hi>) ponder well theſe
wordes of <hi>Austine:</hi> and be not afrayde with <hi>Austine</hi> to
yéelde, to the manifeſt trueth, (when it ſhall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
to you) onely becauſe it lacketh the conſent of
Peoples, and Nations, the authoritie of Myracles, the
nouriſhment of hope, the increaſe of looue, the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Antiquitie, the holde from <hi>Peters</hi> ſeate, the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of Prieſts, and the name of Catholique. For S.
<hi>Augustine</hi> ſayth: That the manifeſt trueth muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before all theſe.</p>
               <p>But if you wyll marke it well, you ſhall finde that
the trueth which we holde and teach, and would wiſhe
you and all your ſort to embrace, dooth not lacke the
chéefeſt of thoſe thinges that mooued S. <hi>Austine</hi> firſt to
embrace it. For it is the ſame, that firſt gotte credite, by
thoſe Myracles that were wrought by Chriſte and his
Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Mark. 16.</note> It was, and is ſtyll nouriſhed by hope: It
<pb facs="tcp:9597:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was, and is ſtyll increaſed by looue, it is alſo confirmed
by that ſeate which you call <hi>Peters,</hi> and hath the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Prieſts, although not in ſuch ſort as you allowe
of. And laſt of all, it hath the right name of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</p>
               <p>Thus, I hope, you doo now ſée, that you haue not
rightly applied, eyther the words of <hi>Paule,</hi> or of <hi>Austine:</hi>
mynding thereby to prooue, that the Church of <hi>Roome,</hi>
(being ſuch a Church, as nowe it ſheweth it ſelfe to be)
is the Piller of trueth, and that Catholique Church,
whereunto all Chriſtians ſhould and muſt of neceſſitie
cleaue, if they wyll be ſaued by Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Your concluſion, wherein you aduiſe all men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of fléeing from the Church, to the iudgement of
the Scriptures onely. &amp;c. Was not ſo aduiſedly made,
as were ſéemely to be made, by one that were ſo well
ſéen in the writings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fathers, as you would ſéeme
to be. For (as I thinke, yea, I am perſwaded, that I
may ſafely affirme,) there is not one of the auncient
Fathers, of your minde in that poynt.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> in his Epiſtle fortie and eight, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

&amp;c.</hi> Doo not therefore (Brother) ſhewe thy ſelfe
wylling, to gather out of the wrytinges of Biſhoppes,
reproches againſt ſo heauenly, ſo many, ſo cleare, and
ſo vndoubted teſtimonies: whether the ſame Biſhops
be on our ſide, as <hi>Hillarius,</hi> or of the vnitie it ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the faction of <hi>Donatus</hi> was ſeparated from it, as
<hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Agripinus:</hi> Firſt for that, that kinde of

ſhould be taken out of them, that it might not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for any man, to be of a minde contrarie thereto,
if perhappes they ſhall in any place be of other minde
then the trueth requireth. For we are of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:9597:13"/>
that may not diſdayne, to take euen vnto our ſelfe,
this ſaying of the Apoſtle. And if ye be of an other

               <p>Thus you may ſée, that S <hi>Auſtine</hi> dooth not allowe

againſt the Canonicall Scripture.</p>
               <p>The ſame Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> wryting to Saint <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>

I haue learned to giue this reuerende feare and honor,
onely to thoſe Bookes of the Scriptures, which nowe

none of the Authors of them, haue in wryting erred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>By this ſaying of Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> it may appeare, that

&amp;c.</hi> Who can be ignoraunt (ſayth Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>)
that the holy Scripture, as well of the olde as of

before all the latter wrytings of Biſhops, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, there may be no doubt or controuerſie at
all, whether any thing that is certainly knowne to
be written in it, be true or right. And the writinges
of Byſhoppes, which haue bene, or be written, after
the confirmation of the Canon, may be found faulte
with (if it happen that any thing therein doo ſwarue
from the trueth) eyther by more wyſe ſpéeche of any
other, that is more expert in that matter: or by
the more graue Authoritie of other Biſhoppes,
or the wiſedome of menne better learned, or by
<pb facs="tcp:9597:14"/>
Councels, yea, and that the Councels them ſelues,
which are holden in particular Regions, or Prouinces,
muſt without any doubting, giue place, to the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of full Councels, which are made of the vniuerſall
Chriſtian world. Yea, &amp; that the full or generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
that are firſt holden, may be amended by them that
are holden afterwardes, when by any experience of
thinges, that thing that before was ſhut, is made open,
and that thing which lay hyd, is made knowne. And
this may be done, without any hautineſſe of ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pride, without any ſwelling throte of arrogancie,
without any contencion of ſpightfull enuie, with holie
humilitie, with Catholique peace, and with Chriſtian

               </p>
               <p>Nowe I thinke you wyll confeſſe, that your Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

the latter generall Councels, may amend the former.
He ſayth alſo, that there may be no doubt or controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
about the trueth of any thing, that is knowne to be

               <p>And as touching that inconuenience that you doo put

               <p>As for the reuealing of the trueth to the vniuerſall

muſt be Iudge, to trie the Spirites, whether they be of
God, or no? Onely the Church, (ſay you) or elſe they
ſhall not be tryed at all. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Saint <hi>Paule</hi> hath tolde you, that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,

And as touching the other poynt, Saint <hi>Austine</hi>

               <p>As golde by the toutch ſtone, ſo are the ſpirites tryed
by the Scripture. And euerie one that is ſkilfull in the

               <p>THe thirde Reaſon that mooueth you to thinke, that

<pb facs="tcp:9597:16"/>
contrarie, bothe to the decrée, and alſo to this thyrde
Reaſon of yours. For, to make a priuate interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is to make ſuch a one as differeth from the auncient

that no propheticall Scripture hath begynning in, or

For thus he wryteth. <hi>Propria interpretatione non fit, id

                  <note place="margin">Lyranus in. 2. Epi. Peter.</note>

               <p>I thinke your Fathers of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> will

it more Engliſh lyke: No propheticall Scripture

               <p>It ſéemeth to me, that bothe the wordes that goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and alſo the wordes that followe, doo enforce this
to be the meaning of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> For he ſayth thus.
We haue a firme and ſure propheticall ſpéeche: and you
doo well in that you doo giue good héede thereto, as vnto
a Candle that appeareth in a darke place, vntyl the day
may waxe cleare, and the day ſtarre may aryſe in your
heartes. But yet ſo, that you doo firſt knowe, that no
propheticall Scripture, is made by priuate or proper
impulſion. For propheſie hath not at any tyme bene
brought vnto vs by the wyll of men, but the holy men
of God haue ſpoken, as by the ſpirite of God, they haue
bene driuen, or vehementlie mooued to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>Let your fréendes conſider of this, and tell you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this may be allowed for Catholique or not. I do<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the raſhneſſe of ſuch as wyll ruſhe into the Scriptures,
without ſuch reuerance as is ſéemely, and take vppon
them to make interpretations after their owne fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.
I know that all that we can doo, and all the helpes
that we can haue, are lyttle enough, and therefore I
thinke it méete, for all men, to follow the rules that S.
<hi>Austine</hi> preſcribeth, writing, <hi>De Doctrina Chriſtiana.</hi>
And thus much may ſuffiſe to be ſayde, to your thirde

               <p>YOur fowrth Reaſon is, for that by appealing to the

to denie all vnwritten verities, which we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued

heare of vnwritten verities. And it ſéemeth that you
perſwade your ſelfe that you haue done it verie finely.
And therfore I haue named this Reaſon of yours Fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But yet a little to temper our follie (you will not ſay

of perſons, and the vnitie of ſubſtaunce in the Godhead,
by expreſſe Scriptures. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Nine verities we muſt prooue by Scriptures, which
are not (as you ſay) written in the Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Well, to ſtaie your wiſdome, I wyll (by Gods
mercifull aſſiſtance) doo what may be done in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And I hope to prooue as many of them, as be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be knowne to ſaluation: euen by plaine ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And the reſt. I hope I ſhall be able to prooue,
in ſuch ſort as the Fathers haue prooued them, againſt
ſuch as haue at any tyme denied them. And firſt, I muſt
prooue, that in the Godhead, there be thrée diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and but one ſubſtaunce. This and the ſecond, that
is, that in Chriſte there be two diſtinct Natures, and
but one perſon: I thinke I ſhall eaſily prooue.</p>
               <p>The Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> hath written thus. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.
The Lord hath ſayde to my Lord,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> ſyt thou at my right

Lord ſhall ſend out of <hi>Sion,</hi> the Scepter of thy power,
<pb facs="tcp:9597:17"/>
beare thou rule in the myddes amongſt his enimies.
Thus much in the two firſt verſes. And in the fift verſe
he ſayth thus. The Lord at thy right hand, hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
euen Kinges in the day of his wrath.</p>
               <p>That the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> dyd in theſe verſes of this
<hi>Pſalme,</hi> ſpeake of the diuine Maieſtie, and of the ſecond
perſon Chriſt: it is manifeſted by that which <hi>S. Mathew</hi>
writeth in his twenty and two Chapt. <hi>Vos quid dicitis
de Chriſto? cuius filius eſt?</hi> What doo you ſay of Chriſte?
whoſe ſonne is he? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Lord. That is God the Father. Sayde to my
Lord. That is to God the Sonne. &amp;c. Héere haue we
two diſtincted perſons, the Father, and the Sonne. And
in the ſeconde verſe, he ſayth: The Lorde ſhall ſend
out of <hi>Sion,</hi> the Scepter of thy power, which is, the
worde of the Goſpell. And this Scepter was ſent out
of <hi>Sion</hi> by the holy Ghoſte, in the feaſt of Pentecoſte:
when he reſted vppon the Apoſtles, in the ſhape of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>rie
tongues deuided. So that héere we haue the thyrde
perſon, and ſo conſequently thrée diſtinct perſons. The
Father ſayth to the ſonne, ſit thou at my right hand. &amp;c.
And the holy Ghoſt ſendeth the word, which is the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the power of the Sonne out of <hi>Sion.</hi> And in the
fift verſe he ſayth. The Lorde at thy right hand, ſhall
wounde euen Kinges in the day of his wrath. Thus
ſpeaketh the diuine Maieſtie: God the Father, God the
Sonne, God the holy Ghoſte, one diuine Maieſtie: to
the Church of Chriſte hée re milytaunt vppon earth.
So haue we the vnitie, of the thrée diſtinct perſons in
the deitie. And Chriſte him ſelfe, expounding the firſt
verſe of this <hi>Pſalme</hi> to be ſpoken of him ſelfe, dooth a
warrant vs, that he béeing <hi>Dauids</hi> ſonne after the fleſh,
is neuertheleſſe <hi>Dauids</hi> Lorde, and therefore God.
And ſo bothe God and man, and yet but one Chriſte.

This might ſuffiſe to ſhewe, that theſe two verities
are not vnwritten, as you do terme them. But to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
you to the full: looke what S. <hi>Mathew</hi> hath written,
in the laſt Chapter, &amp; laſt words of his Goſpell: repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the wordes of our Sauiour, who ſayth thus there.
<hi>All power bothe in heauen and earth, is giuen vnto me.
Goe your way therfore, and teach all Nations, baptizing
them in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the
holy Ghoſt: teaching them to obſerue all thoſe thinges
that I haue commaunded you. And behold, I am with
you euerie day, euen to the ende of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Héere the man Chriſte, receyueth from the diuine
Maieſtie, all power, bothe in heauen and in earth: and
by that power he giueth commiſſion to his Apoſtles to
goe and teache all Nations, and to Baptize them in the
name of the Father, of the Sonne, &amp; of the holy Ghoſt.
So that héere againe we haue thrée diſtinct perſonnes:
and their vnitie, in giuing to Chriſte all power in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
and in earth: and the two natures, in one perſon
Chriſte, in that he receyueth all power in heauen and
in earth, and giueth commiſſion to his Apoſtles to teach
and baptize.</p>
               <p>If this will not ſatiſfie you: I refer you to that which
S. <hi>Austine</hi> hath written in his booke,<note place="margin">Tom. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>De Trinit.</hi> There
ſhall you finde proofe vpon proofe, that theſe verities are
not vnwritten.</p>
               <p>The thirde veritie that you ſay is vnwritten, is that
God the Father was neuer begotten. It ſéemeth that
you haue not read S. <hi>Peaules</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians:</hi>
for if you had, you muſt néedes haue ſéene, that this is
no vnwritten veritie. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> writeth thus. <hi>Huius

                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 3.</note> For this cauſe (ſayth S. <hi>Paule</hi>) doo I bowe

               <p>The fowrth veritie, that you ſay is not written, is
that the holy Ghoſt procéedeth bothe from the Father
and the Sonne, as from one fountayne. If you would
reade that which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath written: I thinke you
would not ſay that this veritie is vnwritten.<note place="margin">Iohn. 15. &amp;. 20.</note>

<hi>Haec cum dixiſſet, inſufflauit, &amp; dixit eis: Accipite ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

breathed vpon them, and he ſayde vnto them: Receyue
ye the holy Ghoſt. &amp;c. If breath may be ſayde, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede
from the perſon that breatheth: then may we ſay,
that it is written, that the holy Ghoſt procéedeth from
Chriſte, the ſonne of God, euen as it is written, that he
procéedeth from God the Father.</p>
               <p>I wyll be bolde therefore, without any more a doo, to
conclude, that theſe fowre verities, are not vnwritten,
but written in déede in the Canonicall Scriptures.</p>
               <p>The fift vnwritten verity, is the deſcending of Chriſt
into hell: this you muſt haue prooued by plaine wordes
of Scripture, the lacke whereof (as you ſay) hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
many, nowe a dayes to deny it flatly. I am none of
them that doo ſo deny it. But that he deſcended in ſuch
manner, as your Catholiques haue taught, and as it
hath bene ſet foorth in their Stage Playes, and in their
payntinges in glaſſe windowes, &amp; elſe where, I thinke
would be as harde a thing for you to prooue, any way,
as for vs to prooue by plaine wordes of Scripture, that
he dyd in déede deſcende into hell.</p>
               <p>I thinke you wyll graunt that the ſpéeche vſed in the

                  </gap> and not his

you wyll not deny to doo) we ſhall eaſily prooue, euen by
plaine wordes of the Scripture, that Chriſte deſcended
into hell.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in the thirde Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note>
ſayth thus. <hi>Quia et Chriſtus ſemel pro peccatis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus
eſt, iuſtus pro iniuſtis: vt nos offeret Deo, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus

qui in carcere erant ſpiritibus veniens, praedicauit. &amp;c.</hi>
For euen Chriſte (ſayth Saint <hi>Peter</hi>) dyd once dye for
ſinnes, the iuſte for the vniuſte, that he might offer
vs vnto God: mortified in the fleſhe indéede, but quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
in the ſpirite, in which ſpirite, comming to thoſe
ſpirites that were in priſon: he dyd preach vnto them.
Nowe, I thinke you wyll ſay, that I haue prooued by
plaine words of Scripture, that Chriſte deſcended into
hell.</p>
               <p>But howe great a matter were it, If this might
not be prooued by any playne Scripture: ſéeing the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Créede (vſed in your Maſſe) maketh no mencion
of it.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Damaſus,</hi> that was Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> 360. yéeres
alter Chriſtes aſcencion, when <hi>Iulianus</hi> the Apoſtata
was Emperour, hath in his Créede no worde of it.
And yet he concludeth his Creede with theſe wordes.
<hi>Haec lege,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ieroni. Tom. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>haec crede, haec retine, huic fidei animam tuam

That is: Reade theſe wordes, beléeue them, holde
them faſte, yoake thy ſoule to this Faith: and thou ſhalt
<pb facs="tcp:9597:19"/>
obtayne of Chriſte, bothe life and reward.</p>
               <p>I note this, becauſe I ſée that you ſhoote at this

               <p>Your ſixt vnwritten veritie, is the cuſtome of
Baptizinge Infauntes. For this, I néede not to
wryte much.<note place="margin">Mark. 10.</note> Our Sauiour Chriſte hath ſayde: Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
little Chyldren to come to me, and forbidde them

               <p>Your other thrée whyes are ſcarce worthy the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering.
Why ſhould we kéepe the Sunday now at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and not the Saturday? Why ſhould we not abſtaine
now ſtyll, like <hi>Iewes,</hi> from ſtrangled meates, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

all the thrée Créedes. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe whyes, ſhall be aunſwered with

being Lordes of the Sabaoth, chuſe for
their Sabaoth, one daye in ſeuen, euen that daye,
the obſeruing whereof, they ſhall ſée to ſerue beſt for
theyr owne edification? And why did the Apoſtles
(as it maye be gathered, by that which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
hath written in his Reuelation)<note place="margin">Apoc. 1.</note> chuſe the firſt daye
of the wéeke to be theyr Sabaoth, and not the laſte?
And why doo you not remember that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> dooth

as are Meates and Drinckes,<note place="margin">Collo. 2.</note> Feſtiuall dayes, and
<pb facs="tcp:9597:20"/>
new Moones: which were but ſhadowes of thinges to
come? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And to your ſecond why, I ſay that the Apoſtles ſaw,
that it was neceſſarie for the tyme, to forbydde thoſe
Chriſtians, that then lately had bene Heathen men: to
ſéede vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrangled or blood. And néeded not to abrogate
it afterwarde,<note place="margin">Acts. 15.</note> when they were further inſtructed, and
knew how to vſe the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lybertie without offence.
A man might meruayle, why any wiſe man, would
mooue ſuch a why as this.</p>
               <p>Your thirde, &amp; laſt why, may be fully aunſwered with
theſe wordes. Becauſe there is no thing in thoſe thrée
Créedes: that may not eaſily be prooued by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And thus are all your whyes aunſwered.</p>
               <p>But, doo you not marke, howe theſe bedlem Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
would ſhake the foundation of our Chriſtian

Church hath ſet foorth (as infallibly true) and to

Whereby, it is manifeſt that he erred, either in the firſt

               <p>If you wyll take paines in reading the Hiſtories; you

both they and we may ſubmit our ſelues, to that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which they, by theyr reuerende ſearching, ſhall
finde in the Scriptures. As for the fortie places of
Scripture that the <hi>Arrians</hi> brought, for the defence of

of God) to ſet foorth plainly in theyr true meaning, and
to withſtand the <hi>Arrians</hi> (without the helpe of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique

Scripture, that they bring more then we can bring for
the trueth.</p>
               <p>And we ſay, as S. <hi>Austine</hi> ſayth: that the Scriptures
to myſſe vnderſtanded, and myſſe applied, are the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
bowe, to ſhoote out theyr owne venemous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.
And as <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſayth: They are the ſhéepes
cloathing, which the Woolfe dooth ſhrowde her ſelfe
in in &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Yea, and we confeſſe, that the Diuell him ſelfe, dyd
alleadge ſcripture againſt our ſauiour Chriſte, and dyd
applie it as rightlie as <hi>Bonifacius</hi> the eight did, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had one day ſhewed him ſelf in his <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi>
that is,<note place="margin">Luke. 22.</note> his Popely attyre, and the next day in the robes

heere are two ſwordes.</p>
               <p>Another of your Popes, ſetting his foote vppon the

Upon the Aſpe and Baſiliſke, ſhalt thou walke,
and vpon the Lyon and Dragon ſhalt thou treade. And
ſurely, as often as theſe wreſters of the Scriptures, doo
ſpeake vnto vs, the Diuell dooth (as <hi>Vincentius</hi> ſayth)
ſpeake by theyr mouthes. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But héere I leaue your <hi>Vincentius</hi> and you together,
tyll at ſome more leyſure. I may reade him ouer. I can
not thinke that hée dooth handle that place of <hi>Mathewe,</hi>
ſo groſely,<note place="margin">Math. 4.</note> as you would make vs beléeue that he dooth.
But though he doo, the matter is not great. For there
is none that hath any ſence or féeling, in the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Scriptures: but the ſame may eaſily ſée, that
when our ſauiour Chriſte ſayde. <hi>Non tentabis Dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Deum tuum:</hi> Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God:
He had a farre other meaning, then that which you
woulde make vs beléeue that <hi>Vincentius</hi> dooth gather of
theſe wordes. Yea, Athens I dyd firſt write this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
I haue read ouer <hi>Vincentius,</hi> and haue founde that

you clap in the necke of it, one ſentence of S.

in all trueth: therfore the ſame holy Ghoſt muſt néedes
be, and remayne ſtyll in that Church, which agréeeth
with the Church of the Apoſtles onely in name, and is
no more lyke the Apoſtles Church in doctrine and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
then blacke is lyke to whyte, and God is lyke the
Diuell.</p>
               <p>The Wiſe man ſayth,<note place="margin">Sap. 4.</note> that Wiſedome wyll not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a malicious ſoule: neyther wyll ſhe dwell in a
body that is ſubiect to ſinnes. For the holy ſpirite of
Wiſedome, flyeth from deceite. &amp;c. And ſhall we thinke
that the holy Spirite of trueth hath bene, and wyll be
ſtyll amongſt ſuch a rabble of Popes, Cardinalles,
and other Catholiques, as your owne Hiſtories make
mencion of, that haue (beſides theyr beaſtly lyfe) made
decrées directlie, contrarie to Gods commaundements?
Yea, ſhall we thinke that the Spirite of Chriſte, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
amongſt thoſe Catholiques, that at this day doo in
the twentie and fiue Seſſion of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi>
pronounce all ſuch accurſſed,<note place="margin">Tom. 4.</note> as doo ſhewe them ſelues,
eyther by doctrine or otherwiſe, to miſlyke with the
hauing of Images in Churches: ſeeing the ſame is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contrarie to the ſecond commaundement of God?
Shall we thinke that the holy ſpirite of God, dyd guide
thoſe your Catholique Fathers, when they dyd in the
ſame Seſſion, blanche the counterfeyting of Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
by an Image?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9597:24"/>
And thinke you that <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet, if he were now
lyuing,<note place="margin">Eſai. 59.</note> would allowe your applying of his wordes to
ſuch Catholiques, and to theyr doinges: ſéeing the ſame
Prophete dooth ſo earneſtly ſpeake againſt the making
of Images,<note place="margin">Eſai. 44.</note> ſcorning bothe them and theyr makers, and
plainly affyrming that they be good for nothing.</p>
               <p>The Scribes, the Phariſies, the high Prieſtes, and
Doctors of the lawe: might as well haue mainteyned,
theyr corrupt Doctrine and Traditions againſt Chriſt
and his Apoſtles (euen by thoſe words of <hi>Eſay,</hi> that you
applie for your purpoſe) as you may now by the ſame,
mayntaine all the corrupt Doctrines and Traditions
of your Catholiques. For they dyd then perſwade them
ſelues (as you doo now) that the promiſe was made to
them, &amp; could not but be perfourmed to them. And that
therfore Chriſte and his fauters, were Sciſmatiks and
méete to be excommunicated, as by them they were, in
déede, and as by you, we be now.</p>
               <p>But to our great and vnſpeakable comfort: our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Chriſte hath foretolde vs of this, ſaying. Theſe
wordes haue I ſpoken vnto you, that you ſhould not be
offended.<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.</note> They wyll excommunicate you, and the time
will come, wherin whoſoeuer ſhall hyll you, will think
that he dooth God good ſeruice.</p>
               <p>And that promiſe alſo, that you would ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ia in déede as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable to vs, as you would
haue men thinke that it is to you.</p>
               <p>We knowe that the Spirite of trueth departeth not
from Chriſte in his members the Church, the true and
vnfeyned Catholique Church. Neyther doo the wordes
that the heauenly Father put into the mouth of Chriſt,
his onely begotten Sonne, depart out of his mouth, the
true Catholique Church: and yet dare not we make
that Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iudge of that worde. For they were not
put into her mouth to that ende, that ſhée ſhould iudge
them: but that ſhée ſhould in all her doinges, be iudged
<pb facs="tcp:9597:24"/>
tryed, and directed by them.</p>
               <p>As ſottiſhe as you ſay, our opinion is: we are ſo farre
from holding, that euerie priuate man, may haue leaue
to be his owne Iudge in vnderſtanding the Scripture:
that we doo not graunt it to the beſt learned, but doo
leaue it to him, that béeing (with humilitie of minde)
ſought in the Scriptures, wyll be found there, yea, euen
by Crafts men, ſuch as was <hi>Peter,</hi> and his fellow fiſher
men. For he reſpecteth not mens perſons, nor Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And vnto them that ſo ſéeke him there (whether
they be many or fewe) he wyll open the ſence of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtading,
that they may vnderſtand, as much as he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
to be méete for them to vnderſtand. And ſuch as
haue that humble ſpirit, wyll not ſearch for, nor ſhewe
them ſelues deſtrous to knowe, any more.</p>
               <p>Well, now you conclude, vpon that which you ſay we
muſt néedes graunt, that is, that the Church is our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as Scripture ſayth. Well, I am glad that you are
now become a Scripture man. But I pray you, where
is that Scripture written, that ſayth, that your Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Church is our mother? It wyll be harde for you
to finde it.</p>
               <p>I wryte not this, as one that would deny the Church
that is the Spowſe of Chriſte, to be the mother of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
in that ſence that ſhe is the Spowſe of Chriſte:
But I write thus, to let you ſée, that I lyke not with
your manner of concluding vpon this, being once grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
That this mother of ours, that muſt néedes teach
all her chyldren, fyrſt to beléeue in God (for that faith
commeth by hearing) and alſo to know the Scriptures,
and is the pyller and ſure ſtay of trueth: muſt néedes be
the abſolute Iudge, and imperiall Schoolemiſtreſſe, to
teach vs all, how to beléeue in God, and to vnderſtande
the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>This geare hangeth together lyke Iermans lyps (as
the prouerbe is:) If you had ſayde thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9597:25"/>
The Church (being the ſpowſe of Chriſte) is our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and hath receyued commiſſion, from her huſband,
and our father Chriſt, to teach vs all thoſe things that
he hath taught and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded her to doo, &amp; to teach vs
his children to doo: wherfore, if we ſhall not hearken to
her, as to our chéefe Schoole miſtreſſe, vnder her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
and our father, ſo long as ſhe teacheth nothing, but that
which our father hath commaunded her to teach vs: we
ſhall diſpiſe him, becauſe we deſpiſe her, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.

               <p>If you had written thus: a man might haue made
ſome ſence of your wordes. But as you haue written,
you ſéeme to make the gray Mare the better Horſe. And
to ſpoyle our Father Chriſte of all his power: that
our Mother, his Wife, may not be found with out abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

               <p>I ſée not therfore, why I may not for this blindneſſe

which euen of Infants and ſucking Babes (as it were)

your owne turne, as a ſéely ſeducer, to maintaine (as
you doo all) ſo groſſe an opinion, béeing the forreſt in

héere you ſéeme to haue had one fling at Maiſter <hi>Foxe</hi>

in the Kéepers warrant, to haue conference with
you.</p>
               <p>I meruayle, howe Maiſter <hi>Turnebull</hi> eſcaped your
frumpping pen. But to conclude this aſſercion. Acquite
your ſelfe as well as you can, why you ſhould not all be
ſuſpected to be Antichriſtians, for as much as you doo
ſo ſtowtly mayntayne that man of ſinne, that ſetteth
<pb facs="tcp:9597:25"/>
vp himſelfe aboue all that is called God, and ſitteth in
the Temple of God, and boaſteth himſelfe, as though
he were God. Whome the Lord ſhall deſtroy, euen
with the breath of his mouthe. And that worde, that
you woulde haue to be iudged by your Antichriſtian
Churche: ſhall iudge bothe Antichriſte and his Church.
And that holy Ghoſt that came downe from Heauen,
vpon our Chriſtes Apoſtles, hath remayned, and dooth
ſtill remaine, and to the ende of the world ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
with his Catholique Church. That is, with
that Church, which beléeueth, holdeth, and proteſteth,
that Catholique Faith, that Ieſus Chriſte, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Apoſtles, to teach Catholiquely, to all Nations
and ſortes of peoples, in all parts of the world. Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that the holy Ghoſt ſhould alwayes remaine with

               <p>Thus, hauing firſt conſidered, the wordes of our
Sauiour, in ſending vs to the Scriptures, ſaying:
Searche the Scriptures. &amp;c. I haue founde that the

            <head>¶A breefe Aunſwer to Maiſter Pownds ſix Reaſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Written by Maiſter Henrie Trippe.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Aiſter Pownd: hauing peruſed the aunſwer of</hi>
Maiſter <hi>Crowly</hi> to your ſixe Reaſons, and finding
them ſufficiently aunſwered, by that godly Father,
(whome you thinke not to be worthy naming, as
you write to me:) I thought good rather to ſubſcribe to his aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer,
then to frame an other: How be it, to take from you the
aduauntage of glorying, which I thinke you will eaſily take a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt
me, as not being able to anſwere you: I wil breefly vrge
you in ſome pointes, wherein I ſée he hath ſpared you.</p>
            <p>And firſt I muſt néedes ſhew you, that all your Reaſons are
ſet one a tottering foundation: becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge her ſelfe is not
cleared of ſuſpition, for you take it as a thing grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, that the
Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> is the ſpowſe of Chriſt, which thing is in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie,
betwene vs. It had bene therfore an orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding,
to haue dealt firſt with that matter, and to haue put it
out of doubt, that your Reaſons in appealing to her iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
might haue bene the ſtronger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Pighius</hi> one of your owne
men confeſſeth, that the queſtion of the Church ought firſt to
be diſcidid. Thus you builde vpon a falſe principle, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
the force of your owne Reaſons, if happily they had
any force.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that which you bring out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fift of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
to prooue the ſcripture to be but witnes bearer to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth
and not the Iudge, though it haue ſome ſhew of reaſon, yet be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
well wayed, it well vaniſhe: for you imagine, becauſe you
finde the worde witneſſe, which is, <hi>Verbum forence:</hi> That by &amp;
by you muſt haue a pitched Court, &amp; a iudgement ſeate, where
ſhall be preſented many perſons, in ſeuerall places, one to be
witneſſe, an other to be Iudge, and perhaps ſome to be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſome to be condempned. But if you had wayed other
places of ſcripture, you ſhoulde haue ſéene that the holy Ghoſte
admitteth no ſuch ſtraight collctions: but framing his writing
to our capacitie: Uſeth ſome time one phraſe, and ſometime
an other. And you might haue found where the worde is
called a Iudge, as in the twelfth Chapter of the ſame Euange<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſt
<pb facs="tcp:9597:27"/>
               <hi>If any man heare my wordes, and beleeue them not, I iudge
him not. &amp;c. He that refuſeth me, and receyueth not my words
hath one that iudgeth him. The word that I haue ſpoken, ſhall
iudge him in the laſt day. For I haue not ſpoken of my ſelfe. &amp;c.</hi>
Now iudge you how ſoundly you haue gathered: it is witneſſe
therefore not Iudge, or not rather bothe a witneſſe &amp; a Iudge.
So might you reaſon of the diuerſe Metaphors giuen to the
word, which is called, Bread, Wine, Oile, Milke, Hony, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Raine, Light, Fyre, Golde, Siluer, Pearle, and Iron rod,
Scepter. Sword, &amp; the breath of the Lords mouth. Now were
it not a fonde Reaſon to gather, becauſe it is the breath of the
Lordes mouth: therfore it is no Sword, becauſe it is a ſword
or Iron rod: therfore it is not Gold. &amp;c. Or becauſe it is Gold,
therfore it is no bread, when as the holy Ghoſt hath ſet downe
thoſe ſundrie Metaphors, to expreſſe the power, dignitie, and
commoditie of the worde. But this is none of your ſix Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and therfore the weight of your cauſe lyeth not vpon it:
yet in pronouncing your Treatiſe before witneſſe, you gaue it
a greate force.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>¶Now to your Reaſons.</head>
               <p>YOur firſt Reaſon is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon a falſe principle: for you
imagine our church to be without a Miniſterie, to teach
and open the Scriptures, which is not ſo, yea rather your
Préeſtes are mute, and not onely that, but ye cloſe vp the booke
of God, &amp; will not let it be read, to make the Scriptures wholy
mute, leaſt they might bewray your corruptions. But God be
thanked, God hath opened the mouthes of many by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
to witnes agaynſt your errors, and ſo iudge you by the
ſame wordes, if you amend not.</p>
               <p>Your ſecond Reaſon pretendeth that the Scripture is verie
full of hard &amp; déepe myſteries: ſurely I confeſſe that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath his harde Miſteries and hard places, but hath it not
alſo his eaſie familyar doctrines? Is there not meate for all
Eſtates, Milke for babes, and ſtrong meate for good ſtomacks.
<pb facs="tcp:9597:27"/>
But I dare be bolde to auouch, that it was Sathans policie,
to robbe the people of the whole vſe of the Scriptures, vnder
pretence of ambiguitie, as though the whole Scriptures were
nothing elſe, but Rydles. As for the tryall of harde places, the
learned haue ſet downe two excellent rules, which I meruaile
you can reiect: the one is conference of Scripture with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the other is begging of wiſedome of God, who giueth it
to the Babes &amp; lyttle ones, and hydeth it from the wiſe in their
owne conceyte, who ſtumble at playne places, not being dyrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Gods ſpirite. But howſoeuer they labour to trie the
ſpirites, or whatſoeuer knowledge they doo attaine, they leaue
the ſuueraigntie of the iudgement to the word.</p>
               <p>Your thyrde Reaſon, grounded on Saint <hi>Peters</hi> teſtimony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
2. <hi>Peter.</hi> 1. Erreth, in not conſidering what the Apoſtle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
by priuate or not priuate, you ſéeme to place it in the
multytude of perſonnes, that giue the interpretation: but the
Apoſtle placeth it in the authoritie of the Author of the word.
Therefore, one Prophete ſpeaking in the Lordes name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truely ſent from the Lorde, is more to be beléeued, then
the whole packe of Préeſtes, reſiſting of mallice, or ignorance,
and they being many, are priuate, and one Prophete, being
but one, is not priuate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you pretende that euerie man may interprete the
Scriptures as he lyſteth, which is a falſe charge. But we
deſyre them, and allowe them to reade the Scriptures, and to
ſée whether thoſe thinges which we teache them, be ſo or no,
according to the example of the faithfull. <hi>Acts.</hi> 17. And as they
are commaunded by Chriſte, and the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>In your fowrth Reaſon, whyle you went about to temper
our pride, as you ſay, it ſéemeth you diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered your own wits,
in putting downe, ſo many things in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of vnwritten ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding are written: you aſke of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when I ſuppoſe ye meane y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> termes, brought in by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to expreſſe the doctrine more plainlie. As the word Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

Articles of faith, without warrant of ſcripture: ſhe was wont
to challenge ſome liberty in Ceremonies, &amp; indifferent things,
but you giue her power in Articles of faith.</p>
               <p>Your fift Reaſon ſtumbleth on the falſe principle, whereon
you grounded your firſt Reaſon, where you iudge no gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be in our Church, becauſe we giue the higheſt rule to
the worde, &amp; gouerne thereby, as by a moſt perfect lawe: after
which no newe Parliament néede to be called, to adde or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe
from it, but all men of all eſtates ought to put to theyr
hands to ſée it executed and kept: for the which cauſe (if they at
any tyme aſſemble) the worde written is theyr direction.</p>
               <p>Againſt your ſixt Reaſon, I auouch that he that appealeth to
the iudgement of the written worde, dooth yéelde a moſt
waighty Reaſon, to ratifie the ſending of the holy Ghoſt to his
Church, and that it is the ſpirite of trueth. For <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the Apoſtles
