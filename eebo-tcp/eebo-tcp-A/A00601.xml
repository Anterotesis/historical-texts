            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CATHOLIQVE

            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader:</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Few daies since a friend of mine
shewed me a Booke intituled a
<hi>Parallel,</hi> which I gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
from him, and perused
it the more readily, because I
well hoped, that some of the
<hi>Parallel</hi> lines would sute to our <hi>Meridian.</hi> But
taking an exact view of them, and applying them
to our <hi>Horizon,</hi> I found they were somewhat
short of our <hi>Eleuation:</hi> yet I discouered some
thing drawne in those <hi>Parallels,</hi> which I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:2019:3"/>
to be of some vse, to wit, the <hi>Lineal</hi> descent of
<hi>Arminius</hi> by the half bloud at least, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Pelagius;</hi>
for if it be confessed, that <hi>Arminius</hi> his pedegree
is lineally to be deriued from <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and that
<hi>Pelagius</hi> is the great <hi>Apenninus,</hi> from which the
diuided streames of corrupt doctrine flow; then
vndoubtedly the assertions of <hi>Arminius</hi> were
<hi>priùs damnatae, quàm natae</hi> were condemned
by the Catholique Christian Church, before they
were brought forth by <hi>Arminius:</hi> And we haue
the Prescription of the Christian world, for more
than 1200. yeares, against the new encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of these <hi>Sectaries.</hi> But me thinks I heare
thee ring in mine care the peale of the Poet,
<hi>Ole quid ad te?</hi> what is this to thee, or me? or to
the matter now on foot? It is not <hi>Arminius,</hi> but
an <hi>Appealer</hi> that troubles our Israel; <hi>Aemilius
fecit, plectetur Rutilius?</hi> Aemilius hath done
wrong, shall Rutilius beare the blame? Because
<hi>Arminius</hi> browseth vpon some branches of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianisme,</hi>
(a plant which our heauenly Father
neuer planted, and therefore in time must be roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
out) is it reason, the <hi>Appealer</hi> should be
muzled, or any mans teeth whet against him?
Verily, the <hi>Appealer</hi> disclaimes all kinred or affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb facs="tcp:2019:3"/>
with <hi>Arminius;</hi> nay he protesteth, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not the man; and if peraduenture some <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi>
or skilfull Genealogist may be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
him, yet certainly the vulgar reader is not.
I haue therefore thought it worth the paines, to
take the line of <hi>Pelagius</hi> which is already brought
downe to <hi>Arminius,</hi> and from <hi>Arminius</hi> to draw
it out euen to the <hi>Appealer,</hi> to the end, all, that
are not forestalled with preiudice, may see,
that both the <hi>Appealer,</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> hold their
errors <hi>in capite</hi> from <hi>Pelagius;</hi> And that at the
first the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and other parts receiued
the infection of pestilent doctrine from <hi>Britaine</hi>
by <hi>Pelagius;</hi> and now at last, that <hi>Britaine</hi> hath
receiued it from the <hi>Netherlands</hi> by <hi>Arminius:
Mater me genuit, eadem mox gignitur ex me.</hi>
But before I open the leaues of my Tablet, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
on the one side the <hi>Arminian,</hi> and on the
other, the <hi>Appealers Demi-Pelagianisme,</hi> I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Reader <hi>emunctae naris</hi> to follow the
sent of <hi>Arminianisme</hi> in the <hi>Appealers</hi> writings
by these foure steps.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. His sleight and dilute purgation from
the aspersion of <hi>Arminianisme.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2019:4"/>
2. His direct and professed defence of the
<hi>Arminians.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. His casting a blur vpon the <hi>Synod</hi> of
<hi>Dort</hi> that blasted them.</item>
               <item>4. His disparaging the Articles of <hi>Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hith,</hi>
which are <hi>è diametro</hi> opposite to
the tenets of <hi>Baro</hi> then, and since <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>To begin with his Purgation. Although in other
Criminations it may be an argument of Innocencie
not to be moued or any way sensible of them; yet
in the suspition of heresie,<note place="margin">Tacit. Maledicta si irascaris, agni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta videntur<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> spreta exolescunt.</note> no man (as saith <hi>Saint
Hierom)</hi> ought to be silent. Silence in such an
accusation is a crying sin, <hi>Et patientia digna om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni
impatientiâ,</hi> and patience it selfe is vnsuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Euery man is bound to professe his faith,
and consequently openly to discharge himselfe
from all imputation, especially of heresie, which
is so foule a crime, that the water of penitent
teares alone hath not bin thought enough to wash
it away. <hi>Scelus hoc exuritur igne;</hi> it hath bin
vsually burnt out with fire. It leaueth such a spot
in the conscience, that <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> conceiueth, The
blood of Martyrdome cannot fetch it out. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula
haec nec sanguine eluitur.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cyprian. epist.</note> Now whether
<pb facs="tcp:2019:4"/>
               <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> be heresie, I thinke it is a question
without question, vnlesse we will take vpon vs
to censure the censures of the ancient Church, and
most eminent Doctors thereof. <hi>S. Austin</hi> in his
booke <hi>de bono Perseuerantiae,</hi> is not content to
call it <hi>perniciosissimus error, c.</hi> 17. but c. 21. he

               <hi>Pelagiana haeresis.</hi> And that <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianisme</hi> is <hi>Pelagianisme,</hi> either in whole or in

writeth, that some in the <hi>Indies</hi> by often smelling
to <hi>Brasell,</hi> had Scorpions bred in their braines; so
the <hi>Appealer</hi> by frequent reading of <hi>Arminius</hi>
his bookes, and smelling to his exotecall positions,
had hatcht this Serpents brood in his braine. But
because hee denieth it, <hi>in verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> I
rest satisfied, that he neuer read <hi>Arminius:</hi> but
for ought he saith to the contrary, he may haue
heard all <hi>Arminius</hi> read ouer to him. Admit he
neuer read, or heard of <hi>Arminius,</hi> this will be no
<pb facs="tcp:2019:6"/>
good plea, if his doctrine be the doctrine of <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;
Legat</hi> that was burned in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for
an <hi>Arrian,</hi> might protest truly, that he neuer read
word in <hi>Arrius</hi> his bookes, as indeed he could not,
because <hi>Arrius</hi> his bookes, with himselfe, were
many hundred yeares ago eradicated, will the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealer</hi>
from thence conclude that <hi>Legat</hi> was no
<hi>Arrian?</hi> How many thousand <hi>Nestorians</hi> are
there in the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church at this day, who
yet neuer read word in <hi>Nestorius</hi> his writings;
not now extant (I take it) any where? I dare say,
<hi>Arminius</hi> himselfe neuer read word in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his workes, or the workes of the
<hi>Semipelagians,</hi> or <hi>Massilians,</hi> yet he cannot free
himselfe from the brand of Pelagianisme; neither
doth much desire to be acquitted from the note of
Semipelagianisme. Wee reade in the Ciuill Law,
<hi>Malitia supplet aetatem:</hi> Malice oftentimes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the defect of age. In like manner it is most
certaine, that where there is a propension in any
mans minde to any old heresie, the malice of the
Deuill easily supplyeth the want of reading: <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barel</hi>
hauing coyned, as he thought, a new distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
vnheard of before, was as proud of it, as euer
<hi>Pelius</hi> was of his new sword, saying, <hi>Ego hanc so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionem
<pb facs="tcp:2019:6"/>
primus inueni:</hi>
               <note place="margin">In comment. in poster. Analyt.</note> yet afterwards he inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously
confesseth, that perusing <hi>Gandauensis</hi> his
writings vpon the same argument, there he found
the selfe-same distinction; and it much reioyced
his heart, that so acute a Philosopher as <hi>Ganda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uensis,</hi>
should hit vpon the same conceit with him.
Might it not be so with the <hi>Appealer?</hi> might he
not first proiect the new plot of Predestination in
his owne head, and yet afterwards light vpon the
same in <hi>Arminius,</hi> or some of his schollers, and
exceedingly applaud either their conceit in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or his in theirs? For mine owne part I will
not vndertake to proue that the <hi>Appealer</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
an apprentice to <hi>Iames Harmin;</hi> but by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp both of their loomes, I will make it appeare
that they are both <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thou seest, Christian Reader, that his purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of himselfe needeth a defence, but his direct de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the <hi>Arminians</hi> much more needeth a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
No doubt the <hi>Appealer</hi> read often in the
Heathen Orator,<note place="margin">Cic. pro Sylla.</note> that it taints a man deepely once
to open his lips in the defence of such a man, whom
he suspecteth to be an enemie to the State: <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
contagio est sceleris si eum defendas
<pb facs="tcp:2019:7"/>
quem patriae obstrictum esse suspiceris.</hi> How
much more doth it blurre a mans reputation to
frame an apologie for him, whom King <hi>Iames</hi> of
blessed memory, vpon iust and religious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Declar. aduers. Vorstium.</note>
proclaimeth to be an enemie of God? Either
the <hi>Appealers</hi> charity, or his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science must needs
be very large, wherein such an offender finds a
Sanctuary,<note place="margin">

Neuer one man deceiued all men, neuer

harmelesse and free altogether from sowing seed of
dissention in the Church, as the ancient Christians

this allegation out of the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> The first is, That he faith the sense of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was there challenged as vnsound; for Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> [who in the name of the rest desired a fuller explication of the meaning of the Article, to preuent that mistaking, which is sithence fallen out in <hi>M.

                        <hi rend="sup">t</hi> Because this place of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is set in the fore-front both by the <hi>Appealer,</hi> and by <hi>Bertius,</hi> as a testimony, on which they most rely, and are most confident of; I will endeuour both fully to answer, and retort it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Besides those Answers, by which others haue rebated the edge of this Obiection: As * first, that this <hi>speech</hi> is <hi>conditionall; suppositiue,</hi> and <hi>not posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue;</hi> and therefore no more inferreth that a righteous
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2019:22"/>
man may fall from his righteousnesse, then those words of Saint <hi>Paul [If an Angell from heauen shall preach vnto you another Gospell, than that you receiued, let him be accursed]</hi> conclude, that an Angell from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen can preach another Gospell. Or the like of our Sauiour, <hi>[They shall doe signes and wonders to seduce, if it were possible, the Elect]</hi> therefore it is possible to seduce the elect; whereas indeed the contrary may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, euen from those words. Secondly, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet speaketh of him, that is righteous in his owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and before men; but not in the sight of God, such a man may <hi>fall away from his righteousnesse;</hi> but the question is, of a man regenerate, and truly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and such a one cannot <hi>turne away from his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi> Of this minde is Saint <hi>Gregory Moral. in Iob. lib. 34. cap. 13. They, who may be seduced in such sort, that they neuer returne againe, may seeme to lose the habit of sanctitie before the eyes of men,</hi> [sed eam ante oculos Dei nunquam habuerunt] <hi>but indeed they neuer had any holinesse in the sight of God.</hi> Thirdly, that the Prophet speakes here of <hi>actuall righteousnesse,</hi> which may be lost, and is lost, by the committing of any wilfull and grieuous sinne against conscience; not of <hi>habituall,</hi> which cannot be lost <hi>[if he doe that which is lawfull and right, Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. and 24. <hi>If he doth according to all the abominations the wicked man doth, all the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2019:23"/>
that he hath done shall not be remembred]</hi> here is not a word that importeth <hi>habituall</hi> righteousnesse, but meerely <hi>actuall;</hi> which, all sides confesse, may be lost. Besides these answers, I say further, that this Scripture no way tendeth to <hi>Bertius,</hi> or the <hi>Appealers</hi> purpose. For they should proue, that a iustified man may lose <hi>Euangelicall</hi> righteousnesse, or the righteousnesse of <hi>Faith;</hi> not <hi>Legall</hi> righteousnesse. Now it is euident, that the Prophet speaketh of <hi>Legall</hi> righteousnesse; First, by the pronoune <hi>(his) [if the righteous turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from (his) righteousnesse]</hi> that is, the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his owne workes, or his inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: not the imputed righteousnesse of Christ, for that is not his owne, <hi>Philip. 3. 9. That I may be found in him, not hauing mine owne righteousnesse, which is of the Law; but the righteousnesse, which is of God by faith.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the enumeration of particulars, <hi>vers.</hi> 6, 7, 8. 15, 16, 17. all which appertaine to <hi>Legall</hi> righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: <hi>If he hath not eaten vpon the mountaines, nor lift vp his eyes to the Idols of the house of Israel, nor come neare to a menstruous woman, and hath spoiled none by violence, and hath not giuen his money vpon vsury,</hi> &amp;c. Lastly, this argument may be retorted against the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries two wayes. First thus, If the difference of the Couenant betweene the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospell,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth especially in this, [that the righteousnesse requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2019:23"/>
by the one may be lost, but the righteousnesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by the other cannot be lost] then the argument from the losse of <hi>Legall</hi> righteousnesse to <hi>Euangelicall,</hi> is of no force, but to disproue our Aduersaries tenent: for that, which in this place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is affirmed of the one, may not be affirmed of the other: but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Couenant betweene the Law and the Gospel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth especially in this, [that the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse required by the one may be lost, but the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse promised by the other cannot be lost.] <hi>Ierem. 31. 31. 33. 34. Heb. 8. 8. Behold the dayes come that I will make a new Couenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Iudah; not according to the Couenant that I made with their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but this shall be my Couenant, which I will make with the house of Israel; I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, I will forgiue their iniquitie, and remember their sinne no more.</hi> And <hi>Ierem. 32. 40. I will make an euerlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to doe them good; but I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</hi> Secondly thus: If these words are spoken generally to the children of God, and belong to the elect as well as others, they cannot imply a totall, and finall falling away from righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, no not in the iudgement of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and <hi>Iesuites</hi> themselues, with whose Heifer the <hi>Appealer</hi>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:2019:24"/>
plowes: [For as the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> so <hi>Arminius</hi> himselfe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>[that a man that is elect, and predestinated to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, cannot fall finally, nor perish for euer:]</hi> But the words of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> are spoken generally vnto all, and belong to the very Elect; therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, in the words of the great Champion of Popery in generall, and of this particular touching the <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of Saints, Card. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Iustif. cap. 12. It is true that the predestinated or elected are in no danger of losing eternall life, and that the terrifying threats vsed by the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures, are to this end, to stirre vp the elect to watchfulnesse and diligence;</hi> motiues they are to, and meanes of perseuerance, not arguments at all to proue the <hi>Saints Apostasie.</hi>

                        <hi rend="sup">u</hi> To the place of <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 44. we answer; First, we ought not to ground any doctrine of faith vpon a meere parable, or allegory: because [as Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> in his booke, <hi>de Doctrinâ Christianâ,</hi> deliuereth it] <hi>All those points which belong to faith and manners, are plainly deliuered in the Scriptures.</hi> Secondly, we cannot a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gue strongly from corporall possession, or disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to spirituall: as a Lunaticke man, so a man pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the Deuill in body, may be yet in the state of grace in his soule; and in like manner, as a man that is cured of his frensie or lunacie, may be yet an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified man; so a man, out of whom the Deuill is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2019:24"/>
cast, from tormenting or possessing the body, may be yet an vnregenerate man, (although, I grant, our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our seldome, or neuer cured any mans body, but first he healed the soule, as some Interpreters haue obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) yet no necessary consequence can be drawn from the health or sicknesse of the body, to the health or sicknesse of the soule. Neither is it said here, that <hi>the vncleane spirit was cast out</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> nor by any other; but that <hi>he went out</hi> of himselfe, and <hi>returned againe;</hi> and therefore this possessed person can be no fit em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of a truly regenerated, and iustified man, out of whom the Deuil is powerfully cast out: and the party is no way vnder him, or in his power, <hi>but led by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, Rom.</hi> 8. and wholly deliuered from the power of Satan. Thirdly, the meaning of the Parable is (as appeareth by our Sauiours application) that as the latter state of that man, [out of whom the <hi>Deuill</hi> first <hi>departed,</hi> and afterward <hi>returned with seuen worse than himselfe]</hi> was worse than the former, so it should be with the wicked <hi>Iewes,</hi> out of whom the vncleane spirit had gone out, for feare of the <hi>Law,</hi> but now was returned againe vnto them through their refusall of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and <hi>despiting the Spirit of Grace.</hi> Thus Saint <hi>Hilary, Ierome,</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi> expound the Parable; and their Exposition is euidently grounded vpon our Sauiours words, <hi>vers. 45. Euen so shall it be also vnto
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2019:25"/>
this wicked generation.</hi> As it is particularly applied by our Sauiour to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> so it may be to any Nation, out of which the <hi>vncleane spirit departeth for a while,</hi> or is driuen away by the preaching of the Gospell, if it be empty of good workes, and giuen to the pleasures of this world; like the lodging of the <hi>vncleane spirit, which he found empty, swept, and garnished.</hi> The <hi>vncleane spirit will enter with seuen worse,</hi> that is, the <hi>Gospell</hi> shall be taken away from them, and the <hi>Kingdome of Grace,</hi> for the abuse of it; and they shall be brought into worse bondage of the Deuill, then before: according to Saint <hi>Peter 2 Epist. 2. 20. If after they haue escaped the pollution of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, they are againe intangled therein and ouercome, the latter end shall be worse with them than the beginning: for it had beene better for them, not to haue knowne the way of righteousnesse, than after they haue knowne it, to turne away from the holy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement deliuered vnto them.</hi> This was the case of the Kingdome of <hi>Congo,</hi> which for a time embraced the <hi>Gospell,</hi> but afterwards perceiuing that it restrained their carnall libertie, and no way permitted pluralitie of wiues, they cast off the yoke of Christ, and enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themselues againe to Satan. But it is not so with those that are truly regenerate, for to them <hi>his yoke is easie, and his burthen light.</hi> Lastly, this obiection may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2019:25"/>
be retorted against the Aduersaries thus;</p>
                     <p>This Parable is meant of a <hi>wicked ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> Matth. 12. 45. <hi>an euill, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous generation,</hi> vers. 39. <hi>a generation of vipers,</hi> vers. 34. such as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises</hi> were, who in this Parable are reproued by our Sauiour.</p>
                     <p>But the regenerate children of God are not a <hi>wicked, adulterous,</hi> or <hi>viperous generation, but a chosen generation, a royall Priest-hood, an holy nation, a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9.</p>
                     <p>Therefore this Parable is not meant of the regenerate children of God.</p>

ioy, while they thriue and gaine by it; but when there ariseth trouble and persecution for the Word, they are offended, and fall away: but those who ground their faith vpon the promises of a better life, their <hi>faith like gold, (1 Pet. 1. 7.) being tried in the fire, is made much more precious, and found vnto praise, and honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, at the appearing of Iesus Christ, beleeuing with ioy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable, and full of glory, receiuing the end of their faith, the saluation of their soules, vers.</hi> 8. Their faith differeth from the faith of Hypocrites, and Temporizers, in the cause and kinde; their ioy in the degree; and both in the continuance. Lastly, this obiection may be retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against the Aduersarie: First thus;</p>
                     <p>They, who are compared vnto the <hi>good ground,</hi> are not meant here by stony ground:</p>
                     <p>But truely regenerate Christians and beleeuers, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 23. are compared to <hi>good ground;</hi>

with the fruits of righteousnesse, Philip.</hi> 1. 9, 11. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the consequence is not good, from a remission of some degree of charitie, to the amission of the habit of it: The Apostles themselues, as they were not so strong in their faith, so neither so hot in their loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Sauiour at his Passion, as before. Their faith was shaken in that fearfull storme of temptation; their confidence was small, or none in appearance, in their owne sense: for in saying <hi>[we trusted, it had beene hee that should haue redeemed Israel, Luke 24.]</hi> they imply, that his death had loosned the Anker of their hope, and that both their heart and faith failed them for the time, their loue also <hi>waxed cold,</hi> if not freezed, when they <hi>fled from him, and forsooke him.</hi> Yet no learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine euer affirmed, that their loue to our Sauiour was quite lost; for as he loued them, so they loued him to the end. Thirdly, this argument may be retorted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Aduersaries thus:</p>
                     <p>If Christ doth here put a difference betweene those that are truly faithfull, and hypocrites, in this; that the one <hi>(Hypocrites</hi> to wit) should in the latter dayes and perillous times <hi>be offended, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, wax cold in charity,</hi> but the other (the truly faithfull) should <hi>continue to the end,</hi> then this place maketh not for, but <pb n="38" facs="tcp:2019:28"/>

                     <p>But Christ in this place puts a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between those that are truly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and hypocrites, in this; that the one <hi>(Hypocrites</hi> to wit) should in the latter daies and perillous times be <hi>offended, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and wax cold in charity, vers.</hi> 10, 11, 12. but the other (the truly faithfull) should <hi>continue to the end,</hi> vers. 13.</p>

 thereof.

Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thus:</p>
                     <p>That feare, which God promiseth to put into the hearts of true beleeuers, to this end,
 <pb n="41" facs="tcp:2019:29"/>
that they may not fall away from him, is a certaine meanes to preserue true beleeuers in the faith, (else God should faile in his end.)</p>

                     <p>Therefore the feare, here inioyned, is a certaine meanes to preserue true beleeuers in the faith: and consequently a strong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the perseuerance of Saints in faith and grace; as it is vrged by Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> in his booke <hi>de Perseuer.

sometimes taken for the saith which we beleeue, that is, the word of faith, or doctrine of the Gospell, as <hi>Galath. 1. 23. Now preacheth the faith, which once he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, Rom. 10. 8. This is the word of faith, which we preach: the hearing of faith, Galat. 3. 2. A great company of the Priests were obedient to the faith, Act.</hi> 6. 7.

Giuing heed to seducing spirits, and doctrine of deuils. Faith</hi> opposed to error, and doctrine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, is the true <hi>doctrine of faith,</hi> which we beleeue and preach. Sometimes the word <hi>(faith)</hi> is taken in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> for the faith by which we beleeue; that is, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace, or habit of faith: as <hi>Rom. 3. 28.

Being iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by faith, we haue peace with God.</hi> This distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not new coyned by <hi>nouelizing Puritans,</hi> but stamped by the <hi>ancient Fathers,</hi> and goes for current among the <hi>Schoole-men.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth booke of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> chap. 2. deliuers it in these very termes, <hi>There is a difference betweene the faith, quae

those among the <hi>Galathians,</hi> who went about to ioyne <hi>Iudaisme</hi> with <hi>Christianisme, Legall righteousnesse</hi> with <hi>Euangelicall:</hi> these the Apostle shewes cannot stand together. For the one consisteth in the <hi>perfect fulfilling of the Law, Rom.</hi> 10. 5. the other in <hi>forgiuenesse of sinnes, Rom.</hi> 4. 7. The proper meaning therefore of the words is, that whosoeuer seekes for iustification by the <hi>Law,</hi> that is, the workes of the <hi>Law,</hi> is <hi>fallen from grace,</hi> that is, hath lost his claime by the couenant of grace, or is excluded from all hope of obtaining mercy and grace; for such a one is become a <hi>debtor to the whole Law,</hi> that is, cannot bee iustified, to wit, by the couenant of workes, vnlesse hee fulfill the <hi>whole Law,</hi> which no man is able to doe. Secondly, Grace is sometime ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a reward of free gift, and so it is opposed to merit; sometime it is taken for supernaturall habits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, putting a man in grace and fauour with God, or making him gratious, and so it is opposed to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; sometime it is taken for the doctrine of free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes by Christ, or couenant of grace, and so it is opposed to the <hi>Law,</hi> or couenant of works: and that it is taken in the last sense in this place, is euident by the antecedents, and consequents, and the very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the <hi>Law</hi> in this fourth verse, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.

would haue it, yet the Text maketh nothing for them; for it is not said, that the <hi>Galathians</hi> fell from grace totally, or finally; although in that particular error of theirs, in retaining the Legall ceremonies, and vrging Circumcision, they in effect, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ouerthrew a maine doctrine of the Gospel, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching iustification by faith in Christ. Lastly, this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection may be retorted against the Aduersarie, thus:</p>
                     <p>Whosoeuer teach, and beleeue iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on by the Law, or inherent righteousnesse, are fallen from grace, and refuted by this text of the Apostle.</p>

                     <p>Or thus:</p>

                     <p>Those, whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> speakes of, are dogs and swine, vers. 22.</p>

                        <hi rend="sup">e</hi> To the place alledged, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. we answer: First, though the regenerate, and iustified mans estate be certaine, yet is it certaine by the vse of such meanes as God hath appointed; whereof spirituall watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2019:37"/>
and care, to which the <hi>Apostle</hi> here exhorteth, is a principall. The Apostles estate was certaine, for <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>Luke 10. 20. Reioyce, because your names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heauen.</hi> And <hi>Iohn 17. 12. Those that thou gauest me, I haue kept, and none of them is lost, but the sonne of perdition.</hi> Yet he commandeth them <hi>to watch and pray, that they enter not into temptation, Matth.</hi> 26. 41. And he prescribeth a forme of prayer to be vsed by them, and vs, continually, <hi>[Lead vs not into temptation] Mat.</hi> 6. 13. The souldiers, and passengers estate, who were in the ship with <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 27. 24. was safe, and sure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>God had giuen Saint</hi> Paul <hi>all them that sailed with him:</hi> Yet were they to vse the helpe of the shipmen to saue their liues, and vnlesse they had so done, they had perished, <hi>vers. 31. Except these abide in the ship, yee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saued.</hi> Secondly, the Apostles words are to be noted, who saith not, <hi>Let him that standeth,</hi> but, <hi>let him that thinketh he standeth.</hi> A man may thinke hee standeth, though indeed he standeth not; as those that killed the Apostles, <hi>did thinke that they did God good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, Iohn</hi> 16. 2. The <hi>Pharisie</hi> thought that he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iustified, than the <hi>Publican,</hi> yet he was not. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thought he had done a worke acceptable to God, and aduantagious to the true Church, when he perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Saints, and made hauocke of the Church. The heart of man is deceitfull aboue all things, as it

deceiueth others, so sometimes our selues also. Wee may conceiue that we are highly in Gods fauour, and a great way toward heauen, when yet indeed we are cast backe, or stand at a stay. It is therefore a speciall point of wisdome, to examine our spirituall estate, and proue whether we are in the faith, or no; that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we stand indeed, or thinke onely that we stand: for he that thinketh only that he standeth, and hath no sure footing, nor ground of his perswasion, may fall, and that irrecouerably. Thirdly, He that standeth may fall, yet not totally, or finally. A man may fall, and yet not bee hurt by his fall; a man may be hurt, and that dangerously, by a fall, and yet not die of that hurt; <note n="*" place="margin"> Though he fall, he shall not be vtterl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, this Obiection may be retorted against the Aduersarie, thus:</p>
                     <p>None of those, whom God preserues from being ouercome, in temptation, can fall total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or finally.</p>

heed lest they fall, are such, whom God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues from being ouercome in temptation; <hi>in the next verse,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13.</p>
                     <p>But God is faithfull, who will not suffer you to be tempted aboue that you are able: but wil with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to beare it.</p>

Hee was a type of Christ, a pen-man of the holy Ghost; God threatned grieuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to scourge him for his sinnes, yet promised withall neuer quite to cast him off. His fall, I confesse, was grieuous, but his repentance in his booke of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher sheweth that <hi>the seed of God</hi> still remained in him, as it doth in all the <hi>children of God, 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 9.

of Generall Councels) the Appealer (howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
by distinguishing of points fundamentall, and
accessory) endeuoureth to difference his opinion
from the Church of Rome, and reconcile it to the
Article; yet in truth he faileth in both. For first, the
Church of Rome holdeth all doctrines <hi>de fide,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by the Church, to be necessary to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and consequently, in the Appealers sense, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
points. In particular, she defineth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisions
of the Councell of Trent, in the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
points betweene vs, to be part of the Catholike
Faith, without which no man can be saued: <hi>Pius 4
in Bullâ super formâ juram. pag.</hi> 441. If therefore the
Appealer, maintaine, as hee doth, That Generall
Councells cannot erre in matters fundamentall, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2019:61"/>
necessary to saluation, he holdeth consequently, that
they cannot erre in matter <hi>de fide.</hi> Secondly, his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
cannot stand with the Article of our Church;
for the Article both supposeth, and proueth, that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Councels may erre, euen in points necessary
to saluation: It supposeth it, in those words <hi>[things
ordained of them, as necessary to salvation, haue neither
strength, nor authority, vnlesse, &amp;c.]</hi> For if Generall
Councels could not erre in things necessary to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we might in such things safely rely vpon their
authoritie without warrant of Scripture; which the
Article expressely denyeth. If Generall Councels may
iudge those things to be necessary to saluation, which
are not, (as the Article implyeth,) they may in like
manner iudge, those things not to bee necessary to
saluation, which are; and so erre bothe wayes in the
iudgement of points necessary, and fundamentall.
And verily the reason, annexed to the Article, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
as strongly, that Generall Councels may
erre in fundamentals, as in Accessory: the reason is,
because <hi>[Generall Councels are an Assembly of men,
whereof all are not gouerned by the Spirit, and Word of
God:</hi> Now they who are not gouerned by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Word of God, haue, and may erre euen in
points fundamentall; in asmuch as nothing can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
a man from fundamentall error, but the Spirit,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:2019:62"/>
and Word of God, whereby they are not gouerned,
as hath the Article. Notwithstanding all this iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and discord from the Article, I find some har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and concord in the close, Appeale pag. 147.

and weakly, That the Papists and wee agree in the
doctrine of merit <hi>(ex condigno)</hi> of condignitie. In his

not well stand with merit of <hi>congruity.</hi> Indeed hee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2019:65"/>
lasheth <hi>Vasques</hi> for that, wherein he differeth from
other Papists: but he retracteth not any where that
his owne sentence, namely, <hi>The eternall state of men

the Images of
Saints. c.</hi> 30. The
signe of the Crosse
workes miracles, not
out of a natural vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
that it hath, as
a figure, But as a
signe instituted of
GOD. Note, that
there are three won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
effects of the
crosse. 1. it terrifieth,
&amp; putteth deuils to
flight. 2. It driueth
away diseases, and
all euils. 3. It san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth
those things
vpon which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed.
The first
effect it hath from
three causes: from
the apprehension of
the deuill, the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of God. For
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2019:70"/>
the Deuill when he
seeth the Crosse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
remembreth,
that by the Crosse of
Christ, hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querd,
spoild, bound,
&amp; disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sited. Hence
it is, that he flyes
from the Crosse, as
a Dog doth from a
stone, or staffe, with
which he hath beene
strucke. Againe, the
Crosse hath a force
from the worke of
him, that worketh
with it, or vseth it;
after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as prayer hath.
For the signe of the
Crosse is a kinde of

<hi>That in her forme of Baptisme shee vseth the

That <hi>[else-where]</hi> is not to be found in
the forme of Baptisme, or els-where in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or practice of our Church.</p>
                  <p>2 He ascribeth operatiue Power, and <hi>experimented

<hi>That wee signe the flesh, that the soule may be

representation of Christs death vpon the Cross.
And more then this, I will not beleeue touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any efficacy of the signe of the Crosse, till I
finde by experience, that the Appealers signing
his lips with the signe of the Crosse, makes him

                  <p>In this point touching the Inuocation of Saints:
the Appealer differeth from the Church of England
in two particulars:
<list>
                        <item>1 That he maketh a difference betweene Angels,
(especially Guardians) and other Saints, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of Invocation: whereas the Church of
England putteth no such difference. But indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
forbiddeth the calling vpon Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
or Angells: <hi>Guardians,</hi> or <hi>others.</hi> And
the reasons they alledge are as strong against
the one, as the other.</item>
                        <item>2 The Appealer denyeth Inuocation of Saints,
onely vpon this ground; that the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted,
ordinarily, know not our affayres:
and consequently, he maketh Popish Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
idle and foolish, but not impious, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,
iniurious to God, and our Sauiour.
Whereas, the Church of England denyeth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of Saints vpon many other grounds;
and maketh it idolatrous, iniurious to Christ,
yea and blasphemous, as appeareth in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                  <p>In this point touching Extreme vnction, though
the Appealer doe not fully ioyne hands with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
and shake hands with the Church of England;
yet he maketh the vsing of Extreme vnction, or not
vsing it; the attributing of such effects, as the Church
of Rome erroniously (if not impiously) ascribeth to
it, or not attributing, a light matter, of no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
a thing indeed not to be obtruded vpon
the Church, as necessary: yet a thing, for ought that
he saith to the contrary, that may be not vnlawfully
vsed. Whereas the Church of England, or at least,
the most approued Writers in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
make the adding of any new Sacrament, and
attributing a diuine, &amp; spirituall effect vnto it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
commandement, or warrant of God's word,
to be a grieuous sinne, &amp; breach of the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.
And if it may haue such an effect, as to
wipe away all sinnes remaining in the sicke, our
Church should very much wrong the sicke not to
administer it to them. It concernes vs therefore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of any such effects, and finding that it hath
none, to condemne it, as not onely vnwarranted by
Scripture, but also derogatory to the efficacy of the
the other Sacraments, and Christs blood.</p>

First, as touching
that they will bee
termed vniuersall
Bishops, &amp; Heads
of all Christian

haue the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Gregory</hi>

them: who, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the Prince of pride,
Lucifers successor,
and the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Antichrist.
S. <hi>Bernard</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto, saith, What greater pride can there bee,
then that one man should preferre his owne iudgement
before the whole congregation, as if hee onely had the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2019:75"/>
Spirit of God? And <hi>Chrysostome</hi> pronounceth a terrible
sentence against them, affiriming plainly, that whosoeuer see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to be chiefe on earth, shall finde confusion in heauen:
and he, that striueth for the supremacy, shall not be reputed
among the Seruants of Christ.</p>

Bishop of Rome being by the order of Gods word none
other then the Bishop of that one See and Diocesse, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

ambition challenge not onely to be Head of all the Church

at a most dangerous course, of referring the
iudgement of controuersies of faith, that concerne
the whole Church, vnto the Pope. Which course,
if (with Master <hi>Mountagues</hi> good approbation) we
should take in the great controuersie touching the

               <hi>Whence I thus argue: First,</hi> In this forme
of oath the twelue new Articles, together with the
rest of the definitions of the Councell of Trent, are
made part of the Catholicke faith, (which except a
man beleeue faithfully, he cannot be saued:) but
neither these twelue new articles, nor any of them,
were held as true by the ancient Church, much lesse
as points fundamentall, and <hi>de fide;</hi> therefore the
present Church of Rome holdeth not the same intire
foundation of faith with the ancient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the ancient Church of Rome held

holdeth otherwise, [making vnwritten traditions
part of the foundation of faith, which, they say, is
built partly vpon the written, and partly vpon
the vnwritten word of God;] Therefore the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church of Rome holdeth not the same entire
foundation of faith, with the ancient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the articles of the Apostles Creed,
rightly expounded, and taken in the sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Holy Ghost, were the foundation of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2019:92"/>
ancient Churches faith; But the present Church of
Rome holdeth not the articles of the Apostles Creed
rightly expounded, and taken in the sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Holy Ghost; therefore the present
Church of Rome holdeth not the same foundation
with the ancient Church.</p>
            <p>The proposition, or major, is not denied:
the assumption may bee euidently proued,
by instancing in some of the prime Articles.</p>
            <p>The first article <hi>[I beleeue in God]</hi> rightly
expounded, teacheth vs that we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our confidence in <hi>God,</hi> and him onely;
not vpon any <hi>Creature, Saint, or Angell;</hi> and
therefore not to call vpon them; the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is the Apostles, Rom. 10. <hi>How shall
they call on him, in whom they haue not beleeued?</hi>
this Article thus expounded, the present
Church of Rome beleeueth not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith in Iesus Christ,</hi> rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
signifieth <hi>affiance in Christ for salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or a <hi>relying vpon Christ, with an assured
perswasion for remission of sinnes, through his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and satisfaction.</hi> This interpretation of
<hi>faith in Christ,</hi> the present Church of Rome is
so farre from admitting,<note place="margin">Conc. Trid. Sess 6. can. 12.</note> that it accurseth all
those, who teach, the nature of <hi>justifying
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2019:93"/>
faith</hi> to consist in this <hi>affiance,</hi> or <hi>confidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>the Incarnation of Christ,</hi> rightly
expounded, implyeth, that <hi>Christ</hi> was once,
and but once made of a <hi>pure Virgin, a true and
perfect man like vnto vs in all things, sinne onely
excepted,</hi> Heb. 2. 17. &amp; 4. 15. And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Calcedon, in the fift Act against <hi>Euti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
accurseth all those, who deny, that <hi>Christ</hi>
retaineth still the properties of his <hi>humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
(such as the shape of man, proportion,
dimension, circumscription, &amp;c.) This ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
thus expounded, is not assented to by
the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> for the <hi>Romanists</hi> teach,
that <hi>Christ is made in the Sacrament by the Priest.</hi>
The learneder Iesuits are not content with
the <hi>adducing,</hi> or <hi>bringing</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> into <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bellar. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note>where he was not before; <hi>[for that,</hi>
say they, <hi>were onely a translocation, not a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation;

mutation,]</hi> but in expresse words maintaine
a new <hi>production of Christs body made of bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againe they teach, that</hi> Christs body in the
Sacrament, is whole in the whole, and wholy in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
part of the Host; <hi>which is impossible, if,
according to the definition of the</hi> Councell of
Calcedon, <hi>he retaine the properties of his</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2019:93"/>
nature; <hi>to wit, extension of parts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of limmes, distinction of members,
&amp;c. Whence I argue,</hi> They, who teach that
Christ hath a body inuisible, indiuisible, insensible,
impassible, ouerthrow the verity of his humane
nature, and consequently deny the article of his
Incarnation: But the Church of Rome teacheth
that Christ (in the Sacrament, <hi>to wit,)</hi> hath a
body inuisible, indiuisible, insensible, &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Church of Rome ouerthroweth the verity
of Christ his humane nature, and consequently, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
the article of his Incarnation. <hi>Fourthly, the
article of</hi> Christ his Ascension <hi>rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
importeth that Christ is so ascended
from the earth, that hee is not now vpon
earth, but is</hi> contained, <hi>(according to his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
presence, and humane nature)</hi> in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
<hi>Act. 3. 21. This article is not thus held
by the Church of Rome; for the</hi> Romanists
<hi>teach, that</hi> Christ euen according to his humane
nature, and bodily presence, is vpon earth in euery
Church, on euery Altar where the sacrifice of the
Masse is offered, besides priuate houses, to which
the Sacrament is caried: <hi>so that by this their
Doctrine,</hi> Christ <hi>is more vpon earth since</hi>
his Ascension, <hi>then before. Before</hi> his Ascension
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2019:94"/>
               <hi>he was onely in one Country, and at one
time, according to his bodily presence, but
in one particular place: but since his</hi> Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<note place="margin">Counc. Trent Sess. 13 ch. 1.</note>
               <hi>according to their</hi> beliefe, <hi>he is</hi> truely, real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and substantially <hi>in a million of places,</hi> viz.
<hi>euery where in their</hi> offertory, <hi>after the words
of</hi> Consecration: <hi>whence I argue.</hi> They who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
and teach, that Christ God &amp; man, according
to his bodily presence, is vpon earth since his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
into heauen, deny that he is contained in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and consequently ouerthrow the article of his
Ascension: But the Romanists beleeue and teach,
that Christ God and man, according to his bodily
presence, is vpon earth since his Ascension into
heauen; Therefore the Romanists deny that hee is
contained in heauen, and consequently ouerthrow
the article of his Ascension. <hi>The first propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or major, is grounded vpon the</hi> Angels
<hi>Argument, Mat.</hi> 28. 6. (He is not here, for he
is risen:) <hi>the testimony of S.</hi> Peter, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21.
(whom the heauens must containe:) <hi>S.</hi> Austins

earth, he was not in heauen; and now because hee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2019:94"/>
is in heauen, he is not therefore vpon earth.) <hi>If
Christs body could at the same time bee in
more places, the</hi> Angels <hi>argument were of no
force; for, (his existence in more places then
one at the same time being granted) he might
be risen, and in</hi> Ierusalem, <hi>and yet at the same
instant be there, where the Angell affirmeth
he was not, to wit, in the</hi> graue. <hi>If Christ may
be vpon earth in his body, and in heauen at
the same time, then is not he</hi> contained in the
Heauens; <hi>for it implieth a contradiction, that
his body should be contained in, and yet be
without the Heauens at the same time. If his
body may bee in more places then one at
once, then he might haue been at the instant
of his passion in the</hi> Sun, and Moon, &amp; vpon the
Crosse, <hi>which S.</hi> Augustine <hi>concludes to bee
absolutely impossible. And if</hi> Christ in his flesh
<hi>may be both in heauen and earth at the same
instant,</hi> Vigilius <hi>his reason hath no strength
at all, to wit,</hi> (because he is in heauen, therefore
he is not vpon earth.) <hi>To conclude, if it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that</hi> Christ his body <hi>should bee at the
same instant in heauen and vpon earth, as the</hi>
testimonies <hi>of the</hi> Angel, <hi>S.</hi> Peter, <hi>S.</hi> Augustine,
<hi>and</hi> Vigilius <hi>aboue alleadged, declare; and if
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2019:95"/>
all Papists teach,</hi> that Christs body, after words
of Consecration, is truely, really, and substantially
vpon earth handled with the hands, and eaten with
the mouthes of Communicants; <hi>they must needes
consequently deny his</hi> bodily presence, <hi>and</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the right hand of his Father in Heauen.
<hi>Fiftly, the article</hi> of the Catholike Church, <hi>right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expounded, signifieth</hi> the whole company of
Gods elect; <hi>which is the onely</hi> Catholike (inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
Church, <hi>wee beleeue, (for the</hi> visible
Church <hi>is an obiect of sense, and therefore
not properly an</hi> article of faith.) <hi>This true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the article, the Romanists are
so farre from admitting, that in the</hi> Councell
of Constance,<note place="margin">Cocl. histor. Bohemi. lib. 3.</note> 
               <hi>they condemned</hi> Iohn Husse <hi>of</hi>
heresie, <hi>for maintaining it. Whence I thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue:</hi>
They who make the visible Church to be the
catholike Church which wee beleeue, misbeleeue
the article touching the Catholike Church; But the
Romanists make the visible Church to be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church, which wee beleeue; Therefore the
Romanists misbeleeue the article touching the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Church.</p>
            <p>The first proposition, or major, is proued
by the words of the Apostle, 2 Cor. 5. 7. <hi>We
walke by faith, and not by sight.</hi> and Heb. 11. 1.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2019:95"/>
               <hi>Faith is the euidence of things not seene.</hi> The

them:</p>
            <p>They, who deny that a man is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that he is of the number of the elect,

            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2 Errour.</note> it is a dangerous errour, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
that the present Church of Rome hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the same foundation of Sacraments
with the Ancient Church. Which I proue,
first:</p>
            <p>They who maintain seuen Sacraments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called, hold not the same foundation
of Sacraments, with that church which held
but two onely:</p>
            <p>But the present church of Rome maintaines
seauen Sacraments properly so called, the
Ancient church of Rome held but two onely:
Therefore the present church of Rome hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not the same foundation of Sacraments,
with that church.</p>
            <p>The first proposition, or major, if it bee
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2019:96"/>
not euident in it selfe, may be thus confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
The fiue Sacraments which the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
adde, cannot be built vpon that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which beareth but two onely: therefore
those fiue Sacraments are built vpon another
different foundation, or vpon no foundation
at all. The second proposition or assumption
is generally proued by all Protestant writers
that handle this question, with whom the
Appealer professeth euery where to hold
faire quarter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I proue it thus;</p>
            <p>Whosoeuer maintaineth an error ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the nature of a Sacrament, holdeth not
the same foundation of Sacraments with the
Ancient church:</p>
            <p>But the present church of Rome maintaineth
an error ouerthrowing the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</p>
            <p>Therfore the present church of Rome holdeth
not the same foundation of Sacraments with
the Ancient church.</p>
            <p>The first proposition is euident in it selfe;
for nothing can be more fundamentall to a
Sacrament, then that which concernes the
nature and essence of a Sacrament; nothing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2019:97"/>
more destructiue, or euersiue then that,
which ouerthroweth the very essence, and
substance of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second proposition, is contained</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem
verbis, <hi>in expresse words in the articles
of religion of the Church of England, Artic.
28.</hi> Transubstantiation, or the change of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of bread and wine, <hi>[a doctrine</hi> de fide <hi>in
the Church of Rome, defined both by the
Councell of Lateran, and the Councell of
Trent]</hi> in the supper of the Lord, cannot be proued
by holy Writ, but it is repugnant to the plain words
of Scripture, ouerthroweth the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and hath giuen occasion to many superstitions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is proued thus:</p>
            <p>Whosoeuer holdeth an errour concerning
Christs ordinance, and institution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
erreth in the foundation of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and therein differeth from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church:</p>
            <p>But the present Church of Rome holdeth an
errour concerning Christs ordinance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Sacraments;</p>
            <p>Therefore the present Church of Rome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in the foundation of Sacraments, and
therein differeth from the ancient Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:2019:97"/>
The first proposition is cleare; for Christs
order and institution is the foundation of the
Sacraments, and therefore an error concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it must needs be fundamentall in point
of Sacrament. The second proposition or
assumption, is set downe in Article 30. <hi>Both
parts of the Sacrament by Christs ordinance and
commandement ought to be ministred to all christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
men alike;</hi> which assertion touching
Christs ordinance, the present Church of
Rome erroneously denieth, and defineth the
contrary in the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> and
<hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 Errour.</note> 
               <hi>it is a dangerous errour, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,</hi>
that the present church of Rome is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
from the ancient vndoubted church of
Christ. <hi>Which I proue. First thus,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatsoeuer Church hath most shamefully
gone from the Apostles, from Christ himselfe,
from the Primitiue and catholike church of
God, and hath vtterly forsaken the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
faith, is vndoubtedly diuerse from the
ancient true church of Christ;</p>
            <p>The present church of Rome hath most
shamefully gone from the Apostles, from
Christ himselfe, from the primitiue and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2019:98"/>
catholike church of God, and hath vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
the catholike faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore the present church of Rome is
vndoubtedly diuerse from the ancient true
church of Christ.</p>
            <p>The first proposition is most euident: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
proposition is verbatim in the Apology
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> part 5. ch. 16. Diu.
1. and part 6. ch. 22. Diuis. 2. This Apology
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it beareth the
name, so it hath euer beene accounted the
Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> When
it was first printed in the daies of Queene
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was commanded to bee had in
all Churches; and since was reprinted with
the like command to be had in euery Parish
Church in this Kingdome, in the yeare of
our Lord, 1611. by our late Soueraigne King
<hi>Iames,</hi> who<note n="*" place="margin">See the Preface to the King, pend by Bishop <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall,</hi> in the end.</note> gaue a <hi>most singular testimony and
approbation of Bishop</hi> Iewels <hi>workes, for the
most rare and admirable that haue beene written
in this last age of the world:</hi> and also gaue spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
direction to the late Archbishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> to appoint
some one<note n="*" place="margin">The life was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>D. F.</hi> then a Student in <hi>C. C. C.</hi>
               </note> to write his, the said Bishops
life in English, and prefixe it to his workes,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2019:98"/>
which accordingly is done in the last edition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I proue it, thus;</p>
            <p>Whatsoeuer Church is fallen away from
Christ his Kingdome and Doctrine, is not
the same with, but diuerse from the ancient
vndoubted church of Christ.</p>
            <p>The present church of Rome is fallen away
from Christ his Kingdome and Doctrine;</p>
            <p>Therefore the present church of Rome is not
the same with, but diuerse from the ancient
vndoubted church of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first proposition cannot bee denied;
the assumption is the Appealers,</hi> Appeale pag.
149. In Apostasie the Turke and Pope are both
interessed; both are departed away; whether wee
take that apostacie to bee a departing away from
Christ, and his Kingdome, and his Doctrine: or
whether wee vnderstand apostacie and defection
from the Romane Empire, &amp;c. <hi>page</hi> 150.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I proue it thus;</p>
            <p>No Church maintaining &amp; practising Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
can be the same with the ancient Church
that worshipped God in spirit and truth:</p>
            <p>The present Church of Rome maintaineth
and practiseth idolatry:</p>
            <p>Therefore the present Church of Rome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2019:99"/>
be the same with the ancient Church that
worshipped God in spirit and truth.</p>
            <p>The first proposition is the Apostles,
2 Cor. 6. 16. <hi>what agreement hath the Temple
of God with Idols?</hi> The assumption is proued
at large in the Homily against the perill of
Idolatry, confirmed to bee the Doctrine of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Artic. 35. <hi>The Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and by name the Homily (the second against
perill of idolatry) containeth godly and wholesome
doctrine.</hi> If godly and wholesome Doctrine,
then certainely true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4 Errour.</note> 
               <hi>it is a dangerous error to affirme,
as the Appealer doth, Answer to</hi> Gagge page
50. <hi>That the</hi> present Church of Rome remaineth
Christi Ecclesia et Sponsa. Christs Church and

Rome we doe not deny; but that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

Councell of</hi> Trent, <hi>holding the cursing and
accursed Canons of that Conuenticle, or
that the Papacy, that is, the Pope with his
Clergy and their adherents, are Christs

Protestant that euer for ought I know, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it.</hi> Iunius <hi>(whom he alleadgeth,</hi> Appeale,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2019:99"/>
               <hi>pag. 113. to this purpose) in his booke</hi> De

ad Ecclesiae definitionem pertinet, est Ecclesia. As
it hath that in it which belongs to the definition of
a Church, is a Church. <hi>Why doth the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
stop in the middle of a sentence? why
doth he not goe on to the full period? the
sentence is yet but lame, he hath put out but
the left legge, I will put out the right legge
for him, wherewith</hi> Iunius <hi>giues Popery a
kicke, and trips vp the Appealers heeles:</hi> Qud

dicimus, eo respectu Ecclesia non est, sed vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
atque corrupta Ecclesia &amp; ad interitum tendens;
But the Church of Rome as it hath a disease or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
growne to it, which we call the Papacy, in that
respect it is not the Church, but a vitiate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
church, and tending to ruine.</p>
            <p>Note here Reader, in the Appealers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of Popery a tricke of Popery, to cite
sentences by halfes, alleadging onely that
which in shew makes for them, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that which in truth makes against them.
The meaning of the whole sentence of <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
is cleare enough for vs, and against the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealer:
to wit, that the Church of Rome
so farre as it is Protestant, and holdeth some
fundamentall truths agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2019:100"/>
is a Church: but as it is Popish, and
addeth many errors to those truths, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
subuerting those very truths it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
it is no Church. Which I thus proue:</p>
            <p>No Spouse or true church of Christ is in
part or in whole that Antichrist, or whore of
Babylon:</p>
            <p>The present church of Rome, as it is taken
for the Papacy or Popish state thereof, is in
part (as the Appealer confesseth, <hi>Appeale</hi>
pag. 149.) or in whole, (as many<note n="*" place="margin">See be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Table, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. de Antichristo.</hi>
               </note> Pillars
of our Church haue taught,) that Antichrist,
or whore of Babylon;</p>
            <p>Therefore the present church of Rome, as it
is taken for the Papacy or popish state there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is no Spouse nor true church of christ.</p>
            <p>I haue heard that the Appealer in a late
conference (wherein this passage, on which
I haue so long insisted, was obiected against
him) should stand at this ward, answering
for himselfe, that these words <hi>[praesens Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia

firma semper constitit, &amp;c. &amp; manet

page 50.] were not his owne words, but
the words of <hi>Cassander.</hi> This his ward will
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2019:101"/>
not keepe off the blow. For first, he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
this sentence in approbation thereof,
and commendation of the Author: <hi>[mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
men,</hi> saith he, ibid. <hi>on both sides, confesse
this controuersy may cease:]</hi> [hee should haue
said, <hi>luke-warme men on both sides.]</hi> Secondly,
he resteth on this passage as being a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the Popish obiection concerning the
<hi>visibility of the Church.</hi> Thirdly, in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his booke, <hi>Appeale page</hi> 113. and 139.
and 140. he affirmeth in his owne words, as
much in effect, as he here coteth, <hi>linguâ Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manâ</hi>
out of <hi>Cassander,</hi> but <hi>fide Graecâ.</hi> His
words are, page 113. <hi>I am absolutely perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and shall be, till I see cause to the contrary, that
the church of Rome is a true, though not a sound
church of Christ, as well since as before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Trent; a part of the catholike, though not the
catholike church, which wee doe professe to beleeue
in our Creed: In essentialls and fundamentalls
they agree, holding one faith in one Lord.</hi> And
p. 139 <hi>Rome is and euer was a true church, since
it was a church.</hi> And page 140. <hi>the church of
Rome is a true church,</hi> ratione essentiae, <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a church, not a sound church euery way in
their Doctrine. Vt Marci Antonij de Dominis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipulum
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2019:101"/>
possis agnoscere:</hi> I know well the
mint where these new tenents were coined:
the Appealer shewes himselfe a tractable and
respectiue Prebend to his late Deane, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him <hi>pene ad aras,</hi> neere to the <hi>Romish
Altars.</hi> That his Deane, after his relapse into
Popery, in the last booke, containing his <hi>poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitendam
poenitentiam, et retractandam retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctationem,</hi>
his <hi>repentance</hi> to be <hi>repented of,</hi> and
<hi>retractation</hi> to bee <hi>retracted,</hi> renouncing the
true religion which he had defended, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<hi>to cleare the present church of Rome from the
imputation of heresie, because,</hi> as he saith, <hi>the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
and learneder Ministers of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
teach, that the church of Rome doth not erre
in any fundamentall articles of faith.</hi> In defectu
credendi haeresis est, non in excessu; haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
est censendus qui in fide deficit, aliquid
quod scriptum est non credendo; non is qui
in fide superabundat, plus quam scriptum
est credendo: <hi>Heresie consists in the defect, not
in the excesse of beleeuing; and he is an Heretike,
who is deficient in his faith, by not beleeuing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is written; not he that superabounds in
his faith by beleeuing more then is written.</hi> This
errour (as I am informed) spreads farre like
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2019:102"/>
a Gangreane, therefore most needfull it is it
be lookt to in time. It is true that the <hi>Church
of Rome</hi> holdeth, if not all, yet most of the
<hi>fundamentall</hi> and <hi>positiue articles</hi> with <hi>vs.</hi> It is
true also, that most of their errours are by
way of addition: Yet whosoeuer from hence
will conclude, that the Church of Rome is
not hereticall, or erreth not in any point ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to saluation, grossely mistaketh the
matter, as will appeare to any, whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not forestalled, by the demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these two conclusions.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>That</hi> Heresy <hi>or</hi> damnable Errour <hi>may be
as well by</hi> adding to, <hi>as</hi> taking from <hi>the</hi>
Orthodoxe faith.</p>
            <p>2 That the Church of Rome erreth not
onely in excesse, or beleeuing more
then is needfull, but also in defect and
beleeuing lesse.</p>
            <p>The first is thus demonstrated;</p>
            <p>Whatsoeuer errours are alike forbidden in
Scripture vnder the same punishment, are
alike damnable:</p>
            <p>Errors by adding to, and detracting from
the Orthodoxe faith, are alike forbidden in
Scripture vnder the same punishment;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:2019:102"/>
Therefore errours by adding to and detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from the Orthodoxe faith, are alike
damnable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The first proposition is cleare by it owne
light. The assumption or second propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is deliuered expresly in holy Scripture.
Deut.</hi> 42. Ye shall not adde vnto the words which
I command you, neither shall you diminish ought
from it. <hi>Proverb.</hi> 30. 5. 6. Euery word of God is
pure, adde thou not vnto his words, lest he reproue
thee. <hi>Galat.</hi> 1. 18. If we or an Angell from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
preach vnto you beside that which wee haue
preached vnto you, let him be accursed. <hi>Reuel.
22.</hi> 18. For I testifie vnto euery man that heareth
the words of the Prophesie of this Booke, If any
man shall adde vnto these things, God shall adde
vnto him the plagues that are written in this book.
And if any man shall take away from the words of
the booke of this Prophesie, God shall take away his
part out of the Booke of Life, and out of the holy
City, and from the things that are written in this
Booke.</p>
            <p>Secondly thus,</p>
            <p>Whatsoeuer things alike destroy the nature
of faith, are alike damnable:</p>
            <p>Errours by addition and detraction, alike
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2019:103"/>
destroy the nature of Faith;</p>
            <p>Therefore errors by addition and detraction
are alike damnable.</p>
            <p>The first proposition is vnquestionable.
The assumption I declare thus: <hi>Faith</hi> is of
the nature of a <hi>rule</hi> or certaine <hi>measure,</hi> to
which if any thing be added, or taken away,
<hi>it</hi> ceaseth to be that <hi>rule. Cùm credimus,</hi> saith
<hi>Tertullian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tertul. de Praescript. advers. Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. c. 8. c. 4.</note> 
               <hi>nihil desideramus ultra credere, prius
enim hoc credimus, non esse quod ultra credere, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beamus:
Fides in regulâ posita est; nihil ultra scire
est omnia scire.</hi> When we beleeue, we desire
to beleeue no more; for wee first beleeue
this, that there is nothing more we ought to
beleeue. Faith is contained in a rule: to know
nothing beyond it, is to know all things.
Virtue is in the meane, vice as well in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
as in the defect. In our body the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundance
of humours is as dangerous
as lacke of them; as many dye of Plethories,
as of Consumptions. A hand or foot, which
hath more fingers, or toes then ordinary, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
monstrous, as that which wanteth the
due number. To vse their owne similitude;
A foundation may be as well ouethrowne
by laying on it more then it will beare, as by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2019:103"/>
taking away that which is necessary to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the building. Thirdly, thus:</p>
            <p>The errours in faith and religion of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans,
Malchamites, Athenians, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
Ebionites, Nazarites, Quartadeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Manichees, and Nestorians, were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:</p>
            <p>But all these seuerall errours were errours of
addition;</p>
            <p>Therefore errours of Addition are damnable.</p>
            <p>The first proposition will not bee gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saied.
For all these <hi>errours</hi> are branded as <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall</hi>
or <hi>damnable,</hi> either by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi>
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or by the <hi>catholike christian
Church.</hi> The Assumption will appeare in the
suruay of those particular errors.</p>
            <p>

                  </gap>s. 6.</note>
               <hi>and consequently they beleeue not a</hi> justifying
faith, <hi>or</hi> justification <hi>by</hi> such a faith: <hi>nay</hi> they
condemne such a beleefe as heresy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they hold not the <hi>formall founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>faith:</hi> for albeit they beleeue the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
and some <hi>points</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> deduced out of
them, yet they beleeue them not for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,</hi>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2019:105"/>
them to bee thus receiued, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued.
They beleeue not <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
for <hi>themselues,</hi> but for the Popes sake:
that is, in effect, they beleeue <hi>Christ</hi> for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</hi>
Hence it is, that although God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
forbids all vice, and commands all
virtue,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 4. de Rom. Pont. c. 5. Sect. Quod.</note> yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>Si Papa erraret prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiendo

Ecclesia credere vitia esse bona, &amp; virtutes esse

the Pope should erre by commanding vice,
and forbidding virtue, (which is directly
contrary to the whole scope, and tenor of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

vice to be good, and virtue to be euill;
vnlesse shee will sin against conscience. But

            <p>The Church of Rome hath euer beene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome is and euer was a true
Church, since it was a Church;</p>
            <p>Therefore the true Church hath beene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p>The Appealer cannot inferre the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
vpon the premisses, vnlesse in his minor
or assumption he intend to make the Church
of Rome more then <hi>a true Church;</hi> hee must
make <hi>her the true Church,</hi> that is, not a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Church,</hi> but the <hi>Catholike,</hi> not a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but the whole. The minor should bee
thus altered, to make his syllogisme current.</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome hath euer beene vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible:</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome is the true Church;</p>
            <p>Therefore the true Church hath euer beene
visible.</p>
            <p>The syllogisme thus being set vpon his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2019:106"/>
true feet, any man may easily see the lame
leg; The Church of Rome is neither <hi>the true
Church,</hi> nor, as the Appealer confesseth, p. 140.
<hi>a sound member of the true Church.</hi> As for the
syllogisme made by the Appealer <hi>prout jacet
in terminis,</hi> vpon which he would haue <hi>his
friends and Informers to chew the cud, as they doe
after Lectures. p.</hi> 139. Hee deserueth himselfe
to be sent to the Vniuersity to chew the cud
after a Logique Lecture, and learne to make
a better syllogisme. For this his syllogisme
is peccant <hi>tam formâ quàm materiâ,</hi> in matter
and forme. To say nothing of mood and
figure, which the Appealer, in the mood he
was, little regarded; I say, (allowing that
there may be a lawfull <hi>expositorius syllogismus,</hi>
consisting of pure singulars, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in no mood) first there are foure termes at
least in this syllogisme, to wit, <hi>[The Church
of Rome, visible, the true Church, a true Church,]
the true Church, and a true Church,</hi> are not one.
Euery particular true Church is <hi>a true Church,</hi>
yet neither euery particular, nor any particular
Church is <hi>the true Catholike visible Church,</hi> of
which the question is propounded, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
by the Appealer. Againe, the <hi>minor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2019:106"/>
terminus</hi> is not in the conclusion; the <hi>minor
terminus</hi> is, <hi>[A true Church since it was a Church]</hi>
which if he had put in the conclusion entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as he ought by the rules of good syllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
his argument would haue proued ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Church of Rome hath euer been visible:</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome is and euer was a true
Church since it was a Church;</p>
            <p>Therefore a true church since it was a church
hath beene euer visible.</p>
            <p>Let the forme passe, enough of the huske;
we will now chew the graine, and come to
the matter of his syllogisme. First, were
both the propositions true, yet the argument
is fallacious: for the processe is <hi>ab ignotiori ad
notius,</hi> the worst kind of the beggarly
fallacy <hi>petitio Principii.</hi> The <hi>visibility</hi> of the
<hi>catholique Church</hi> is more knowne then the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi>
of any one member, be it the <hi>Church of
Rome:</hi> for the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> is <hi>visible</hi> and
knowne in all the parts and members, and
therefore must needs be more knowne then
any one member. Secondly, the major is
false, if it bee vnderstood in the Appealers
sense: for, during many <hi>schismes</hi> in the <hi>Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:2019:107"/>
and when the Pope sate at <hi>Auennian,</hi> and
not Rome, when diuers Popes were depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Councels for <hi>Schisme</hi> and <hi>Heresy,</hi> and
sometimes the Pope set vp by the Councels,
was deposed by the power of Princes, as
<hi>Amodius;</hi> and sometimes the Popes deposed
by Councels were reëstablished in their
Popedomes by the power of Princes, as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi>
the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> was not so <hi>visible,</hi>
as the Appealer would haue it. Thirdly, if
the Appealer vnderstand by the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>Rome</hi> (as his <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>informers,</hi> and all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
generally vnderstand it, and as hee
must, if he say any thing to the purpose.)
a <hi>Church</hi> in Rome, and the Popes territories,
or elsewhere, holding the present Romane
faith, which is set downe in the Councell of
Trent, both the major and minor are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
false. For neither was there any <hi>church</hi>
in the world, holding that <hi>faith, visible</hi> for
many hundred yeeres after Christ; neither
is the Church holding that erroneous faith a
true Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Howsoeuer, it may please God
in <hi>that Church</hi> (as hee did in the <hi>Churches</hi> of
