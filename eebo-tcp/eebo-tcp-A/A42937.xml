            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>BOoks,</hi> as <hi>Knives,</hi> are by the Learned eſteemed Adiaphorous; and it is by our applying of them, that they become either good or bad. Ill Stomachs convert the wholſomeſt Food to Poyſon; and what's deſign'd for Nouriſhments, through defect of our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, proves oftentimes pernicious, and helps to ſupport our Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>—Neither was it any deſign of mine, in what I wrote concerning the <hi>Turks,</hi> in my <hi>Ephemeris, Anno</hi> 1678. to bring them in [Prophetically] to deſtroy <hi>Christendom</hi> at this time, or that the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> ſhould go into <hi>Italy,</hi> pull down the Pope, and exalt himſelf in his room, ruine the Emperour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor yet to doom the Puiſſant <hi>French</hi>-King to Death, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this very year, or any other year: But my Book falling into ſome peoples hands, who, either out of prejudice to Me, have thus interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, or not underſtanding me aright, have nois'd me to have been the Praedictor or Propheſier of theſe amazing and amuſing matters.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, that, conſidering the notable and ſpreading Differences among Chriſtians, and an advance of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> to the great decay of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; as alſo, the ſober Remarks made thereof by ſome of the moſt Learned in our Nation, I did ſignifie my Fears of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> encroachment upon <hi>Christendom, Anno</hi> 1678<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in theſe words following:—<q>It is in <hi>Mundane Affairs</hi> as in a <hi>Watch,</hi> which when men would put out of order, they either ſtop the Ballance, or diſplace the Spring thereof: <hi>Religion</hi> is the Ballance or Spring of a Nation, the Soul of the Body-politick the whole World over; the true <hi>Spiritus Mundi;</hi> the <hi>Philoſophers Stone</hi> in Government; and without it, all Empire woul<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

How choice and curiouſly careful ought Nations, therefore, as well as Perſons, to be in the preſervation of their Religion!—<hi>Religio neglecta maximam Peſtem in Civitatem infert, omnium ſcelerum ſeneſtram aperit,</hi> ſaith a learned Author: Religion neglected, deſpiſed, or brought into contempt, brings the greateſt Plagues upon Kingdoms, Countreys, Cities and People, and opens a door to a Wickedneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Stars not only in this <hi>Year,</hi> (as you have been told) but in this <hi>Age,</hi> do ſeem to direct their Beams of Influence more particularly and perpendicularly upon Religious Perſons, Affairs, and Intereſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than in ſundry Ages paſt. I would enlarge upon this Theme a little, if I thought I might not give offence. And here, I think it not amiſs to mind the World of a Chronological miſtake, which I find in the Writings of that Learned man <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> concerning a Prediction of <hi>Albumazar,</hi> which he is pleas'd to urge againſt <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> 'Tis this, <hi>Albumazar</hi> wrote, That the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> ſhould continue but 1460 years; and yet (ſaith he) God be thanked, it lifteth it ſelf up, and ſhineth more and more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I could, and do earneſtly wiſh, That <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> as to this his Prediction were in the right, and <hi>Albumazar</hi> miſtaken; But <hi>Albumazar,</hi> from his Skill in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> underſtood that the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> firſt got ground God permitting it ſo to be, according to the courſe of ſecond cauſes) under the Regency of the Sun, whoſe great years are 1460. (<hi>Cardan</hi> ſays, 1462.) which ſaid number of years are not to be accounted from the Birth of our bleſſed Saviour, but from the time that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God) firſt promoted <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> by a Law; and that was above 300 years after Chriſt's Birth. For the Birth of Chriſt was but the Conception of Chriſtianity, and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was the happy Midwiſe of that Divine and Heavenly Production. So that the miſtake, you ſee, is not (yet) in <hi>Albumazar,</hi> (whatever it may) but in <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> who, I conceive, did not fully apprehend him. And if we ſhall add 1460 to 312. (the year wherein the Chriſtians were firſt own'd by a Law) the ſum will fall upon the year 1772 which clearly tell us, that we want 94. years of <hi>Albumazar</hi>'s intended time.</q>

               <q>
                  <hi>Spineus</hi> tells us, among other vain things, that the ☌ ♄ ♃, 1603. ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified the Deſtruction of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and Glory of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but we <hi>Christians</hi> have not ſo found it, but rather the contrary; for, as it is truly, though ſadly, obſerved by the Learned <hi>Glanvill,</hi>—Providence ſeems now, by glorious Succeſſes, to countenance the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and the Tyrant <hi>Ottoman</hi> ſpreads his Victorious Arms, and is fleſh'd in Tryumphs, vide <hi>Seaſonab.

Epiſtle to <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity,</hi>—That our <hi>Religion</hi> is ready to draw its laſt Breath, being ſtiſled and oppreſſed with the Vices and Impieties of a debauch'd and proſligate Age. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we conſider the great progreſs the <hi>Turks</hi> have made againſt <hi>Christendom</hi> theſe laſt 100 years, and obſerve therewith the preſent great Diviſion among Chriſtian Princes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and how the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> are diſtreſſed by that Potent Enemy,—we may (perhaps, without <hi>Astrology</hi>) be able to prefage,—That if they proceed for the next 100 years after the ſame manner, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumazar</hi> may be found to be truer than we would be willing to have him; and a <hi>Turkiſh Barbarity</hi> may come to be planted in the place of <hi>true Chriſtian Civility</hi> among us: which God of his Mercy avert.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And here, I cannot but crave leave to collect a few Lines from the Travels of the Worthy Dr. <hi>Edw. Brown,</hi> Son to that Univerſity of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the Author of <hi>Religio Medici, viz.</hi> in p 111. he writes,—<hi>A great part of</hi> upper-Hungary <hi>(through which I travell'd) had a different face from that of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>and from what they formerly had been. Some places had been burnt or plunder'd by the</hi> Turks <hi>and</hi> Tartars <hi>in the late Wars, and divers pay Contribution to them: ſo that many live warily and meanly, to be leſs noted, even in parts of the Countrey better provided; and under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, a great part of the People being of the</hi> Reformed Religion, <hi>are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch hard meaſure and fears, that they live in little content: and being of a ſtout and perſevering temper, they may in time become ſo deſperate, that if the</hi> Turk <hi>ſhould powerfully break in, 'tis probable they would not fight ſo heartily againſt him as in times paſt.</hi>—And in pag. 82. of the ſame Book, he writes, <hi>I am apt to think or fear, if he who putteth bounds to the Sea, and ſaith,</hi> Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further, <hi>doth not put a ſtop to their further Incurſions, they may probably obtain and conſerve a far larger Empire, and even all</hi> Europe <hi>to the</hi> Weſtern Ocean. <hi>Certain it is, they are not ſatisfied with their preſent bounds, and look beyond</hi> Hungaria; <hi>and I heard them ſay, We muſt in due time come to</hi> Beatch, (<hi>ſor ſo they call</hi> Vienna) <hi>and try our Fortunes again. At this day the</hi> Star <hi>and</hi> Half-Moon <hi>are above the</hi> Croſs <hi>upon the Steeple of the Cathedral-Church of St.</hi> Stephen, <hi>in the Emperours chief City,</hi> Vienna; <hi>and it griev'd me to ſee in all the Confines, a Croſs which our Heraulds dream not of, which is, a</hi> Croſs Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;—<hi>Whereby They, the Inhabitants, as they teſtifie their</hi> Chriſtianity, <hi>ſo they acknowledge the</hi> Turkiſh Power.</q> Thus far this ingenious Author.</p>

               <q>I know the learned <hi>Garenciers</hi> is of opinion that this Prophecy was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. But I am of belief, that if it intend any thing, it muſt be of far greater conſequence than any of the actions of that year could be: although I muſt allow, that <hi>Henry</hi> II<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sultan Solyman</hi> were then concern'd in each others Affairs. But <hi>H.</hi> II. had <hi>Gemini</hi> for his Horoſcope, a Sign not beholding the <hi>Palladium</hi> of the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Faith: A Monarch of <hi>France</hi> therefore, of the ſame <hi>Horoſcope</hi> with That, or in Trigonal Ray unto it, muſt be the Fulfiller of this ambiguous Prophecy. The former-quoted <hi>Spineus</hi> tells us, That there are yet two other Faiths to ſucceed <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> and the <hi>Moon:</hi> But ſo to write, is not <hi>Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> but <hi>Prophecy;</hi> there being no Rules in <hi>Aſtrology</hi> to countenance ſuch Praeſages. Howbeit, we have great cauſe to fear, that if the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould once more advance againſt <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> powerfully, (and it is not the Valiant and Fortunate <hi>Sobietski</hi> can always live to prevent them) the grand Eccleſiaſtical Differences among us will not be ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Papiſt</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> as between <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and the grave <hi>Mufti</hi> and <hi>Muſſulman</hi> may (to the ſorrow and loſs of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) vie it with the Venerable <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Cardinal.</hi>

               <q>And this poſſibility of enlarging the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Power in <hi>Europe,</hi> thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed from Natural and Political Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Influences of the Stars, and the grand Animoſities among Chriſtian Princes and Prelates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with the Univerſal, and (almoſt) remedileſs contempt of the Clergy, may reaſonably ſuggeſt unto us, that the Ark of God, even Chriſtianity it ſelf, is nearly ready to depart from our Tabernacles. God willnot always be mocked; and the true Worſhip and Adoration of his Name ſhall not for ever be profaned, contemned, deſpiſed. They are the words of <hi>Horace:</hi>—</q>

               <q>When men abridge God of his Honour, God will ſhorten them of their Happineſs, <hi>Omnia proſpera eveniunt colentibus Deos, adverſu ſupernenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>

ſaith <hi>Cicero. Thoſe People that have a Reverence for Religion and the Worſhip of God, are ever proſperous; but the neglecters thereof are always unhappy.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Religion</hi> alone, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> witneſſeth, that is the Ligature of all Communities, and Firmament of Laws: It is that which is the band of Families, and Foundation of Republick.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Let every Chriſtian, therefore, uſe all juſt means and ways to preſerve his Religion, and implore Heaven, that the <hi>Horned Moon</hi> in a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſence, may never be exalted above the <hi>Croſs,</hi> the <hi>Enſign of our Religion &amp; Salvation.—The alteration or ſhaking of Religion, is commonly the most deſperate Paroxiſm that can happen in a ſickly Empire,</hi> ſaith the learned Biſhop of <hi>Down.</hi> And once diſſolve the Snow of Religion, a great deal of dirty weather will infallibly follow, as the Divine <hi>Leontius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> wiſely obſerv'd, when he ſtrok'd his Reverend Silver Head.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Strive we then, I ſay, each of us in our proper place and ſphere, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> againſt the menaces of the Stars, and motion of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and in ſo doing, we ſhall be able to continue in the rightful poſſeſſions of our minds, Honours and Fortunes: and as being born and bred Chriſtians, we may hope ſo to die, leaving our Poſterity to inherit what our Progenitors, by Gods Providence, and their great care and induſtry, had bequeath'd unto us.—Then ſhall we not need to be either afraid of the <hi>Turks</hi> Power, or yet of the Judgments inculcated to befal a wilful and obſtinate People, as mention'd in the <hi>Wiſdom of Solomon,</hi> chap. 18. 14, 15, 16.—<hi>For whilſt all things were in quiet ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and that the Night was in the midſt of her ſwift courſe, thine Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Word leap'd down from Heaven out of thy Royal Throne, as a fierce man of War, into the midſt of a Land of Deſtruction, and brought thine unfeigned Command, as a ſharp Sword; and standing up, fill'd all things with Death.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far in my <hi>Ephemeris</hi> 1678. which is all that I can remember I ever wrote concerning my fears of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, concerning the great <hi>French</hi> Monarch, that I may compur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate my ſelf from any imprudent Predictions relating to him, as ſome have idly &amp; falſly boaſted me to have wrote, I ſhall here relate all again I have particularly mentioned of Him,—<hi>viz.</hi> Having ſome years ſince had a ſcribling Conteſt with an <hi>Anti-Scorpiouiſt,</hi> in defence of that my Theme, in my <hi>Oblequium Rationabile,</hi> I produc'd this Illuſtrious Princes Nativity, as it was printed by <hi>Morinus</hi> in his <hi>Aſtrologia Gallica,</hi> (that in the <hi>Collectio Geniturarum</hi> being wrong timed, as I have ſince prov'd to near 8 degrees in the <hi>Horoſcope</hi>) and thence I wrote as follows,—<q>Let (my Antagoniſt) but conſider how he hath blaſted perſons of the higheſt Honour and Grandeur, and of the moſt glorious Fame in the World, by this his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and invidious charge exhibited againſt <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and all perſons born
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101860:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
under it, and then tell me whether he believes he hath done well in ſo doing: But Kings and Princes are his <hi>Tennis-balls,</hi> (as well as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Stars) and muſt be toſs'd and ſtruck up and down as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bandy them with his black and envious Racket, I mean his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Pen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in an <hi>Encomium</hi> on the Caeleſtial <hi>Scorpio,</hi> printed in the ſame Book, I ſubjoyn'd theſe Verſes,—<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>The Glorious Chriſtian King when he was born,</l>
               <l>(The Heavens themſelves intending Him no ſcorn)</l>
               <l>Had <hi>SCORPIO</hi> ariſing in the Eaſt;</l>
               <l>And who in War was e'r more fully blest?</l>
               <l>Whoe'r had greater Honour by His <hi>Word?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Whoe'r did nobler Actions with a <hi>Sword?</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>And this is all that I have ſaid about this glorious Prince's future Deſtiny, which I am ſure muſt needs excuſe me from having any hand in predicting His Deſtruction by a Stab, or otherwiſe, in this, or any other year. There are ſome indeed among us, that are a little too impudent with the Honour and Grandeur of Princes; and will be ſo ſtill, unleſs <hi>Aſtrology</hi> have a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſer that underſtands it: <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> being to be ſpoken in Figures as fully and as miſchievouſly (to ſome Peoples underſtandings at leaſt) as in words at length.</p>
            <p>But if, after all this, it ſhould be expected that I give my opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſent matters before us, and that I may beg leave to do it without offence;—then I ſhall preſume to ſay, (notwithſtanding all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtick Prophets or Prophecies to the contrary) That,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Grand <hi>Ottoman</hi> Power will, either upon Articles or Conditions, in ſhort time retreat, or elſe be forced back. The Illuſtrious and Victorious <hi>Sobietski</hi> is yet alive; and God grant him long to live, to the Honour of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and terrour of its Enemies.</item>
               <item>2. The <hi>French</hi> Monarch (if <hi>Morinus</hi>'s Scheme of his Glorious Birth be true) will (according to Starry Edicts) out-live his preſent Menaces either by Death or a Stab, (which of late are dropt from fooliſh and Enthuſiaſtick Pens) and ſurvive yet (by Gods bleſſing) many years, advancing in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Honour and Grandeur, to the ſucceſs and ſupport of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>This I thought fit to publiſh now, (1.) to excuſe my ſelf from any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Propheſie, or of being Author of any of thoſe clamorous Reports, or yet any way privy to them, until their obtruſion upon the World. And (2.) to vindicate <hi>Astrology</hi> it ſelf from the Infamy that ſuch ſpurious Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages muſt neceſſarily bring upon it.</p>
