            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been the uſuall cuſtom of Epiſtles, to give the Reader an account of the cauſes that brought thoſe writings into publick, that were onely intended for a private Cloſet; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it has been at the requeſt of friends, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with mingled truth and deſigne, to prae-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the judgments of many, by telling the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome, ſo to preſerve their modeſty as much in the pretence, as they could have done in the concealment of their Writings.</p>
            <p>Though I cannot pretend ſuch a cauſe as this, I can yet free my ſelf from that vanity that others would avoid, by aſſuring the Reader, I had not ſtock of confidence enough to ſhew theſe things privately to many friends, much leſſe to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with enough, to make them publick to all

indifferent perſons, had not the deſires of the Book-ſeller prevail'd with me: to whoſe civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities I believ'd my ſelf ſo far engag'd, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him nothing that he thought a kindneſſe, which could not be ſeverely prejudiciall to my ſelf: Yet I doubted not, but that I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the cenſures of many; which, upon the granted principle of prejudice, appear'd not a reaſonable argument to prevail with me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his requeſt, ſince the ſame ſhould as well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me not to live, for life and converſation r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nder man in Print more than letters can do; and is made more publick by that way, than he can be by this. His life is mingled more with his defects and paſſions, than probably his writings are; and whether they are equall, or exceed others, need not trouble him that writes: He may be ſatisfied, the production of retir'd hours are the beſt of himſelf. I had no great reaſon then to deny his requeſt, that imagin'd he ask'd his own advantage, when he deſired nothing that I believed contrary to mine.</p>
            <p>Yet I wiſh that it may ſo far give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all, that they may as little repent the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the ſeverall ſubjects which here make one bundle, there is not any of them that have not layn by me theſe many years (two or three copies of Verſes onely excepted); and had been wholly perhaps laid aſide, but for the reaſons given, applying my ſelf now to more ſerious ſtudies, according to the ſeverall ſeaſons of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing age, as the earth produces various fruits to the different ſeaſons of the year. By this ſhort account of time, the Reader may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in what clowdy days my Muſe ſpread her wings, as little contributing to her flying a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heighth, as to ſhew a juſt ſubject: He that moſt deſerv'd it was moſt deni'd it (as he was indeed his right in all things) either from private fear, or publick power, though I equall not the crime of faint thoughts in paſſive ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to the guilt of bold profeſſion in publick action. 'Tis now to be hop'd, that the praiſes of our Prince, who ſo much merits it, may be received willingly by all, ſince nothing can be ſaid of him, that has not been done by him; and man's largeſt invention has been excell'd by His actions, there being nothing capable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet I ſhould a little be disſatisfied with my ſelf to appear publick in his praiſe, juſt when he was viſibly reſtoring to power, did not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Panegyrick vindicate the writing of it, and, beſides my affirmation, aſſure the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, It was written when the King deſerved the Praiſe as much as now, but ſeparated farther from the Power; which was about three years ſince, when I was Priſoner in <hi>Windſor-Castle,</hi> being the beſt diverſion I could then find for my own condition; to think, how great his Vertues were for whom I ſuffered, though in ſo ſmall a meaſure compar'd to his own, that I rather bluſh at it, than believe it meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</p>

Nor ſhall I envy him that writes better, by being much in love, if he muſt purchaſe the advantage of Wit by the loſſe of Freedom.</p>
            <p>For the Tranſlations, the Authors have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready received thoſe Characters from the world, that they need none of mine, eſpecially <hi>Virgil,</hi> of whoſe works I have onely publiſh'd this one Book, that lay finiſhed by me; not judging it convenient to perfect thoſe other Books of his <hi>Aeneid's,</hi> which I have rudely gone through, having long ſince laid aſide all deſignes of that nature; and this little of it rather grew publick from accident, than deſigne, the Mingle it had with my private Papers, was the greateſt cauſe, that it received its ſhare in the publick Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Statius,</hi> he had received commendations enough, had he been alone commended by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> in his 7 <hi>Satyr.</hi> but <hi>Alexand. ab Alex.</hi> alſo, <hi>lib.</hi> 6 <hi>ch.</hi> 14. relates, that he thrice received the Victor's Lawrell in the publick reading of his Verſes, and was once vanquiſh'd; as unjuſtly

The <hi>Annotations</hi> may in ſome places perhaps be judged too large; yet, had I omitted any thing, it is probable that the ſame perſons would have cenſur'd me for ignorance: ſo that being equally ſenſible of theſe extreams, I judg'd it the teſtimony of the greateſt modeſty, By omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting little, to ſhew my ſelf not at all ſecure in the world's opinion.</p>

'Tis juſt this child ſhould be in all your heir,</l>

                     <l>Had you left unrewarded his pure flame,</l>
                     <l>You muſt have loſt your ſhare in time and fame.</l>
                     <l>So in the Chaos before Love made way,</l>
                     <l>Both Time and Glory unregarded lay.</l>

From <hi>Janus</hi> the gates of any private houſe were called <hi>Januae.</hi> The gates of Janus were ſhut but twice before the time of Auguſtus. <hi>Janum Quirinum ſemel atque iterum a condita Vrbe memorium ante ſuam clauſum, in multò bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viore temporis ſpatio, terrâ marique pace partâ, ter cluſit,</hi> ſaith Suetonius, <hi>in Auguſto, c.</hi> 22. That is, The Temple of Janus, from the beginning of the City, was but twice ſhut before the reign of Auguſtus; but in his reign, in a much leſſer ſpace, he being at peace with all the world, it was thrice ſhut. The firſt time it was ſhut was in the reign of Numa Pompilius; The ſecond, when T. Manlius Torquatus, and Attilius Balbus were Conſuls: but it was opened again (as many ſay) the ſame year, and ſo continued till Auguſtus. Perhaps <hi>Rome</hi>'s not enjoying peace was not the leaſt cauſe of its proſperity. For in troublous times, mens endeavours commonly are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the publick ſafety, but purſue private intereſts in times of peace and idleneſſe; ſo hard it is to make true ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of God's greateſt bleſſings.
