            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOt longe agoo, after I had translated into our englysshe tonge the boke called <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men sanítatís Salerni,</hi> I hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned being at London to talke with the printer, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of hym, what he thought, and how he lyked the same boke: and he answered, that in his mynde: it was a boke moche necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, and very profitable for them that toke good hede to the holsome teachynges, and warely folowed the same. And this moche farther he added therto, that so farforthe as euer he coude here, it is of euery man ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well accepted and allowed. And I sayd, I pray god it may do good, and that is all that I desyre. And thus in talkynge of one boke and of an other, he came forthe and sayde: that if I wolde take so moche peyne as to translate into Inglysshe the boke that is intitled <hi>De medicina guaiací, et morbo gallico</hi> wryten by that great clerke of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne Vlrich Hutten knyght, I shulde, sayd he, do a verye good dede.

For I doubt whether I may come to the clere vnderstonding ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of or not: It is in ernest a matter straunge inough to translate, not onely for the names of herbes and other diuers thynges therin conteyned, but also for the phrase and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent style.

Let them be seene and looked vppon, of the sober and lerned phisitions: but lette them leaue the dregges and spices of this other sorte.

And agayne they wyl not beleue me, that there is a seruant of my faders, which with .iii. certayne herbes sodden in wyne, hath healed a mannes brayne panne broken to peces: and many sore and euyl woundes hath he heled with a few herbis of our own growynge, sodden in wyne or water, and that within .x. or .xii. dayes, withoute any feare of feuer. But this they thynke a vile medicine / sayinge it is not done after theyr canons. And the same thynge do they iudge of Guaiacum, whose nature and power / howe clerely they vnderstonde, and what maner wordes they vse to haue of hit: we may perceyue by the answere of a certaine noble phisition, not nowe yonge, that he shulde begynne to practise / but of extreme age, that it is very lykely he fealeth Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen, Mesuen, and other authors of phisike,

This phisition whan I was wrytinge these thynges, and takyng my iourney from Frankeford, wher he was wrytynge his recipe, was asked of a certayne frende of myn, what he thought of Guaiacum: I haue not sene it / sayd he, but what so euer it be, the weyght / the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the sauour, must be consydered in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>¶Furdermore it is well knowen, that they that are of a sanguine qualite of body, may abyde hunger better and longer than the colerike. For in the sanguine the humoures that nourysshe the body / are more abundant and plenteous, the hete is temperate and lesse burnynge: for it is myngsed with moy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sture to make hit slacker, but in these other, all thynges are thynne and drye, and nedy of humours.

Fyrste it came frome Spagnola in to Spayne, and than other nations about them sought what profite wolde come ther of. And whan they vnderstode, that many had vsed hit prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, the Sicilians receyued it.

               </gap> to thynke, but that our region and men be very apte vnto this medicine? Which thing Paulus Ricius, a phisition of pure iugement and hygh erudition, approueth, and more ouer affirmeth / that he knoweth by playne experience, that no nation is more apte vnto this dyete. But if we had not sene some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored vnto helthe through the helpe of Guaiacum, and nowe shuld begyn to proue hit: we oughte not beleue, that god were so moche sette agaynste vs, that he wolde ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kepe this helthfull medicine from vs, or defraude vs of the vertue therof, seynge it was brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Spagnola into Spayn, and had the same vertue there, whiche hit hadde at home: excepte a man wylle saye, that Guaiacum disdayneth to be caried vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs / his nature fyrste not chaunged, or whan it commeth to the Germaynes / that than it suffreth that great and myghtye po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and strengthe of his, to be taken from hym, and no where els. And it is playnely knowen, that with vs his helpe is very pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent, and peraduenture more presente than els where.

hunger and thurste. And more ouer as our bodyes abunde with heate, so are they very stronge. For after the iudgement of Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, they that inhabite cold countreys, haue moche naturall hete in them, and they that haue moche heate, for the most parte are of great strength. And bycause the Almayns vse moche eatyng and drinkyng, Ricius the phisition was demaunded of late, what he thought, whether it were best to remyt som what vnto them in this cure of this skle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der &amp; thinne dyete, &amp; he sayde: No by sayncte mary, not thus moche, but rather handle them the strayter, lette these great belyes vsed in eatynge and drynkynge be dryuen to a moche thynner dyete than these thynne and leane Italians. And he shewed me hym selfe, that he hadde punysshed with hunger one of these fatte felowes .x. dayes lenger than he ought to haue done, bicause he wold haue nothynge remayne that myght let the operation of Guaiacum.</p>
            <p>¶This thyng and suche other I do glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reherse by Ricius, and do make often mention of Stromer, that suche as shall rede this boke may vnderstond, whom I cal good and right phisitions, and how vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy I thynke these comen tormenters of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dignite of this title &amp; name.

straunge countreyes may knowe, that Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynie hath some good and excellent phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. And that I delyte as moche in the lernynge and amitie of them, that be good and well lerned, as I hate these vnlerned and foole hardy felowes, whiche after they be for theyr moneye ones made doctours, streyght professe / that they can reuyue the deed, and restore lyfe to them that are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed. But I wylle retourne vnto these .ij. whiche be of an other sorte, of the whiche two Stromer, whan I asked hym the laste yere a medicine to pourge me with, sayde / Do not vexe thy stomake with medicines in this age of thyn / in whiche nature is able of her selfe to do all thynges moche better. For as he is very scarse in pourynge in of medicines / so bryngeth he all sycke people vnto a verye strayte rule of dyet. Wherfore whan he had taken in hande to cure one in the cytie of August after these wayes, and he said, that he feared, leste he coude not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyne hym selfe from women: Seing than (saide he) thou haste decreed to dye, thou hast no nede of my helpe, &amp; so forsoke hym, and lefte him to his intemperancie.</p>

But on the other syde for so moche as in this cure done by Guaiacum, the sycke are greued with nothynge more, than with thurste it is thought, that the syck may worse absteyne from drynke in somer than in wynter. wherfore in Spayne, and where the heate is vehement, they durst not hytherto proue this experyment in the som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Furthermore in wynter (after the mynd of Alexander Aphrodisius) there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth on man through moche eatynge. (For than haue men moche better appetite thanne in other seasons) an humour called <hi>pituita,</hi> that is fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4539:39"/>
and kepte. These thynges we haue spoken as touchynge the tymes of feruente heate and feruent colde, and nowe we wyll speke of the other two seasons that be betwyxte bothe, of the whiche two, Autumne semeth the worste of bothe. For than is there great abundance of all maner syckenes, and the humours waxe worse and worse, bycause this tyme of the yere is vnegall and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order, alwayes chaungynge and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant / bryngyng in many kyndes of diseses. For as Celsus affirmeth, Autumne kylleth many a one.</p>
            <p>¶Furthermore the french pockes are very noyfull to the synowes, and the sayd author teacheth, that wynter and Autumpne be not mete nor apt tymes vnto medicines / for the resolution of the synowes. But these are the reasons of them that dispute generally and speake not onely of the vse of Guaiacu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore this I thynke, that sommer (at the lefte wayes in Asmayne) may be beste taken: but that is that parte of sommer / that begynneth whanne vere endeth, as in Maye, for than there is not here so moche heate, but the sycke maye well abyde and suffer thyrste: And in wynter the colde is very feruent, and lykewyse in vere and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4539:39"/>
the colde is sharper, than the sycke may abyde in this cure. For it is one of the chiefe poyntes for hym that is restored by Guaiacum, with all diligence to eschewe colde. And as for suche incommodities / as maye happen in the sommer, to the intente they may the lesse be feared, I haue spoken of before, and shall repete them agayne, whan place shall be. And neuer the lesse at this tyme I do affirme, that this drynke of Guaiacum dothe meruaylously stere vp the naturalle power and strengthe, and hath power and myghte to quycken and to make lusty the body / whiche for lacke of natural heate is weake and consumed: Which thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges if they were not as I haue sayde, and had not Hipocrates in a certayne place / if I well remembre me, sayde: that Vere and Autu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne are the most aptest times to let blod and minister medicines: verily the counsell of Celsus shuld than haue semed best, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che saythe: that <hi>Vere</hi> is the holso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest tyme to go to phisike / &amp; next vnto that wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that is ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry dangerous, &amp; Autumn mooste daungerous of all.</p>

Wherfore I thynke that he was of excellent wysedome (if any suche was) that feared in tymes passed, leste suche voluptuous and delycate lyfe shulde enter into Germanie: wherof (as euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may playnly see) spryngeth so moche pesty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and so many diseases: and ageyn per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, that they shulde lyue quietly / that coulde be contented to lacke suche pleasures and delyciousnes. For they that dresse oure herbes, &amp; lyue with them (as there be some trewe Germaynes yet remaynynge) they are of good helth and bodily lykynge: but they that be spyce fyngered, and belche sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom, and smelle all of cloues, and haue all theyr pleasure in goodly araye, these be they, that are subiectes to all kyndes of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases and euyls. Howe properly therfore dydde the Satirike Poete calle the gowte Ryche? For it medleth not with them that are poore, and drynke no wyne, but hit is a companion for ryche men, dronkerdes, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetours and delycate lyuers: which (as the same poete sayth) to gette swete morsels, leue no place vnserched.</p>

            <p>¶The wrathe of god lyghte on these deed mens heedes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyrst receyued these euyls in to Germanie. For they haue done a thynge vnworthy for the grauite of the Germains Truely they, oure forefathers, were none suche: the which preferred the labours and peins of Hercules aboue the flesshely lustes, aboue the delycate meatis and softe beddes of Sardanapalus.

We haue also of our owne beestes flesshe bothe tame and wylde, whiche are not of vnpleasant taste. We haue fruites of trees, not to be dispised, howe ryche is Germanie, howe plenteous of all meates, howe abundantly dothe hit ministre all thynges necessary for the lyfe of man? Wherfore my chiefe desyre &amp; vowe is, that they neuer lacke the gowte, nor the frenche pockes: that can nat lyue without pepper: And I pray god / they may ones be brought to extreme hunger, whiche nowe serche in all places, not for meate to lyue with: but for delycates and deintees, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they may stere vp their swete mouthes and prouoke theyr appetites.

By the whiche example we may know, that they onely lyue in knowlege of theyr owne lyfe that lyue scarsely and soberly: And on the other syde, they that be gyuen to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rysshynge of theyr bodyes, and the pouryng in of all thinges, be as men erryng in darke<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, and perceyue not theyr owne lyfe, so farre are they from the lyfe of pleasure. Howe be it within short space, whan they be ones fallen into diseases, than they begynne to fele and perceyue, what lyfe they haue chosen, and what is the reward of the same. For as Persius sayth, whan the harde and stony goute, the braunches of their olde sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetynge, hath broken their ioyntes: than they mourne, that they haue passed theyr dayes so grossely, and consumed theyr lyfe so fylthely, and be so sorye to late of theyr lyfe to comme.</p>

Therfore as many as coueyte vertue and knowledge, lette them take hede and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Pythagoras, whiche saythe: that a man, that ryseth aboue man, can nat tast or atteyne any hygh thynge, that is to say, as longe as a man lyueth vnchastely and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, he shall neuer do any great thynge with wytte or mynde. The moste holsomest fedynge for man (sayth Plinie) is one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner meate, the heapynge of dyuers tastes is pestiferous, and sawces are worse than that.</p>
            <p>¶Persius well perceyued these thynges whan he thus spake in great mode: Thou woldest haue lyttie ioyntes, and a hole bodye in age. Ye but the full dysshes, and the fatte denteous, wyll not suffer the goddes nor Iupiter to graunt thervnto.</p>

Nor as longe as luste and pleasure bereth rule, Temperance can haue no place: Neither vertue may beare any stroke, where luste and pleasure reigneth. And therfore he iudgeth, that we ought to gyue great than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes vnto age, whiche causeth that we lyste not to do that thynge, whiche we ought not.

Fyrst bycause the body is emptied in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge with a pourgation, and than by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is lyttell meate receyued. But as this place is closed and shut from eiections, so is there somewhat in the meane season, other by sweatynge, through the strengthe of Guaiacum that expelleth thynges hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and superfluous, or els in the vrine, the whiche is more moyste than that cometh of the meate. And one thynge is greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, that in the tyme of this cure there

chaunceth no swellynge / nor there are no peynfull throwes or aches felt / nor the taste cometh not bytter, nor there ryseth no lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge of meate, nor vapours breathe not lyghtly ascendynge from the stomake to the heed, as in other diseses. And that the pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is pourged, it is easely perceiued by making of water: nor to the intente that shulde be done / none other prouocacyon shulde be soughte.

And many thynke, that it skylleth greatly, as well in this disease / as other, in what placis of the body the sycke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shulde chaunce, for the ryghte parte is more healeable than the left: Bycause, saith Alexander, by larger exercyse the matter is stopped, and made more apte to heale. Also they saye, it is more harder to heale the vttermoste partis, bycause they be farre of from the bodye, it is longe er they can be nourysshed and fedde. And there it is to be taken hede, whether the grefe doth ascende or discende. Celsus sayth, that what so euer grefe gothe downewarde, is the more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And agayne.

Whiche as in all other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines they maye be moued, so for the newe vse brought vp of Guaiacum, I wote not whether it be alway so or no. But this lette euery man take hede of, that where so euer the grefe be, and with what so euer kynde of the pockes they be peyned, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare well Guaiacum / and after they haue dronke so long therof that it be spredde and rounne into the veynes: thanne ye maye be sure theyr ache lytell and lytell goth away: And otherwhyle the ache commeth agayne / and is more sharpe and peynefull: and goth away agayne.

And by this I perceyue well, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this medicine is to purifie &amp; clense the soores vndernethe, and vnder the fleshe to proue and shewe fyrste the vertue therof. Hytherto haue I sene fewe or none, whose soores were cleane healed, that were kepte close tyll they helde.

For the nature of this medicine is not to breake, or plucke away the blondde, but by lyttell and lyttell to amende and purifie hit (in whiche blondde beinge corrupte, resteth al the force and strength of this disease) and to expelle and diuide from the body the hurtefull hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, thht are norisshementes of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, from some in theyr vrine and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges, and from other som in theyr sieges.

Not that on those, newely diseased any thynge shoulde be lefte vnhealed, but that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge goth forwarde more hardly, and the disease stycketh faster and is more greuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plucked out. For Guaiacum doth resolue and destroy meruaylously swellynges / ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therynges to gether of yll matters, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses / bumpis, and knobbes. Fluxions or runnynges it vtterly taketh awaye / eyther consumynge or tournyng the same an other way. It causeth the soores to impostume, withoute any maner of grefe. And if any thynge lye hydde within, it rooteth it oute.

And so of some (as it dyd to me) it maketh the bones bare, of some hit sheweth the sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowes, and breaketh the veynes, or eateth moste depely in, and it healeth these partis that be infected with this disease, and with suche stynche and fylthynesse / that the sauoure canne not be abyden.

that if this syckenes were thus preuented in the begynnynge, it myght vtterly be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and clensed, and the syke restored.

            <p>¶I knewe one / my very sure frende / whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che whan he saw me so bytterly vexed with this siknes, that for pein I could nother rest by nyght, nother eate by day, aduysed me to kylle my selfe, seinge there coulde no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be founde, and my body semed to droppe awaye in fylthy matter, to my great peyne and sorowe / and no hope at all of recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye: sayinge to me, It becommeth the to be delyuered frome this euyll, whether hit wyll or not. But he hadde forgotten, that we were christians, and remembred to wel, that we were frendes and louers. For hit is our parte to beholde all thynges in them that wytnessed in tymes past, whom we now calle martyrs, vnto the worlde, our sauiour Christe manfully sufferynge for his sake great tourmentes and peynes: Howe be it if any thyng maye cause a man to longe for dethe, truely it is the tourment of this syck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For I vtterly deny, that euer the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Licinius Cecine, suffered any suche sorowe or peyne, whan he flewe hym selfe with the iuise of Papauers, Or that euer

And left any man shulde thynke that my disease was eyther lyght, or in one parte onely: I wyll shew in what takyng I was. Fyrst I could do nothynge with my lefte foote, for there
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4539:71"/>
had this euyll dwelled .viii. yeres and more, and in the mydlegge, where the shynne is couered with fleshe very thynne, there were soores inflamed through the inflamation of the flesshe, rottynge with greatte ache and bournynge, and as soone as one waxed hoole, an other brake vp. For there were many, here some and there somme / whiche could by no help of the phisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be brought to gether in one. Ouer them was a knobbe so harde, that a man wolde haue thought it a bone, and in that was excedynge peyne and ache, beatynge and pryckynge without ceassyng. There was also very nygh to the ryghte ancle aboue, a certayne swellynge and gatherynge / whiche was also harde like a bone, and was the oldest of all / wher in remayned the remenantes of this pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence fresshe and newe rysen.</p>
            <p>¶Whan the phisition went about this with yron, with fyre, with hotte yrons, or with any other instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they profited nothing: somtyme it was swollen very vehemently, with great peyne and akynge, somtyme it aswaged and was gentyller. And it greued me lesse whan my foote was holde towarde the fyre / and yet wold it not suffre to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with moche geare: it ranne so that a

man wolde haue thoughte hit wolde neuer haue ben stopped. And as often as I wolde reste or stonde vppon my foote, my peyne was intollerable: than vpwarde the calfe and the knee were meruayllous colde, and as thynges deed. The thygh was cleane worne away &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed to extreme lennesse, and the skynne was so thynne, that there semed nothynge els lefte to couer the boone with. Moreouer the ioyntes were so louse, that longe tyme I had moch adoo to stonde hilone: and to be shorte: the one of my but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes was but a thynge wethered awaye. In my lefte shulder there was suche peyne that I coulde not lyfte vp myn arme: the extreme partes of my shulders were weke and woxen verye styffe: in the myddes of the brawne of myn arme there was a swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge as moche as an egge, and as for the reste of myn arme euen to the verye hande, was cleane worne away. And on the ryght syde a lyttell vnder the lowest rybbe, there had I a sore, whiche was not in dede peyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full / but it boyled out certayne fowle and stynkynge matter / and issued very fylthyly after the maner of a fistule with a narowe mouthe outwarde, and inwarde it was of a large holownes.

also an other as though a bone hadde bene bredde there vpon a rybbe. And to conclude I dyd playnly feele a streme and issue come downe behynde from the toppe of my heed vnto all these.

But nowe is that gone so far from me, that I trowe if I shuld enforce my selfe to slepe in the daye tyme, I coulde not. With all these, and so great euyls all though I was so maystred, that all men dispeyred my helth yet my good angell (I beleue) wylled me to tary and loke for somwhat.

As for me I repent my selfe in nothyng: and if by any meanes longe lyfe myght be graunted vnto me, I haue greatte hope that I shulde lyue hoole, sounde, and lusty. And of this disese, and of the remedy of Guaiacum / I haue wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these thynges that cam to my minde very faythfully, truely, and as my lernyng wolde suffre me: and here wolde I make an ende, if I thought it not necessary to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysshe them, that shall rede these thynges, howe after this cure, the sicke muste be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as touchynge the order and maner of theyr lyuynge, which thyng I wyll per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and that breuely.</p>

            <p>I Gaue warnyng before, that after this cure is paste, and the pacient is departed owte of the cloyster of this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, wherin he was close kept he must vse consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

And nowe that we be come to the very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre place to entreate of the same thynge / I say that it is so necessary to be done, that who so euer hath recouered his helthe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he afterwardes take good hede, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obseruynge many thynges, and lyue for a space vnder a certayne rule, as though he were yet shut vp: I say playnly that his helth shall not longe endure. And therfore thre monethes are appoynted vnto suche as were eyther greattely consumed and lowe brought in theyr syckenes, and hadde many issues, and auoyded moch, or els were sore hurt in there synowes and lymmes, or be so weakened, in their body, that a lyttell tyme can nat be sufficient to gether vp perfitely: their cro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes agayne. And on the other side, they that be stronge and not so farre gone, nor broken, vnto suche, ii. monethes after their settyng out ar ynough as it is thought. But by cause I wolde prouyde surely for them that wyll folowe me, I wyll aduyse them to obserue and kepe this prescripte very longe, and to begynne with, they shall absteyne them selfes longe tyme frome the flesshely acte: Bycause they that be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>&amp;The nexte poynt here vnto is this, that though they shall haue a gredye and sharpe appetite to meate, beinge emptied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall hunger, yet they muste resyste the same, and as moche as maye be to behaue them selfe very soberly and scarsely in their fedynge. And therfore they muste fyrste vse verye lyttell meate, and afterwarde some what more, goinge forth by lyttell and lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, so that there maye be a good space er that they come to theyr olde custome of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, exercysynge them selfe softely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynnynge no newe thynge hastely or soden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vtterly absteinynge fro al wynes except it be fyrste delayed with moche water, and be also of hit selfe smalle and of good sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and clere, and yet so, very moderatly: Let hym also, that is cured, be well fensed agaynst the violence of the ayer, and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in those tymes that be greuous with colde wynde and rayne, or els let hym goo forth abrode very seldome. He maye take meate twyse aday, but at euentyde very ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell:
<pb facs="tcp:4539:75"/>
and all that tyme he maye neuer fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe his appetite, but muste auoyde fulnes, as the greattest euyll, that can be. He must also aboue all thynges forbeare fysshe, and feade vpon yonge and tender flesshe, suche as is of lyghte digestion, and nouryssheth purely: whiche they be ye maye knowe by the phisitions teachynges. And these thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges must haue place, in the sayde two or .iii. monethes, for other thynges whiche shall be further obserued, maye be serned more playnly in the thynges folowyng. For now I wylle aduyse and monysshe with fewe wordes, not onely them that are recouered by Guaiacum, but other as wel from what soo euer disease they be delyuered, if they tender their good helthe and welfare, and desyre to be longe in prosperitie, whatte thynges they shall folowe. And here hit is chiefly to be noted (howe be it all doth now knowe it) that this one thynge is it that ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth this sycknes to be very greuous, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is great difficultie in dyetynge. For whan this disease is ouercome, hit is not one onely that muste be obserued in the order of our lyuynge, but many thynges: and dyuerse muste be reckened vppon. In so moche as what so euer thynges there
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:4539:75"/>
be, whether they be with or agaynst all the diseases, whiche I sayde before folowed this syckenes, he that is recouered, muste sette them before hym: endeuorynge hym selfe with all diligence to obteyn them / that make with hym, and to auoyde them that be ageynst hym. Wherfore he muste be all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes very carefull in his lyuynge, that all thynge may be done ordinately. Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stondynge if this medicine haue saued any, there is for them great comforte, bycause they that are expert therof, plainly thynke, that after the pacientes haue ones receyued their helth, &amp; the tyme of obseruation, which foloweth this cure be past, nothinge that is not contrary to theyr olde maner of liuyng can putte them in any daunger, so that they vsed not before to liue without order vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For that same order shal serue hym, that is thus restored, as shall serue them, that neuer had the sycknes. Wherfore they think it not so moche to be regarded, what a man eateth, as howe moche he eateth: And ther fore no kynde of meate to be forborne, no choise of meate to be hadde, concernynge the qualitie of fedynge, nothynge to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fore, but that whiche is knowen to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteygne to the commen conseruation of
<pb facs="tcp:4539:76"/>
helthe, and to the vniuersall auoydynge of all maladies and diseases. Wherin that that Celsus teacheth, perchance shall not be the leeft, whiche is, that euerye man take hede, lefte whyle his bodye is in prosperitie, the aydes and succour ageynst aduersite be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed and wasted.</p>
            <p>¶Helthe is preserued (as the same Celsꝰ sayth) by dyet, by medicines, by oyntynges, by frictions &amp; rubbynges, by baynes, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyse, by caryage aboute, by clere and pleasant readynge: whiche thynges howe they ought to be considered fully and holle, I leue you to aske of hym. Here wylle I breuely touche a fewe thynges, and suche as apperteyne to dyete. This I thinke they muste fede pleasauntely and moderately / and take suche meates and drynkes as be of lyghtest digestion. For as Paule saythe, The chiefes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> poynt of education is, that the meate be suche as wyll lyghtly digeste and nourysshe well, not slowe in digestynge, nor clammye / nor plentuous in superfluities: and the drynke to be smalle wyne / whyte, pure, and a lyttell delayde with water. And Celsus saith: Se your meate be nat fatty, clammy, nor wyndy. And by his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell ye muste absteyne in all suche diseases
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:4539:76"/>
from all maner salte meates, sharp, sowre, and bytter. For the same reason I thynke, wherof I made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion before. And Paule saythe, In eatynge, the greattest fawte is satietie and fulnes, For al though the bealy digeste well / yet the veynes to moche reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysshed, laboure soore / they swelle, they breake / they be stopped and fylled with wynde, and playne it is, that the worst dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases of all comme of sacietie. He thynketh this onely to be auoyded, that no man fylle hym selfe. And I iuge the same but not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for I wolde more ouer nothynge to be dressed deinteously, nothynge to be sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therfore I wil repete agayn this thing whiche is spoken of the same author: Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of meates is greatly to be auoyded, specially whan contrarye operations and vertues be in them. For whan they be so thruste in, they resist digestion. And the same thynketh Galene, and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4539:77"/>
as be of pure iudgement in phisicke.</p>
            <p>¶Cato (as Tully wryteth) commandeth so moche meate and drynke to be receyued, as may refresshe the strength and power of the body, and not oppresse it. Wherfore by the counsell of Xenophon, we muste make for the most parte a small dyner, that there may be a place for the supper.</p>
            <p>¶Playnly this disease is of that sort, that Galenus thynketh to come of fulnes: whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thynge is thus to be vnderstande, not that I thynke all that lyueth in surfetynge, streight way to be caste into the french poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes (al though suche shall not escape dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, no not most greuous) but if any haue ben vexed before with them, and than hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, eate &amp; drynke intemperately, he must ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des fall agayn into them. And therfore the meate that is receyued, let it nother be dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerse nor moch, that the stomake be not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and digestion letted. And agayne let it be (as I monysshed) easye in digestynge. Plinie sayth, All maner sharpe meates, all that is to moche, and all that is hastely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued be harde in workynge / and harder in somer than in wynter, and harder in age than in youthe.</p>
            <p>¶It is wryten in Tully, he that medleth
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4539:77"/>
not with exquysite meates, looded tables, and often cuppes, shal not be combred with dronkennes, rawnes of stomacke, or drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. But for as moch as wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶Plinie also sayth, The bodies growe and increace with swete and fatte meates and with drynke: they diminisshe and go downe with drye, leane, and colde meates and thurste. But this muste be wysely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonde, for those thynges whiche I haue often before monysshed. But seinge Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus warneth vs in all thynges to take hede to the bealy, For what so euer, sayth he, is corrupted, in that it is a cause of rot vnto al the body, and so of diseases: I thynke hit beste to take those drynkes and meates, as Celsus teacheth, which<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And fyrste I wyll admonysshe you of egges.

Alexander Aphrodisens thynketh that it conteyneth in it selfe the qualites of all the elementes, and to conclude there is in an egge a certayne shewe of the worlde, bothe because it is made of the foure ele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mentes, and agayne bycause it is gathered rounde in sphere fascion, And hath a lifely power.

He that eateth dayly his fylle of ptisana, his nutrimente Galenus thinketh can by none other meates be hyndred. And the same thynge wolde I say (saythe he) by beanes: if they fylled not with wynde. Of the vse of milke both in meates and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in medicines, Paule dothe intreate ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye goodly. Alexander saythe, mylke is lyghte in digestynge, and nouryssheth well. For that may lyghtly go into bloudde, that is made of bloudde, and in a maner hit is bloud made whyte.</p>
            <p>¶Of manye thynges I haue shewed you a few, but yet he that desireth to haue helth, ought, saythe Paule, to knowe howe great
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4539:79"/>
power wyne hathe. And the same saythe, if wyne frete anye man, he muste drynk colde water. And the nexte daye drynke the iuise of wormewode, and walke vppon it: he must rubbe his body and wasshe it, and than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresshe hym selfe with lyttell meate. Wynes that were lately must, and also wynes that be to olde must be auoyded, sayth Galenus. For these heate to moche, and the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge at all. That fedynge faythe Paule, that kepeth a man bare and sklender is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che surer for the helthe, than that whiche maketh one fat. But for as moche as lyttell meate gyueth nother strength nor stedynes vnto the bodye, therfore he after addethe sayinge, Suche meates as are of a meane nature, are the chiefe nourysshementes of all. For they ingender bloudde of a meane substance. And as such are most metest &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

This saythe Paule. And he teacheth more ouer / that rye breadde nouryssheth more than all other, and that wheaten breade is of harde digestion and wyndy, and that barly breade is of lyttell strengthe.

Through rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bynge, if it be vehement, the bodye is made harde, if it be softe and easye, the bodye is made softe, if it be moch, it diminissheth, if it be meane, it fylleth.</p>
            <p>¶In our days that high lerned man Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Roterodamus, vsynge thus dayly and specially in the mornynge at his vprysynge, thinkith therbi that he preserueth his helth, the weakenes of his body (whiche is verye great) not withstondynge. And hathe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me diligently, that aboue al other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I and all other studentes shulde vse the same. I folowe the counsell of my frende, and fynde ease therin. Somme forbydde wasshynges and all maner bathes, and they saye, that they be vnholsomme for all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as be recouered from this disease.

I thynke by cause they mollifie the syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, and lose them, and therfore they wyll not that water shulde touche them: and yet they do not, sauynge for that, improue sweattynges, water hurtethe the synowes though it be warme saythe Alexander: not bycause it is warme, but bicause it is moyst. Paule commendyng warme wasshyng saith thus: It taketh away werynes, it shaketh downe fulnes, it heateth, it mitigateth, hit mollifieth, it disperseth, it prouoketh slepe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not withstondynge the Italianes nowe a dayes wasshe not but very seldome, wherof I doo not meruaylle, seinge in tymes paste they vsed it dayly as wrytynge testifieth, &amp; also the tokens of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>¶In exercises Galene teacheth, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure muste be kepte and obserued, sayinge, Immoderatenes I reproue euery where. He lykewise sayth: As exercise before meat is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefest thyng to preserue helth, so is al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner motion after meate most noyful. For the meat is scatered out of the bely before it be digested, and therof gadreth many grosse
<pb facs="tcp:4539:81"/>
and rawe humours in the veynes, wherof all maner diseses are wont to be ingendred. Paule aduyseth vs, so longe to exercise our selfe, vntyll the body begynne to swelle and waxe reed, our motions stronge, equall, and easye, and the swette seme to be mixed with vapour: than fyrste to reste, whan any of these begynnne to chaunge. They monysshe also to gyue reste and quietnesse vnto that membre, whiche was lately restored to hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the. And Hipocrates saythe: The remedye of the foote is reste. Wherof Alexander ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth that that, which is heled again must nedes haue reste. For motion (saythe he) causeth flowynges of the superfluous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whiche may reyse and styr vp inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The worst thynge that can be to hym that hath akynge knees, is to ryde, saythe Celsus. He also thynketh hit not good for them that be gowtie. The old men exercised them selfe also in voyce that they moughte synge and also rede more clerely.</p>
            <p>¶I sayd I wold entreate of these thynges, as occasyon gaue, not moche regardynge any order, but as euery thyng, worthy to be noted, shuld com to mynd. And therfore let no man loke for any greatte thynge here, if there be any that wolde knowe, I haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4539:81"/>
in what authors what thynges he shall fynde. But loo here commeth an other to mynde, he that wyl preserue his helth, must take hede (saythe Galene) to .ij. thynges specially: one is, that the meate be agreinge and mete for hym: an other is, that there folowe good brookynge, and clensynge of those superfluities, that are lefte of the meate. It is recyted by Paule, that the olde men thought it was sufficient to defend and preserue helth: if the bourden of the bely &amp; bladder were dayly vnloded wel &amp; without faulte, accordynge to the portion of the meate and drinke receyued. Galene as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge the vse of Venus, hathe lefte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge vntouched, affirmynge that acte to be an ennemy vnto the helthe of all them that are drye of complexion, and specially of them that are also colde. For Venus (sayth he) is vnhurtefull onely vnto them that be hote and moyste, and be aboundant of sede. And ageyne he saythe: They that haue theyr bodies well tempered and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault, ought not vtterly to absteyn from Venus, as they that be cold and dry ought. Also Paule sayth: drye copulations hurteth all men, and moste of all if colde be ioyned to dryeth: so that they onely / whiche be
<pb facs="tcp:4539:82"/>
hote and moyste, may vse it without ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye. As labours are profytable vnto helth, so are also copulations if they be vsed with mesure. This one thyng ought all to know, that al they that haue had the frenche poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes ought with grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> care, for loue of their synowes to auoyde carnall copulation. Paule iudgeth it well done to exercyse chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that through the labour of body and mynd, they may be brydeled and restrayned from the violence of bodily pleasure. Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates compareth that act vnto the fallyng sycknes. Alexander Magnus was wont to say, that copulation and slepe were two the greattest tokens of mortalite.</p>
            <p>¶The holsomes also of the ayre muste be loked vppon, which is a good post of helth. That ayre, sayth Paule, whiche is infected with euyll vapours, puffynge out pestilent blastes, or is nygh vnto a synke or draught, or is mustie / or is kepte in a vallie, compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about with hilles hurteth al ages. And the beste ayre is most holsome. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a temperat body a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate aire is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, sayth he, and a distempred is for hym that hath a contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ry temperature. Sicknes is nothyng els, sayth Galene, sauyng a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without nature. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayth: The phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sitions
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4539:82"/>
vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de hym to be hole, al whose me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres be according to the cours of nature: &amp; contrarywise tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be syck, if any part go out from his nature. It is forbidden by the doctrine a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the phisitions, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drink streight vpon chafyng. They say also, that al sodayn changes are dangerous. This is also admitted for trouth, that contynuall i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delnes is most contrary to good helth. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary wise, Meane exercyse is great aide &amp; socour. Galen saith, depe rest of the body is the greattest euyl that can be for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruyng of the helth, as moderate labour is the greattest good. As perteynyng to slepe, whan it ought to be taken and howe moche Paule teacheth abundantly, and also what commodities folowe, whan it is well taken in tyme. With noone slepe there is none that holdeth. For suche as be of a sad nature, or be troubled with thought and care / the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions iugeth very good to cal for som ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pastimes &amp; mirthe, to finde out by some meanes, wherby the hart may be chered, &amp; the sadnes of mynde eased.

            <p>¶He that is in good helth (sayth Celsus) &amp; at his owne libertie nedeth to care nother
<pb facs="tcp:4539:83"/>
for medicines nor oyntmentes. Which thing as I do allowe, and wolde not them that be of good lykynge and helth to be bounde greatly to any maner rule of lyuynge: so thynke I it nedefull for them, that haue ben sycke, or haue syckely bodyes, or do folowe suche kynde of lyuynge, that they can nat well defende the bodyly helthe, to haue a rule of lyuynge, to order them selfe by. For Galene monyssheth, that a lawe and rule of lyuynge is in no wise superfluous. For dyete, sayeth he, is a verye medicine.</p>
            <p>¶These thynges that I haue here wryten, moste noble prince, I repute moste profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to this pourpose, bothe by myn owne and others experience, and also by the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge of them that were hyghly lerned.
