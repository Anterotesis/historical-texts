            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ON Friday about five or ſix at night, came
three Gentlemen into the Tower to
ſpeak with Sir <hi>John Coniers,</hi> Lieutenant of
the ſaid Royall Caſtle and Magazine. He
not being then within, one of the Gentlemen reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
of the Yeoman-Uſher, that if he knew he were
neere about, he will doe him the favour to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
unto him that there were ſome attending him
which had buſineſſe from the King: the yeoman
uſher cauſed the meſſage to be delivered unto the
Lieutenant of the Tower, where in a gentlemans
houſe upon the hill he then was. The Lieutenant
forthwith came; and in the meane time they got
into their company, Maſter <hi>Binian</hi> long ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
for denying to ſubmit unto the new order
of <hi>Militia:</hi> they met the Lieutenant upon the Hill:
and one of the three (as it ſeeemes, a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger)
delivered a Warrant under the Great Seale
of <hi>England</hi> unto him, ſaying, The King greets you
Sir. The Lieutenant demanded whom or what it
might concerne; it was anſwered by the Meſſenger,
the ſpeedy and preſent releaſe of Maſter <hi>Binian,</hi> for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65321:3"/>
whom his Majeſtie had ſent and muſt goe along
with him the Lieutenant deſired ſome houres ſpace
to conſider of it, it was anſwered him that he could
not grant it, having expreſſe charge to the contrary,
and for that to take any delay, for an utter denyall.
Then the Lieutenant would have ſpoken a word in
private with another Gentleman there preſent,
who excuſing himſelfe denyed it, deſiring his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
anſwer, and to conceive what perill might or
might not accrue unto himſelfe upon the refuſall.
Upon thoſe words, putting off their hats as taking
leave; why quoth the Lieutenant (opening the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and reading it, and once moving a little his
head) then I obey, you may take him with you, and
God bleſſe you all. So Maſter <hi>Binian</hi> agreeing for
his fees, forthwith takes horſe and towards <hi>Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had not Maſter <hi>Binian</hi> made ſuch ſpeedy diſpatch
he had haply ſeene <hi>Coulcheſter</hi> before Thurſday,
and a worſhipfull Citizen of <hi>London</hi> mude up in a
Countie Gaole: What thankes and commendation
the hononrable Houſe ſhall thinke the Lieutenant
worthy of for ſo ſpeedy an execution of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
command is not yet knowne.</p>
            <p>Saturday morning the commiſſion of Admiralty
was taken from the Lord of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and the
Regiſter with all other officers ſummoned to give
their perſonall preſence at <hi>Yorke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sunday the Kings Declaration was read in the
Cathedrall of <hi>Pauls,</hi> where the firſt and ſecond
leſſons are uſually read; the reader where of turning
himſelfe unto the Communion Table, all men
were commanded to ſtand up and to be uncovered.</p>

boldly, and daringly with eight thouſand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
three little Field Pieces, and made ſhew of a

all Engliſh, and moſt Townesmen: who by
