            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

procuring of the Sentence of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I conſider the way of my Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the courſe of my life; which
hath been wholly ſtrange to publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of books; I begin to thinke that
as God Almighty brings into every
mans life ſomewhat unexpected and remarkable, ſo
that by this croſſe neceſſity that at the preſent lies
upon me, he would make it evident to me in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
that our lives are but clay in his hands, and
that we ſcarcely come ever ſo ſenſibly to feele his
hand as in the day of our adverſity.</p>
            <p>And therefore though I bemoan the injuſtice of
men towards me, yet him I juſtifie and reſigne my
ſelfe up ro his will, and truly ſince he hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to permit affliction to lye upon me, to have my
good name, nay my eſtate and truſt taken away
(which nevertheleſſe he will reſtore in his due time)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40652:4"/>
I ſhall not doubt to lay open the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of my troubles, the unjuſt and fraudulent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of my Adverſaties, the nature of my crime
freely and clearly laid out, and laſtly the ſufferings
that it hath occaſioned to me. For though this be
but a private buſineſſe, and my Wife and Children
ſeem only to be Sufferers, yet in a Commonwealth,
ſince every man hath intereſt in juſtice, and all men
are tyed to joyn their Forces againſt unrighteouſneſſe,
I hold it more then private; and come what will, I
will lay it open, cleaving always to the truth, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
my ſelfe with that duty and civility, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
me to that Power which God hath ſet over
me.</p>
            <p>I can ſpeake it in the ſincery and uprightneſſe of my
heart, and I hope without boaſting, my converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among men, hath been ſuch ever ſince I came to
deale in the world, that I never yet had any man juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mine Enemy; but either he who was an Enemy
to the Cauſe I embarked in, or elſe ſome other,
whom I had oppoſed in ſome unjuſt proceedings, and
whom I had kept from oppreſſing the weaker: And
upon this latter ſcore, I juſtly fear, That Sir <hi>William
Allenſon</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and a Member of this preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
became ſo ſharp and ſo eager an Enemy,
that for a crime which is no crime at all, or in the
moſt rigorous interpretation, a miſtake, I am Voted
uncapable of their Service, whom I had faithfully
and diligently ſerved ſo many years (to the neglect of
my buſineſſe, and almoſt ruining of my eſtate) either
as a Souldier or a Common-wealths man, and my
eſtate ordered to be ſold. But of that hereafter. Now
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40652:4"/>
that which hath brought all this trouble upon me, is
no other then this.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond year of the late <hi>Charles, Leeds</hi> Town
and Pariſh was Incorporated, and that illegally, by
reaſon that the major conſent of the Inhabitants was
wanting, and it was well known by what Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means
it was at that time procured, but however pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
it was, and the Governours acted accordingly,
which produced many Suits and Tryalls at Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and the Clothiers.</p>
            <p>At the beginning of theſe Troubles, nine of the ten
Aldermen appeared for the late King, and thereby
became uncapable of civill imployment, ſo that the
Town was then at liberty and injoyed their former
right, till theſe preſent Governours illegally and out
of courſe created themſelves, and took upon them to
act according to the former Charter. But the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
being ſenſible of the inconveniencies they had
formerly received by it, and not expecting the beſt
things from them that ſo luſted after the power, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
a Commiſſion under the broad Seal, directed to
Sir <hi>John Savill</hi> Knight, <hi>Charles Fairfax, Henry Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
Eſquires, &amp;c. Impowering them to command
the High Sheriffe to empanell twenty four honeſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
men, to inquire the legallity of the Charter, and
their acting, which was accordingly executed, and
it was found by the Jury, that the Letters Pattents
were illegally procured without the major conſent of
the Inhabitants, and that it was prejudiciall to the
Towne and Pariſh, and not ſtanding with the good
of the Commonwealth, and that they had illegally ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
one another contrary to the letter of the Patent,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40652:5"/>
ſo that the Inquiſion was returned, and remaines now
in the Petty-Bag-Office.</p>
            <p>Now Sir <hi>William Allanſon</hi> fearing, as he had good
cauſe, that it might fall heavy on his Brother, who
contrary to his Oath and Truſt, had acted ſo crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and knowing I had a Charge ready againſt him,
procured an Order of the Parliament that ſuch Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as had been made by the well-affected in any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
though not according to the Letter of the
Charter ſhould be good; by which meanes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Governours I dare affirme have oppreſſed more
within theſe ſix yeares paſt, and brought greater ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
upon the poore Inhabitants, then they had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in fourteene yeares before: I therefore having
been ſo zealous and forward in this buſineſſe in behalf
of the Inhabitants as inprocuring the Inquiſition,
as alſo by a Petition to the Northern Committee,
ſigned by me by the conſent in the name and in the
behalfe of the Inhabitants, and preſented by my ſelfe
in heir behalfes and Mr. <hi>Bains</hi> in the behalfe of the
Aldermen in <hi>December</hi> 1647.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William Allanſon</hi> took an enmity to me becauſe
I oppoſed his Brother, and never ſince reſted from
any meanes that might bring my ruine, though I be
verily of opinion, that if I had not oppoſed his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or <hi>Stillington</hi> had not been too neer <hi>Crake</hi> Caſtle,
we might have been friends to this day; But becauſe
you ſhall ſee how juſtly Sir <hi>William</hi> affords his Brother
this Patronage, and how much need the other hath of
it, and how juſt it is for any man that loves the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
to lay open the iniquities of ſuch a man; I
ſhall quote you one or two of them whereby he broke
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40652:5"/>
his Oath and Truſt as a Sequeſtrator.</p>
            <p>After the Rendition of <hi>Yorke,</hi> this <hi>Francis Allanſon</hi>
who is Sir <hi>Williams</hi> owne Brother, ſent ſome peeces of
Cloath belonging to <hi>Lancelot Iveſon</hi> a Malignant, to
<hi>Leeds</hi> as his own, and then and there demanded of the
ſaid <hi>Lancelot Iveſon</hi> what hee would have for them a
peece, hee anſwered that ſuch a man whom hee then
named gave uſually 52 ſhillings or thereabouts; Mr.
<hi>Allanſon</hi> replyed, that if he would let him have them
at 30 ſhillings, well it were, otherwiſe he would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter
them to the uſe of the Commonwealth, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the poore man finding himſelf under a neceſſity
of being cheated, conſented, and the Commonwealth
loſt all the advantage of that Sequeſtration.</p>
            <p>Will you have another of them? ſome four Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Leeds,</hi> whereof Mr. <hi>Allanſon</hi> was one, had a
Commiſſion or Order for the providing of five or ten
thouſand pounds worth of Cloath for the uſe of the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Armie, whereupon they tooke mens Cloathes
(which the Inhabitants remember with complaint to
this day) at what price they pleaſed, not ſuffering the
Cloathier to ſell his Cloath to others, and paid them
in what price and manner they pleaſed; by which
meanes they inriched themſelves, though it was out
of the groanes of the poore. But this and other things
if they came to be ſcan'd, would I beleeve deſerve a
ſentence ſevere enough againſt Mr. <hi>Allanſon</hi> though
he be now boyed up by Sir <hi>William</hi> his Brother; And
truely Sir <hi>William</hi> for all his pretended zeale to the
Cauſe, hath not wanted Cloaths to keep it warme, for
upon pretended loſſes he had the <hi>Hamper-Office</hi> given
him, and 'tis knowne that out of Biſhops or Deans and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40652:6"/>
Chapters Lands hte hath raiſed himſelfe a very large
Eſtate. But as I would impeach no man upon Rumours
or Conjectures (for my ſelfe have felt too much of
that) ſo will I not ſtand to examine how many men
he raiſed in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> at the eruption of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi>
nor will I ſay hee is a Countenancer of Malignants;
but 'tis a ſigne that Sir <hi>William</hi> hath a hollow place in
his heart: For ſoone after the Death of the late King,
in his journey towards <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> lodging at the <hi>George</hi>
at <hi>Stanford,</hi> he there boaſted to Malignants how wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he had carried himſelfe, <hi>viz. That there was but one
other and himſelfe of all his Countrey-men that voted for a
perſonall Treaty with the King, and that he could waſh his
hands from having any hand in the Kings Blood.</hi> And
theſe words are witneſſed by <hi>Richard Morris</hi> and Mrs.
<hi>Margaret Dobins,</hi> and <hi>Rich. Morris</hi> did repeat the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
words in the preſence of Captain <hi>Matthew Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips
11th. Auguſt</hi> 1650. and hee then ſaid he would
juſtifie them upon Oath; Thus much for Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another back Friend of mine was Mr. <hi>Sikes</hi> of
<hi>Leeds,</hi> whom though I eſteemed very much for his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to the Parliament, yet I thinke the Nation is
not much obliged by him, by reaſon of his unworthy
diſcovery of the Myſtery of Cloathing in <hi>Holland,</hi> and
his planting of it in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to the great prejudice,
and if God had not prevented, the inevitable ruine of
many thouſand of families. Yet becauſe I oppoſed
him in the behalf of M. <hi>Marſhall Steward</hi> of the Court
of <hi>Leeds,</hi> whom he endeavoured to have ſequeſtered,
to the intent that he might be made incapable of that
Office, both by articling againſt him at the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40652:6"/>
of <hi>York</hi> and Indempnity, where he was both times
cleared, Mr. <hi>Sikes</hi> of a Friend became an Enemy, and
with his Son and Sir <hi>William Allanſon</hi> laid that traine
which ſince blew me up.</p>
            <p>And truly, my heart beares me witneſſe that I
ſpeak not out of malice, but out of love to the weale-publicke;
I envy not that large Eſtate that Mr. <hi>Sikes</hi>
now enjoyes, though it be much above the probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that he ever could have; but this in behalf of the
Commonwealth I will ſay, that I am altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
as to the 4000 li. he had ordered him out of
<hi>Goldſmiths-Hall,</hi> and the 3900 and odd pounds out of
the Exciſe, both with Intereſt, after the rate of eight
<hi>per cent.</hi> for I am confident the Parliament was herein
ſurprized, and that if the buſineſſe had been rightly
underſtood, no ſuch ſums had ever been allowed.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe hindges of malice was my ruine turned,
and truly both how cunningly and with how high a
hand it was brought in, I ſhall now tell you, and let
all the world judge of me how far I have been unjuſt
to this Common-Wealth, and whether I deſerve not
pitty that have languiſhed above a yeare under a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
ſentence without any hearing, when the Report
and the Sentence was haſtened within a few dayes.</p>
            <p>For any Malignancy, I can in my Conſcience ſay I
ought not to bee taxed with it; my prayers, my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
my eſtate have been all for the Parliament,
and it hath been the endeavour of my ſoule to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to them in my Station, nay even ſome of

            <p>Now when the Parliament had <hi>Novemb.</hi> 24. 1642.
enabled the Lord <hi>Ferdinando Fairfax</hi> to receive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Plate, Horſe, and Armes upon the Propoſitions,
for which the Publicke Faith was to bee engaged,
I lent 60 <hi>li.</hi> upon the Propoſitions, and timely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in raiſing of a Troope of Horſe compleatly
armed, which with incident charges coſt me above
600 <hi>li. 450 li.</hi> whereof I have paid Intereſt for ever
ſince.</p>
            <p>I was plundered to the value of a great ſum while
I was in the Service, I loſt the uſe of a profitable Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40652:7"/>
which I can with a ſafe Conſcience aver, brought
me in more then the pay of that Command, though
it had been fully and immediately diſcharged. After
the Battle of <hi>Namptwich,</hi> I was ſent by Sir <hi>Tho: Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faix</hi>
to <hi>London</hi> with a Letter to the E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> &amp; about
Monies, and I may juſtly ſay, I was mainly inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
in procuring the City by way of loan, to lay down
10000<hi>li.</hi> which in that juncture of time, how accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a ſum it muſt needs be, I leave any man to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
In this Service we continued till by Order we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded,
and my Arrears amounted to 1657<hi>li. 16s. 3d.</hi>
After this the Parliament by Ordinance <hi>May</hi> 22.
1647. provides for the payment of the one third of
the Arreares of the Northern Officers to be accepted
by them in full ſatisfaction: My ſelfe being one of
the ſaid Officers, my accounts being audited, and ſo
ſtated that the 600 <hi>li.</hi> which I advanced in Horſes and
Arms upon the Publick Faith was accounted amongſt
my Arrears, I was then in a ſtraight, conceiving that
the Parliament intended not to give one third in full
for my Money lent, yet being in neceſſitie for Monies
by reaſon of my loſſes in ſerving the Parliament, I
was willing to accept of one third in full for my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares,
and to receive one third of my 600 <hi>li.</hi> lent, but
not for ſatisfaction. Therefore upon the 27 of <hi>May,</hi>
before I tooke any aſſignment for any Money, five
dayes after the ſaid Ordinance paſſed, I Petitioned the
Committee of the Northern Aſſociation, ſhewing
that I could not accept of one third for the whole of
my 600<hi>li.</hi> lent, &amp; that the Ordinance mentioned only
Arrears, and deſired that my Caſe with my loſſes and
ſufferings might bee repreſented to the Parliament;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40652:8"/>
whereupon the Comittee ordered that my Petition
ſhould be reported to the Parliament, and the Lord
<hi>Fairfax</hi> writ Letters to Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> M.
<hi>Brian Stapleton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Luke Robinſon,</hi> deſiring that
my Petition might be anſwered, and I might be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for the ſaid 400 <hi>li.</hi> and my loſſes.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I received my Petition, and my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
which was to make good the Petition, from
the Clerk of the Committee, and put them into the
hands of Mr. <hi>Bryan Stapleton</hi> to report to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who as he hath already teſtified under his hand
and ſeale, had them in his hand one whole yeare, but
after his withdrawing I put them into the hands of
Sir <hi>William Allanſon,</hi> (ſo confident I was of my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
and Juſtice in the buſineſſe) from whom I am
to acknowledge I have received faire words, but that
was all.</p>
            <p>By this time were two yeares ſpent, and I could
heare of no reparations for my loſſes and ſufferings,
and the Parliament at that time paſſing an Act for
doubling upon Deans and Chapters Lands, I thought
it but juſt and in-offenſive to double the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
400 <hi>li.</hi> being the two remaining thirds of the 600
<hi>li.</hi> with its allowed intereſt which made it 600 <hi>li.</hi> as
money due upon the Publicke Faith, not diſcharged
by way of Arreares. Now this hole being found in
my Coat, Sir <hi>William Allanſon</hi> and the Corporation
of <hi>Leeds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sikes</hi> the elder, who were my friends as
I mentioned before, and Col. <hi>Matthew Alured</hi> (who
hath made it ſince appeare that he thirſted after my
Regiment, and I have cauſe to feare knew too much
of the plot, for to a Friend of his he fore-told the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40652:8"/>
ſentence ten dayes before) put their heads together
and endeavoured to bring me into the Penalty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
in the Act, and make me forfeit my Purchaſe
which was a moat in ſome bodies eye. So the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
was referred to a Committee, before whom I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1650. to make my defence, but
there was nothing done in it, becauſe Sir <hi>William Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanſon</hi>
would not ſuffer me to make my defence, and
informe Col. <hi>Boſwell</hi> who was in the examination of
the buſineſſe, as ſome worthy Members there preſent
can witneſſe; though Sir <hi>William Allanſon</hi> making it
his buſineſſe, writ into <hi>Scotland</hi> that I was heard, and
Col. <hi>Alured</hi> endeavoured to perſwade the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
there the ſame, the better to weaken me in
their opinions, and to keep back the aſſiſtance of my
Lord Generall in caſe I ſhould have Petitioned for it.</p>
            <p>I went downe into the North, to raiſe my Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and then Sir <hi>Wil. Allanſon</hi> ſaw it was his time,
ſo that there being the 25th. day of <hi>Iuly</hi> after, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
Sir <hi>William Allanſon,</hi> being of the Sub-Committee,
drew up a report, and as I have reaſon
to think, made it be entred into the book as paſt the
twentieth (when it was known there was nothing done
in it that day) and Sir <hi>Wil. Allanſon</hi> the 30th. day after
reported it to the Houſe (I being then 150 miles off
raiſing a Regiment for <hi>Scotland</hi>) which, I not being
heard, and ſome being ſurprized, others I fear me not
conſidering the depth of the matter, produced this
Vote.</p>

               <p>Now maiſt thou ſee my crime, Of 1657 <hi>li. 16 s. 3 d.</hi>
Arrears, and 600 <hi>li.</hi> laid out of my purſe in raiſing
my Troop, I had of each but a third allowed me,
which made 752 li. 12 s. 1 d. 387 li. whereof was loſt
by transferring it from the Exciſe to Deans and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
lands. And yet upon doubling the remaining two
thirds of the 600 li. (which I laid out of my purſe, and
was a Debt, not an Arrear) and Intereſt (a Sum that
I could have bought in Bills for 90 li. at <hi>Gurny</hi> houſe.)
I am ruined in my fortunes and credit, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I pay Intereſt for moſt of the monies disburſed in
that ſervice to this day. And thus it may appear how
much I have gained by the Service of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
that of one third of my Arrears, and Troop,
having loſt 387 li. by transferring, and not ſuffered to
double the remaining 400 <hi>li.</hi> I have not received the
firſt 660 li. accounting my receipt and doubling at the
price current.</p>
               <p>Now ſince the words of the firſt Report runs thus,
<hi>for ſurrepticious taking his Accounts,</hi> I deny it, for I had
my Accounts, my Petition, &amp; the Order of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
(which was the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1647.) delivered
me by the Clerk of the ſaid Committee, as appears by
a note under his hand, and have ſince acted according
to the ſenſe of the Committee in daily ſoliciting the
hearing of the buſineſſe; and I am to note, my caſe is
different from all others except Major <hi>Lilburns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be asked indeed, <hi>whether by the Ordinance of
the 22 of</hi> May 1647. <hi>I be tyed to accept a third in full of
my disburſements?</hi> I anſwer, According to the letter
of the Ordinance, no, becauſe it mentions only Arrears
of pay; and ſecondly, it is not to be ſuppoſed the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
intended to pay a principall, for which their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40652:11"/>

                  </gap>

                     <desc>••••…</desc>
                  </gap>
I anſwer, that conſequently the Parliament is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to performe <hi>their</hi> Contract, and if I am bound to
returne a full value in doubling &amp;c. the Parliament is
by the ſame Law (as I humbly conceive) to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the loſſe in transferring, which is treble
the value of doubling, or Publick Faith Bills. And my
acceptation of the third part was in regard of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity
of the ſecurity, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Exciſe) ſufficient to
advance the whole proportioned ſumme, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
Money would not yeeld above a moiety, which
conſideration enclined the Parliament to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to Collonell <hi>Alured</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Maſon</hi> in
the ſame caſe.</p>
               <p>It may bee further objected, <hi>That I did receive for a
Months pay</hi> 42 li. <hi>which was to be deducted out of the ſum
proportioned for my thirds upon Account.</hi> I acknowledge
the receipt of the ſaid ſumme as other Officers in the
ſame Liſt, for which upon my Account I would have
diſcounted, but never receiving the ſame in manner
and forme as by the Ordinance was appointed, I could
not diſcount for it as might be expected; (yet in my
Account betwixt the Common-wealth and my ſelfe
as Debtor and Creditor, I have charged my ſelf with
the ſame.</p>
               <p>You may ſee now how my caſe ſtands, and with
what power and proſecution it was carried on, and
truly I make any man my Judge, whether if it had
been his caſe he would not have ſaid, hee had drunke
of the Cup of Bitterneſſe and taſted of Affliction, my
crime being of that nature I have told you, and (if I

                  </gap>. But as <hi>Job</hi> ſayes,
<hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him;</hi> ſo I may ſay,
though I periſh in this cauſe, yet muſt I love it; and
therefore I hope God intends better things to me by
this ſeaſonable Affliction, which I willingly take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my ſhoulders, in hope he will in his time remove it.
In the mean time I wiſh all proſperitie to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
a continuall ſucceſſion of a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
ever filled with a Spirit of Counſell, Vnity, and
ſelfe-denyall, which to me would be the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſight in the world, though I found my own ruine
in it.</p>
