            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S your Maiestie, Sir, after your accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and vertuous maner was sometime discoursing at Table with such your Domestiques, as chaunced to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant;</p>
                  <p>It pleased your Highnesse not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to esteeme the peereless stile of the Greeke <hi>Homer,</hi> and the Latin <hi>Uirgill</hi> to be inimitable to vs (whose tongue is barbarous and corrupted): But also to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (partly thorow delight your Maiesty tooke in the Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie stile of those most famous Writers, and partly to sound the opinion of others) that also the lofty Phrase, the graue inditement, the facound termes of the French Salust (for the like resemblance) could not be followed nor sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in our rude and impolished English language. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I more boldly then aduisedly (with your Maiesties licence) declared my simple opinion; not calling to mind, that I was to giue my verdit in presence of so sharp and clear-eied a Censor as your Highnesse is: But rashly I alleadged, that it was nothing impossible euen to follow the footesteps of the same great Poet <hi>Salust,</hi> and to translate his verse (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
<pb facs="tcp:11251:456"/>
is of it selfe exquisite) succinctly, and sensibly in our owne vulgar speech. Wherevpon it pleased your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie (among the rest of his works) to assigne me, <hi>The Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Iudith,</hi> as an agreeable Subiect to your Highnesse, to be turned by me into English verse: Not for any speciall gift or Science that was in me, who am inferiour in knowledge and erudition to the least of your Maiesties Court: but by reason (paraduenture) of my bold assertion, your Maiestie, who will not haue the meanest of your house vnoccupied, would haue mee to beare the yoke, and driue forth the penance, that I had rashly procured. Indeede, the burden appeared heauie, and the charge almost insupportable to me: neuerthelesse, the feruent desire which I had to obtemper vnto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties commandement, the earnest intention to verifie my rash speaking, and the assured confidence which I ankred on, your Highnesse helpe and correction, encouraged mee so, &amp; lightned on such wise my heauy burthen, that I haue with lesse paine, brought my half despaired worke to finall end. In the which, I haue so behaued my selfe, that through your Maiesties concurrence, I haue not exceeded the number of the lynes written by my Author: In euerie one of the which, he also hath two syllables mo then any English beares. And this notwithstanding, I suppose your Maiestie shall finde little of my Authors meaning pretermitted. Wherfore if thus much be done by me, who am of another profession, and of so simple literature, I leaue it to bee considered by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, what such as are consummate in letters, and knowes the waightie words, the pithie sentences, the polished tearms, and full efficacie of the English tongue, would haue done. Receiue them, Sir, of your owne seruant, this little worke at your owne commandement enterprised, corrected by your Maiesties owne hand, and dedicated to your owne Highnesse. If I haue done well, let the praise redound to your Maiestie, whose censure I haue vnderlyen. If otherwise, let my default of skill bee imputed to my selfe, or at the least my good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention allowed, whereby others may haue occasion to doe
<pb facs="tcp:11251:456"/>
better. To your Highnesse consideration, referring Sir, both my diligence done in this smal translation, and the inueterate affection which I haue, and ought alwaies to beare vnto your Maiestie, I commit with all humilitie, your Highnes, your Realme and estate, to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of God, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth all the World.</p>

And if the effect hath not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered to my desire, I beseech thee to lay the fault vpon her who proposed to me so meane a <hi>Theame</hi> or subiect, and not on me who could not honestly disobey. Yet in so much as I am the first in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who in a iust <hi>Poeme</hi> hath treated in our tongue of sacred things, I hope of thy fauour to receiue some excuse; seeing that things of so great weight cannot be both perfectly begunne and ended together. If thou neither allow my stile nor workmanship, at least thou shalt be driuen to allowe the honest pretence and holy desire which I haue to see the youth of <hi>Fraunce</hi> so holily by mine example exercised.</p>
                  <p>I may not forget, that they doe greatly wrong me, who thinks that in discriuing the <hi>Catastrophe</hi> of this Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (truely tragicall) I am becomne a voluntary Aduocate to these troublesome and sedicious spirits, who (for to

But seeing this question is so diffuse that it cannot be absolued in fewe words, and that my braine is too weak for so high an enterprise; I send you to those who haue spent more oyle and time in turning the leaues of the sacred scriptures, then I haue done for the present. It me sufficeth for the time to admonish the <hi>Reader,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing without a clear and indubitable vocation of God against those whom he hath erected aboue vs; and aboue all things, not to abuse the law of humane hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and other holy bands, for to giue place to these frene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike opinions so to abolish a pretended tyranny. I haue also to warne thee of two different sorts of men: of the which one sort is so depraued that they can heare nothing, but that which is altogether prophane; and the other is so supersticious, that they make conscience not onely to write, but also to read of holy things in verse, as though that the measure and iointure of syllabes were so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained as it were vnpossible to keepe the sense vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted,
<pb facs="tcp:11251:459"/>
or at least not excessiuely obscured. Now if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that this my first assay may bee to thee agreeable, I shall continue more gladly my newe commenced race, in such sort that thou shalt not repent thine indulgence nor I my passed pains.

For the people being humbled, and hauing called to the Lord for mercie and succour at his hand, hee both heard and succoured them at neede. The meane was not through strength or stoutnesse of some worthy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; but by the hand of <hi>Iudith,</hi> a tender feeble woman, to the shame of this most proud and cruell tyrant, and all his heathen hoste. For shee cut off his head, put all his campe to slight, destroyed his men of Armes, in such wise that they fled here and there; and, seeking to saue their liues, left all their tentes and baggage. Thus the Lorde, by the weake, and those that are not regarded, makes his workes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable. By one selfe meane hee saued his owne, and executed his iustice against his enemies. In which wee haue to consider his singular ptouidence and goodnesse, and the care which he hath in especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for his faithfull, and all his whole Church. This Historie is intituled by the name of <hi>Iudith,</hi> because it containes the narration of her great vertues, and
<pb facs="tcp:11251:460"/>
for that the Lorde vsed her as an instrument for the deliuerance of his people. It is not certaine who was the first Author hereof: neuerthelesse the reading of it hath beene receiued in the Church, for the doctrine and vtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the same.</p>

Yet such is the estate of Gods Church in this world, that when all things faileth, God manifesteth his power.

After her entrance to the Camp, she is brought to <hi>Holophernes,</hi> who was curious to knowe the cause of her comming there. And after audience giuen, he is so surprised with her beutie and eloquent language, that she obtaineth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to withdrawe herself by night to the next valley, there to pray to God. And, continuing this exercise, she requireth strength of the Hyest, that in taking away the chieftaine, she might at one instant destroy all the <hi>Heathen</hi> Army. Herein giuing example that the beginning, and end of all high attempts, ought to be grounded vpon the fauour and earnest calling vpon him, without whome all wisedome, and humaine force is nothing but winde: and who, contrariwise, may by the most feeble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of the world, execute things most incredible and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible to humaine capacity.</p>

                     <hi>HOlophernes,</hi> being surprised with the sweete language, and excellent beautie of the chaste <hi>Iudith,</hi> becommeth altogether negligent of his charge and gouernement. Wherein is represented the vnhabilitie of the reprobate, who cannot withstand such temptations as the Lord sendeth vpon them. But as they become slaues to their owne affections, so by the same they are enforced to fall into perdition. In place of some faithfull seruant to warne him of his vices, <hi>Holophernes</hi> conferreth with <hi>Bagos</hi> an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who feedeth him in his humour, &amp; bringeth <hi>Iudith</hi> to his Tent. And here the Poet reprooues all flatterers and bawdes, with the vices of all Courts in Generall. <hi>Iudith</hi> seeing her chastitie in perill, and the time vnmeete to execute her enterprise: subtilie drawes the Tyrant to talke of other affaires. He thinking to insinuate himselfe the more into her fauour, taketh pleasure to crack of his conquests and of his speciall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse; discoursing so long till suppertime approached &amp; she auoyded the inconuenience. And here is to be noted, that whilest the tyrants boast of their cruelty against the Church, God prouideth for his owne, &amp; preserueth them for that worke, that he hath ordained by them to be done.</p>

And whereas the <hi>Tyrant</hi> thought by such excesse to ouercome the chaste wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow: himself is so ouer come with wine, that vpon a very simple delay he lets her goe till he was in his bed. And here is noted that the snares that the wicked laies for others, they fal in them their selfs. Whiles the <hi>Tyrant</hi> contemplated his lust, <hi>Iudith</hi> in trouble called vpon her God, who made way for her works through the <hi>Tyrants</hi> owne wickednesse: who heaping sin vpon sin, approched at last to the end of his tragoedy: and mounting vpon the skaffolde of the yre of God, falls asleep in his sinfull bed, and is by <hi>Iudith</hi> beheaded in his beastly drunkennes. True it is that in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution she felt her great infirmity: but likewise she found that God was able to strengthen the most feeble for the execution of his Iustice. And as before she was preserued in the midst of her enemies: so the Lord to make a miraculous end of his work, brings her safe home to her people. The <hi>Bethulians</hi> giues thankes to God. The <hi>Ammonit</hi> ranished with this miracle, embraced the true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And that was Gods Iustice, that those that had followed this <hi>Tyrant</hi> in his wickednes should be compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his death. <hi>Iudith</hi> last of all celebrates the deliuerance of God, with a song, to the honour and glorie of his almighty name.</p>
