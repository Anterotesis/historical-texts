            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

thr√©e or fowre of the Bi≈øhoppes owne ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, who had made no fal≈øe report of theyr Mai≈øter, before in my matters: but as they wrote home to Dure≈øme, to theyr companions, what thinges I ≈øhould be charged with all, and what ≈øhould be my iudgement, ≈øo afterward I found it true. And therefore vpon the monday at after noone, which was the thyrtie of October, after it was tolde me by a fr√©end of mine, dwelling in London, who was familliar in the Bi≈øhoppes hou≈øe, and at that tyme frequented it the more, to heare ≈øomwhat as touching me, that he had learned, and was crediblie enformed, both that all my goodes at Dure≈øme, was ≈øea≈øed on in the Qu√©enes graces name, and that I my ≈øelfe ≈øhould on the morrow be committed to the Tower: both becau≈øe I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the Qu√©enes highne≈ø≈øe Letters, and al≈øo for that I was a Scotte. I ≈øaye, after I heard the≈øe thinges, con≈øidering how many godlie learned preachers were impri≈øoned, and commaunded to theyr hou≈øes for religion without all doubt, and yet an other pretence made, perceyuing, that abiding could not profit my ≈øelfe, nor yet the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, my departure might

doo both: I committed my ≈øelfe to the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Lord, and went my waies, not making any man priuy to my departure. Meruaile not good brethren, though after that I was entred into my iourney, I were troubled with ≈øundrie cares, but ch√©efely with this, lea≈øt that I ≈øhould now be apprehended by mine enimies, and ≈øo giue them that they would haue b√©en glad of, ≈øome hone≈øt colour, wherefore they might haue ≈ø√©emed iu≈øtly to haue wrought on me theyr will.

But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Lord had deliuered me, at the lea≈øt, for this time, out of the mouth of the

Lyon, and ≈øaued me out of the handes of all mine enimies, which hated me: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ≈øtudy with my ≈øelfe, and more dilligently con≈øider, to what end GOD had wrought thus my deliuerance, which was not that I ≈øhould nowe liue as one that had no regard of Gods glorie, nor of mine owne duety. But that, as I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be a workman in his vineyard, and a watchman ouer the hou≈øe of I≈ørael: ≈øo I ≈øhould now mo≈øt earne≈øtly hunt tho≈øe wilde ≈øwine that de≈øtroyeth the Lordes vineyard, gather togeather (≈øo much as in me lieth) the Lordes ≈øh√©epe, that now are di≈øper≈øed thorow out mountaines, hylles, and groues, and to giue them warning of the feareful ≈øword that hangeth ouer their heades.

            <p>This cau≈øe con≈øtraineth vs at this time, to tarie longer in the declaration of this matter, that euerie man may knowe, his owne duetie, and deceyue not him≈øelfe, thinking that he is e≈øcaped, when he is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, as the common ≈øaying is, vnder a wet ≈øacke.

to confe≈ø≈øe this that I ≈øaye, that the Ma≈ø≈øe by it ≈øelfe, is a deniall of Ie≈øus Chri≈øtes death, and a certaine Sacriledge inuented and ordeined by Sathan, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhe the Sacrament of the Supper. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they able to deny, but that theyr inuocation of Saints, and Suffrages for the dead, are wicked abu≈øes, whereby the inuocation of Gods name, a thing of all other mo≈øt holy is prophaned. And they, who among the Papi≈øtes, doo defile them ≈øelues with the≈øe abhominations, doo thinke them≈øelues guilty of no fault.</p>
            <p>What ≈øhould we doo, ≈øaye they? It is not lawfull for vs to correct and amende tho≈øe thinges, which we knowe euill and faultie, we are priuate men, and they that haue the power and publique aucthoritie, doo earne≈øtly defend the≈øe thinges. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we mu≈øt ≈øuffer that violent nece≈ø≈øity. I graunt all this to be true. But I ≈øaye this is not to the purpo≈øe. It belongeth not to theyr office, to correct and appoint a common order for the people, neyther dooth any man require this at theyr hand, yet neuerthele≈ø≈øe, they are admoni≈øhed to amende them≈øelues, and to in≈øtitute an hone≈øt and mannerly behauiour of priuate

lyfe, which thing without all doubt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth to theyr duetie.</p>
            <p>Neyther doo wee commaund them, to clean≈øe the Temples and the common ≈øtr√©etes, but that euerie man k√©epe, his owne body and heart in puritie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and labour by all meanes that God maye be honoured, ≈øerued, and obeyed, in his owne hou≈øe. For the≈øe are farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, and much di≈ø≈øonaunt, to aboli≈øhe the Ma≈ø≈øe in any Region, and not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent at it, when as the v≈øe thereof, and that Religion can by no other meanes be letted. But they repeate and iterate theyr ≈øaying, that is, that they doo not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the death and pa≈ø≈øion of Ie≈øus Chri≈øte, ≈ø√©eing, they haue no ≈øuch purpo≈øe, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip it in theyr minde.</p>
            <p>But I doo a≈øke of them, what is that a Chri≈øtian man dooth confe≈ø≈øe with his mouth, but that ≈øame that he bel√©eueth in his heart? This is plaine and manife≈øt inough, that this thing which they doo, is mo≈øt di≈øagr√©eing with the confe≈ø≈øion of faith. So that, as much as in them lyeth, they doo not onely hide the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per te≈øtimony of faith, but al≈øo doo vtterlie deny and for≈øake it. I wyll yet talke

with them ≈øomething, more familliarlie and plainelie. For the Papi≈øtes doo ≈øay, the Ma≈ø≈øe is a Sacrifice, wherein they will offer Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, to reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues to God.</p>
            <p>But if this be ≈øo, it followeth, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt hath not obtayned vnto vs, by his death, righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and eternall ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Let them ≈øeeke all the compa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes and ≈øhiftes they will, yet mu≈øt they come h√©erevnto, that all which goe to Ma≈ø≈øe, vnder the name of deuotion and Religion, doo profe≈ø≈øe that they con≈øent therewith. Therefore as much truelie as in them lyeth, they ≈øhewe that they haue not their redemption perfect inough, by the death of Ie≈øus Chri≈øte.</p>

            <p>We (≈øaye they) ≈ø√©eke the Supper of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øte, and when we cannot, being oppre≈øt vnder that tyranny, wherein we dwell, haue the ≈øame pure, we mu≈øt be content with that which is left to vs, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for the helping hand of God.

without ≈øword or buckler, they bring and obiect the aucthoritie of this or that man, as though the ab≈øolution of any one man, may exempt and delyuer them, that they be not condemned of God.

            <p>But in ca≈øe it were ≈øo, that a deuoute and godly man, were ≈øometime of this mind, that he thought it was nothing euil to come to the high Ma≈ø≈øe, yet afterward when he knoweth the trueth, if he dooth di≈øalowe and condemne his former iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his later is ≈øo much the more to be bel√©eued, for that God hath brought him, or rather compelled him to di≈øalowe the ≈øame: and becau≈øe hee perceyueth, and plainely knoweth, that he is ouercome in that thing which he before did greatlie embrace and allowe.</p>
            <p>But what n√©ede we h√©erein to ≈øtyrre the truth, as if we ≈øhould blonder and trouble a water that is pure and cleare.

in iudgement ought to preuaile, without the re≈øpect of any per≈øon.

in the Sacrament of the Supper a right, they ≈øodeinlie ≈øhake off and for≈øake the high Ma≈ø≈øe. But we ≈øhould not meruaile at ≈øuch incon≈øtancie, for this is a ≈øure and due puni≈øhment, for them which haue layde no foundation at any tyme of truth in theyr minds, that they ≈øhould alwaies wauer, and be contrarie to them≈øelues, in all things that they doo, and take in hand. As touching that ≈øame hypocritical Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I knowe that they be of this minde, that they ≈øuppo≈øe it to be the greate≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to them≈øelues that may be, when it is rebuked and improoued. But what can we doo in that matter, ≈ø√©eing it is nothing agr√©eable to Chri≈øtes rule? Neither doo I finde fault with this, that they doo it ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlie, for I knowe that the Supper was neuer better celebrated, nor more deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, then when the Di≈øciples went into ≈øome ≈øecrete place, to ≈ølie the tyranny of the enimie.</p>
            <p>But h√©ere are two faultes, truely not to be ≈øuffered. One, that they which doo make ≈øuch a Supper, and lyke apes doo fal≈øelie and corruptlie counterfeite, the true Supper of Chri≈øte, doo feine that they k√©epe and wor≈øhippe theyr Ma≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11166:43"/>The other is, that the Mini≈øter, which for the mo≈øt part is ≈øome Religious man, the rather to di≈ø≈øemble the matter, dooth not that office as a Chri≈øtian, but as a Prie≈øt of the popi≈øhe profe≈ø≈øion: and in this they ≈øuppo≈øe they haue an hone≈øt and ≈øure defence, if the Ma≈ø≈øe ≈øayer haue not this purpo≈øe, to ≈øhew the bread and wine to them to be wor≈øhipped, if he leaue out the Canon, wherein are conteined many great impieties, and if he delyuer the Sacrament to all that be pre≈øent vnder both kindes.</p>
            <p>But when they ≈øhall come before the highe≈øt Iudge, then ≈øhall they f√©ele the fruite that they ≈øought, by ≈øuch glo≈øing and lyes, yea truely, they ought now alreadie to perceyue it. For I doo iudge, tho≈øe ≈øame goades and prickes, wherwith theyr con≈øciences are prickt and wounded, to be a gr√©euous f√©eling of the ≈øame iudgement. And truely this cau≈øe mu≈øt be decided, and plainely debated in that ≈øame place and court, where the trueth hath her graue and true witne≈ø≈øes. For to be ≈øhort, they doo knowe them≈øelues guiltie of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they haue purpo≈øed to declare, both to Gods enimies, and al≈øo to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

people. But God mu≈øt n√©edes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him≈øelfe, if he alowe the order and doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that profe≈ø≈øion. If all the men in the world, with one minde and purpo≈øe, would con≈øpyre to pronounce the≈øe men righteous: yet none be he neuer ≈øo ready and mightie, can excu≈øe and delyuer them from this, but they ≈øhalbe thought to halt on both ≈øides. And GOD dooth declare by his Prophete, that no ≈øuch halting of any man, ≈øhall be euer allowed before him.</p>
            <p>As touching the man, whome they choo≈øe to be the Mini≈øter of theyr Supper, it is a fooli≈øh thing to abu≈øe his per≈øon, as though they could ≈ø√©eme to make him an apt man to that office and function. Yea, but the vertue of that ≈øame Sacrament (≈øay they) re≈øteth not in the woorthine≈ø≈øe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters.

            <p>To conclude, all ie≈øters, and praters, let them holde theyr tongue, and boa≈øt not out theyr merie wittie ≈øayinges, vnle≈ø≈øe they will f√©ele his mightie hand, at who≈øe word they ought to tremble.

            <p>As for all others, which doo not ≈øo proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie de≈øpy≈øe Gods word, and yet are ≈øo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and weake, that they can in no wi≈øe
