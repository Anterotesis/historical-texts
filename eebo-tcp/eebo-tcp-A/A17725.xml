            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But eſpecially, when I ſawe the Lords table, whereon was miniſtred the holy Supper of the Lord, according to his owne inſtitution &amp; ordinance, was caried away, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion abhorred as hereſie, and for theſe, <hi>Baals</hi> altars reared vp: and his Prieſts &amp; monkiſh hipocrites, returned to theyr abhominable, blaſphemous, and idolatrous Maſſe, as Dogs to their vomit. Wherefore, I began to recorde with my ſelfe, &amp; call to my remembrance (not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

earneſt calling on Gods name, for the aſſiſtaunce of his ſpirit) mine owne ſtate &amp; condition, and to examine more déepelie, both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine which I had taught, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I perceyued, that of neceſſitie I muſt render an account, and that within ſhort time, and alſo my duty of allegaunce vnto the Quéens highneſſe, wherin I found my ſelfe ſo cleare &amp; blameles: that if the deuil himſelfe, and all mine enimies, ſhould doo theyr worſt, they could not haue accuſed me iuſtlie, neither of word nor déede, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated againſt her grace. And as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the doctrine which I had taught, the more dilligentlie I did examine it by the holie Scriptures, and the teſtimony of the auncient Fathers, the more ſincere and pure it appeared: I was the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly perſwaded, and ſetled in the trueth thereof, my conſcience dyd more plainelie laye to my charge, that I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke, ſaye againſt, nor diſſemble it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blaſphemous contempt of God,<note place="margin">No man can ſpeake againſt the truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great blaſphemy to God.</note> and moſt horrible deniall of his Sonne Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte. So that I found no fault in my ſelfe, as touching my preaching: but that as an vnprofitable Seruaunt, I dyd not ſo much as I ought to haue
<pb facs="tcp:11166:6"/>
doone, although I had doone much more, then ſome thought I ſhould haue thanks for. But what ſoeuer men thought or ſpake, as touching thankefull reward for my labour, I perſwaded my ſelfe, that I ſhould haue all thinges weied after equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and therefore conſidering both mine owne integritie, that I had offended no law of the Realme, but liued like an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſubiect, and alſo that the ſame men bare the chéefe rule vnder the Quéenes highnes, and ſhould be my Iudges, as did know that the ſword was deliuered them, for the defence of the good &amp; obedient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect: ſo ſoone as I heard tell, that I was exempted the Quéenes highnes pardon, I tooke my iourney towardes London, with ſo much conuenient ſpéede as I might. Where I found all thinges farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then I would haue beléeued, if I had not béen put in experience therof my ſelfe. For I found in the place of equitie, preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: for lawe, luſt: for reaſon, will: and ſuch as ſhould haue giuen ſentence, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as matter had béen obiected and iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prooued, plaide both the part of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer, of the witneſſes, &amp; alſo of the Iudge: and gaue this ſentence immediatlie, that
<pb facs="tcp:11166:6"/>
I ſhould eyther vndoo that I had doone, or elſe: what that or elſe meant, I knewe well inough, for I had the expoſition ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by his owne holie ghoſt. Then my good L. Chancelour (who was alwaies ſure at a néede, perceiuing that I ſtood to this, that I had offended no law, to helpe at a pinch) obiected, yea, thrée or fowre times for fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a mater no leſſe malicious then falſe. And becauſe nothing ſhould be lefte out, that might helpe foreward the mater, this good olde father of Dureſme (who had plaide thrée partes before, right well) char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me with a matter, not onely malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; falſe, but ſo fooliſhe, that I had much to doo to refraine my ſelfe from laughter, I could not chuſe but ſmile. At the laſt, my L. Chancelour, after certaine talk had vnto me, and mine anſwer made, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it was not only preaching, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I ſhould be charged, the which hee perceiued I ſufficientlie defended by the Kings lawe (in déede I had aſked counſel, of them that were learned in the lawes of the Realme) but alſo matters touching the Quéenes highneſſe, which were the ſame, wherwith he and the Biſhop of Dureſme had charged mee before, as I learned by
<pb facs="tcp:11166:7"/>
thrée or fowre of the Biſhoppes owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, who had made no falſe report of theyr Maiſter, before in my matters: but as they wrote home to Dureſme, to theyr companions, what thinges I ſhould be charged with all, and what ſhould be my iudgement, ſo afterward I found it true. And therefore vpon the monday at after noone, which was the thyrtie of October, after it was tolde me by a fréend of mine, dwelling in London, who was familliar in the Biſhoppes houſe, and at that tyme frequented it the more, to heare ſomwhat as touching me, that he had learned, and was crediblie enformed, both that all my goodes at Dureſme, was ſeaſed on in the Quéenes graces name, and that I my ſelfe ſhould on the morrow be committed to the Tower: both becauſe I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the Quéenes highneſſe Letters, and alſo for that I was a Scotte. I ſaye, after I heard theſe thinges, conſidering how many godlie learned preachers were impriſoned, and commaunded to theyr houſes for religion without all doubt, and yet an other pretence made, perceyuing, that abiding could not profit my ſelfe, nor yet the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, my departure might

            <p>I muſt néedes héere giue the Noble men warning of that I heard,<note place="margin">A note of the Aurhor, to the noble men.</note> becauſe I loue

At my laſt béeing at London, waitinge at the Parliament houſe of my Lordes of the Counſell, as I was commaunded, I met with a familiar acquaintaunce of myne, although not of my opinion in Religion, but one, that for the matters of Religion, dooth fauour the Popiſh Biſhoppes, and is both familier with the beſt of them, and alſo taken to bee a wiſe man, and of a great foreſight, as he is indéede. He aſked me of my ſtate, ſaying thus vnto mée, did not I tell you, that your Religion would not continue? And ſo would haue perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mée to haue giuen place, and reuoked myne opinion: wherein when he ſawe he preuailed not, he ſaid fréendly, he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for mee, and wiſhed that hee were of power to doo me pleaſure: to whom I ſaid, it was ſufficient to me, that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his familiar fréendſhip with mee: and there vpon I charged him (as I was often wont) of fréendſhip to tell mée, what he thought of our Biſhoplike procéedings.
<pb facs="tcp:11166:21"/>
Whereto he aunſwered, as in matters of Religion, very well. But in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters nothing ſo. For, ſaith he, I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred talke with ſome, that be moſt nigh of their Counſell, and I perceiue this by all their procéedinges and purpoſes, that they are fully be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to ſet vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, as high as euer they were, aboue the Laity, &amp; I haue good reaſons that mooueth me alſo to thinke this to be true. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I ſaid, that can neuer bee brought to paſſe: For although the Noble men doo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour their Religion, yet will they neuer ſuffer them to clime ſo high againe. Tuſh, ſaith he, they ſhall firſt of al helpe them to bring to paſſe at this Parliament, that they would, and then they will haue their heades off one after an other. What, ſaid I, they will neuer ſo doo, for the Nobilitie fauoureth them. Yea ſaith he, and they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour ſome of them againe. But they looue none of them all ſo well, but they looue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues better. They ſée that the whole youth of the Realme, and eſpecially of the Noble, &amp; the worſhipful are infected with this hereſy, &amp; new learning, and they ſhall hereafter vndoo againe, all that they now doo, and then the latter end ſhall be worſe
<pb facs="tcp:11166:22"/>
then the beginning, and therefore, wyll they chop of the heads of the Fathers, and thereby both their children are diſenheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſhalbe able to doo no harme, &amp; alſo they may in their place, make Noble men of their owne kindred and fréends. What (ſaide I) it were too much cruelty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he ſayeth, yea, yea, they thinke it is better an inconuenience, then a miſchéefe. God deliuer the noble blood of England, out of the daunger of theſe diſſembling woolues. But let the Noble men conſider, how many of their owne fréendes, &amp; moſt déere dearlinges, with whome they were ioyned in confederacie for the biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> wretched Wincheſter, and deuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh dreaming Dureſme, haue brought to confuſion, and they ſhall haue ſufficient warning, how they may truſt theſe bloody butchers.

He inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the waies he could, to bring me to reuoke the trueth: he cauſed two Noble men to charge me with preaching, as he termed it hereſie, he himſelfe accuſed me, that I had infected his whole dioces with new learning: but when that would not ſerue, becauſe I had doon nothing, but that was confirmed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of the Realme, he was not aſhamed to lay to my charge, that I was not an Engliſhe man borne: that I had exerciſed his office in his biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricke, that I had brought in a wife of mine owne into that Church, where ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer woman came before. And then the L. Chauncelour chargeth me with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Quéenes highnes, as though I ſhould haue receiued thrée letters of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundment, to repayre and make mine appearaunce before the Councell, and would appeare for none of them. If both theſe butchers, had béene ſo well knowne to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, for rancke tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to the Crowne of England, as they were in déede, which nowe they ſhewe plainlie, as I am well knowne to be a meere naturall Engliſh man, they ſhould neuer haue brought that noble Realme,
<pb facs="tcp:11166:23"/>
now in daunger to bee ouer runne, and conquered with ſtraungers: the which thing men that be halfe blind, may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee they goe about. I neuer meddled with his office, I was in daunger of much diſpleaſure, as the honorable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell did well knowe, becauſe I would not take vpon me his office. And herein he vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth his malitious hipocriſie, and what an vnſhamefaſt bawde hee hath béene, is, and wilbe, to the Monkes of Dureſme, when he ſaith, there came neuer woman within that houſe, before my wife came there. For he knoweth right well, that the Churche of Dureſme, was repleniſhed with maried Préeſtes. For Biſhoppe <hi>William,</hi> by the helpe of <hi>Lanfrank</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> did obtaine lycence from Pope <hi>Hilderand</hi> to baniſhe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Préeſtes, and to bring Monkes from <hi>Warmouth</hi> and <hi>Iarrow.</hi> And alſo it is not vnknowen to him, nor to his Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, nor to any one of his officers, that euery Monke of them al for the moſt part, hath a Concubine in the towne, who hath come, and dooth come, to their Church and Chamber, and no fault found, but that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men of the towne, and alſo of the

Countrie are offended there with, but dare ſay nothing, for feare of the great bawde their Patrone. Yea the Biſhoppe and his Monkes knewe full well, that I did knowe to much of their iugling, and therefore it was time to rid mée out of the way.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Wincheſter</hi> came in alſo with his falſe accuſation, (for I neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued one letter nor token of commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, from her highnes, nor from her honourable Counſell, but a letter the poſt deliuered me by the way, as I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to London) and layd it earneſtly to my charge, as though I had béene a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne rebel, I perceiued they would ſerue me as they had doon others, I meane, to puniſh me for religion, and pretend trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and ſubornate two or thrée falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as they haue plenty in ſtore, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that I had made ſome offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the Quéenes highnes, as their great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires plaid with Chriſt, ſaying,<note place="margin">Math. 22.17</note>

my doctrine was neuer ſo pure, my heha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior neuer ſo vpright, and I neuer ſo able to aunſwere with trueth, to that was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected.

ſonnes: and to acknowledge with all kind of beneuolence, honour, and obedience, the ſame benefite which our moſt déere Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, did vouchſafe to beſtowe on vs, after he had bought it with ſo great a price. And becauſe we are bounde, not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all infidelitie, but alſo to ſeperate our ſelues from all ſuperſtitions, which do as well diſagree with the true ſeruice of God, as the honour of his Sonne, &amp; which can by no meanes agrée, with the pure doctrine of the Goſpel, and true confeſſion of the faith: I ſayd this doctrine of it ſelfe to be ſo eaſie, that onelie the practiſe and exerciſe therof, ought to remaine vnto vs, ſauing that many men doo ſéeke certayne deceytfull ſhiftes, thorow which they will not be ouercome in that thing, the which is moſt chéefely condemned, by Gods own mouth.</p>
            <p>This cauſe conſtraineth vs at this time, to tarie longer in the declaration of this matter, that euerie man may knowe, his owne duetie, and deceyue not himſelfe, thinking that he is eſcaped, when he is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, as the common ſaying is, vnder a wet ſacke.

Neither truely ought we to forget in the meane while our brethren, which are kept vnder the tiranny of Antichriſt, oppreſſed with moſt miſerable bondage, but to take care, remembraunce, &amp; pittie ouer them, and ſo pray God to ſtrengthen them with that conſtancye, which hee requireth in his worde. We muſt alſo admoniſhe and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite them by all wayes, not to reſt in places, where men are faſte on ſléepe in their voluptuouſnes, but to apply dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie thought this, and will, that they confeſſe the glorie, due vnto God.

            <p>And firſt in this place we muſt conſider, whether this be not Idolatrie, to ſignifie and declare by outward tokens, our agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with thoſe Superſtitions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſeruice of God is corrupted, and vtterlie peruerted.

            <p>What then? Surely, the chéefe honour that God requireth, is ſpirituall, but the outward ſignification, whereby the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doo teſtifie, that it is God onely whom they ſerue and honour, muſt ſo immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie followe, that they muſt at one tyme be ioyned together.

            <p>If theſe goodlie wittie Sophiſters, had béene there at that tyme, they would haue laught to ſcorne the ſimplicitie of theſe thrée ſeruauntes of God. For I ſuppoſe, they would haue taunted them with ſuch lyke wordes, you fooliſhe men, this truely is not to honour them, ſéeing you put no affiaunce in theſe thinges. There is no Idolatrie, but where there is deuotion, that is to ſaye, a certaine bending, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the mind, to honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Idolles. But theſe godlie men, dyd followe a better and wiſer councell: for this aunſwere which they made, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded not of theyr owne witte, but rather of the holy Ghoſt, which moued them thus to ſpeake, whome if we wyl not reſiſt, we muſt accept this place, and this example, as a certayne rule and definition, that Idolatrie is an outwarde action againſt Gods honour, yea, although it procéed not from the wyll and purpoſe of the minde, but be onelie colourable and feined. In which matter they make goodlie cauilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb facs="tcp:11166:30"/>
that there is no Idolatrie at all: when as our affiance is not put in Idols. Yet ſhall theſe men continuallie remaine condemned, by the ſentence which the mightieſt Iudge hath pronounced. But theſe men doo contende onelie for that name, onely going about ſomewhat to leſſon theyr faulte, which they can by no meanes defend nor excuſe. Yea, they will graunt that this thing is euill doone, and not rightlie: yet notwithſtanding, they would haue this fact to be iudged as a certaine veniall ſinne.</p>
            <p>But although we graunt them, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the name, that thing they aſke, yet they ſhal not get ſo much therby, that they may make theyr cauſe much the better. Let vs ſaye thus, that ſuch manner of fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned worſhipping of Idolles, is not called Idolatrie: yet neuertheleſſe, it ſhall be a trayterous enterpriſe againſt God, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fact repugnaunt to the confeſſion of faith, and a fowle filthy pollution, moſt full of wicked ſacriledge.</p>
            <p>I praye you, when the moſt ſacred ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and honour of God is ſo violated, that we falſelie breake that promiſe we made to him, that thorow cowardiſe and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

            <p>Beſides this, theyr impudencie is ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and ſhamefull, that I am aſhamed to diſpute againſt it, as though it had ſome colour or lykeneſſe of reaſon, yet I muſt néedes doo it, ſéeing they doo pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo greatlie, and are, as it were men droonken in their own opinions and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, fallen faſt on ſléepe.</p>

            <p>Go too, let vs procéede further. Although I ſhould graunt the Idolatrie of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes to be vnlyke, and differre from the
<pb facs="tcp:11166:35"/>
ſuperſtition of the olde Gentyles,<note place="margin">God dooth forbid falſe religion.</note> yet can they not deny, but God ſo earneſtly dyd forbidde the Religion, wickedly ſet vp in Bethel, as all other ſuperſtitions which were inſtituted and celebrated in other places.</p>
            <p>When the Calues were erected in Dan and Bethel, this was inſtituted and done vnder a certaine colour of his name, which had brought his people out of Egipt, and yet the ſame Religion which was there appointed, is manifeſtly againſt the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the lawe. God dooth condemne all thoſe that goeth thyther, to defyle and pollute themſelues.</p>
            <p>And truely, the Supper of Ieſus Chriſt and the popiſhe Maſſe, are no leſſe repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt and contrarie, the one to the other, then the Sacrifices of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi> From whence then is this diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and lycenſe, to goe and heare Maſſe vnder this colour, that the Supper of Ieſus Chriſte is but tranſfourmed, yea, rather in déede defourmed? But I ſaye and affyrme contrariwiſe, that all they that doo feare GOD truelie, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him godlilie, ought ſo much the more to hate and deteſt it, for that it dooth
<pb facs="tcp:11166:36"/>
more openly violate and prophane the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtitution of Ieſus Chriſte, then if it were not ſo repugnaunt and contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame. Wherefore, let vs kéepe this common rule generally, that all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and inuencions of men, proponed and taken in hande, to corrupt the ſimple trueth of Gods worde, and to peruert that Religion which he requireth and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, are verie ſacriledges, with which the Chriſtian man, may in no wiſe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, without that iniurie and contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, which treadeth vnder féete Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour moſt wickedlie.</p>
            <p>I know wel inough, how gréeuous and vntollerable, this ſeuere iudgement ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to them, which would after theyr owne luſt and delycate minde, be more nicely and méekely ſpoken too and taught. VVherein, what would they I ſhould doo? What moderation and lenity ſhould I vſe? Truely, now I perceyue how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and deinty they are, I couet ſo much as may be to ſpare them, but both I and they muſt be condemned ſo ſoone as God hath ſpoken: therefore if we wyll tender our owne ſaluation, let vs take it in good part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11166:36"/>They ſaye, they finde no man more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere and ſharpe then I am, but I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto them, on the other part, that I handle them more méekely and tenderlie, then the trueth of the cauſe, the woorthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Gods name, and theyr ſaluation, dyd require. Which thing beeing ſo in déede, truely they cannot excuſe and dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themſelues, from the neceſſitie of that duetie and teſtimony, that the Prophete <hi>Ieremie</hi> dooth require of the <hi>Iewes, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues in Babylon,</hi> whome hee not onelie forbiddeth to come néere the abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> or colourablie or fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedlie, to giue any conſent to them: but alſo doth giue a plaine commaundement, that they ſhould declare the wicked Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> to be vnto them a moſt filthy ſauour. <hi>You ſhall ſay to them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere. 10.11.</note> (ſayeth the Prophete <hi>Ieremie) the Gods which haue not made heauen and earth, ſhall periſh both out from the earth, and alſo from vnder heauen.</hi>

            <p>There is alſo in this place an other cyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunce to be marked, that when the Prophete had written his booke in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue, yet he put in this ſentence, expreſt in the common vulgar ſpéeche of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11166:37"/>
as though he would by this means, conſtraine the Iewes, to chaunge from theyr tongue, to the ende they might more apertlie profeſſe, the hatred and diſagrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they haue with the wicked Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours.</p>
            <p>Now let our nice yonglings complaine of me, as though my aduertiſement excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all meaſure, &amp; yet I haue not at any tyme deſired the halfe part of that duetie, which the Prophete requireth and aſketh ſo earneſtlie. But whatſoeuer be the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, eyther of my ſaying or moderation, or elſe of my ſilence and taciturnitie, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, we are tyed and bounde to that lawe, which God dooth giue vnto vs. And truelie, it is not without a cauſe, that God ſpeaking to his faithfull, ſayeth to them, <hi>You are my witneſſes, and my ſeruaunts whome I haue choſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, whoſoeuer will prooue him ſelfe to be a member of Ieſus Chriſte, ought by all meanes to declare, that the prayſe and honour of Gods name, dooth ſo appertayne to him, that they which by theyr feining, doo hide and burie the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his trueth, doo leaue themſelues inexcuſable.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:11166:37"/>What I praye you is to be thought, of them that doo all theyr lyfe tyme ſubuert the ſame? Of what ſorte are they, that doo not onelie hyde the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, and ſheweth no to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereof before men, but alſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth many thinges, and thoſe moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and vnſéemelie.

            <p>Let vs nowe come to ſhewe certaine kindes of Idolatries, which are of moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation in theſe dayes.

to confeſſe this that I ſaye, that the Maſſe by it ſelfe, is a deniall of Ieſus Chriſtes death, and a certaine Sacriledge inuented and ordeined by Sathan, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe the Sacrament of the Supper. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they able to deny, but that theyr inuocation of Saints, and Suffrages for the dead, are wicked abuſes, whereby the inuocation of Gods name, a thing of all other moſt holy is prophaned. And they, who among the Papiſtes, doo defile them ſelues with theſe abhominations, doo thinke themſelues guilty of no fault.</p>
            <p>What ſhould we doo, ſaye they? It is not lawfull for vs to correct and amende thoſe thinges, which we knowe euill and faultie, we are priuate men, and they that haue the power and publique aucthoritie, doo earneſtly defend theſe thinges. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſuffer that violent neceſſity. I graunt all this to be true. But I ſaye this is not to the purpoſe. It belongeth not to theyr office, to correct and appoint a common order for the people, neyther dooth any man require this at theyr hand, yet neuertheleſſe, they are admoniſhed to amende themſelues, and to inſtitute an honeſt and mannerly behauiour of priuate
<pb facs="tcp:11166:39"/>
lyfe, which thing without all doubt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth to theyr duetie.</p>
            <p>Neyther doo wee commaund them, to cleanſe the Temples and the common ſtréetes, but that euerie man kéepe, his owne body and heart in puritie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and labour by all meanes that God maye be honoured, ſerued, and obeyed, in his owne houſe. For theſe are farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, and much diſſonaunt, to aboliſhe the Maſſe in any Region, and not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at it, when as the vſe thereof, and that Religion can by no other meanes be letted. But they repeate and iterate theyr ſaying, that is, that they doo not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſte, ſéeing, they haue no ſuch purpoſe, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it in theyr minde.</p>
            <p>But I doo aſke of them, what is that a Chriſtian man dooth confeſſe with his mouth, but that ſame that he beléeueth in his heart? This is plaine and manifeſt inough, that this thing which they doo, is moſt diſagréeing with the confeſſion of faith. So that, as much as in them lyeth, they doo not onely hide the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per teſtimony of faith, but alſo doo vtterlie deny and forſake it. I wyll yet talke
<pb facs="tcp:11166:40"/>
with them ſomething, more familliarlie and plainelie. For the Papiſtes doo ſay, the Maſſe is a Sacrifice, wherein they will offer Ieſus Chriſt, to reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to God.</p>
            <p>But if this be ſo, it followeth, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath not obtayned vnto vs, by his death, righteouſneſſe, and eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Let them ſeeke all the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſhiftes they will, yet muſt they come héerevnto, that all which goe to Maſſe, vnder the name of deuotion and Religion, doo profeſſe that they conſent therewith. Therefore as much truelie as in them lyeth, they ſhewe that they haue not their redemption perfect inough, by the death of Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
            <p>There be many that ſpeake not ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, neyther ſuffer theyr talke to wander thorowout all ſortes of Maſſes, that is to ſaye, Sacriledges.

            <p>Although this ſimilitude dooth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée on euerie parte, becauſe that an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte ioyned in matrimonie to an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, wyll haue ſome ſhamefaſtneſſe and modeſtie, that ſhee wyll not ſette foorth and make her ſelfe common to all that commeth: but the pariſhe or high Maſſe, is an whoriſh Idolatry, of all other moſt common, ready and ſet foorth to all mennes deſyres and wicked luſtes: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe fylthie bawdes, doo colour and ſmoothe héere with this colour and
<pb facs="tcp:11166:41"/>
ſuch beautie, that they retaine ſtyll ſome reliques of Ieſus Chriſtes Supper. It is with theſe as with the Théefe, who brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and boſteth himſelfe then more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and gloriouſlie, when he hath wunne, and is cloathed with the ſpoyles of him, whome he hath ſlaine, and whoſe horſe he rydeth on.</p>
            <p>We (ſaye they) ſéeke the Supper of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, and when we cannot, being oppreſt vnder that tyranny, wherein we dwell, haue the ſame pure, we muſt be content with that which is left to vs, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for the helping hand of God. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth a goodly and prety excuſe. Becauſe they haue no right and perfect vſe, of the Supper, as though they had gotten a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſo: they witneſſe and openlie profeſſe, that they haue not Ieſus Chriſte, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and onelie Prieſt, and therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie wéeke doo ſéeke a new Sacrifice, to put away theyr ſinnes. For all this is in the high Maſſe, as well in that which is ſayde in the name of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> or for the dead. In which thing they feine themſelues to worſhippe an Idoll, and yet doo boaſt that they ſéeke Ieſus Chriſt: and becauſe they would not ſéeme to fight againſt GOD,
<pb facs="tcp:11166:41"/>
without ſword or buckler, they bring and obiect the aucthoritie of this or that man, as though the abſolution of any one man, may exempt and delyuer them, that they be not condemned of God. I wyll not ſaye, that they lie egregiouſlie, when they alledge ſuch men as they doo, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of theyr cauſe.</p>
            <p>But in caſe it were ſo, that a deuoute and godly man, were ſometime of this mind, that he thought it was nothing euil to come to the high Maſſe, yet afterward when he knoweth the trueth, if he dooth diſalowe and condemne his former iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his later is ſo much the more to be beléeued, for that God hath brought him, or rather compelled him to diſalowe the ſame: and becauſe hee perceyueth, and plainely knoweth, that he is ouercome in that thing which he before did greatlie embrace and allowe.</p>
            <p>But what néede we héerein to ſtyrre the truth, as if we ſhould blonder and trouble a water that is pure and cleare. Doo they thinke that with the iudgement and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mortall man, they maye ſtoppe God and hedge him in? We knowe that there is nothing beſides the trueth, that
<pb facs="tcp:11166:42"/>
in iudgement ought to preuaile, without the reſpect of any perſon. This matter is ſuch, that the pariſhe or high Maſſe, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to ſacrifice Ieſus Chriſte, and to reconcile the fauour of GOD, both for quicke and dead, and alſo that a péece of breade ſhould be there worſhipped, as though it were the ſonne of God. I doo not examine thorowlie, all the abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and wickedneſſe, that are in that Maſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they be almoſt innumerable. But I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> rehearſe onelie the worſſer and groſſer. Now let them that doo but feine a conſent with ſuch wickedneſſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, waſhe theyr hands ſo cleane as they will, yet ſhall they neuer be more iuſt and innocent then <hi>Pilate.</hi> But this is a meruaile, that theſe good and religious pariſhioners at Eaſter tyme, doo ſéeke, ſome by Chappell, or ſome mockchriſtian Monke, which may prepare &amp; deliuer vnto them the apiſh and counterfeit ſupper. If the high Maſſe is moſt néereſt the Supper of Ieſus Chriſte, as they ſay it is, why doo they not obſerue and kéepe it? But nowe after that they haue beene at the highe Maſſe, euerie Sundaye thorow the yéere, becauſe they would ſéem to communicate
<pb facs="tcp:11166:42"/>
in the Sacrament of the Supper a right, they ſodeinlie ſhake off and forſake the high Maſſe. But we ſhould not meruaile at ſuch inconſtancie, for this is a ſure and due puniſhment, for them which haue layde no foundation at any tyme of truth in theyr minds, that they ſhould alwaies wauer, and be contrarie to themſelues, in all things that they doo, and take in hand. As touching that ſame hypocritical Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I knowe that they be of this minde, that they ſuppoſe it to be the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie to themſelues that may be, when it is rebuked and improoued. But what can we doo in that matter, ſéeing it is nothing agréeable to Chriſtes rule? Neither doo I finde fault with this, that they doo it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlie, for I knowe that the Supper was neuer better celebrated, nor more deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, then when the Diſciples went into ſome ſecrete place, to ſlie the tyranny of the enimie.</p>
            <p>But héere are two faultes, truely not to be ſuffered. One, that they which doo make ſuch a Supper, and lyke apes doo falſelie and corruptlie counterfeite, the true Supper of Chriſte, doo feine that they kéepe and worſhippe theyr Maſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11166:43"/>The other is, that the Miniſter, which for the moſt part is ſome Religious man, the rather to diſſemble the matter, dooth not that office as a Chriſtian, but as a Prieſt of the popiſhe profeſſion: and in this they ſuppoſe they haue an honeſt and ſure defence, if the Maſſe ſayer haue not this purpoſe, to ſhew the bread and wine to them to be worſhipped, if he leaue out the Canon, wherein are conteined many great impieties, and if he delyuer the Sacrament to all that be preſent vnder both kindes.</p>
            <p>But when they ſhall come before the higheſt Iudge, then ſhall they féele the fruite that they ſought, by ſuch gloſing and lyes, yea truely, they ought now alreadie to perceyue it. For I doo iudge, thoſe ſame goades and prickes, wherwith theyr conſciences are prickt and wounded, to be a gréeuous féeling of the ſame iudgement. And truely this cauſe muſt be decided, and plainely debated in that ſame place and court, where the trueth hath her graue and true witneſſes. For to be ſhort, they doo knowe themſelues guiltie of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they haue purpoſed to declare, both to Gods enimies, and alſo to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:11166:43"/>
people. But God muſt néedes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelfe, if he alowe the order and doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that profeſſion. If all the men in the world, with one minde and purpoſe, would conſpyre to pronounce theſe men righteous: yet none be he neuer ſo ready and mightie, can excuſe and delyuer them from this, but they ſhalbe thought to halt on both ſides. And GOD dooth declare by his Prophete, that no ſuch halting of any man, ſhall be euer allowed before him.</p>
            <p>As touching the man, whome they chooſe to be the Miniſter of theyr Supper, it is a fooliſh thing to abuſe his perſon, as though they could ſéeme to make him an apt man to that office and function. Yea, but the vertue of that ſame Sacrament (ſay they) reſteth not in the woorthineſſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. That I graunt and adde this too alſo, if any deuill ſhould miniſter the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it ſhould be neuer the worſe. On the contrary parte, if an Angell ſing Maſſe, yet then ſhould it be no whit the better.

the Sacramentes, for the vices of the Miniſters, as though wee doo héere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the proper ſinnes of euerie man, and not rather the common ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>I doo paſſe ouer this matter ſhortly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which is ſpoken, is ſufficient inough, to conuince ſo fowle and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full impudencie.

            <p>Which is a cauſe, why S. <hi>Paule</hi> dooth teſtifie, that he was ſent to turne the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull from their vanities, vnto the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, as though he would ſay, it is to no purpoſe, to chaunge ſome one olde and accuſtomed euyll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with other hypocriſies and feininges, but vtterly to aboliſhe all

ſuperſtitions, that the true Religion may be ſet in her owne puritie and holineſſe. For without this Faith and integritie, men neuer come the right way vnto God, but doo alwayes wauer &amp; are vncertaine, to what part they may turne themſelues. There be others that are come thus farre, that they diſalowe and refuſe the Maſſe, but they would haue ſome patches kepte ſtyll, which they call Gods ſeruice, leaſt as ſome men ſaye, they ſhould ſéeme to be deſtitute of all Religion. And it may be, that ſome of theſe be mooued with a godly minde and zeale: at the leaſt I wyll ſo thinke, but whatſoeuer theyr zeale and purpoſe be, yet maye we not ſaye, that they kéepe the true rule or any good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>Many ſaye we may come to theyr bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes, becauſe there is no manifeſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie in them.

            <p>It was alſo a manner vſed among the Gentiles, and wherby they compelled the weake men to denie God. And for this cauſe, the greateſt parte of Martyrs dyd ſuffer death conſtauntlie, for that they would not make perfumes, and burn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet they thinke we ought, to hide and couer this ſo great wickedneſſe and miſchéefe.</p>
            <p>But I beſéeche them, in the honourable and holie name of God, that they wyll dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlie marke this ſaying of the Pſalm:

            <p>But to ſpeake plainlie and fréely what I thinke of all theſe, which ſéeke a meane way, betwixt GOD and the deuill: they haue double and variable mindes, and I cannot finde out a more apt and fitte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to ſet them out, and paint them in theyr liuelie colours, then that ſame which may be brought of <hi>Eſau,</hi> that ſame filthie and double man.<note place="margin">Gene. 28.6, 7, 8, 9.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Euen ſo, they that are wrapped vp in the world, that they can in no wiſe follow God, doo mingle and toſſe together, many and diuerſe kindes of Religions and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, that they may applie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues by ſome waye, to the will of God, and they alwayes kéepe ſtyll ſome corruption, ſo that whatſoeuer they doo, cannot appeare to be pure and ſincere. I knowe alſo right well, that there be in thoſe places many miſerable ſoules, which liue there in great difficulties and cares, which truelie coueteth to walke rightlie without hypocriſie, and yet cannot looſe themſelues, out of many doubtes and ſcruples, which is no meruaile in ſo great and horrible confuſion, as we ſée at this time in the Papiſme.</p>
            <p>Yea, I doo greatlie pittie theyr myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate, which ſéeke meanes whereby they maye ſerue God deuoutlie, and liue among the enimies of Faith, if it may be poſſible by any wayes. But what wyll we? I can doo nothing elſe to the one, or
<pb facs="tcp:11166:47"/>
to the other, but declare theyr errour and ſinne, that they themſelues may adde the remedie. If they come héereafter to aſke of me this or that, more dilligentlie and particularlie, I will ſend ſuch curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitours to the common rule which I haue of God.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake this, for that there be ſome of this ſort of men ſo importune, that if a man ſhould aunſwere all theyr difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and doubtes, he ſhould ſéeme neuer to make an ende of any thing. And me thinke ſuch men, maye well be compared to them, who after they be taught in a Sermon, to vſe ſober apparell, and dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the body, without all diſſolute and ſumptuous trimming, they would haue the Preacher, to make their hoſe and ſewe theyr ſhoes.</p>
            <p>Well, what muſt we doo then? In this matter, there is a certaine thing ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, wherevnto we ought to dyrect and conferre our whole minde, ſtudie, and thought. That is, that the zeale of Gods houſe may eate vp our heart, and ſo moue vs, that we beare and take vppon our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, all diſhonours, contumelies, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probries, which are doone moſt vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
<pb facs="tcp:11166:48"/>
againſt Gods holy name. When ſuch deſire of Gods honour, and feruent loue ſhalbe kindled in our hearts, not like drie ſtubble ſoone ſet on fyre, and eaſilie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, but lyke a fyre that burneth continuallie, a man ſhall be ſo farre from ſuffering, or approouing theſe abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherewith the name of GOD moſt ſhamefullie and vnwoorthilie is polluted, that when he ſhall beholde them, he ſhall be able in no wiſe to ſuffer diſſimulation, ſilence, and taciturnitie.</p>
            <p>And it is dilligentlie to be marked, that he ſayth, <hi>The zeale of Gods houſe:</hi> that we ſhould knowe that to be referred, vnto the outward order, which is inſtituted in the Church, that we ſhould exerciſe our ſelues in confeſſion of our Faith. I doo not weigh the mockers, which ſay, that I my ſelfe lyuing héere without any daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, yea, rather in great quietneſſe, doo talke goodlily of theſe matters.</p>
            <p>I am not hee, with whome theſe men haue any thing to doo: For this is well knowne, I haue héere no lande of mine owne. So may wee thinke and ſaye, of all theſe Philoſophers, which giue theyr iudgement without knowledge of the
<pb facs="tcp:11166:48"/>
cauſe.</p>
            <p>For ſeeing they will not heare GOD, who dooth now truely ſpeake ſo gently to them, to teache them: I doo declare the day and iudgement, at what time béeing cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before the iudgement ſeate of GOD, they ſhall heare that ſentence, againſt the which there ſhall bee no anſwer nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>For ſéeing they will not heare him, as the beſt and moſt méeke maiſter, they ſhall then knowe at the laſt, and féele him, as theyr moſt ſeuere and iuſt Iudge. At which tyme, the ſtouteſt and the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt of them, ſhall perceyue and knowe, that they were deceyued in theyr opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Let them bee ſo well exerciſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as they will, to obſcure or ſubuert iuſtice, and equitie, yet their lawlike and iudiciall ornaments, and the badges of the great dignitie and power, wherewith they now proudly wax inſolent, ſhall not then giue them the victory. I ſpeake this, becauſe Counſailours, Iudges, Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, aduocates, and ſuch other, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſwinge in Courtes and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not onelie bolde to ſtryue with
<pb facs="tcp:11166:49"/>
God, and ſo to contend, that they would ſéeme, to haue gotten a certayne right, to ſcorne and mocke his Maieſtie, but alſo reiecting all holie Scripture, doo ſpue out theyr blaſphemies, as the greateſt ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Lawe, and moſt high Decrées. Theſe men whome the world dooth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as certayne Idolles, ſo ſoone as they haue ſpoken one worde, cannot ſuffer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and trueth to haue any place to reſt in.</p>
            <p>But yet by the way, I doo admoniſh and warne them beforehand, that it ſhall be better for them, to haue ſome remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of that ſame horrible vengeance, which is ordeined for them that chaunge iuſtice with iniquitie, and trueth with ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Neither the Doctors, and Chamber-maſters, the delitious banquettours, and verie voluptuous men, take any higher degrée héere, then that they may chatter in theyr feaſts and banquettes, and bable foorth theyr wordes againſt the heauenlie Maiſter, to whome truelie all men ought to giue moſt diligent eare.</p>
            <p>Neither can their goodly &amp; famous titles, plucke any man from this iudgement, in which the Lordly and reuerent Abbottes,
<pb facs="tcp:11166:49"/>
Priours, Deanes, Archdeacons, as chéefe Maiſters of the game, ſhall be compelled to leade the daunce in that condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which God ſhall make moſt gréeuous. Now although the Courteours are woont to gratifie men, with the ſprinckling of theyr holie water, let them not thinke, that they can with that kinde of dooing, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie God.</p>
            <p>To conclude, all ieſters, and praters, let them holde theyr tongue, and boaſt not out theyr merie wittie ſayinges, vnleſſe they will féele his mightie hand, at whoſe word they ought to tremble. Wherein theyr errour is too much fooliſhe, that beléeueth becauſe they take me for theyr aduerſary, therefore, they ſhall not haue God to be theyr Iudge. Let them ſcrape my name out of theyr bookes, and vtterlie blotte it foorth, ſpeciallie, in this kinde of cauſe and queſtion, wherein my purpoſe is onelie that God be heard and obeyed, not that I ſhould rule mennes conſciences after my luſt, and charge them with any neceſſitie or lawe.</p>
            <p>As for all others, which doo not ſo proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deſpyſe Gods word, and yet are ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and weake, that they can in no wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:11166:50"/>
be mooued, I doo moſt heartilie beſéeche them, that they wyll take more thought, and regarde to theyr owne duetie, ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Gods honour, and doo more flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelues, as they haue doone hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto.</p>
            <p>Let them therefore open theyr eyes, and reare vp themſelues, that they maye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the myſerie wherein they are.

            <p>For to put our lyfe in daunger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration vnaduiſedlie, and chaunceablie, is moſt againſt nature. And ſo to doo, ſhould be thought rather raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then Chriſtian boldeneſſe. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, God alloweth nothing that we doo, vnleſſe wee be plainly perſwaded, that it is for his names ſake, and for his cauſe that the world is ſo againſt vs, and dooth hate vs.</p>
            <p>But when I ſpeake of ſuch certaintie, and perſwaſion of minde, I doo not onelie vnderſtande this, that wee ſhould knowe to diſcerne and iudge betwixte the true Religion, and the fooliſhe oppinions, and conſtitutions of menne, but alſo that wee be thorowlie perſwaded of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting lyfe, and the Crowne promyſed vnto vs in heauen, after our conflict in this world.</p>
            <p>Let vs nowe marke well, that theſe two reaſons doo pertayne to our duetie, and muſt be ioyned togeather, that the one maye in no wiſe, be ſeperated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned from the other. It is meete therefore, to take our begynning of this:
<pb facs="tcp:11166:53"/>
that we vnderſtand and knowe, what is our Chriſtian Religion, what Faith it is that we ought to holde and followe, what rule of lyfe God hath giuen vs? Neither muſt we onely haue our mindes inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this godlie doctrine, but alſo haue our mindes ſo armed and prepared, that we maye fréely and boldly, damne all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, lyes, and ſuperſtitions, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than hath brought into the world, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the pure ſimplicity of Gods doctrine. Therefore it is no meruaile, that there is ſo ſmall a number of men, that haue a ready minde and deſyre to ſuffer for the Goſpel, and that the greateſt part of them, that profeſſe themſelues Chriſtians, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not the power of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and theyr owne profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">All men are careles in a maner, and do not delight to reade the Goſpell.</note>All men in a manner are negligent, and haue no deſyre, or verie ſmall, to heare and reade, who thinketh it ſufficient, if they haue gotten ſome ſmall taſte of the Chriſtian Faith. And this is the cauſe, why there is ſéene in theſe no ſuretie and conſtancie of minde, and that ſo ſoone as they come into any conflict, they are ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed, as though they ſhould by and by vterlie periſhe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11166:53"/>For which conſideration, our deſyre ought to be greater, to purſue and ſearch out, moſt dilligentlie Gods trueth, that therewith our hearts may be perſwaded without any doubt.

            <p>For we ſée many ſo well trauayled in Gods doctrine, that they ſéeme, as though they were ſtayned and dyed therewith, in whome neuertheleſſe, there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre and loue of GOD, no more truelie, then if they had knowne nothing at any tyme of the godlie doctrine, but by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnſure, lyght, and wauering opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But what other cauſe is there, of this ſo great vncertaintie and leuitie, but that they did neuer perceyue in theyr minde, the maieſtie of the holie Scripture.

<pb facs="tcp:11166:56"/>
this ſaying, that it is a myſerable thing, to forſake and betraye the cauſes why we lyue, for the conſeruation of lyfe. Yet hee and his lyke dyd neuer knowe true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to what ende menne were ſet in the world, and wherefore they lyued therein.</p>

            <p>If this perſwaſion of Gods fatherlie care, and prouidence did reſt and cleaue déepe in our hearts, we ſhould be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of hande, of the greateſt parte of theſe doubtes and difficulties, which doo now trouble and hinder our duetie. We behold now the bitterneſſe of the tyrants, and vnbridled crueltie, brawling péeuiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in all ſharpneſſe of puniſhments. And heereby we iudge, that God hath no more care, nor regard, to defend and kéepe vs in ſafetie. And therefore we be ſo ſtyrred and prouoked, by our owne reaſons to look and prouide for our ſelues, as though the whole hope of Gods helpe and ſuccour were cleane taken away. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, the ſo great prouidence of God, as he hath ſhewed vnto vs, ought to be vnto vs like a ſtrong fenſed Caſtle, which can be ouercommen with no power. Let vs therefore learne &amp; holde faſt, this ſhort ſentence, that our bodies are in his hand and power, who alſo did create them.</p>
            <p>And this is the cauſe, wherfore God hath deliuered his, after a meruailous ſort, and
<pb facs="tcp:11166:72"/>
contrarie to the opinion and hope of all men, as <hi>Sydrach, Miſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi>

            <p>By theſe examples, he would declare vnto vs, that he could ſtaye our enimies, as it were with a certayne bridle, and that hee had that power, that when hee would, hee could preſerue, and as it were plucke vs out of the mouth of Death it ſelfe.
