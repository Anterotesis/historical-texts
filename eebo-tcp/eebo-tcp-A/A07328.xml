            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and peculiar dispositions; that the curiositie of succeeding times, who pry deepely into those men, whose lives were of so great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world, might beeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied and delighted. It will not therefore bee amisse to deliver a Character of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; a Monarch greater in Fame and Territories than any Christian King, that then lived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hee was a man (as we finde recorded) of a just stature, a strong and healthfull constitution; but somewhat grosse, more by the inclination of Nature, then by any fault either of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance or sloth. For besides the sparenesse and sobrietie of his dyet, he vexed his bodie with continuall labour, and to ouercome his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

               </gap>esse, was almost immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all his exercises. Hee was of a ruddy complexion, his head was large, his eyes gray, whose aspect was terrible in his anger; his voyce was hoarse and hollow. Hee was a Prince of great affabilitie, faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in discourse; and when he was free from anger, or important busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ost pleasant and Courtly in his whole conversation. Eloquent he was by nature, and (which was rare then) very learned. The best histories, which in those dark times could be gotten in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, he had perused with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and by the benefit of an extraordinary memorie did retaine them perfectly. He was very har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in enduring either labo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of the seasons; couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in warre: but not rash, and willing to try all wayes before the chance of a battell; yet when there was occasion, very resolute, and so much feared by those Princes that had to doe with him, that hee was never put to any great field. Hee was more kinde in honouring the memories of his souldiers that were slaine, then hee was in rewarding those that were alive; and never see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med truly to value his best Captains, till after they were dead. Exceeding frugall and parsimonious hee was, (almost below the dignity of a King) but it proved happy to his affaires. Though in private hee were very sparing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>et abroad hee appeared often in great magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence;
<pb facs="tcp:22962:96"/>
his bountie to some poore Princes, and those large summes, which hee disbursed to the holy warre, might teach the worl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> that hee was not covetous, but wisely provident<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The greatest taxe that was laid upon him by those that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the same age, was his too too often breaking of his promises; a fault that many Princes, great in other vertues, have beene guilty of. Hee was exceeding fond of all his children, especially in their childish age, before their carriage had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved either way; which shewed that Nature onely wrought that strong affection in him. Yet there, where he most loved; and by those of whom hee had most deserved, it pleased God, hee tasted the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb facs="tcp:22962:97"/>
crosses; his Sonnes were his scourges, and the onely instruments that did, or (in l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>. So great a contrarietie there seemed to be betweene his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to them, and the returne of theirs to him. Hee appeared in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almost of a tender nature, but in loving them; and might have beene thought fomewhat severe in disposition, if hee had not beene a father, to shew the contrary: they were in generall of a Noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, taxed in their times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of no unjust or bad act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:22962:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perchance it pleased God by the fruit of his loynes to punish those sinnes of the flesh to which the King was so much addicted. Hee was noted, more then any Prince of his time, to be given to the love of women; but especially after the displeasure conceived against his wife Queene <hi>Elianor</hi> (as a stirrer up of his Sonnes against him) when hee altogether forbore her bed, hee was growne carelesse of the voyce of Fame, and strove not at all to hide his wanton affections. All his vertues (which indeed were many) had occasion often to be knowne by the varieties of his reigne, in which felicitie and crosses did so often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ceed each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they were not onely tried, but declared to the world. For very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable
<pb facs="tcp:22962:98"/>
were the alterations of Fortune (if we consider all things) which happened in the reigne of this great Prince. Of which if you will take a briefe survey, consider it divided as it were into five Acts; for as one sayes, <hi>Tanquam fabula est vita hominis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the first eight yeares of his reigne (or thereabouts) be counted for the first Act. Where the bravery and wisedome of his youth (for but 24. years of age was he) enough appeared in setling the kingdome, and vindicating the rights of his royall Crowne, after so long a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and so many calamities of civill warre. He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> expelled the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers out of the Realme, which in <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

it. He providently setled not onely the revenues but the authority of his Crown (as before appeareth) and fitly disposed of all the Castles and strong holds; which he either kept in his owne power, or quite demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Hee maintained the ancient bounds &amp; honor of the Realme not onely in the North, but against the Welsh. Beyond the Seas he suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ered no damage, but gained upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. K. <hi>Lewis</hi> &amp; he were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times likely to have come to battel; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t peace was made, and King <hi>Lewis</hi> content rather to sit downe with some little losse, then contend with so puissant a foe. <hi>Chaumont</hi> he tooke from him, &amp; seized (against his wil) upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Nants</hi> in <hi>Britain:</hi> this was indeed the time of K <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>nry</hi>'s greatest felicity
<pb facs="tcp:22962:99"/>
in which hee enjoyed his dignitie without any vexations, and the people, that had long beene affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with miserable times, did tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoyce in their new King. And during these yeares, as a farther bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to him, and securitie to the kingdome, the Queene was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and bare him three Sons.</p>
            <p>For the second Act, wee may consider his next eleven or twelve yeares; in which time, though hee suffered nothing by the hand of warre, as not molested by rebels at home, nor threatned at all by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne enemies: yet by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of one Church-man he found a long and wearisome vexation.

Yet in this incumbred time, his State and Dignitie had great additions; of which the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest was that easie accession of the Realme of Ireland unto his Scepter. And another (considering the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasions of state) of as much importance to him, the gaining of the Dutchy of Britaine to his third Sonne <hi>Geoffrey.</hi> Which hee with great wisedome and industrie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the nonage of that yong Ladie <hi>Constantia,</hi> the daughter an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This great Monarch, whose felicitie was so lately the envie of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Princes, is now become the pittie of them all; and the injuries done to his estate and person, are much lamented by some Princes too farre off to lend him succour. But be hold the turning of Fortune againe; it pleased God againe to lift him from this depth of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the height of honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hee now found the benefit of his fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality; and that large treasure, which hee before had gathered, was his great assistance in procuring merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie souldiers to his side; besides some faithfull Lords there were, (whom we have named in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) that were deeply moved at their masters injuries; and so Nobly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

him, that within three yeares after the beginning of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions, King <hi>Henry,</hi> according to his owne wishes, beheld a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and victorious end of them, as is before expressed.</p>
            <p>Let the fourth Act continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seven yeares that next ensued, a time of honour, and highest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to this great King; after his troubles were allended according to his wish, the King of France daunted, the martiall King of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land his prisoner, all rebels under his feet; his Sonnes brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their duty, and all his large dominions in great securitie. While the mightiest Monarchs of the Christian world admired his wisedome and great successe, asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb facs="tcp:22962:102"/>
almost at so wonderfull a change as they now beheld. His sumptuous Court was filled with congratulating Ambassadours; of whom at one time there were moe seene, then ever had beene to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Court of England; as namely from the two Christian Emperours, <hi>Manuel</hi> of Constantin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople, and <hi>Frederike</hi> of the Romans, from the Kings of Navarre, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>om the Archbishop of Triers, and the Earle of Flanders. During the time of this happinesse, hee marryed his two youngest daughters (for the eldest was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before to the Duke of Saxony) to the Kings of Sicily and Arragon. Hee called Parliaments, in which according to his minde, hee was

furnished with treasure, he wisely setled the estates of Church and Common-wealth, and besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other wholsome &amp; happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, he first appointed Iudges Itinerant for the six circuits of the Realme of England.</p>

The beginning of which was a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond revolt of his two Sonnes, <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> which was soone taken off by the untimely death of both the Princes (as is before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Poëm;) besides the ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in the affaires of Ireland under

the government of <hi>Iohn</hi> his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest sonne. Those troubles that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from <hi>Philip</hi> King of France, and prevailed against <hi>Henry</hi> in his old age, more then any enemy had beene able to doe before: which had not fallen so heavily upon him, if <hi>Richard</hi> (then his eldest sonne) had not unnaturally forsaken his father, and joyned in confederacy with King <hi>Philip.</hi> That miserable dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion broke the heart of old King <hi>Henry,</hi> and was the end both of his reigne and life.</p>

They were Princes of greatest eminence in those times, and upon whom the eyes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome were most set; a large Stage they had to act upon; and early occasions to discover their worth. They were both tall of sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beyond the ordinary height of men; of comely visage, and maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall presence; for courage and magnanimity they were thought equall; and both admired for roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vertue, though of a nature diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. <hi>Henry</hi> was beloved for his sweetnesse: <hi>Richard</hi> honour'd for his gravi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>o warre it selfe: One was Courtly: the other serious. One beloved for mercy: the other feared for Iustice. The one a refuge: the other a terror to all offenders. Two Princes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of so great worth; and yet so diverse, have seldome beene obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Yet well might they spring from one root; their father <hi>Henry</hi> in the mixture of his nature was knowne to containe both their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Characters; and iudged to have a minde (as one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>How much the sweetnesse and lovely carriage of young King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> had wonne upon the world, let one observation (which some of his owne time thought like a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle)
<pb facs="tcp:22962:106"/>
teach us to judge. How strange was it, that a young Prince rising in armes against his father, possessed neither of lands nor trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, much lesse of a good or just cause, was followed almost by all the neighbouring world against a King of so large a territory, and so full of treasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from him, hee was able, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most with mercenary souldier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So many rich gifts of minde and

body were heaped on this young <hi>Henry</hi> (saith a Writer of his time) that Nature, as it were envying what she had bestowed, soyled it againe with one staine, the vice of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and disobedieuce to so good a father. Which sinne of his was thought the cause that plucked downe Divine vengeance, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely cut off that flourishing youth which was judged worthy (if God had prolonged it) to have ruled a greater Empire.</p>
            <p>The severity and industrious cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Richard</hi> the second Sonne let this declare; the Earledome of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctou, and the Dutchy of Aquitaine, which were the inheritance of his mother <hi>Eleanor,</hi> were committed to his government whilest he was

very young. Yet in that tender age (so manly were his vertues, so awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full was the hand which he carried over the rebellious and stubborne subjects of those Countryes, that he soone reduced them to a more quiet state, and setled obedience, then any of their former Princes had ever done. As he was stout in the action of warre; so was hee constant and unwearied in pursuing his fortune, and making the full use of any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, according to that marke that <hi>Lucan</hi> gives of <hi>Iulius Caelar:</hi>

considered the quality of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the necessity of such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
