         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

of this world, feeding fooles with siggs, and philosophers with

begun to exile ignorance, to reuiue artes: knowing <hi>Ladislaus</hi> reasons
to be of force, that Citizens who are vnlettered, are lesse than men,
or rather (as <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour was wont to say) manlike
beastes. Which vertuous indeuor of yours (worthie both your name
and fortune) shall in time to come more aduance you, than they who
tooth and nayle labour to purchase lands, which ordinarily perish
through their heires lauishnes. It is true fame which is gotten by
vertue, &amp; perfect vertue to maintaine learning; which is so kinde to
those that seeke after it, that in all changes of fortune, in all miseries
of this life, and casualties whatsoeuer, it prepareth the mind, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth
mishaps. And least I among the poore Tirones of learning,
who desire the increase therof with the most, though deserue therein
with the least, should seeme to forget this especially and ingrafted
vertue so admirably bestowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your worship, I haue thought good
to present you with a rude and homely written history, which if with
like regard you shall accept, as <hi>Alphonsus</hi> did the silly Satires of
<hi>Philelphus,</hi> I doubt not but in short time to publish that vnder your
name, which shall not only merit and deserue your acceptance, but
also mightely profit all such as are studious in all sorts of learning.
Till when, I most humbly commend me, desiring your Worship most
earnestly to prosecute your vertuous enterprises, beseeching God to
prosper you in them and all other, to the aduancement of Letters.

greatly assist in causes of honor. These two princely cooples
ordained by desteny to high desasters, though their affluence
of riches promised them felicitie, yet the influence of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
intimated their aduersitie; for hauing great signories to
bequeath, they had no heires to enioy, accompting this for
their only crosse, that they were without children: many were
their vowes, but to no auayle; many their prayers, but to
little purpose; if phisick might haue made fruitfull, <hi>Editha</hi>
had been a Mother; if great summs could haue purchast yong
sonnes, <hi>Aubert</hi> had been a Father. Seuen yeares and more
liued they in this sort, the one carelesse of loues delight, the
other comfortlesse in that she was barraine, till on a prefixed
Saterday, when Nature had powred all her treasures on the
earth, <hi>Flora</hi> powdered all the medowes with flowres, when
the louesick <hi>Zephirus</hi> softly breathed, and the tender leaues
sweetly bowed, when the sunne played with the waue, &amp; the
waue dallyed with the sunne, both enioying an equal simpathy
of solace, Duke <hi>Aubert</hi> (who from his youth vpwarde was
meruailously delighted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chase) accompanyed with his faire
Duchesse, departed out of his Capitall Citie of <hi>Roan,</hi> to take
his pastance in the Forrest. <hi>Editha</hi> (by deuine ordinance)
was that day attired, as if she intended to wooe <hi>Lucina</hi> to
graunt a Sonne, and winne the Norman Duke to get a
Sonne. Her hayre, in stead of gould to grace it, was goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
exceeding gould, more finer than the thrid wherewith
<hi>Arachne</hi> wrought her loombe, more softer than the bed of
Roses, wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Morning playd with <hi>Cephalus.</hi> Bound it
was after a carelesse manner, as if disdayning that so rare
beauties should be imprisoned, but pleyted in such sort, as if
Nature should make a laborinth for Loue, Loue could not
wish a sweeter laborinth. Midst euery pleight were certayne
spheares of Pearles and Diamonds, which with the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
of their purenesse, gaue no little grace to her hayres
perfection: her browes not so hard as Iuorie, but more whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

intermedled with some delicate vermilion, her eyes in
puritie like the Carbunckle, lightning y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> darkest thoughts in

concluding all passions in themselues, in that they were the
rootes of passions: her cheekes like two orbes of rubies par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating
the whitenes of the Lillie, her lips resembling the
Roses, being limits of more wonder than either toong can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
or eye behold. Oh how may men that surfet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
expresse in pen! Suppose the attire answerable to the
person, the person excéeding report, and in a word imagine
<hi>Auberts</hi> happines, who might behold so faire, and enioy so

            <p>In this sort both these Princes rode together, till such time
as their traine had rowsed a mightie Hart, and vncoopled
their howndes, when each one intentiuely followed the game,
inforcing himselfe either to shewe his good horsemanship, or
woodmanship, the rocks resounded with the cryes, the woods
ecchoed at their clamours. In this sort spent they the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
till about Noonesteede, when the Sunne was in the

being attainted with heate, entered the thickest of the
wood, hoping to obtaine some cold shelter, where he might
rest himselfe for a while, and rid himselfe of his wearynes.
But the further he walked, the more was his wonder, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n
euery side Nature had been so prodigall of hir power, that the
eye could not behold too much, nor the thought imagin so
much. Heere saw he a faire delicious brooke, recording mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
in his course, being christall in cleerenes, enuironed with
faire Ceders so orderly aranged, as Arte could not in more
excellence exemplifie the effects of perfection. On that side
a closed Arbor beawtifyed with Roses, paued with Uiolets,
on the top whereof, the byrds with melodious musick anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the flowres, and the flowres assisted by the Westerne

Fiue moneths and more dallied they the time with light skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes,

him with his equalles in birth, his companions in

vnapplied to reforme him: but as the Oke sooner
breaketh than boweth, and the Sallowe being bowed in the
twig is crooked in the tree: so <hi>Robert</hi> by nature inclined to
vice, coulde in no wise bee induced by aduice; hee was in wit
pregnant, but applied the same to loosenes, reioycing as much
at diuelishnes as other in their doctrine; in reading the Poets
he despised the precepts of worth, and delighted in the poems
of wantounes; hee was eloquent, but in impietie; diligent,
but in mischiefe, hauing nothing in more estimate than mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
flying nothing more earnestly than modestie: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of this his intemperance, it was by some supposed that
his mother at such time as he was begotten, was inchaunted;
each one seeing his inclination fled him as a Serpent, his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals
he banished from him with buffetings, his elders with
reuilings, hauing neither feare of God nor regarde of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

               <p>Master (sayd he) I haue but put in practise that which you
haue taught me in precept, and since I find you a man of such
credite, I will boldly write vnder your lesson <hi>probatum est:</hi> he
was naturally inclined to intort all good principles of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
and to apply the earnest secrets of antiquitie to notable
insolencie; hee dissembled most holines when hee was irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
supposing it vertue to inuent sinne, and shame to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in sinne: his prouident Tutor knowing (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe
runneth) the Tree by his fruite, the Lyon by his naile,
and the Crocadile by his teare, knowing by daylie experience
that too much impunitie is the cause of too much impietie, that
it is easier to stop the riuer in the spring, than withstand it in
the streame, that the Lyon restrayned being a whelpe, is trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in his greatest yeares; that Custome was a meane, if
not to subdue, yet to alter Nature, thought good by crueltie
to correct that, which by le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ie hee could not confound: for
which cause seeing that gentle admonition preuailed nothing,
he exchanged his strict perswasions to sterne lookes, his sound
rudiments to sharp rigor, hoping to recouer that by displing,
which he could not reforme by discipline. But as their labour
is frustrate who seeke to bring <hi>Cancasus</hi> into a plaine, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue
<hi>India</hi> of gems, <hi>Candia</hi> of oyles, <hi>Cochim</hi> of pepper, or

is grounded in peremptorie wickednesse, it is impossible
either to destroy or disanull the effects thereof, according to
the opinion of the Poet:

For, giuing him ordinarie correction at one time for an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
offence which he had committed, in stead of submission
and acknowledgement of his misdéedes, he intentiuely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
himselfe to murther, and finding his Maister one day
asléepe, he priuily tooke his penknife and cut his throate,

smilingly concluding his impietie in this sort.

with such horror to attaine him, that he euery way grewe
desperate. Oftentimes did he prepare himselfe to complaine,

<pb facs="tcp:10100:16"/>
he had béen so dissolute: and lifting vp his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
he beheld the Moone performing her course, the Starres
ministring their dueties, and by their celestiall beautie began
with himselfe to imagine the beautie of their maker, then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
he to remembrance the olde rudiments of his master, as
touching the essence and power of God, the wonderfull work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
of the heauens, the beautifull order of the spheares,
the strange creation of man, the influence of the celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in these inferiour parts, and considered that all thinges
were made by a determinate and inuiolable lawe limitted by
prescript of Nature, and that if in the earthly compact of man
the imperfection and griefe of one member afflicted the whole
compact, much more a contrarietie in the powers both of soule
and bodie threatned a confusion: Then called he to mind, that
since there was a Moouer which disposed &amp; ordered al things,
so in due ordinance of gouernment it was requisite too as hée
prescribed rewards for good deserts, so he should also ordaine
punishments for vice. Hereupon began he to meditate on the
nature of sinne, the causes of sinne, and the effects of sinne,
and him thought that a voyce sounded in his eare, <hi>the reward
of sinne is death.</hi> Oh how great was the horror and confusion
of his soule at this time, his burthen heauier than <hi>Aetna,</hi> his
affliction more fiercer than may bee imagined, and sodainly a
shower of teares burst from his eyes, his heart was inflamed,
his thoughts troubled, and the eye of reason long time obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
at last began to break foorth with inestimable brightnesse,
so that falling downe on his knees, and thumping his woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
breast, he at last in bitter termes entered into this extasie.
I wonder thou maker of heauen at thy workmanship, &amp; thy
worthines is knowne by thy workes, I see that thou art iust
in dealings, and I desperate through my delayes, I haue had
a portion with the chiefest creatures, but haue imployed it
worse than bruite beasts. Oh how my soule groaneth within
me, and my inward bowells are gréeued in my bodie. Lord
thou hast made me, but I haue martered me; thou hast saued
me, I haue shamed thee; thou hast elected me, I haue reiected
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10100:16"/>
thee; mine impenitence hath wrought thy impatience: oh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not into the fulnes of my sinne, least I aduenture the furie
of thy sword, the vale of heauinesse ouercladdeth me, the hope
of heauenlinesse is clowded from me: Oh that the hils would
fall vpon me, or that the depth might deuoure me: oh that I
had neuer been borne, or had euer béen better. Lord it is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
I merite condemnation, I deserue affliction and no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
damnation &amp; no preseruation, commination from thée,
not combination with thee. Oh my soule groane for my sins,
greeue at my shames. Oh happie were my soule if griefe
could suffice: oh my soule, rent at thy vnrighteousnesse, melt
at thy murther, or happie were my soule if remorse would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
but my portion is in the graue, not among the iust; amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
the defiled ones, and not the reconciled ones; I am heauy my
God; but why call I him mine, whom I haue blasphemed?
I am sorie my God: as if sorrowe would satisfie the excesse of
sinne? Oh, no I am vnworthie to behold heauen, to conceaue
hope, to intreate mercie, to promise amends: but damnation,
oh the bitter wound of damnation that threatneth me, that
killeth me.</p>
               <p>In these desperate and sorrowing tearmes spent hée the
most part of the night, neither receauing sustenance, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying
sleepe, his cléere complexion became pale, his strong
limmes grewe lither, and hée that before time thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
more woorthie than the King of heauen, now thought
himselfe vnwoorthie to tread vppon the earth. By this time
the memorie of his sinnes assayled him anewe, and a hidden
working from aboue dispersed the clowdie passions of his
thought, in such manner as wée sée a faire and pleasant breath
of winde, which during the extreame heate of the Sunne,
tempereth the furie of the same, in which manner I leaue him

arriued where <hi>Robert</hi> lay, altogether bathed in his bloud,
and so ouercome with dispayre, that he continually languished
till it pleased death to yeeld a finall period to his pensiuenes.
The good old man seeing his personage comely, his apparell

more néere him, and reuiuing him with fountaine water,
which sprong very neere at hand, hée brought him into some

he led him to his Hermitage, where after some refection ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,

               <p>Ah olde man, how fond art thou to foster a viper in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and a villaine in thy bed? why permittest thou not that
I sleepe with death, who am alreadie damned? and may dye
without merrie, who haue liued by nought but murther? The
olde man amazed to beare his cursed melancholie, knowing
that desperate wounds require most of al yrksome medicines,
began thus. Ah my sonne, gather thy spirits together, it is
fondnesse in thée to desire death, and policie in me to protract
life; by the one thou shalt loose occasion of repent; by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
recouer meanes of amendes: Thou art no viper my

my sonne, a breach of Commandement, a hainous sinne:
but is not God mercifull to forgiue beyond our conceit? He
knew thée in thy Mothers woombe, and ordained thée to an

not vnknowne vnto him, and all this was done by ordinance
of his secret will, and not without the mightie hand of his

as much in suspect of his mercie, as in neglect of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
for his mercie exceedeth all his works: I will teach
thee, and my words shall sauour vnto righteousnes. The
hand that gouerneth all things, is deuine: the works of God
admit no limits, and his wayes are vnknowne: he ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
not sinnes by our proportion, nor condemneth by worldly
iudgement. Be confident therefore, and serue the Lord in
feare and trembling. Suppose all things wicked that is in
thee, and confesse thy wickednes beyond measure. Detest
that which thou hast pursued: be penitent in that thou hast
defaulted. If the Lord looke vpon thee in mercie, thy soule
shall feele it, yea, thy raynes shall waxe hote, and thy spirit
moued: neyther feare thou if terrour assayle thee beyonde

deferre to presume on that sinne, which thou canst not define,
neyther obiect that to thy selfe, which dependeth on the Iudge:
thy déedes are written, but to God belongeth mercie. It is
doubted, whether presuming too much on the knowledge of
hidden sinne, be not sinne. But be thou aduised by me,
referre all to the Lorde, detest all meanes that may seduce
thy mind: arme thee with the shield of faith: pray that thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
may be increased: let all things seeme vile to thee in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

perswades me of your ouergreat forwardnesse in passions,
who are castly ouercome with euery light ioy, and sodainely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10100:19"/>
crossed with the lightest trouble: which fruite of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
(with reuerence, you Nobles may I be bould to tell
you) ariseth through want of equabilitie in minde, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
remembrance that you are mortall. If according to your
worldly store, your estates were constant, you should be
so farre from knowing God, as you would quite forget him.
At the entraunce of thy Pallace <hi>Aubert</hi> I see men wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
because the report runneth thou art wretched; thus are
all affections ruled by the affaires of the mightie, and honour
is so sauourie a thing in those mens mindes, who would be
great, that it sootheth, and is soothed by all sorts of them.
In <hi>Traians</hi> time, all men loued iustice, because he was iust:
in <hi>Octauians</hi> before him, all hunted after peace, in that he
was peaceable: in <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> dayes all were wanton, in
that he was wanton: and now, since thy minde is vexed
with doubtfull griefe, thy subiects likewise are attaynted
with doubtfull griefe. But dry vp your teares good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and reioyce, Prince <hi>Robert</hi> (supposed dead) is surely
liuing, (yet dead to his olde wickednesse) following better
wayes: for after he escaped from his enemyes, he arriued
in my Hermitage, where after I had cured his woundes,
and counselled him from his wickednesse, hee vndertooke
his voyage and Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome,</hi> but before resorted
to <hi>Thuringue,</hi> labouring to disswade the remnant of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
from their lewd life, which when he could not effect,
he in my presence slewe them, vnder pretence (as he sayd) to
rid his countrey of caterpillers. And in that, dread Prince and
my liege Lord <hi>Aubert,</hi> he hath mightely offended you, he
humbly by me beséecheth his pardon, protesting vehemently
a hartie detestation of his sinne; and requesting, that it would
please <hi>Editha</hi> his Lady Mother and Duchesse, to haue him
in memorie in her most sacred deuotions: and for that he
knoweth that he hath many wayes indamnished poore men,
he humbly intreateth your Mightines, to accept these keyes
of your Castell of <hi>Thuringue,</hi> where in the Treasurie you
shall finde sufficient to make ample satisfaction for all iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
<pb facs="tcp:10100:20"/>
thus hauing discharged the duetie of a messenger, and
acquited your Grace of suspition, I humbly craue licence to
depart, that I may the better intend my woonted contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations.
It were hard to imagine with what incomparable
ioy the olde Duke entertayned this aged Herauld of his
happinesse, for his teares of ioy trickling from his eyes as
messengers of his hearts content, aboundantly watered the
Hermits bosome, and beeing vnable to expresse his ioy, he
silent foulded his armes about his aged necke, seeming so
besotted with delight, as before he gaue ouer he cryed out
with the <hi>Grecian,</hi> O Fortune, pay this most excéeding ioy
with some durable grief, for as now it is at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fulnesse: <hi>Editha</hi>
likewise was not carelesse to content her selfe, but drawing
the olde man apart, with often repetitions of his troubles,
his torments, his passions of minde, his patience in afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the occasion offered it selfe, she became either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
or pensiue, shewing by her changes of couler, hir con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation,
or discontents: and in this ioy let vs leaue them,
returning to our wearie Pilgrim, meditating in this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
trauailes: to see how from a gracelesse person, he became
a godly penitenciarie, truely the discourse heereof draweth
me into admiration of Gods mercie, who calleth men home
beyond common beliefe, accomplishing héerein his diuine
promise, who sayd, that he came not to call the righteous,
but sinners to repentaunce.</p>

decayed beawties of the fielde, which were beforetime wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted

beforetime esteemed the very patterne of deformitie, began

wantonly casting her armes about his necke, proffering
dalliance: but he whose loue was planted on heauenly, not on
earthly delights, sodainly cast her from him, and lifting vp his

tye me to thy loue, intice me to thy lawe, incense me to vertue,
subdue in me vanitie, let not temptation conquer, though it
trie me; nor Sathan compasse, though he tempt me. The
prayer was no sooner finished, but a horrible cracke of thunder
fell from the heauens, the Woods were inflamed with light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
and this wanton vision sodainly vanished, in steade
whereof succéeded horrible Eathquakes, the Curtaines of the
heauen were darkened, the compasse of the world was clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and on the face of the Center there appeared through the
light of lightning, hideous shapes of Giants threatning him,
monstrous Tygers assayling him, but he constantly putting
his trust in GOD, and boldly walking on his way, at last at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
into an open plaine, in the middest whereof there stood
a poore Chappell, with a little Cottage hard beside, and by
that time the dangers were ouerpast, &amp; the dimmy approach
of the euening foretold him that the day was spent; for which
cause he hasted into the Chappell to doo his deuotions, where
he found before the Alter a graue old man performing his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
prayers: neither of these two intended worldly saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but solemnely fell to their deuotions, which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
the olde man seeing so goodly a personage cloathed in
a Pilgrims weed, with great reuerence saluted him, deeming
him for no lesse than he was, beseeching his companie in his
Hermitage for that night, in that other lodging was not nere
at hand. <hi>Robert</hi> easilie condiscended, and entering the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Cottage, he was feasted in friendly sort with such dainties,
as his poore estate could affoord. During the time of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past,
<hi>Robert</hi> desirous to knowe the secret of the inchaunted
Wood, began to question with the olde man about the same:
who al amazed to heare that <hi>Robert</hi> had passed it, in manner
of admyration, he answered thus. Truely (my sonne) thou
art happie, that through the mercie of GOD hast ouerpassed
those dangers which thy predecessors could neuer attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
for this Wood (my friend) is called <hi>Le bois du temptation,</hi>
the wood of temptation, where through many holy men haue
attempted to passe, but they haue either béen withdrawne by
<pb facs="tcp:10100:23"/>
delight, or driuen backe by feare, and finally perished through
their owne follies: But since thou hast so constantly perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
procéede in thy deuotion, and let humilitie be thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and doubtlesse (my sonne) thy ende shall bee farre better
than thy beginning. <hi>Robert</hi> wondering at his doubtfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
replied thus. And why father, doest thou knowe my
beginning? I sonne (sayd he) thou art of the earth as I am,
borne of a Princesse as I was not, sonne to a Duke, yet of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
life, <hi>Robert of Normandy</hi> I knowe thee, thy chaunge
was foreshowne mee in vision, now therefore prosecute thy
pretence, followe thy repentance, for in so doing thou shalt
performe mightie things. The sorrowfull Prince hearing
but the repeticion of his former life, wept most bitter teares,
being sore ashamed to behold the graue father. But the olde
man comforted him, and knowing the expedition of his ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
so animated him, that hee presently set forward, in that
the louely Moone assisted him with sufficient light: the aged

him, wondering at the maiestie of his countenance; but he
replied that hee was vnworthie, and so with teares forsooke
them. If any his fellowe Pilgrimes fainted on the way, hée

he was comfortable to those that were comfortlesse; and
where he sawe the innocent wronged he was agréeued. Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing

a poore countrie maiden, and drawing néere him he so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
reuenged the iniustice, that the poore mayd falling at
his feete was faine to intreate for her persecutor. Such blind
men as he met hee called them happie, assuring them that the

vanitie; seeing a lame man complayning of his imperfection,

S. <hi>Peter,</hi> at which time in great solemnitie the Popes
are accustomed to goe to diuine Seruice, and humbling him
with other Hermites, (as it was the custome in those super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticious

was the solemnitie on that day, and throughout the streetes
where the Bishop should passe, each one deuoutly humbled
him on his knees to entertaine his blessing: At the enterance
of the Church, among other deuout Hermites, hee behelde
Prince <hi>Robert</hi> bathed in his teares, humbled on his knees,
and wondering at his manly countenance &amp; tall proportion,

himself to the Recluse, who detesting his abommable life, and
not knowing what maner of punishment he might condignly
appoynt him, he commaunded him for that night to continue
in deuout prayers in the Chappell, promising him the next
morning to satisfie him in his doubts. During the time that
darknesse ouerspred the face of the whole earth, and euery bird
beast and fish enioyed the happie benefites of fléepe, the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
religious couple deuoutly applied themselues to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
when about the third houre of the night the Recluse
was resolued of his penaunce: wherefore vpon the breake of
day, when <hi>Robert</hi> had arisen from his prayers, he came vnto
him, and carying in his countenance the grauitie of a father,
and in his heart the sinceritie of a Counceller, he began thus.
Yong Prince, if thy contrition for sinne be so compassionate
as thou pretendest, and thy zeale to acknowledge the same so
accomplished as thou presumest, knowe this that thy danger
is lesse and thy benefite the greater, for repentance is a swéete
sacrifice, and desire to amend is the way to end the fault. But
in that thy offences and follies haue béen extraordinarie, thy
punishment must be no lesse, in sufferance whereof thou shalt
throughly perceaue the indignitie of thy former sinne. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
be prescribed him his penaunce: first that hee should eate
no meate but that hée receaued from a dogge: secondly, that
during seauen yeres he should be dumbe: lastly, for that space
of time he should walke in a fooles habite, in acknowledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of his accustomed leawdnesse. <hi>Robert</hi> thankfully accepted
that which was enioyned him, neither repyning at the hard
penance, nor disdayning y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> flender pittance, but taking humble
leaue of the Recluse, hasted himselfe vnto the Citie to satisfie
that which was prescribed him, and buying him a fooles habit
he walked vp and downe the streetes, enduring the reuilings
of children, who cast dirt in his face, scoffed and mocked him,
and the more lewd language that they vsed, the more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he receaued, remembring this, that his deserts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions
deserued farre more martyrdome: oftentimes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10100:24"/>
was he reuiled, but deuotion closed his tongue, considering
this in himselfe, that in refrayning the same be auoyded much
offence. Certaine of his confederate Hermites beholding this
madnesse and idle behauiour, came vnto him to comfort him,
but he crossing his hands and weeping teares, poynted to the
heauens, signifying thereby that hee suffered that crosse for
sinning against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In short time he became the by word of
the Citie, some buffeted him, which hee endured patiently;
some others of more charitie offered him foode, which he with
gratulation refused, so that no other noise was published
through <hi>Rome</hi> but of the strange Idiot that was dumbe; the
people flocked about him, some praysing his person, some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting

               <head>How Robert entered the Emperours Court, &amp; how he there

               <p>AT last he entered the Emperours pallace, at such time
as with his Nobles he solemnized a most solemne and
festiuall day, great was the presse about the table, and
many the attendants, but <hi>Robert</hi> boldly entered the presence,
demeaning himselfe after such a manner, that the Emperour
and Princes tooke very great delight in him, he was actiue of
bodie, &amp; vaughted excéedingly well, performing such aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
trickes, as the Emperour all amazed inquired what
be might be; he made him signes of dumnes, shadowing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
colours of delight his intentiue deuotion. Then presented
they him meate which he refused, accustoming himselfe at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
such offer to make showe of discontent. The Emperour
at that time had a faire Greyhound, who for his swiftnes in
the chace and seemelines of bodie was highly esteemed, that
beholding <hi>Robert</hi> fauned vpon him and plaied with him, as
if appointed by some diuine instinct to affect him; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
seeing he refused meate at his haud, cast some pittance
at his dogge, where <hi>Robert</hi> sodainly strugled for the same and
<pb facs="tcp:10100:25"/>
greedily fed thereon, which made the lookers on intentiue to
sport, to accustome him to that kinde of feeding. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
caused him for this cause to be cherished in his own house
and tended with diligent care, taking pastime continually to
haue <hi>Robin</hi> in his presence. At night when the festiuals were
finished, <hi>Robert</hi> was brought vnto a good bed well furnished,
but he refused it, &amp; gathering together certaine locks of straw
hee made him a cabbin vnder the staiers of the Emperours
pallace, where for seauen yeres space he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually slept with
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hound, refusing all other content or delectation. Oftentimes
was he priuilie seene to weep bitterly, &amp; when he could get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any seuerall place to pray deuoutly on his knees, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tolde vnto the Emperour, made him more curious to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his progenie, but by no meanes could he vnderstand it,
for the good Prince had kept it most secret. Thus may we see
that when the minde is withdrawne from worldly delights,
(wherewith for the most part wretched men are detayned) all
things seeme abiect and vile, except such as lift the soule vnto
heauen, and subdue the bodie in his sensualitie. This most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and renowmed Romane Emperour, among all other
his high blessings and Fortunes benefites, had a faire Ladie
to his daughter, whose picture if <hi>Praxitiles</hi> would describe,
or a better Master than <hi>Apelles,</hi> hee should rather lacke cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
than lay colours; as beautiful she was as Nature could
imagine, and as well formed as she was faire, and no lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
in learning as in lineaments, her onely imperfection
was that she was borne dumbe. This noble Princesse cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Emine,</hi> was sought vnto by all the Monarkes and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married
Potentates of the worlde, so was her fame brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
abroade, and such was her beautie: among the rest,
the Souldan of <hi>Babilon</hi> vnderstanding by certaine Italian
Merchants the excéeding and surpassing excellence of her
person, and receauing from them her picture, hée became
woonderfullie surprized in loue, so that neglecting all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleasures, hee onely setled his minde towardes the
attainment of her fauour: Oftentimes presented hée rich
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10100:25"/>
presents to ordinarie trauaylers, desiring onely to growe
famous in the Italian Countries, and he that could but in
best words set out <hi>Emines</hi> prayse, had a princely recompence.
Round about his Pallace was no other posie but <hi>Emine:</hi>
and in his Oratorie was no other Goddesse but <hi>Emine:</hi>
if he talked, he talked of <hi>Emine:</hi> if he longed, he longed

his ioyes metamorphosed into <hi>Emine.</hi> It was woonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to sée his disguise in attyre after the Christian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:

you haue read) in beholding the picture falne in loue
with the person, for the space of sixe months secretly
concealed his hidden griefe, and communicated it only with
straungers and aliens, gan rather increase than diminish his
dispaire, for knowing the naturall inclination of his subiects
euery way repugnant against the lawes and manners of the
Christians, their dissident religions, their different regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
their mortall hate, and immoueable stiffneckednesse, he began
to giue ouer all thought of contentation, plotting out such a
course of life, as therein he shewed more barbarous constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in loue, than iudgement and discretion: for picking out a
<pb facs="tcp:10100:26"/>
solitarie wood farre from the resort of men, he builded him a
place of pleasure, begirt with ritch bulwarks, and inuironed
with sweete springs: the lodgings all of white Marble, the
pillers of Iaspis, and the whole furniture so rich, as neuer
eye of man could behold more wonderfull. In midst whereof,
was placed a daintie and wonderfull Garden, stored with all
the ritches of nature, with sweete shades, cleere springs,
strange flowres, wholesome hearbs: and in the middle of the
same was erected a Temple to <hi>Cupide</hi> and <hi>Emine,</hi> wherein
hir stature made of the purest golde, seemed to stayne all the
excellencie of workemanship, for the Paynter had done as
much as might be, to describe beawtifull <hi>Emine.</hi> Herein he
closed himselfe, and hauing all the battlements of the temple
made of polished Iuorie, he with a true loues knot interlaced
his name with <hi>Emines,</hi> being of himselfe excellently seene in
portrait. If any one of his Lords resorted vnto him, destrous
to know the name of his Goddesse, he answered <hi>Emine:</hi> but
how he serued, or of what place she was, he durst not tell, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barbarous treasons of his greatest subiects. Thus cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that warlike nation their armes, who were beforetime so
famous, and he that was woont to fight for signiorie, was now
foyled and besotted with loue. The Nobles about him not
induring idlenesse, presented themselues before him, seeking

sware vnto him by a solemne oth neither to contrary him, nor
forsake him, till he had atchieued the fulnesse of his ioy, if so it
pleased him to discouer the cause of his pensiuenesse. The
Souldan marking their incessant suites, and praysing <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henzars</hi>
dutifull obedience, rowsed himselfe from his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
seate, and with a milder countenance began thus.</p>
               <p>I am fortunate in nothing more my noble Péeres, and

not so basely as <hi>Haniball,</hi> for <hi>Capua</hi> contained his, where

The ayme of my thoughts is the honor of <hi>Rome:</hi> oh
sweete <hi>Rome</hi> that containeth such an honor, which if I attaine
not, it is but your discontents, my death, &amp; if my death, what
though: oh happy death if for her grow my durance. This ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

men expected no other but his finall ouerthrow, or her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
wherevpon his Nobles priuatly, consulted, and by his
consent <hi>Behenzar</hi> was made Embassalor, and with ritch

intelligence should be giuen, and Ships rigged, to the ende
that on the sodaine the Souldan might inuade Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and rid himselfe of all the obstacles of his happines.
These conclusions well liking the Souldan, were briefely

this magnificall answer. It is not our custome in

for his inuasions I feare them not, since my Christ is
my protector, vnder whose safe conduct both these and I little
feare him, and so be thou answered. <hi>Behenzar</hi> mad with rage
seeing the Emperours small regard, stamped with his foote,
and sware thus: By <hi>Mahound</hi> (Christian) thy Carpenters
sonne that Christ, your God, shall not saue thy hands, nor thy
heads from the sword of the meanest Prince about the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
but this Citie shall be raced in despight of thy protector,
and thy power. <hi>Behenzar</hi> had so sayd, and in his furie was
stinging out of the Pallace, when <hi>Robin</hi> the Diuell hauing
all this while solemnely attended at the foot of the Emperour,
all on the sodaine arose, and not induring to heare the name
of his Sauiour blasphemed, he flung the Pagan to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
and stamped him vnder his feete, which done, he made shewe
of a foolish triumph, and bumming the proud Babilonian with
his bable, he had welny killed him, had not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Princes drawne
him off, who safety conducted blaspheming <hi>Behenzar</hi> to his

The faire <hi>Emine</hi> seeing the forwardnesse of her Champion
was meruailously delighting, shewing vnto her father by

day dressed she meanes to recouer his wits, vsing prescripts
of Phisicke, and the councell of the learned, who secretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
her that he was a man of rare expectation. These sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
meruailously inflamed her, and loue began to show

changing her colour, which least it should be perceaued, she
with humble reuerence forsooke the assembly, leauing her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

mightie armie is the onely meane to make head against a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Enemie, the whole Nations assembled them together
about <hi>Rome,</hi> and submitted themselues vnder the conduct of
the Empyre. Now at <hi>Rome</hi> in stead of beautiful houses were
builded strong Bulwarkes; in stead of Pallaces, Palisadoes,
and each man was mightily addicted to the safetie of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
But the Barbarian like the cruell riuer of <hi>Tigris,</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his bounds with vnmeasurable and resistlesse waters, or
the lightning falling vppon the drie Cedars, ouerran all the
fruitfull champion, destroyed Cities, burned Uillages, raced
Manner houses; the voyce of desolation was heard on euery

Clergy with great deuotion called for assistance from heauen,
and euery man hearing of the daunger of his neighbour, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
his owne domage to be at hand. At last the Souldan
after great victories, rich spoyles, good fortunes, and long

and strong siege, his streamers waned in the winde, and the
Egle of golde shining on the top of his Pauilion, seemed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bash
all the beauties of the Capitoll. The Emperour was no
lesse vigilant in preparing defence, for being assisted by the
brauest men of <hi>Europe,</hi> he neither pretermitted policie, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
oportunitie: often were the outrodes the Enemie
made about the Countrie, and there passed no day wherein
there was no some light skirmith, wherein for the most part
the fortune was doubtfull. But <hi>Behenzar</hi> mooued with the
outrage of the Idiot, among all the Pagans was most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to battaile, euery day would hee ride about the walles,
reuiling the Christians, calling the Emperour Toward, his
followers Foxes, that durst not stirre out of their hale, till at

not concumelie, neither brooked braues, so earnestly wrought
with the Emperour, that the battaile was appoynted the day
following, and the Souldan thereof aduertised by a Harrolt;
<pb facs="tcp:10100:31"/>
great was the preparation on both sides, and greater the dread
among the Christians, in that the whole hope of the Empyre
depended on the fortune of that conflict. No sooner did the
bright and beautifull messenger of the day, with blushing
seemelines awaken the sleeple God of light, whose Chariot
being apparelled by the houres, with golden brightnesse gaue
possession to radiant <hi>Phoebus,</hi> but both the armies issued out
into the field, and in a faire plaine arranged themselues in

exhort, the Caualiers applaude, the Trompets made a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
harmonie, inforcing the horses to carrier, and the heart
to courage: in briefe, the battailes ioyned, where the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
shewed inestimable feates of armes, hewing, murthering,
and ouerthrowing whom so euer he met. <hi>Pepin</hi> like <hi>Mars</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,

their sonnes, many the sighes of the daughters
weeping for their fathers, there was no house in the Citie
which solemnized not some funerall, and happie was he in his
misfortune, whose sonne had béen most forward. But among
all the mestfull families, the Emperours Court was most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate,
where in stead of rich spoyles, the Emperiall cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were replenished with dead and wounded bodies, and
confusion seeming to haue elected her habitation in that place,
began to infect euery particular person with his poyson. The
Empresse bathed in teares, had her eyes almost choaked vp
with weeping, and <hi>Emine</hi> the flower of beautie seemed like
the Rose ouerwashed with ouerlirant shewes, her crimson
staines became pale and bleake colours; so much doth sorrow
alter both the inward and outward habilities. <hi>Robert</hi> agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

he dissembled mirth, practising all meanes possible to delight
the Emperour, to mooue laughter to the Empresse, to content
<hi>Emine;</hi> faine would he haue enterprised armes, but he durst
not, fearing it was preiudiciall to his vowe, and so much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

him, and confidently perswaded him thereunto, (so his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
were not for vaineglorie sake, but for the honour and in
the name of Christ). <hi>Robert</hi> resolued herein became more
frolicke, moouing great pleasure in the Princes, by kissing
their swords, and playing with their armes; many battailes
were there fought, wherein he would faine haue béen present:
One day among the rest, at such time as the Princes issued
out to battaile, <hi>Emine</hi> called <hi>Robert</hi> vp into the top of a high
turret, from whence they might behold all the manner of the
conflict: but alas, the day was fatall to the Christians, and
the cries of them that fled pierced the very heauens. <hi>Robert</hi>
not able to endure these massacres, wept bitter teares for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and seeing <hi>Emine</hi> discontent, made signes vnto her for
armour; she by diuine instinct somewhat assertained of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
secretly with her owne hands armed him in a rich white
armour of her fathers, which he vsed in his youth, giuing him
a faire sword and shield, and shutting his beuer close comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

such furie, that before his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thirtie of the best Pagans: then taking in hand his well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
sword, hee performed such Cheualrie, as all the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were amazed, his sworde lighted in no place where it
cleaued not a lim, neither was their Helmets of that temper
that could withstand his stroake, he slewe <hi>Behenzar</hi> hand to

band of strong Tartarians reskewed him. <hi>Emine</hi> from her
solitarie Turret beholding his prowesse, was surprized with
meruailous sollace, now wished she that she could speake
whereby she might mooue her loue, now desired she that hée
were as noble, as hee was valiant, and as wittie, as hee was
worthie. But the Emperour among the rest was wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued
with the sight, and yéelding God most humble thankes.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10100:32"/>
animated his Souldiers to pursue the victorie; many and
valiant were the men that fell that day by <hi>Roberts</hi> sworde,
and had not the night by speedie approach departed both the
Armies, the Souldan had that day suffered an vndoubted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe:
whereuppon both the Armies sounded the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate,
and <hi>Robert</hi> with all expedition priuilie entered the
Citie, where encountering the Recluse his Confessor, he left
his Armour with him, and hid his horse in a Monastarie,
where the good man was resiant, returning to the Court in
his fooles habite: by which time the Emperour with his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
was entered the Citie, and being disarmed sat him
downe in great content, discoursing with his Princes and
Emperours vppon the affayres of that dayes seruice; great
was the noyse throughout the Citie of the white Knights
valour, and in Court was no other talke but of the straunge
Knight that behaued himselfe so valiantly. The Emperour
made great inquisition after him, but by no meanes could
vnderstande thereof.</p>
               <p>By this time <hi>Robert</hi> and his hound (as was his custome)
entered the dyning chamber, playing many pleasant trickes
before the Emperour, who tooke thereat wonderfull delight,
<hi>Emines</hi> eye was continually fixed on him, and whilest the
Kings talked of the valiant warriour, she purposely poynted
at him. It fortuned in this incountrie that <hi>Robert</hi> had a little
scratch ouer his right eye, which being but freshly wounded
bled a little; the Emperour that loued him deerely, examined
who had harmed him; great noyse was there about the
Pallace of this iniurie, and no man would be knowne of it,
only one Knight knéeling before the Emperour, certified his
grace that the knight who had deserued so much in his seruice
that day, was wounded in the same place, &amp; that he suspected it
was he. <hi>Robert</hi> fearing least he should be discouered, began
much more to play y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Idiot, putting his Cockscomb vpon the
Knights head &amp; laughing, which caused all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes to take
great delight: but <hi>Emine</hi> still poynted at him, &amp; if the libertie
<pb facs="tcp:10100:33"/>
of her tongue had graunted her meanes to discouer the secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of her thought, <hi>Robert</hi> assuredly had at that time been
knowne. The Emperour notwithstanding began to gather
on these allegations, and desirous to knowe the certaine
trueth, priuatly appoynted certaine Knights against the next
day to the number of thirtie to attend the sayd Champion;
and by some meanes to cause his discouerie. In this manner
passed they the euening in delight, till it was bed time,
when as the Emperour and Emperesse (after order was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
for the safetie of the Citie) betooke them to their rest,
and the other seuerall Lords and Princes to their lodging, at
which time <hi>Robert</hi> and his hound entered their homely cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,
wherein meditating without closing his eyes, the salt
teares streamed downe his cheekes in remembrance of his
sinnes, in thought of his father, in consideration of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie:
and now came there to his minde how for sixe yeares and
mare hée had liued an abiect life, vnworthie his estate, the
thought whereof so much abashed him, that it is vnpossible
to reckon vp his perplexities: then called hee to minde the
kinde effections of <hi>Emine,</hi> and his soule bemoned that so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a person should haue so palpable an vnperfection: now
applied hée the cause thereof to the Emperours sinne, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compting
the virgin happie, that by her want of speach esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
from many occasions of offence: then recorded hee the
effusion of Christian bloud, and of méere compassion in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of that thought hee wept most bitterly, when the poore

night in consideration of many thinges, and in conclusion of
the aduenture of his life, for the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

went euery one to arme him, and after they had heard the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

and made them more vigorous vnto reuenge, each one resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with this Camarado, to subdue, or dye; to conquer, or be
confounded. In their lookes were shadowed their tyrannies,
and in their hast their hardinesse. Scarcely were the allarms
sounded on both sides, but the enemy gaue the charge, and
the Souldan inflamed with loue, and inraged with furie,
sought by all meanes possible to confound his aduersaries.
On euery side were heard the gronings of wounded men,
some hauing lost their armes, some their legs, the sonne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
was trampled vnder the horsse féete of his father,
and in these common miseries, nature her selfe stoode amazed
to behold the Massacres. The Souldan which way soeuer he
trauailed, ouerthrew his resistants, the Emperour was by
him vnhorssed and wounded, and had not <hi>Pepin,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi>
of <hi>Burgundie</hi> rescued him at that time, <hi>actum esset de imperio.</hi>
Certaine men that were lightly wounded, brought no lesse
astonishment into the Citie, than was in the battaile, for they
aggrauated the discomfiture farre more than it was, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that the Emperour was vnrecouerably distressed. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
hearting of these rumors, hasted to the Recluse, his soule
groaned within him, and zeale ouercame him, so that after
some deuout prayers, accompanyed with remorsefull teares,
he mounted on horsseback, and hauing taken his armes, he
so valiantly and furiously entered the fight, that those who
beheld him, thought that some tempest had bin stirred vp, and
some whirlewind issued from the Citie, in his furie he tooke
no regard of person, murthering whomesoeuer he incounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
scarce could his horsse stirre himselfe for the multitude of
dead men that fell before him: such of the Christians as fled
out of the battaile before his entrance, returned vehemently,
so that the conflict was renewed with such vigor, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
in vehement showers seemed to be weepe the murther.
The Emperour beyond all expectation, shewed himselfe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
and approching the place where the Norman Prince
fought, he cryed out for extreame ioy: Oh hope of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
thou flowre of chiualrie, thou anchor of mine Empire,
<pb facs="tcp:10100:34"/>
the heauens requite thee: see how old in yeares my person
shall accompany thee, how forward I will fight, and inforce
thy selfe the more to preuent the desolation of yond Citie.
<hi>Robert</hi> quickned with his words, departed as if he vnderstood
him not, and meeting with the Souldan, gaue him such a
stroke on the helmet, that his horsse fell vnto the ground, and
he himselfe was wonderfully amazed. The whole band of the
Mamelucks seeking to withstand him, were either dissipated
or destroyed, and be that thought to gaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefest triumph,
enacted the choicest tragedie: in briefe, as the tender blossoms

borne creatures, vpon the violent breath of a Northren wind,
are depriued of their beawtie and decayed in their blossome:
so the Pagans beholding the forwardnes of the assaylant,
and the feeblenesse of their assembly, fled away, both care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
of their weale, and recurelesse in their wrack. <hi>Robert</hi>
seeing the euening approching on, the Christians prowd with
victorie, the pursuite hote, the flight hastie, sodainely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe
himselfe; for the gentle Westerne winde (a kind loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

cause, dreading to be be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all glory to heauens, and not vnto his hand) he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
departed, leauing the Christians to pursue that with
swiftnesse, which he had compassed by his sword, but whilst he
seeketh to auoyd the furie of his enemie, he is readie to perish
through the meanes of amitie, for the thirtie chosen Knightes
appointed by the Emperour to descrie him, at such time as
he forsooke the battaile, followed him hastelie, and couching
their Launces all at once, on sodayne assayled him: he seeing
so many attempting him at once, turned his horsse, resoluing
to endure the hazard, but finding their armes to be Christian,
he spurred his horsse, detesting vtterly to come in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10100:34"/>
the pursuite was hote, the flight seruent, the follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
in despayre, the flyer determined; how often smiled
<hi>Robert</hi> to himselfe, knowing that he fled before he feared?
how often feared they to touch him, that fled from them?
in briefe, some one better horssed than the other, seeing that
the hazard of their credits depended on their knowledge,
hauing the swiftest Horsse, pursued the Norman Prince,
and so egerly indeuored, that he gaue him a deepe wound
in the thygh, and sodaynely returned to his companyons,
knowing, that the bitternesse of the same, and the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his griefe, would soonest disclose the obscuritie of
the sufferer. And now began the night to giue freedome to
the afflicted, and <hi>Robert</hi> meanes of escape, who arriuing at
the Hospitall of the Recluse, set vp his Horsse, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vp hys woundes, and in his Idiotlie habbit, entered the
Court. <hi>Emine</hi> that had seene the battaile, could hardlie
contayne her selfe, entertayning the supposed Ideot with
many solemnities, beeing onely priuie with the holie man
to his ordinarie rescouses. Often did she offer in signes, to
shewe he was wounded, but <hi>Robert</hi> so cunningly concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his agonyes, as the world could not discerne his gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce.
In conclusion, the day closing vp, the daungers
were manyfest, the Christians had the vpper hande, the
Pagans were discomfited, and the Emperour returning
in tryumph vnto his Court, was solemnelye receyued
with Procession, and euery valiant Prince entertayned
also with publique applaudings. In the Pallace was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

supposed Idiot, that gaue vs conquest: This <hi>Robert</hi> surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
(for his wicked life in times past) the Diuell, who hath
turned his damned deedes to deuotion, is he that reskewed
the Emperour, was armed by mee, was horsed by my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and if he be searched, is the very man who was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by your Knights; this Souldans armour is magicall,
his Stéede infernall, himselfe perfidious; why permit you
(Princes) that he who hath soyled his hands in your blouds,
should be serued like a Prince of high bountie? Lay handes
on him, inflict bonds on him, flay the viper ere he sting, and the
Crocodile ere he can deuour. These words were vttered with
a confident and bolde spirit, and all the assembly was abashed
at this wonder; the Souldan stood as a man that had lost his
senses, and the best Romanes began to flocke about <hi>Robert.</hi>
During these miraculous euents, whilest each mans tongue
was kept mute with meruaile, the holy Recluse entered the
presence (ordayned as it is thought by diuine ordinance) in his
hands bare he the true Armour, and about his neck the girdle
and sworde, hauing a religious Nouice at his heeles who

throught the prease, and prostrating himselfe before the
Emperour and Pope, began thus. How many waies (you
tyes of Christendome) hath God permitted error to supplant
the righteous, to the ende that beyond expectation he might
expresse his righteousnesse? The lippes that were shut hath
he opened, and the things that were hidden hath he reuealed;
<hi>Patroclus</hi> is not <hi>Achilles</hi> (ye Princes) though he weare his

nor the Crowe the king of birds, though hee hath borrowed

The Souldan pondering with himselfe his perilous
estate, seeing his loue recureles, and his libertie rechles except

licence from the Emperour, to goe visite the same: <hi>Emine</hi>

tooke his leaue of the Emperour, who with entire affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Almightie, and King <hi>Pepin,</hi> who accompanyed them: and
so long they trauayled with gracious entertaynement in all
great Cities, that at last they arriued on the frontires of
<hi>Normandie,</hi> when as <hi>Robert</hi> bethinking him of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

many amiable consolations, and <hi>Pepin</hi> perswaded with

they met a Damosell galloping in great haste, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
so piteously, that it greeued the beholders: aged shee
was, yet goodly of personage: and being earnest in her hast,
would haue ouerpassed the Princesse, had not <hi>Robert</hi> stayed

that might concerne his Mistresse, or moue affection: she
tould how his Ladie was adiudged to death within three
dayes, if she found not a Champion, (for onely three dayes
remayned of the yeare) she declared the earnest haste of the
accusers, and concluded thus: Now noble Prince, since
thou knowest the cause of my trauaile; if courage serue thee
in the attempt, O be forward, and helpe the forsaken, for
more noble canst thou not fight for, more gratious canst thou
not aduenture for: but if thou preferre thy reioyce before
iustice, pleasure before prowesse, and beare the name of a
Knight, but not the nature, O stay me not, stay me not good
Prince, I will seeke out <hi>Pepins</hi> Court of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> where
are valiant Knights and vertuous, sterne in rigor, studious
of right; who if they forsake this cause, are worthie to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
none. This discourse finished she with aboundant
teares, neither was there any in the company so hard harted,
who be wept not <hi>Edithas</hi> miserie. <hi>Robert</hi> inflamed with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
replied thus: Lady, thou hast found a Champion,
seeke no further, heare is <hi>Pepin</hi> to allow him, and a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to appoint him: this sayd, he in priuate conferred with
the King of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Emine,</hi> desiring them to take easye
iourneys, whilst he and the messenger intended the safetie of
<hi>Editha:</hi> the request was so reasonable, that it was quickly
graunted him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherevpon he tooke his horsse and armour,
and trauailed with the auncient Lady, resoluing himselfe
in euery respect of that he suspected: yet concealed he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
though she required his name verie earnestly, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vp his lodging neere the Citie of <hi>Roane,</hi> he charged
the Lady to goe and comfort her Mistresse, assuring her
that she had a Champion that either would dye or acquite
her. The Lady was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ack to accomplish his commaund,
but so schooled her Mistresse by comfortable admonitions,
that she who before times was altogether comfortlesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to gather some consolation. And now the prefixed day
was arriued, when <hi>Villiers</hi> desirous to effect his pretended
tirannie, had erected an ample and faire Listes in the chiefest
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10100:43"/>
and fairest playne adioyning to <hi>Roan,</hi> building sumptuous
Scaffolds for the Iudges, prouiding place of audience for
the prisoner, leauing nothing vnsought for, that pertayned
to that tragedie: and at such time as the assembly of estates
was set, he brought foorth the Champion, a kinsman of his
owne, well instructed in armes, and resolued in the complot
of treason. This braue Caualier ritchly mounted, bonded his
horsse before the iudgement seate, offering to doo his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oire
toward the approbation of the Dutchesse treacherie. Then
was the prisoner called for, where <hi>Editha</hi> carying in her
lookes the badge of modestie; in her behauiour the courage
of a Matron; apparrailed in black Ueluet, and couered with
a vaile of black Tissue, ascended her Scaffold, attended by
all the chiefe Ladyes of <hi>Normandie,</hi> who to testifie their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie,
were in like manner attyred mournefully. After
that <hi>Editha</hi> had done her obedience to the Iudges &amp; Estate,
she was demaunded for her Champion, who returned this
answere. It is extreame iniurie, and no iustice (you Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
when Princes shalbe condemned like priuate persons,
without respect of their Maiestie, or regard of their accusers:
for otherwise was <hi>Auberts</hi> hope (ye Lords) who appoynted
me to commaund you, and not to be condemned by you: but
dutie I perceiue was buried with him, and those that hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him in his life time, it was not for loue, but in hope to get
liuing. I am accused for poysoning <hi>Aubert,</hi> ye Peeres, and
you your selues were eye witnesses of his naturall death,
when no signe of treason, no token of violent death, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ppeared
either before his death, or after his departure. Had he taken
potions, they should haue wrought, but you knowe there was
no violence in his pangs, but euen the infirmitie of age that
fashioned him to his graue. But you will say there are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and what alledge they? forsooth that I bought poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

I ministred poyson, but when? were you as forward to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

you would blush either at your wilfull blindnesse, or

the fire, yet shal I dye innocent; call me murtheresse, I know
I am innocent; for my Champion, I haue not sought him, but
God hath sent him: if he come not at the summons, let my

worst of your enuie. This conclusion she vetered with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
boldnesse, insomuch as <hi>Villiers</hi> blushed, and some of the
Peeres began to suspect him: well, the summons was soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
according to order, and braue <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Normandie</hi>
boldly entered the Listes, offering to aduenture his life in the
behalfe of <hi>Editha.</hi> Great was the ioy of all the Ladyes, to see
so goodly a Knight enterprise the Dutchesse right, and <hi>Editha</hi>
in thought seemed to claime some part of him: but leauing
tedious circumlocutions, this in briefe was the effect of the
matter, the Champions were sworne, and the Iudges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted,
and after sound of Trumpet, and Proclamation,
the Combate was commenced. Great was the courage of
the accuser, but greater the constancie of the defendant, the

theyr Swoords, where (after some small resist) <hi>Robert</hi>
lent his aduersarie such a stroke, that he cut off his right

vppon his neck in a sound, and with such entyre affection
embraced him, that it was thought that both their bodyes
were vnited together with a mutuall simpathie of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
and after she was reuiued a little, stealing a long kisse
from his lips, she began thus. And art thou yet liuing my
Sonne, or are mine eyes deceiued? Yea thou liuest my
Sonne, for nature tells me so, planting such a ioy in my
heart to sée thée, as I neuer had so great will to sigh for thée.

discourse, each one presenting him homage and humble
salute: whereupon taking <hi>Editha</hi> with him, and placing her
on the right hand, he with great grauitie ascended the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

insolent, as I haue béen accustomed (my countrimen) neither
would I ascend the place of Iudgement, nor condiscend to
administer Iustice: but since God hath humbled my heart,
and altered my affects, and made you happie, in calling mée

and duetie you imploy on mee, I must leuell out and deuise
meanes to preserue you, which can no better bee administred
but by iustice, which ordereth all things with so determined
iudgement, that the good are maintained for their goodnesse,
and the bad punished for their iniustice: Since therefore in

in hand like a commaunder, and roote out this cockle from the

in more feare; for which cause (ye Normans) since it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
and approoued, that <hi>Villiers</hi> with his competitors, haue
conspired against the Ladie Duchesse my mother, our will is
that they perish in the same fire they prouided for the faultles,
and suffer the same punishment they ordained for the innocent.
All the whole people applauded his righteous iudgement,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10100:45"/>
and iustice was orderly executed, whilest each one meruailed
at his excellencie and wisedome. After then that he had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
