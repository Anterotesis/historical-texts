            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

priuate Souldiour that knoweth himselfe, may iudge it were more then beastly: and so stands the case with vs, if we doo wilfully or ignorantly forsake that which wee haue so long time made iust triall to be of the greatest force, and doo returne to that againe the which we haue so often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken, for the disabilitie that by triall we haue found ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: then are we well woorthy to abide the smart thereof to our own reproche. And yet were it but the losse of the thing it selfe, the matter were the lesse. There are none that in person hath made iust triall of the Archers that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer will if he may choose be partaker with them againe: it is but the loue that manye doo beare vnto the same wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, for that in times past they were the best shotte that were: and yet were they the cause of more bloodshed then in these daies is vsed: and my reason is this, that when battailes and great encounters chaunced to fall out, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the shot were no more offenciue, then by the vse of the long Bowes and Crossebowes: the enemies did then commonlye ioyne both with long and shorte weapons, as by the dints of two handed Swoordes, Battell Axes and Billes, with Leade malles, whereby the fight continued vnto the last end of the one party, but in these daies where the weapons of fire hath beene rightlye vsed, it hath beene scarselye seene that either Pike or Halberd hath come to ioyne at any time before the one partie did turne their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by reason of the terrible force of the great and small shot the which by skilfull conductors of the same, haue been placed vpon their enemies by vauntage of grounds or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, as time and place hath serued.</p>
            <p>And for that I haue heard so many seuerall opinions as is aforesaide: I thought it my parte and duety to set downe my opinion and knowledge the which I haue learned by vsing of diuers seuerall weapons, in times of seruice as well on horseback as on foot, and the rather for the better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of those not vnderstanding how requisite it is to bee resolued in those pointes, not thinking in all my life to


<pb facs="tcp:1172:5"/>
haue doone any such matter, but vpon this occasion the which I am driuen vnto for diuers causes, not altogither for want of experience in the thing it selfe, but for want of knowledge how to parfect the same in the setting down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnlearned, saue only to write a very simple stile: it may be thought in me a presumption, yet for that the thing is laudable and tendeth to no other end then for the triall of so good a cause as this is, the which all good Subiects are bound to fauour: wherein I doo with a cleere conscience protest not willinglye to offend any partie or parties vnder the Sunne, of what qualitie or calling soeuer he or they be. I am not to treat of any matter of auncient times, but as some occasion may cause me for proofe, but only within my owne knowledge or at the least recorded, or to be prooued: And for that I entred to be a Souldier at the age of 18. yeeres, which was the second yeere of tht good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. at which time our English Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers were in force and greatly vsed, and Harquebuziers not as then common. For the first that euer had any whole band in England, was Syr <hi>Peeter Mewtas</hi> Knight, who had as I doo remember the charge of 500. halfe Hakes, the which were but mean stuffe in comparison of those that are now in vse, and at that time there were not in most bands of 100. men, aboue 10. or 15. and in many none at all: sauing Captain <hi>Hugh Smith,</hi> who had in Guymes 100. Harquebuziers, sauing 10. or 12. of other weapons, insomuch that the perfection of them were not as then in England knowen to any purpose, nor yet vnto this daye but with few, in respect that the sa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> is in other countries neere vnto vs, which I would wish might be as well in England as elsewhere, for those weapons of fire are not to be vsed without exercising of the same to any good purpose for seruice vpon the suddaine: but being once throughlye practised, it is an excellent weapon and next vnto the Musket, as in place heerafter shalbe showne.</p>
            <p>It may be thought by some Captaines of late experience, for that I haue not entred into these troublesome toyles in


<pb facs="tcp:1172:6"/>
the Low Cuntries, or the ciuill warres in Fraunce, that I cannot haue that experience &amp; knowledge as others haue: wherunto I answere that when I was young I did seeke to serue, both in England, Fraunce, and Scotland, to that end I might the better doo my Prince and Countrye seruice, and also to sustaine myselfe, who otherwaies was not able to liue as I did desire to doo: wheras I learned to know the vse of most weapons of warre both for Horsemen and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are or haue beene vsed in this age, with as good Schoolemaisters as any Italian, Spaniard or Wallon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, hath been or now is.</p>
            <p>And further I hope I maye without offence set downe the seueral paies that in my own Princes seruice I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for my own person. The first pay that I had was 6. pence per diem, for 3 months: after that 8. pence per diem, 16. pence per diem, 20. pence per diem, 2. shillings per di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em, 4. shillings per diem, charge after 4. shillings per di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em, charge after 6. shillings per diem, charge after 8. shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings per diem, charge after 14. shillings per diem. In all which aduauncement of payes &amp; credit I did neuer make sute nor require any of the same paies: sauing my first paye of 6. pence per diem: but they were all bestowed vpon mee either by the Prince, or by those who had the next place: without sute either of myselfe or of any other in my behalf: my entertainment in the French Kings seruice was such, as none of our nation for a footman euer had, only captain <hi>Lampton</hi> excepted: who after hee was discharged from his band of footmen, became a priuat Souldier in the foote bands of Fraunce, and had great allowance for his owne person and seruants. I haue been offered in Fraunce better pay and greater aduauncement then euer I had or desired.</p>
            <p>I was promised by the King of Spaine to haue a penci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of 200. Crownes by yeere to be paide vnto me in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for my seruice doone vnto him at St. Quintins, but before I could come from whence I was prisoner, his Queen was dead, and hee againe married to the French Kinges Daughter, and at my return from my troubles in Fraunce,


<pb facs="tcp:1172:6"/>
I was answered that the King was gone who did promise the said pencion, and the Queene was dead, wherefore the promise was not to be perfourmed, I required letters into Spaine to the King, I was answered that it was no time as then, but when time serued I should haue letters of Serti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, and so the cause grue worse then before, and so as yet I had nothing. This haue I set down to th'end, that those who doo not knowe me may the better vnderstand, that I doo not write or speake by reading or heare-say but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience only.</p>
            <p>Wherfore I doo hartely wish that we may growe all to one perfect knowledge without contending in any point, so far differing from all true knowledge and experience: and let the times past, rest, with such weapons and engines, as in those daies were the best, and yet but trifles in respect of things now in vse: As for example, was not our olde Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Towers, sufficient to defend against all Rams and engins in those daies vsed: wheras in these times there is hardly any deuice of fortification will serue against the force of the Cannons? Was not that famous King, <hi>Edward</hi> the third, constrained to lye before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Callice 13. or 14. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, for that he wanted the vse of the Cannon, the which in foure or fiue daies was lost with the force of the same, and other fiery weapons? some may say it was lost by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but those that doo know any thing, doo perceiue how that was doon. And again, was not Iack and Sallet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our remembrance thought to be sufficient for arming of Souldiours? and further, concerning our simple arming in times past, notwithstanding that Syr <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> dooth affirme that men were as well armed in times past, as now present: which for example, looke into the Histories the 11. yeere of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth: where it appeareth, that <hi>Robert Basset</hi> Alderman of London, and the Recorder there, was thought to be well armed, being both armed with Iacks to defend the Cittie, against that Rebell Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard <hi>Neuell:</hi> a man would think, that being an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, if Armours had beene as then in such store as now


<pb facs="tcp:1172:7"/>
they are, that the Alderman would haue had one for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and another for the Recorder. Againe, did not the Duke of Bedford arme the most parte of his Souldiours with tanned leather for the cheefe partes of their bodies, at such time as he was commaunded by that prudent Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. the 2. yeere of his raigne, to encounter with that Rebell the <hi>L. Louell:</hi> whereas now by reason of the force of weapons, neither horse nor man is able to beare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours sufficient to defend their bodies from death, wheras in the former times afore mentioned, woundes was the worst to haue been doubted, touching the force of all their Archers, as by that manner of arming it seemeth most certaine.</p>
            <p>I wish without offence, that all the Spanish shot were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as good as euer were in England, to that end, our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might once ioyne with them, for any harme that the arrowes could do, they would soon returne to gather grapes in Spaine.</p>
            <p>Why should not Spaniards being owners of that pleasant wood the Yewe, become Bowmen and Archers? they are artificiallye sufficient, and they haue and doo seeke by all meanes possible, that their ambition may be made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. There is no doubt, but mighty Princes would haue them, either of their own Subiects or of hierlings: if they were but halfe so good as in the opinion of sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> they are thought to be.</p>
            <p>And thus by these simple reasons, the which cannot iustlye be denyed, it maye appeare how thinges in times past, and now in these our times doo differ, which may and will I hope in time be better considered off.</p>
            <p>My intent is to no other effect, but only to explane the matter so far differing, by the discourses of the saide two Knights, in declaring my opinion touching the same: I might the rather be blamed heerin, as no doubt I shall be, of some halfe Latinists, for want of congruitie in my doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: but neuerthelesse, I will not let for all those to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with this, seeing that in all this time none doth frame


<pb facs="tcp:1172:7"/>
to set downe something touching the matter before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. I hope I may as a labourer, take vpon me to dig forth the stones from the Rockes, and to leaue the same in more readines for the woorkmen to hewe and pullish to a greater perfection.</p>
            <p>It dooth cause me to remember one <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and a Souldiour in the French Kings seruice, who could haue plaide of a Lute or a Gitterne excellent well: but his conditions was such, that if the best Lord or Lady in Fraunce had requested him to haue plaied, hee would not haue doon it, the reason was that he doubted, that he should haue been taken for some foolish Musition, and yet was he to be brought to haue plaied without intreatye, as thus: if any of his acquaintance had taken the Lute or Gittern in hand, the worse that he or they had played, the sooner would <hi>Cornelius</hi> haue taken the same foorth of his freends hands, and thereon would haue plaide right plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly. And so now I doubt not but euen at the firste blush we shall haue a <hi>Cornelius</hi> to set these instruments in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tune, in all their wants and imperfections by mee for want of learning and knowledge committed and left vnperfourmed: so shal I be glad to haue giuen an occasion to so good effect.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>First I will begin in this my sayd discourse, to remember one of the examples that S. <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> dooth set downe in his discourse, for proofe of Archers to bee weapons of force: And thus he saith at the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight of famous memorie, lying in Campe before <hi>Turwin,</hi> there was a Conuoy to goe from <hi>Guynes</hi> to the saide Campe, of Munition and Uictualles: and all the Frenche Captaines of <hi>Picardie</hi> &amp; <hi>Varmendois,</hi> hauing intelligence thereof, did assemble all their men at Armes and Launces of those Prouinces, with some number of shot, also of Harquebuzers &amp; Cros-bowers, and attended the English Conuoy in an ambush, more then a league


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1172:9"/>
beyond the town of Ard towards Turwin, where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering with the english light horsemen, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carreres then did ouerthrowe them: which beeing perceiued by the Captaines of the Conuoy, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlye indused their carriages into a conueniente fourme, and placing conuenient numbers of Archers vnto two open places before and behinde, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all other places betwixt cariage and cariages where the Frenche Launces might haue anye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce, after a long fight and many charges by the men at armes of Fraunce, and their shot giuen: the terrible effecte of the volley of Arrowes was such, that a great number of their horses were wounded or slaine: and one of their chiefe Captaines called <hi>Monsieur de Plesse</hi> lifting vp his sworde to strike, was shot in at the arme-hole through his Gosset of Maile, and there slaine, with many other french gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and others of good accounte, in suche sorte that the Frenche did farre excéede the Englishe in number, were that day repulsed and ouerthrowne by the excellencie of archers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If Sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> doo giue credite vnto olde maister <hi>Candwell,</hi> and thereupon set downe as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesaid: he may in that pointe be deceiued, as for example: doo but reade <hi>Hollinsheades</hi> Cronicle the fifth yéere of <hi>H. 8. folio.</hi> 817. vpon B. how the same fell out contrarie. Againe at solemne masse, where the power of Scotlande to the number of 15000. minding to iuade the West borders of England, and so being in the English ground in a mistie morning about twelue miles distaunce from the Scottishe power: there was vpon the warning of the Beaken comming from the Baronrie of <hi>Kendall,</hi> about two hundreth Archers, and notwithstanding the Scots nor Archers did not méete by tenne miles: yet was


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1172:9"/>
it reported and yet is saide, that the Archers was the cause that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scots were that day ouerthrowne: wheras there was no such matter touching the said Archers: but true it is that the Scots was there ouerthrowne, their whole power in effect as <hi>Iedeon</hi> ouerthrew Gods enemies, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Scots were 44. to one English man, I could rehearse more, but this maye suffise, being doon in <hi>H.</hi> 8. his daies.</p>
               <p>And whereas Sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> doth rehearse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye and sundrye exsamples of victories and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes, giuen by the force and effect of Archers, some aboue 2000. yéeres since, and some 200 yéeres since, and the most betwixt these times: but what hath béene doone since the perfect knowledge of fire weapons hath béen in vse? and wheras <hi>Manuell</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had in his armour or Target the number of 30. arrowes sticking: one Harquebuze or Musket shot would haue dispatched the matter, wherby men may sée that it is but our owne opinions and grounded affection, that our countrymen doo beare vnto the same weapon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that the same was the best shotte in aunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time, when others of greater force were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne: we haue the like estmation of the Long Bow, as the Irish haue of their Darts, the Dansk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their Hatchets, and as the Scotch men haue had of their Speares: all which are more méeter for Sauadge people or poore Potentates, who are not able to maintain others of greater force, then for puissant Princes. The Scots and Irish for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Countries doo vse their Bowes, and so doo the Burgonians and Wallons in the time of the warres, garde their Caues, Churches &amp; small Pyles: the Cuntrymen for the safety of their goods, but the Souldiers in pay doo neuer vse them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb facs="tcp:1172:10"/>
in hold no rfield, who would not forbeare to vse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they knew no better or other of greater force.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, that Sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> dooth say that the arrowes of Archers wil kill th'enemies farther distance off then any Harquebuze can doo, I leaue that to the iudgement of all such Captaines and Souldiers as haue seene the true triall of both the weapons.</p>
               <p>It is not possible that noble men should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand or knowe the force and effect of weapons and abilliments of warre, as other meaner persons doo, who are brought vp with the vse therof: some with one, and some with other, and selve with all: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it the place for a noble man or worthy perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, to become a Musketter, Harquebuzere, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonere, miner, trench maister or fortefier, all which are for meaner persons and yong men to begin their seruice withall, and to procéed from one to another, as the body and the minde is addicted, and without these the warres cannot be conuaid to any good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: and as for footemen, a Pike, a Halberd, or a leading staffe: and for horsemen, a Launce, a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching staffe, Pistoll or mace, it is seemely for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage of good account, either on foot or on horseback to vse them as in their kindes they ought to be: all which weapons are soone learned sauing the Pistoll the which must come by exercise. And now to very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my woords, I will heere set down and name such as by wrong instructions of them that haue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med some noble men in marshall causes not so néere the matter as the cause required to haue been doon, all thinges considered: and also of some that haue been accounted wise and expert Souldiers in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and yet in their dooings haue not so well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed the same: I would be loath to offend anye


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1172:10"/>
in this point, for I doo rather set it downe for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of those that doo liue, then in any sort to blemish those departed:</p>
               <p>I will begin with the noble Earle of <hi>Penbrooke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Earle of Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook.</note> whose valour and wisdome is not forgotten: and yet was he not greatly trained in the knowledge of Martiall Discipline, as by these reasons shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>After that I had béene in the French Kings ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice from the 6. yéere of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> siege of <hi>Saint-quintans</hi> in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> at which time I did come to the said Camp, where the saide Earle was Lieftenant of the English army vnto the King: it pleased his Lordship to call mee to him and to talke with me of diuers French matters: and after many discourses what preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were made in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> it pleased his Lo. to aske me who was cheefe in the Towne of <hi>Saint-quintins,</hi> I tolde his Lo. the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and his brother Andelot, he asked mine opinion<note place="margin">Admirall Satylyon.</note> of the Admirals courage and knowledge: I tolde his Lo. that he was both wise and valiant, as any that euer I had serued vnder. No, no, said the Earle, you are deceiued, he is wise but not valiant: I did not replye any further in that point, thinking that the Earle by his great wisdome, knewe more then my selfe, being then but young, but the Admirall did proue my opinion sufficiently: then the Earle did ask me what I thought of that armie, and if that I had euer seen the like: I said it was a goodly armye, and that I had seene the like at diuers times. Yea saide the Earle, but did you euer see y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like expedition that is made in battering the walles of the Town? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of his Lo. how long the same had beene placed, his Lo. answered 14. daies, I saide that I had seene as much doon in three daies, the which was


<pb facs="tcp:1172:11"/>
of greater strength then that was off: he asked mee where, I tolde him, and after some other spéeches, his Lo. departed for that time. Now his Lo. had neuer séen the like before: wherfore it séemed to him a new thing: this is not any reproche to that noble and woorthy Earle, for how can any man whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be, know that he did neuer sée?</p>
               <p>And shortly after it happened that the Castle of<note place="margin">The Castle of Guynes besieged.</note> 
                  <hi>Guines</hi> was besieged by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French: and hauing drawn their Trenches neere vnto the walles of the saide Castle, euen at the point of the day, a volley of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons went off at the Castle walles, and a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of good account hearing the same, saide to his man, me thinkes said he, I doo heare the battery goe off, goe sée at what place the same is placed. The man went, and brought his M. woord that the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie was placed against the Marie Bulwarke, that is well saide the Gentleman, God holde them there this moneth, supposing that the same would haue holden foorth the like time, but the same was made assaultable, before two of the clock the same daye. Thus in mistaking of things, men may see the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of experience: for that manye other fortifications was supposed to be of strength sufficient to defend the cannon, and therby haue been deceiued.</p>
               <p>There was in those daies great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the French and the Spaniards in battering, for I haue séene both, and haue considered of the strength of both, the forciue and the defenciue: and in troth the Spaniards are or were, farre inferiour vnto the French: For examples sake, firste at <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,</hi> where the Emperors campe laye at the least 3. moneths before it was wonne, being in effect drye round about, without any water in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ditches, which is a great strength to any holde. <hi>Saint-quintins</hi> was


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1172:11"/>
the weakest Towne in all <hi>Pickardy, Taresse,</hi> or in <hi>Uarmendois,</hi> and yet it cost y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> King 20. daies woork, whereas the French King did winne in one season<note place="margin">Townes won in one summer by the french. K. H. 2.</note> these townes, viz: the Towne of <hi>Seme</hi> in one day, the Town of <hi>Marianbrugh</hi> in one day, the town and castle of <hi>Ieuoye</hi> in one daye, the Towne of <hi>Bouaigne</hi> in one day the castle of Denant 3. daies, the towne of <hi>Binks</hi> in one daye, whereof the most parte were stronger then either <hi>Turwin</hi> or <hi>Saint-quintins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to returne where I lefte touching wronge informations or wante of experience: It fell out<note place="margin">The french Nacion expelled foorthe of Scotland.</note> within two yeeres, that the Queenes Maiestie that nowe is, sent her army into Scotland for the expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Frenche Nation from thence, at which time the Frenche did then retire themselues, with some fewe Scots, into the towne of <hi>Lieth,</hi> for theyr most safetie vppon the approching of her Maiesties armie: the L. W. <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton</hi> then Generall of<note place="margin">The L. W.

Pelham intrencheth and is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended without cause.</note> of good will that I bare vnto the seruice, I wente vnto him in courteous manner and saide, maister <hi>Pelham,</hi> it were verye good for you to beginne at the foote of this hill, and runne straight to yonder hillocke, whereat he seemed to be offended and saide that I stoode not charged with these matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was his charge and not mine: I was sorie of that I had spoken, considering how vncourteouslie he did accept


<pb facs="tcp:1172:12"/>
of my good will. But how did the matter fall out? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tenne daies, by leauinge his trenche open: the French perceiuing that they might without any let come both on horsebacke and foote, and so did: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it cost the liues of 200. souldiers, and Captaine <hi>Bartlet</hi> taken prisoner, with diuers others, and at the reskew wherof the L. <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton</hi> that now<note place="margin">The L.

               <p>And againe at the time, that the good Earle <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But the said Captaine <hi>Brode,</hi> to maintaine his said answer, sayd that he had said truely, and thereupon did offer to wager, whereto I did offer there, to shoot<note place="margin">40.

               <head>The third Discourse.</head>
               <p>AS for the disorders in the Low Cuntries, it is sufficientlye spoken off in the discourse of Sir <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> and as concerning the battell at <hi>Tilbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile at Tilbury.</note> in Anno. <hi>1588.</hi> I haue heard diuers reportes therof, the which if they be true, there was some cause to finde faulte. But as touching the Archers they were placed in my opinion, in the place most fit for them: for the best was to be placed in the front, and the woorst in the rereward.</p>
               <p>And as concerning great or small Bandes of footmen: my opinion is this, that it is necessarye for foote-bands or bands of horsemen, to be of diuers numbers, for sundrye causes: First, for that there are Captaines, who are better able to gouerne fiue hundred, then some othoers are to guern two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1172:14"/>
Againe, if there happen some péece of seruice<note place="margin">It is good that Bands of footmen and horse men be of diuers num bers for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers causes.</note> to be doone, which one hundred maye doo, it is more then néedeth to send two or thrée hundreds to do the same, or peraduenture there cannot be spared so manye: If therefore there should be sent one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth from another hundreth, if in both the places seruice should come in hand: the two hundreth so parted, shall be the weaker in both the partes, by deuiding the Officers. As for example.</p>
               <p>I haue the charge of <hi>200.</hi> footmen, my commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der commaunds me to set foorth of my band of <hi>200.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deuiding of bands dooth wea ken the same.</note> one hundred, to keepe a straight or passage, or such like: it is reason that either my Lieftenaunt or my selfe doo goe with them: if in the mean time occasion of seruice be offered, both my two hundreds are by this means weakned.</p>
               <p>And so dooth the matter fall out, if a parcell of seruice should be doon, where <hi>500.</hi> should be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therunto: it were better that one sufficient Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tooke in hand to doo the same with his onlye band, then to send two Captains: for two may be of diuers opinions, and so may differ, whereby the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is oftentimes hindred. So is it in my opinion, not amisse, that there be in a great Army, <hi>100. 200. 300. 400. 500.</hi> or <hi>600.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Frenchmen doo vse when a noble man hath <hi>600.</hi> footmen in charge, to haue two Ensignes, and two Lieftenants, foure Sargeants, and 8. Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles, for commonlye, they doo vse <hi>300.</hi> to one En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe in Campe time: but the Countie of <hi>Creance</hi> had in the seruice against <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. the charge of <hi>600.</hi> footmen.</p>
               <p>And for the numbers to be admitted vnder Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, it standeth in the same state, as dooth the


<pb facs="tcp:1172:15"/>
Captains before mentioned: for a worthye perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage that is able to gouern aright, would I wish to haue vnder his charge <hi>3000.</hi> men, a mener <hi>2000.</hi> and the least <hi>1000:</hi> so should they the more properly serue vpon seuerall occasions, as the Captaines maye in their estates doo. But one thing I doo wish, that the Collonelles should take such order with their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, that euery seuerall band be armed and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned alike, according to their proportion: so shal it be a great furtheraunce at the time that the Armye shall be reduced into battaile, and put in order to fight, without any confusion or trouble to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralles of the fielde, or to the Sargeants maiors: but with great ease maye embattaile them vpon the sodaine, if they were in number <hi>20000.</hi> footmen. Thus much after my mean skil and vnderstanding haue I set down, as concerning Collonels and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, referring the same to my betters, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of greater experience and knowledge, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or disalow at their pleasure.</p>
               <p>And further concerning the proportion of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons<note place="margin">The proper showes of weapons for foot bands.</note> afore mencioned: I wish to euery hundred <hi>35.</hi> armed Pikes, <hi>30.</hi> Muskets, <hi>20,</hi> Calyuers, and <hi>15.</hi> Billes, Halberds or Partesants: my reason is this, that I would haue so much to offend, as to defend: for as by common experience, that those Swissers and Almaines, whose hierlings soeuer they be, the chéefe cause wherefore they are retained, are but to fortefie the bodies of their battailes as defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and therfore are most sure and strong. But as for the offenciue, which be the shot next vnto the Horsemen: they must be of other nations, and men of more agillitie of bodye, then either Swisser or Launce-Knight. And now to the declaration of our weapons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:1172:15"/>IT is supposed by many, that the weapon called commonly a Caliuer, is another thinge then a<note place="margin">The Duke of Guise was the first that did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent them</note> Harquebuze, whereas in troath it is not, but onely a Harquebuze, sauing that it is of a greater circuite or Bullet, then the other is of: wherfore the French man dooth cal it a péece de <hi>Calibre,</hi> which is as much as to say, a péece of bigger circute.</p>

               <head>The fourth discourse.</head>
               <p>ANd nowe for that the Harquebuze, was the first weapon that I did vse, I will therefore say some thing touching the same: it is a weapon moste offenciue, that as yet euer was inuented, for all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of seruice, as well on horsebacke as one foote, and in the handes of a skilfull souldier, well practised and trained with the vse thereof, a most terrible and<note place="margin">Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze in the hands of ignoraunt men are rather hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious</note> deadly weapon. But this I muste néedes confesse, that in the handes of an ignoraunt person, neither apte nor willing to vse the same, as of right it ought to be, it is rather hurtfull then commodious: For whosoeuer shall take in hand to vse the same wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, must take (as it were) a delighte in the well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thereof. First to kéepe the same cleane and cléere as well within as without, and to haue his molde, to cast his Bullets, as round as is possible, and the same well pared, to that ende it may fall close to the powder, without staying by the way, then his match well made and dry, his stéele and flinte to strike fire, his scrues and wormes to serue all for his skowring sticke, and for euery tenne souldiers to haue a casting panne. For flasks, it were better that the vse of them were lefte, and in liewe thereof the Spanishe vse, which is nowe had with vs for our muskets, for it is the best, the surest and the readiest, that yet hath

béene vsed for diuers causes, which I omitte least I should bee tedious. This Harquebuzier muste yet haue a tuch boxe, a purse for his Bullets, steele and flint, and a priminge Iron for the clearinge of the tuch hole, when neede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall require, a good Morion, with not to high a creast, a good shorte sworde of a yarde in blade, and dagger of twelue inches in blade, with a good girdle and stronge. This souldier thus furnished, being apt &amp; willing, and dooth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand<note place="margin">A Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzer neede not being perfect to incounter a man at armes.</note> what him selfe is in force: needeth not to care who he dooth encounter withall béeing but one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were a man at armes: and in groundes of aduantage to be the death of many, the which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of groundes, is the greatest helpe to all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendantes, the which I take to be our partes at this day in England, to thinke vpon.</p>
               <p>For these Harquebuziers, is the onely weapon, that hath beene the greatest cause of the deathes of suche numbers, as haue béene of late dayes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, in great incounters, yea and in small skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, &amp; by the terrible shot of Pistoliers or Reis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and specially at <hi>Saint-quintins:</hi> and at <hi>Graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> the English ships, were a great cause of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe.</p>
               <p>But reade the booke of the Commentarie of the sciuile warres of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and the incounters in the Lowe countries: and at the same time, that the Frenche Kinge <hi>Henrie</hi> the seconde incounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> at <hi>Rentie,</hi> what was the shot of Harquebuzers there? the very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before the sunne was one hower highe, there<note place="margin">400.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1172:16"/>
which was done there that same daye: And it was well knowne that of the Spanish partie, there was slaine in the same skirmishe, almost double the number. And after the obtaining of the same bushes or shrubs, by the french, the Emperor came forward towards the Kings armie, being a Fawcon shot the one off the other: at which time the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> hauing the leading of the Uant-garde, did descende towardes the saide bushes possessed by the Frenche footemen: and the encounter began with such terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shot of the Spanish Uant-garde and the French<note place="margin">The shot of Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers are most dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weapons if they be in the handes of skilfull men.</note> footemen, that who so euer did see the same; may wel say, that the shot of the Harquebuziers, are moste deadly weapons, being in the hands of skilfull men: For what with the terrour of the French shot, and the braue charge of the French light horse-men, the Uantgarde of the Emperor was there ouerthrown, and chéefely by the terror of the French shot, laid in the bushes as afore is said.</p>
               <p>Againe before <hi>Cambraye,</hi> the armies aforesaide being néere together, where the King had staid foure dayes according to his promise for the Emperour: It fell out the laste daye, the Kinge remooued his Campe, at which instant there approched néere vnto the French Campe 2000. horsemen of the best in the Emperors armie, accompanied or backed with two thousand Harquebuziers one foote: the French being <hi>5000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> men at armes, &amp; archers, within Pystol shot of their enemies for the space of foure houres, still beholding one another, who durst first breake: for if the Frenche, beeing the greater number, had charged the Sapniards, then would the two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand shot, haue galled and destroyed the most parte of them, to their great detriment and losse: wherfore it may be thought that the French would not haue


<pb facs="tcp:1172:17"/>
ouer shot themselues so farre, as to haue omitted such a daies worke: but only for the doubt that they had, of the same Harquebuzers so couched in a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe way, behind the horsemen, as aforesayd.</p>
               <p>Againe at the siege of <hi>Bouaigne,</hi> where the French King being in person, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Emperor at <hi>Namure,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eight miles, the Kings pleasure was to haue fiue hundred horse, to goe as neere to the Emperours Campe as they could, to discouer the enemies: but it fell so foorth, that there were 2000. horsemen ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abrode, at the same time: and méeting the one with the other, they both pawsed to charge: for the most part of the way lay, betwixt the riuer of <hi>Moose</hi> and a great banke: so that the French supposed, that the whole Campe of the Emperour had beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they retired a soft trote: their enemies pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made after with more speed, and the French hauing but onely forty shot, horsemen, they caused them to light and to defend the straighte at the best aduantage: &amp; by meanes of those forty shot, the <hi>500</hi> horse were saued, and came to their Campe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out losse. Also the very first daye, that <hi>Bouaigne</hi> was besieged, the French shotte so freshlye followed the Spaniardes, that were sallyed foorth for the maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their skirmishe: that in conclusion, they<note place="margin">A batterie plased with out trenche or gabyon.</note> came close to the walles of the towne, and there stayed: and so without either trench, basket, or gabyons, continued there, from eight of the clock in the morning, vnto fower in the after-noone: in which time, there was not any, either souldier or towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that durst looke ouer the walles: in so much, that the Cannoniers and Pyoners, did place theyr ordinaunce, without anye more defences for theyr safety, then afore is saide: so that before fiue of the clocke, the frenche foote-men entered, and

               <head>The fifth discourse.</head>
               <p>ANd touching the rest of our fierye weapons, I will set downe partlie my opinion, and when I doo speake of Harquebuzies, it is meant by all Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers &amp; Curriers: &amp; although the musket be a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of greater force then the Harquebuze is of, yet generally both on horseback and on foote, a Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze dooth serue for both. But were the musket to be dealt withall on horsebacke, as one foote: I woulde then thinke it the best of all manuall weapons, that yet haue beene deuised and inuented: and not onely in defendinge of holdes and trenches, but also in the plaine feelde for Battels and great incounters: yea and to backe the smaller shot in skirmishe, to<note place="margin">Peeces of more force to defende holdes then Muskets.</note> great purpose. For within holdes or trenches, there may be vsed, as the maner is, péeces of better force, and more to offend the enemies then muskets: as


<pb facs="tcp:1172:18"/>
Fauconits, Robinets, and Organpipes, all these bée but light peeces, &amp; are mounted vpon carriages, and the greatest may bee remooued with two or thrée men (which is the Fauconit) al along the rampiers: and euer new and new, small lowpes made, that the enemies shall not discerne the same, before the shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, which may not be done, but vpon good occasion: and also there be other peeces, to be set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Blockes, and to be remooued in like manner: as Bases of diuers sorts, and Harquebuze with crooks, otherwise called Hagbuts a crooke, the name come of the hooke of the same, which is to be holden fast to a stocke or stone, for recoyling.</p>
               <p>But to the musket againe: The musketes are<note place="margin">No armors can defend against the Musket be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere hand.</note> weapons of great force, and at this day, bothe with leaders and followers, much feared: for fewe or no Armours, will or can defend the force thereof, being néerehand, which is as well a terror to the best ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as to the meanest: it will kill the armed of proofe at ten skore yardes, the common armours at twenty score, and the vnarmed at thirty skore, being well vsed in bullet and tried powder.</p>
               <p>And where as it is alledged in S. <hi>Iohn Smithes</hi> booke, of many and sundry imperfections, incidente vnto the same weapons of muskets, and Haquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies, as in dankishnes of powder or matche, the smalnes of their bullets being not equal for the bore of the same peeces, with diuers other impediments, as there is to be seene, who so listes to looke: which<note place="margin">No impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes where as skilful sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are.</note> are no impedimentes, where skilfull souldiers hath the vsing of the same péeces. And for the cause of raynie weather (by him aleadged) if it bee such a great wet, that all things are wet: then is it as bad for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one partie as for the other: Let the seruice rest, or fall to it with hand strokes. An other obiection is


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1172:18"/>
made in the same booke, against all knowledge and experience, and that is touching the taking leuell at their marke or marks, whereat they shoot, as being so far inferior vnto the Long-bow in that respect, as though there were no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison to be made therein. To the which I aunswer, both of my owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and by common experience, for that I my selfe did vse my bowe, vnto my ag of 17. yeeres, and could haue shot therewith right wel, and so from my bow to my Harquebuze, and after that I had vsed the same, but <hi>4.</hi> or <hi>5.</hi> monthes, I would haue shot at any marke, at buts short or long, or banke: with the best bow-man in England, for all that I had, and so shal I as yet doo, for a good wager, or at the leaste some scholler of mine.</p>
               <p>And as it is there termed point and blancke, I neuer heard but that it is tearmed point blancke,<note place="margin">Point bla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke and not point and blancke.</note> but I will not stand vpon tearmes, for either haue I and many moe such plaine fellowes, misued our tearmes in that point, or else I am in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight. But as touching the certaintie of shooting at markes or enemies, let it be with Harquebuze or musket, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered but with the archer himselfe: Whether a Cros-bowe, or a Long-bowe in a Tyller, shoot more certainely, either at marke or pricke, then dooth the Long-bowe that from the hand of the bow-man is deliuered: and then I thinke it will be allowed, that when the Harquebuze or Musket, doo take the leuel from the button of his sight, vnto the pin in the fore ende of his péece, that he may shoote with more and surer leuell, then can either loose Long-bowe, Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler-bowe, or Cros-bowe: and specially the Musket, who hath his rest to stay his péece vpon, right sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:1172:19"/>
that it is not méete, that any Harquebuziers should discharge or shoot, but within 8. 10. or 12. yards at the most. I wonder what manner of souldier that shold bee, that within pointe blancke of his weapon, be it musket or Harquebuze, that should misse the bredth of a trencher: and these are my reasons which consis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in two pointes. First as touchinge a good and skilfull Cannonier, notwithstandinge that his<note place="margin">Touching a good and skilfull Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonere.</note> Cannon dooth recoyle, sixe or eight foote: hee will not faile the compasse of a yarde of his marke, beeinge within pointe blancke: Secondly the fowler, who dooth shoote without a rest many times, and hath his péece charged with small haile shot, if he be perfecte, wil not faile to kil a Mallard, (yea sometimes halfe a dozen if they sit néere together, or right vpon his leuell) within fiftie yardes. Then much lesse will the skilfull Harquebuzier or Muskettier misse the hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a man: And againe, there is not so simple a souldier, that cannot make an estimation how farre his marke is without his leuell, that is without pointe blanck, and so giue his weapon that vantage, as the distaunce doothe require. And so I omitte to answer vnto the rest alleadged, for the slendernes of them: thinking this sufficient, to prooue my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes manifest enough vnto all that dooth knowe the vse of weapons of war: and for such as are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, let them learne of them that dooth truely know them.</p>

               <p>LEt vs consider iustlie of sir <hi>Iohn Smithes</hi> words, although he dooth giue the Long-bowe, manie great and excellent commendations: yet when hée commeth to account of the full force thereof, he sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it dooth most wonderfully with the noyse thereof terrefie the enemy, and so foorth: and also dooth confesse that it dooth but sometime kill. I refer that point to all good souldiers iudgement, there is none worthy to be a soldier, that dooth not thinke to be a Captaine in time, by his valour, knowledge, and good behauiour: And what is he that is of that minde, or that dooth feare any woundes, so that life<note place="margin">Archers are rather an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then hurtful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.</note> may be in little or no daunger? I doo firmely beleeue, that it is rather an encouragement to a resolute sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, rather to approche towards them, then anie way to shunne them: For in troth when I was in the french Kings seruice amongst the olde bandes of footemen, I did greatly commende the force of the Long-bowe, but how was I answered: to be shorte euen thus, <hi>Non non Anglois, vostre cause est bien salle car dieu nous a donnes moyen de vous encountrer apres, vnautre sorte que en temps passe.</hi> No, no, English man saith he, your case is become fowle, for God hath giuen vs meanes to encounter with you after an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1172:22"/>
sorte then in times past, for nowe saith he the weakest of vs are able to giue greater wounds, then the greatest and strongest archer you haue: &amp; when I replyed, as sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> often dooth that the number of arrowes dooth come so thicke, that it was lyke vnto haile: well saith he but it is not to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as that weapon that dooth kill where it lightes: for saith he, when I doo marche directlye vpon them and seeing them comming, I doo stoupe a little with my head, to that ende my Burgonet shall saue my face, and seeing the same arrowes lighting vpon my heade peece or vpon my brest, pouldrons, or vambra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and so séeing the same, to be of no more force nor hurtfull: then doo I with lesse feare then before, boldelye aduaunce forwardes to encounter with them. But these are but arguments of small effect, and rather to showe the opinion of the french soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers then for any iust proofe of the matter, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesit that by our owne knowledge, it be truely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of, for as I haue saide before touchinge the English seruice at <hi>Bolloigne</hi> and <hi>Guisnes,</hi> with all the great Garrisons there of long time kept, which was to our Princes an infinite charge, and specially <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne</hi> with the members and fortifications. And not withstanding there were, as many stronge and able archers, in the same Garrisons, as in all Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendome there were none better, for that number: Let it bee considered, what was by them done, at any time of seruice, within those fiue yéeres that it was English: or at <hi>Guisnes</hi> or <hi>Callice</hi> during the same time.</p>
               <p>And nowe to a latter time, as in the seconde yéere of the Queenes Maiesties most happie raigne that nowe is, at the siedge of <hi>Lieth,</hi> where there was verie manie archers, as of <hi>Yorkeshire, Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>

And I may the more certainlie speake it for this cause.</p>
               <p>It was my chaunce at the conclusion of the peace, and the yeelding vp of the towne of <hi>Lieth,</hi> to méete with diuers of my acquaintaunce beeinge French-men: amongest the rest, I mette with a Gentleman and an olde souldier, who serued in the same company that I was off, amongest the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> whose name was <hi>Mounsieur de Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> whose vallour and honest conditions, I did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie knowe, so much the better, for that we were both vnder one Corporall, and lodged together, and frequented at meate and tablinge long togeather: in so much that in respect of the great curtesie, that I found at his handes in <hi>Fraunce:</hi> I partlie conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of at <hi>Lieth,</hi> &amp; after diuers speeches past betwixt him and me, I demaunded two questions of him.</p>
               <p>The first was to know how many of our souldiers were slaine, at the Skale or Saltie by vs giuen: he answered that there were slaine 448. I demaunded<note place="margin">448. Slaine at Lieth at one assaulte</note> howe he did knowe the same, hee aunswered that the Gouernour of <hi>Lieth</hi> dyd commaunde, that all the vppermost garmentes of the slaine men of the English partie, shoulde bée brought into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place, and there to bée counted, which was done as he affirmed, and there were found sayd he so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as aforesayd.</p>
               <p>Secondly remembring the wordes of the french<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men before rehearsed, at the time of my béeing in <hi>Fraunce</hi> touchinge archers, I demaunded of this <hi>Sentan,</hi> howe manye were slaine with Arrowes,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1172:23"/>
from the beginning of the siedge vnto that daye, he answered not one, sauing said he, that one who was shot betwixt the shoulder and the bodie, and that<note place="margin">Not one slaine at Lecth with archers, but one hurt.</note> with the heat of his body when the arrow was pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led foorth, the head stuck behinde, and came not forth together, wherfore the Surgion was constrained to cut the man to recouer the head of the arrow, and so the man still lay vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> amendement of his wound.<note place="margin">It dooth appeare that feaw or none hath been slaine with arrowes, but great numbers by the fiery shot.</note> Now by this and other before rehearsed, and héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be rehearsed, it dooth and may appéere, that by Harquebuzes great numbers haue come to their deaths, and either fewe or none with arrowes, or archery.</p>
               <p>And now touching the seruice doon at that time that <hi>New-hauen</hi> was kept, the 5. yéere of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, by the Earle of Warwick: let the Cronicle, or those y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> yet doo liue, make account who were there slaine, with the force or dent of arrowes.

               <p>To the first I answer thus, I will not follow sir<note place="margin">Sir I. S. his answere not followed but the true obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> in his answere vnto the same, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the true obseruation, which by all good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is not forgotten to be perfourmed vpon any occasion of seruice. The Harquebuzier dooth firste charge his péece in good order, as to a Souldier it néeds no rehearsall, and to other not knowing how to doo it, it is but folly without exercise: But thus, hauing charged his péece, he goeth towards his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as dooth the Archer with his Bowe bent, and one arrow in his hand: the Harquebuzier hath also for his first shot, all thinges in more readines then any Archer can haue: for wheras the Harquebuzier against the time that his officer shall commaund him to shoote, his match of a yarde in length is fired at both the ends, &amp; ready set in his serpentine: that doon, he hath nothing to doo, but lay his péece close to


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1172:24"/>
his shoulder, and marke his enemy iust. The Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man though he haue his arrowe readye nocked, yet must he drawe the same to the head, the which I<note place="margin">The archer dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more time then dooth the firy weapon to shoot the first shoot.</note> haue seen oftentimes very slenderly perfourmed: and the drawing of that to the head, dooth require more time then the fiery weapon doth, being in the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as is aforesaide.</p>
               <p>But this is the effect of the matter. If it must be as Sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> dooth say, that a Harquebuze may not discharge but within 8. 10. or 12. yardes: I think that if that be allowed, that the Harquebuzier may discharge the first, before the Archer, being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as afore is said. And if it be at horsemen and the horsemen be so néer as within 10. or 12. yards: then is it too late to charge again, or to shoot, for the hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being so néer as aforsaid, wil either enter or els immediatly retire, with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they haue already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for it is a thing most certain, that horsemen in their charge if they be Souldiers, when they are within danger of the shot, will either not charge at all, or else being neer, will with all possible speed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme their charge: for otherwaies, they should<note place="margin">One of the Tresmaines slain in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering in his charging of footmen.</note> be counted but simple Souldiers, for euen so was one of the <hi>Tresmains</hi> (in houering in the charging of footmen) slaine at <hi>Newhauen:</hi> and as for shooting 4. for one, there is no Archer that can shoote 2. for one, if the Harquebuzier be perfect and well trained.</p>
               <p>The Harquebuzier that dooth perfectlye knowe<note place="margin">A perfect Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zere wil dis charge more Bul lets, be the time short or long, then any Bowman can doo arrowes.</note> how to vse himselfe and his weapon: will discharge more Bullets, then any Archer can doo Arrowes: and by this way and meane. If it be a Musket, so much the better for my purpose, and this is to be doone in great incounters, whereas armies cannot marche but easilye, for that the numbers are great, and being a Musket, I would firste deliuer a single

Bullet, at <hi>24.</hi> score off or there abouts, by that time they had marched fourescore neerer, I would deliuer<note place="margin">All this while the Bow dooth stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dooing any hurt.</note> another Bullet, and at <hi>12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> score two, and at eight score three, at forescore <hi>6.</hi> Pistoll Bullets, with lesse pouder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the first by the third part, for alwaies the more lead the lesse pouder, and yet shall the force be neuer the lesse.</p>
               <p>Now consider, that betwixt eight score and the ioyning of the battell, how many arrows can a bow well deliuer? for within that distance, both the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes dooth come on with great speede, or else not at<note place="margin">No man can tel how to fight be fore he see his ground and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> all. But no man can tell how to fight, but as the time, the ground, and the number shall either giue leaue or suffer.</p>
               <p>Now euen as I haue declared for the Musket, so dooth it stand with the Harquebuze, but not to begin so farre off with the Harquebuze, as with the Musket: and take this for most certain, that a Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiere or a good Harquebuzier, will deliuer more bullets, &amp; of greater force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any archer can do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, be it in short time or long time: for as before<note place="margin">A Musket shoots more Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets then a Long bow doth ar rowes.</note> is declared, if the enemy be so neere that the Archer can shoot but one, then maye the Harquebuzier let fall another Bullet into his péece, and shoot two for the archers one. And if th'enemy be far of, then may it be perfourmed as afore is said.</p>
               <p>And touching the second point, that is, whether the Archers with their weapons, or the other Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with their weapons of fire, doo faile least, to shoot, discharge and giue their vollies.</p>
               <p>As touching this second point and question, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thus, that touching the certainty of neere shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or failing to hit th'enemies, the Bow cannot be able to come néer the Harquebuze or the musket, for the firie weapons dooth shoot with a certain Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1172:25"/>
as it were by rule, and the Bowe but by gesse,<note place="margin">The bowe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not come neere the fiery weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in neere shooting for the firy weapon shootes by rule and the bowe but by gesse</note> as I haue sayde before sufficiently touchinge that pointe. And for fayling, as in respect of dankishnes of powder or matche: with a good souldier it is neuer to be founde but that he wyll bée as carefull thereof as of his lyfe, and for the rest that maye happen in fayling, it is nothing to bee compared to the fainte drawing that the archer dooth vse, in not drawinge his arrowe to the heade, when he is néere his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as by many yet liuing, that can witnesse the same, as well as my selfe, and how lewdlie they will at the halfe Arrowe flirte them into the ayre and withall stoope, as though euerye shoote of Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze that went off, were shot at them.</p>
               <p>And where as it is set downe in the same place, that there can nothing hinder the archer, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his Bowe or bow-string, yet I take it that there are diuers other lettes, the which I haue séen dyuers archers complaine of.</p>
               <p>Fyrst, for that he coulde get no warme meate, nor his thrée meales euery daie, as his custome was to haue at home, neyther his body to lye warme at night, whereby his ioyntes were not in temper, so that being sodainely called vpon, as the seruice doth often fal out: he is lyke a man that hath the Palsie, and so benommed, that before he get eyther to the fire, or to a warme bedde, he can drawe no bowe at all.</p>
               <p>And it is further set downe in the saide booke, that neyther Raine, Hayle nor Snowe, can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Archers from shootinge, but I am not of that minde, for that the archer lyinge in Campe, where as hee maye not lye foorth of his appointed place, and hauing not to couer his Bowe nor scant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie


<pb facs="tcp:1172:26"/>

               <p>Nowe to aunswere the thyrd question, which is whether the Bullets of weapons of fyre, or the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of archers, doo annoy the enemie most, which question is friuolous, for by the propounding of the question, and aunswered by the authour him selfe, it dooth carrie a showe in wordes, to be taken as a thinge most certaine, with such especallye, as dooth not vnderstand to the contrarie.</p>
               <p>But with all souldiers, Captaines and skilfull Conductors of the warres, it is euidently and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festlie knowen, that where as there hath béene one slaine with arrowes, there hath béen a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred slaine with manual wepons of fire, since the vse of the same<note place="margin">A 100. for one slaine with fiery weapons.

               <p>And where as Sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> dooth saye him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that the archers doo hurte and wounde, as in the face and places vnarmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet dooth hee confesse, that the same dooth but sometimes kill, whereby it<note place="margin">Bowes doo but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <p>But truelie I neuer did see any archer in the warres, that had any other then such rustie arrowe heades: and besides I did not at any time see, anie of those archers goe about to mende them, and to make them cleane and smooth, that thereby the same might the better enter through the doubletes, or garmentes of theyr enemies: for by common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and dailie proofe, any thinge that is rustie, be it<note place="margin">Rust ye things will not enter in to any mean thing with great force.</note> Bodkin or Dagger, or arrowe heade, it will not with great force enter through any meane thing if it were but a meanely bumbasted doblet.</p>

               <p>But first to conclude with these our archers and of their disabillitie, in respect of the seruice of these dayes: true it is, that before the weapons of fire,

were inuented, and vnknowen, as also vntryed, to be weapons of great force and effect, in all seruice on horse-backe as one foote, as before is declared: and yet but of late dayes that the same haue beene<note place="margin">This natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is brought vp with the long bowe as a parcell of our chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest pastime</note> made publicke in armes, and not as yet throughlie and generallie knowen vnto this our Nation, as vnto some of the greater calling, and to the most of the meaner sorte, as the Long-bowe or archer is, by reason that we are brought vp therewith, euen as a parcell of our chéefe pleasure.<note place="margin">And yet good hope that the firy weapons shalbe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter practised in time, for without practise they are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious but hurtful.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But yet there is good hope, that by reason of suche good prouisions as are made, within this realme, that in some conuenient time the same may be more vsed and practised then it is, and speciallye the Musket, the Harquebuze and the Pistoll: the which without exercise can not bee commodious or profitable in any good sorte to be answerable against the vsurping enemies the Spaniards, who are who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fully practised therewith, and specially with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Musket and Harquebuze: And would it pleased God<note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practised in the fiery weapons.</note> our Prince and Maiestrates, to haue our able men in England, to be vsed and trained in the same wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of fire: it would not onely incourage them, but also be a great delight to theyr Captaines and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the rather to incounter with those wicked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies or any other.</p>
               <p>And also it wold be a terror to al our enemies, that should chance to offer any iniurie to this realme of England or Ireland: for wee may assure our selues that it is our want of skill, that maketh these for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine enemies the more bolde to inuade vpon vs.</p>

And in my opinion these soldiers last spoken of may be armed all after one sort: as a good strong burganet, a coller with a paire of good Cuirasses of the Pistoll proofe, and a paire of well arming Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drands, one Gantlet for the Bridle hand and no Uambraces: &amp; the horse with a good strong saddle, with strong furniture, with two rains to his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle wherof one should be with a prety strong chain of wier, and the head part also of the Bridle, for being not cut in sunder with the blowe of a sword: Then a good sword and a dagger: for weapons, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">3.

               <p>And if that I were well and strongly mounted, and thought that I should at any seruice encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with footmen: I would haue a placket to clap<note place="margin">A Placket.</note> vpon my brest of the like proofe as aforesaid.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>NOw saith he for answere vnto some of these vnsol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierlike opinions, I saie that if any such as do holde that woonderfull opinion of the effects of Muskettiers, how good Souldiers soeuer they thinke themselues, were at any hauen in England with fiue or sixe thousand of the best muskettiers that they euer sawe of our English nation, without an armie of horsemen and footemen of other weapons to backe them, I thinke they would worke verie small effect against the enimies landing, although they had insconced themselues, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will omit to rehearse the whole set downe by sir<hi> Iohn Smith, </hi>but the principall effects as thus,<hi> If they should see an armie of thirtie or fortie thousand men besides sea men, and such as should be left for the garding of the ships, vnder some notable and sufficient Generall, enter into any capable hauen in England, with winde and weather fit for the purpose, with intention to inuade as God forbid: they should finde themselues, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For vpon the discharging of the third Cannon </hi>(saith he)<hi> all the longboates and vessels of oares for the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, do rowe with all furie towards the land,<note place="margin">A woonderful terrible noise of Drums &amp; Trumpers.</note> with a woonderfull terrible noise of trumpets &amp; drums: Now if our such men of warre with their Muskettiers, would giue their vollies of Musket shot vpon these ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boates full of men, with intent to destroy great numbers of them, being so thicke and so many: they shall finde, that discharging their musket shot from the higher grounds downe into the sea, which by the Italians are called Botti di ficco, accounted of all other the most

vncertaine, &amp;c. That insomuch that in despite of this insconcing &amp; musquetiers, the enemies will land and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch their indented Sconce, not with any crosse trench gabyons nor mounts, according to the order of approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and battering of places, in forme fortified: but with other inuentions gardable against musket shot, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture our such men of warre are ignorant of, as also with musket shot, &amp;c. Insomuch that our such men of war (</hi>as he saith<hi>) would not scarcely abide the landing of the first boate ful of soldiers, without abandoning both sconce and shore vnto the enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto I say, that if any such forren eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<note place="margin">The authors answer to the obiection.</note> should pretend to land héere in England, as of late the Spaniards would haue done as it was thought, the which by Gods prouidence, and the indeuour of our valiant Seamen were preuented, and dispersed to their losse and reproch. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am fully perswaded that if the like occasion should be offered, although that they were more in number than is spoken of, with the most sufficient Generall being but a man: that by the same grace and helpe aforesaid, and with the supply of the fiue thousand Muskettiers and Harquebuziers, with 500. Pyoners, and twelue Fawcons and Fawco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,<note place="margin">Pyoners.</note> to assist our Seamen, with such Gentlemen as would accompany the same, there is no doubt but it would suffise to be such a barre against those enemies, that they should not be able to touch our<note place="margin">A meane to barre the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Spaniards.</note> shoares in England, &amp; chiefely if it should so come to passe, as sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> doth alledge, <hi>that the banks were high aboue the Sea,</hi> it were so much the woorse for the enemies to assaile the same fiue to one: as for example, the banks being high as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies must either haue ladders to climb foorth of their tottering boates, or else som of their


<pb facs="tcp:1172:33"/>
owne friends or fellowes, to drawe them vp with pykes, the which I would thinke by all reason, that our muskettiers, harquebuziers and laborers with the blacke bill, should right well serue their turne in that behalfe, to their destruction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse. For whereas the enemies must of necessity stand vpright in their vessels of oares at the full showe, to their great annoiance, and also shall not be able to giue their vollies of shot, with any such certainty as shall our muskettiers, who shall lie close vpon the shoares, with a small trench before them, and shall néede to shew nothing but their heads and weapons aboue the same, which trench may be made in halfe an houre, with the pioners aforesaid.</p>
               <p>And againe, if the hauen be full, that the bankes and water be in maner equall, then may our field péeces with muskettiers cleanse the hauen, at the verie first vollie, being discréetly deliuered, and in due time: that is first the fielde péeces at 12. score yards, and the muskets at eight score, the harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buziers at fower score, and so by these dooings, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry péece both great and small, should haue time to recharge before the enemies coulde touch the shores: and to be readie againe to giue them their welcome to their faces.</p>
               <p>But I do not beléeue, that the enemies would abide the second welcome being thus vsed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all this I doubt nothing lesse, but that her Maiesties armie by sea, wil be as readie to attend vpon them as aforetime they haue done, and with a greater desire to deale with them than at the first they had, by reason of some wants, &amp;c. And so being still beating at the buttocks of the enimies, with the like aduantage as before they did. So


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1172:33"/>
that our Sea-men kéeping them occupied in their reregard, I doubt not but this number aforesaide may with small losse stay their landing.</p>
               <p>Now I feare nothing of this to be performed,<note place="margin">Nothing to be feared in all this but the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of the enimies lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> but for the vncertainty of the place of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended landing: for otherwise I had rather be one of the defendants vpon the land, of the 5000. shot with the assistance aforesaide, than to be one of 50000. to approch the shores: for some must staie to defende their ships against our Nauie, againe some are so Sea-sicke, that they are for a space<note place="margin">Some are sea sicke vnfit to fight.</note> vnfit to fight: and for the vncertaine taking their leuell to shoot either their Base or Musquet, being vpon the swelling water, and our defendants vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firme land, where they may shoote with the best aduantage. There is great difference in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers respects, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And againe, whereas Sir <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> doth further alleadge, besides all which before is allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, saieng, <hi>That if a puisante and mightie Enemie, that in the time of Sommer, intendeth the inuasion of forraine Dominions by Sea, to the intent to giue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and subdue, doth not alwaies bende himselfe to land his armie in a hauen, but sometime vpon an open coast and shoare, if the Sea without hidden rockes and flattes be deepe, and the winde and weather faire, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing commoditie by the deepe of the sea to approch his Nauie, and to cast anker in open rode neere vnto a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious shore, to land and march vpon, &amp;c. The which armie</hi> saith he, <hi>cannot be repulsed neither with inscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of sconces, nor yet with any well ordered fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely with a great and extraordinary wisedome, and with the valiant hands of a puisant armie and a campe formed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereunto I saie as before, if the certaintie


<pb facs="tcp:1172:34"/>
of their landing might be knowne, it were no matter: for in my opinion they should be as well letted vpon the open coast as in the hauen. And let it fall out that the same shoulde be at a dead lowe water, and a mile distant from the shore, I would wish then that the defendants shoulde bée aduertised where the most méetest place for their vessels were, for the landing of their men, and so soone as the first boats should direct their course towards the land, I would put foorth of my num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber two hundred shotte close to the lowe water marke, and there attende the approch as néere to offende them as could be, all as loose shot abroad vpon the sands, who with a little retiring in good<note place="margin">200. Shot put forth to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish whiles the laborers do make the trench for the rest.</note> order should kéepe the enemies occupied, vntill such time as from the same 200. shot I would in one halfe hower, cast a trench in the Sands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the lande, into which the rest of the shot should descende to backe the two hundred first, and with some of the labourers aforesaid, drawe downe the said féelde-péeces, as by this figure may be séene.</p>

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1172:35"/>
Thus before the enemies could land two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand<note place="margin">Al this would be don before that the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could land 2000. men.</note> men, I would not doubt but all this would be performed, so that if I thought good to breake foorth, before the Boates should returne for moe men: I would do so, if not, I would plie the skirmish with some moe fresh shot, and lie close with the whole regiment, if the enemies were not aboue fower thousand, vnto that they were 6000. or 8000. and then would I take the vantage of<note place="margin">Time to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the field peeces.</note> the winde from before the féelde péeces, so that so soone as the defendants were so néere, that their vollie of shot were deliuered: euen foorthwith would I discharge the féeld péeces right vpon the enemies, and thereupon would I run vpon them with Halberds and Swords, and dispatch those against the rest should come, or at the least put them to swimming. And thus vsing the matter, it should mooue our Sea-men to buckle the better with them, vpon their great Bulworks the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liasses, the which may not start from their course, and this being performed in this sort, I woulde not let if the enemies shoulde lande at the first<note place="margin">If the enimies should land ten thousand, this would serue.</note> ten thousand of their best men, (the which I thinke is as manie as can well lande at one vault, for as I saide before they will haue some impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by sickenesse or other waies:) There is no doubt but these aforesaid defendants cannot bée without the companie of some Gentelmen well mounted, who woulde not forbeare to put fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde themselues and the rest, séeing so great<note place="margin">A cart lode of bils for the laborers.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1172:37"/>
is whereas he saith in the 38. page of his booke in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the captaine or captains,</hi> saith he, <hi>that charge either with troupe or troupes, do not care whether the soldiers do breake their lances or not, but to enter reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and keepe togither, and that halfe of them should carrie their swoords and Pistols in their bridle hands, and rather than faile to quit their launces, and vse their swords and Pistols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am fully perswaded, that there is no furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in acquiting of any weapon, but as I haue declared in my 11. discourse fol. 22. of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, but that euery weapon may be in as great readines in their accustomed places, as in both their hands at once being of conuenient length, for long swords are not to be vsed with horsemen and footemen.</p>
               <p>But as touching the good orders of incamping, marching, or battering, with most excellent iustice both in Towne and Féeld: the Spaniards were neuer comparable vnto the French, at such time as the wars was continued betwixt <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the second French king, the which did continue from Anno 1551. vnto the first yéere<note place="margin">There were greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in the wars between the Emperor Charles the 5. and Henrie the 2.

                  <pb facs="tcp:1172:38"/>

                     <hi>That the Alfere of the said</hi> Iulian Romero, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And now to shewe the like offence committed<note place="margin">A good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> and yet in my opinion not so hainons as that was, it fell out that at the time that <hi>Callis</hi> was yéelded to the Duke of <hi>Guize:</hi> one of the chéefe captaines would haue taken awaie a merchants Daughter of the Towne, but the Maiden being vnwilling, he sought meanes to force her: wherevpon, the Mayden did crie with a lowde voice, insomuch that one of her friends tolde the Duke of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vpon which aduertisement, the duke straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies caused the said Captaine to bée hanged for th'example of others.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1172:38"/>
done, touching manie other matters: and againe, there is vsed as Sir <hi>Roger Williams</hi> doth set downe in his discourse, in the 16. page, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Secretary of greater trust then either Duke or Prince, who hath diuers Blankes signed with the Kings hand, it would make some Gouernors thinke much, hauing his large commission from the King, to be ouer awed with a Secretarie, &amp;c. These two points are differing from my erperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or else nothing that I finde set downe by Sir <hi>Roger Williams</hi> but as before is set down, though it bée supposed by Sir <hi>Roger</hi> otherwaies: for whereas he speaketh of some Fortifications, and to prooue a wette ditch stronger then a drie: it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péereth also in the 49. page, that the counter scarffe of a holde, should bée made of Lyme and Stone, which I do thinke not to be the best course to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie: for all men that haue séene the experience of the Cannon, will neuer fortifie with stone where the Cannon may batter. And againe, he wisheth mynes to be made in the same, for thus he saith: <hi>It were not amisse although it hath beene neuer seene before</hi> (saith he) <hi>to haue mynes like vauts ouerthwart to the midst of the counterscarffe, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a common thing in the frontyre Townes<note place="margin">These things are common in the front townes in France.</note> in Fraunce, both in their Rampiers and counter scarffes to haue the like, the which are casemats, and not the Flankers, for as there be Flankers, so be there Casemats: and a Flanker is not a Casemat, nor a Casemat is not a Flanker, for a Casemat may be made of timber, as of Plankes: this I speake of experience for that I haue béene, and did serue in the most part of the Frontier Townes betwixt <hi>Callis</hi> and the Duchie of <hi>Lorain.</hi> And did sée diuers of the same amended, in fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng

against the force of the Cannon and mynes. And also after the conclusion of peace, betwixt King <hi>Phillip</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the second of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> I by extraordinarie cause was prisoner in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and being newly deliuered foorth of prison, and my horses and armour lost, of necessitie I went with one Captaine <hi>Sturton,</hi> Captaine of fiftie myners to rase Townes fortified, the which by composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peace was to bée rased and laide open, wherein I did sée the secrets of diuers thinges,<note place="margin">Strange mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not to be written but first to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> which I had, nor coulde neuer haue knowen, but for the same rasing, the which were verie straunge, whereof I will omit to write for two causes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding that <hi>Nicholas Machiauel</hi> haue set foorth his whole knowledge, as touching fortification, and other sundry policies, the which if he had béen a soldier he would neuer haue done. As in his booke called the Art of war is to be séene.</p>
               <p>It is a sport to heare how he doth by himselfe, fight a battell in words, and saith, that if he had béen a soldier in his youth, he would either haue woon the field with valor, or at the least haue lost it without shame. Who did let him to become a soldier in his youth?</p>
               <p>And thus by alteration of times and the sundrie opinions of men, diuers matters do come in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and especially with such as do least vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the iust triall of the thing it selfe, whereof<note place="margin">Reasoning without knowledge.</note> they do reason: for as I haue heard at manie and sundrie times, that such Gentlemen and soldiers, the which haue gotten their knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of seruice in the Low Countries and other places where ciuill wars haue béen, do hold that opinion that the like discipline hath not béen séene


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1172:39"/>
neither in this age, no nor at any time before, and thereupon do séeme to disgrace some of good cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and more ancient than themselues and of greater experience in seruice, than any that hath béene: but in these Low Countries seruice, or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill<note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge gotten in the wars betweene kings and emperors are more worthie than ciuill wars, and more to be learned.</note> wars in <hi>France,</hi> can or may haue as before is said by reason of greater armies, of Princes whose subiects were both rich and loyall, vpon both the parties, as by many other examples I could prooue but for breuities sake. And for any newe matters or inuentions there is not any woorthy of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance but the musquets onely, the which euerie good harquebuzier may vse as well as his harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze, presently. And therefore the thirde time, I wish that contentions and comparisons to anie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ende, may be left, and that loue and vnitie may be embraced. And with laudable and sounde arguments, matters may be decided to the best effect, that by age or youth can be deuised. And so I cease touching the discourse of Sir <hi>Roger Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> knight.</p>
               <p>And now hauing set downe my opinion as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Armours and weapons, and partly the vse thereof, so far as I thinke is requisite, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the perfect knowledge thereof cannot be had but by exercising the same. And for the better proofe of my said opinions, I haue made rehearsall of diuers parcels of seruice, the which haue come to my memorie at this time, and yet for that I would not séeme tedious, I haue left diuers things vntouched both of my owne knowledge and of others, the which I do know to be true and to good effect. Neither haue I taken occasion héerein to shew wholy that I could in action performe, if op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie serued: neither do I euer intend to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish


<pb facs="tcp:1172:40"/>
the same but by action.</p>
               <p>And whereas some may peraduenture imagin that I haue written rather to set foorth my owne vaine glorie, than for any other iust cause héerein contained: for answere whereof I do héerein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, that the onely cause which mooued mée to write, is as before in the proheme of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise I haue declared, to giue my opinion as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the force and effect, difference and disabilitie of weapons, as well the one as other, and the vse thereof, whereof I could not shew my full intent, except I should make rehearsall partly of such matters as I haue in times of seruice had the experience of.</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding that I haue not set down things done in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Burgondie</hi> as they were performed one after another, wherein I haue ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regarded the effect of the matter, than obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the time: yet can it not be denied, but all the same is most true.</p>

good, the like I did neuer sée nor heare of before. And although a man may liue in warres thréescore yéeres, and not sée any such thing come to passe, yet the deuice is verie good, neuerthelesse my opinion is that in two points he hath not set downe the best course. The one is in the setting of his two<note place="margin">Le Novv doth mistake two points in his discourse.</note> Battelyons, and the other is in holding the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pykes: but it is better and easier to amende then to make.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the forme of his said Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyons, I am of that minde, that there is yet a better way, to forme the said Battelyons with the same numbers by him set downe, and for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I haue héere set downe the manner of his: and how I would do the same, as by these figures may be séene.</p>
               <p>The first is his, the second is mine, and let it be considered, which of our flanks shall be more noisome vnto these Launcers, when that they shall charge the footemen, considering vpon which side of the Horse the Launce doth giue his blowe, and withall remember the placing of his shot vnder the armed pykes and within them also, now to <hi>Mounsier de la Novv,</hi> his batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyons.</p>

               <head>The 18. Discourse.</head>
               <p>ANd now to the second point, as concerning the Souldiers in holding their Pykes, the Lord <hi>de la Novve</hi> doth with that Souldiers should set their Pykes in the ground, and to holde the same about the middle thereof, to receiue the brunt of the charge of Launcers: whereunto I answere, that it is verie dangerous for the armed Pykes to giue the horseman that aduantage, for as the hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans intent is to strike the footeman vpon the brest or faces, so is it for the footeman to direct his Pyke point, right vpon the brest of the horse: now if the Launce be longer before the brest of the horse then halfe the footmans Pyke, then doth the Pyke no seruice at all: for so soone as the Launce doth hit the footeman vpon the brest or face, and the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Pyke not entred into the horse, it must of necessitie come to passe, that the Souldier giuing backe, with the violence of the blow of the launce, must either let fall his Pyke, or other waies bée constrained to pull it vp: so that the point of his Pyke shall be aboue the horse, and thereby worke no effect, but become vnprofitable: I would wish that such armed Pykes should be taught to holde their pykes rather two parts of thrée before their hands, &amp; to set them in the ground vnder his right foot, and to hold them low right against the brest of the horse, and not against the head of the horse, nor the brest of the man, for the horse hauing a chieffront, and also the man well armed, the pyke can do no harme at all.</p>
               <p>Some may alledge and saie, that if the horse be armed vpon the front, he is also armed vpon the


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1172:42"/>
brest, but I saie that there is ten to one armed more vpon the head, then vpon the petron, and if it be that the horse were armed vpon the brest, it is nothing so strong as the chieffront is by halfe.</p>
               <p>And notwithstanding that I haue spoken of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers incounters and ouerthrowes, giuen betwéen the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and <hi>Henrie</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond French King: yet haue I left vnremembred the most braue battaile offered by the French King vnto the Emperour néere vnto <hi>Valentian,</hi> where the saide King did cause all his footemen to bée deuided into thrée battailes, and so being aranged and reduced into the form of battails, the Uauntgarde being led by the Duke of <hi>Vandosme</hi> accompanied with the Counte of <hi>Ringraue</hi> with his Almaines for the bodie of his battaile.</p>
               <p>The King himselfe in the maine, being all French, the Fronte whereof was a hundreth and fiftie, ninetie in flanke besides shot, the forme and manner whereof was in other sort, then in <hi>Machiauell</hi> or <hi>Stuard,</hi> or any other Printed bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes as yet hath béene set foorth and published.</p>
               <p>Then was there in the Rearegard ten thousand Swisers, conducted by the constable <hi>Memorance:</hi> the footmen were in number 35000. in horsemen 12000. in pyoners 6000. with 30. péeces of great Ordinance: al which numbers being most perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbattailed in a plaine field of thrée miles at the least in the narrowest place without either hedge or ditch, woode or bushes.</p>
               <p>And being thus placed with the caualrie vpon their left hand, and vpon the right hand a strait or gill, and betwéene both the armies a faire plaine grounde: and thus being placed in the face of the enemies, the Canons enterchangeably did go and


<pb facs="tcp:1172:43"/>
come through both the armies, and yet no great matters performed, by reason that the Emperors campe was intrenched with huge and high tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>And the King séeing that the Emperour would not come foorth of his inclosed campe, caused his numbers to turne their faces, and to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his campe againe, after diuers skirmishes doone by the light Horsemen, and after that the Kings battailes had marched a myle homewards, the Harquebuziers discharged their péeces, one battaile after another, in such sort, that with the gallant soundes of the Trumpets and Drums being such, and the voice of the armie calling <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailie, Battailie,</hi> that if I should héere make report what I heard and did sée, it would not with the most séeme credible, therefore I will omit.</p>
               <p>Some will imagine that the plot that I haue herein made, wherein there is placed the figure of twelue féelde péeces, that it is some skonce or forte, but my meaning is, that the same might bée as a trench cast with pioners for the safetie of the fiue thousand shot, the better to defend them from the danger of the enemies artillerie, the which might otherwise annoy them from their great ships: and also to be néere their enemies if any should lande, as I trust neuer any shall do to offend vs.</p>
               <p>I haue good will to set downe the manner of the kings battaile aboue spoken of in forme as it was, the which I wil omit for this time for some cause: it was the onely and most braue thing that euer I did sée, although at diuers times I haue séene as many togither and more, and whosoeuer did not sée the same, I dare auouch, that in this age with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Europe, the like hath not béen séene of any.</p>
