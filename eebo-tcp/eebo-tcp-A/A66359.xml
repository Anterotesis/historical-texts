            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And though Mr. <hi>Bullocke</hi> be pleased to under-rate at it halfe the crowne the bushell, which in the Canaries <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which though it may appeare a matter of admiration, yet I shall easily make it apparant by the following Narration, in which such is the exactnesse of the Ayre in this Country, that you may have five successive Harvests of the same grain in different seasons. For though a man and a boy with much ease may plow an Acre every day, the ground being pliable of a rich blacke and tender mold, and no frosts or snowes, no usuall droughts or raines to hinder the going of the plow, yet I shall allow a month for the plowing of twelve Acres, and thus plowing in September, October, November, December, and January, you may have your severall Harvests in June, July, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, and September, which may easily bee inned by the same hands the labour not falling in a glut upon them, but the Corne ripening according to its severall seasons.</p>
            <p>And thus by two mens labours onely you have a gratefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of at the least three hundred and sixty Quarters of Wheat, which will at that under rate formerly mentioned, <hi>viz</hi> 2s. 6d. yeeld so many pounds sterling: Nor is there such difficulty in the threshing, as may be at first sigh't suspected, since it may easily be tread out with Oxen, as it is usuall in Italy and other Countries.</p>
            <p>The first Wheat being reaped, if you desire a croppe of Barley, the same Land plowed in <hi>Iuly,</hi> will returne its ripe increase in <hi>September,</hi> so that from one and the same piece of ground you may have the benefit of two different Harvests.</p>
            <p>But the Rice (for production of which this Countrey is no lesse proper then those Lands which have the greatest reputation of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility) sowed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For there are an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense quantity of Indian fields cleared already to our hand by the Natives, which till wee grow over populous may every way be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly sufficient, but that the very clearing of ground carries an extraordinary benefit with it, I wil make apparent by these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reasons.</p>

            <p>Nor are Pipestaves and Clapboard a despicable commodity, of which one man may with ease make fifteene thousand yearely, which in the countrey it selfe are sold for 4l. in the <hi>Canaries</hi> for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62483:11"/>
twenty pound the thousand, and by this meanes the labour of one man will yeeld him 60l. <hi>per annum,</hi> at the lowest Market. If all this be not sufficient to remove the incumbrance of Woods, the Saw mill may be taken into consideration, which is in every respect highly beneficiall by this Timber for building houses, and shipping may be more speedily prepared, and in greater quantity by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of two or three men, then by a hundred hands after the usuall manner of sawing.</p>
            <p>The Plankes of Walnut-trees for Tables or Cubbords, Cedar and Cypresse, for Chests, Cabinets, and the adorning magnificent buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, thus prepared will be easily transported into England, and sold at a very considerable value.</p>
            <p>But that in which there will be an extraordinary use of our Woods is the Iron mills, which if once erected will be an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying Staple, and of this forty servants will by their labour raise to the Adventurer foure thousand pound yearely: Which may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be apprehended if wee consider the deerenesse of Wood in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, where notwithstanding this great clog of difficulty, the Master of the Mill gaines so much yearely, that he cannot but reckon himselfe a provident Saver.</p>
            <p>Neither does <hi>Virginia</hi> yeeld to any other Province whatsoever in excellency and plenty of this Oare: And I cannot promise to my selfe any other then extraordinary successe and gaine, if this noble and usefull Staple be but vigourously followed.</p>
            <p>And indeed it had long ere this growne to a full perfection, if the treachery of the Indians had not crushed it in the beginning, and the backwardnesse of the <hi>Virginia</hi> Merchants to reerect it, hindred that Countrey from the benefit arising from that universall Staple.</p>

            <p>Nor is it a contemptible profit that may be made of Woods, if by boaring holes in divers trees, of whose vertues wee are yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and collecting the juce thereof, a scrutiny be made which are fit for Medicinall Liquor and Balsomes; which for Gummes, Perfumes, and Dyes, and heere I may justly take occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of our owne sloth and indulgence, if compared to the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

            <p>For the advance of which noble Staple, I should propose that the Greeke, and other Rich Vines, being procured from the Countries to which they are geniall, every Planter in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey might be enjoyned to keepe a constant Nursery, to the end when the ground is cleared, that they may be fit for removal, and the Vineyard speedily planted.</p>
            <p>Further that some Greeke, and other Vignerous might be hired out of those Countries to instruct us in the labour, and lest their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, pride, or jealousie of being layd aside when their mysterie is discovered, may make them too reserved in communicating their knowledge, they may be assured, besides the continuance of their Pension of a share in the profits of every mans Vintage, which will the more easily perswade them to be liberall and faithfull in their instructions, since the publick advance of this designe cannot mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry without a sensible losse to their particular interest.</p>
            <p>That before their going over a generall consultation may be had whith them what ground is proper, what season fit, what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of casualties by bleeding or splitting, what way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve or restore Wine when vesseld, which <hi>species</hi> of Wine is fittest

            <p>These consultations drawne to a head by some able person, and published to be sent over in severall Copies to Virginia, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of which people might arrive at such competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Mystery, that the reservation or jealousies of those Vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerons, could not but be presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But from hence no occasion should bee derived to breake or fall short of any contract made with those Vignerons, who are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xactly dealt with in performance of Articles, every way made good unto them, with all just respects to win upon them, and the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance of this hath beene the originall cause why Virginia at this day doeth not abound with that excellent commodity.

            <p>Were this brought to a just perfection no other Nation could u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a quarrell betwixt Us, and Spaine, and France, reape a benefit by selling us their Wine at a third Market. And what wee vend now for it (that being made Native to us) might be returned in Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, to the apparent enriching of the Common-wealth, and the impoverishing of our Enemies, or at the least Friends deservedly suspected.</p>

               <p>There must be likewise a providentiall regard in a moist season, that the Mulberry leaves be carefully dryed after their gathering, before they be administred for food to the Silke-worme: But if the season pertake more of drought it will be wisedome to let the leaves lye and shade a little after their gathering, that they may have them coole and refreshing, and in seasons of temperature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued droughts, it may be very requisite to water the Roots of the Mulberry-tree, which will be a refreshing to the leaves, and this is usually practised in Spaine; especially if the Mulberry-tree be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a hot or dry ground, which otherwise must not be so prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed without particular caution.</p>
               <p>Nor is it below our consideration to weigh the condition of the place in which the Mulberry is planted, if in a sower foule or wet soile to collect what inconvenience that food may bring unto your worme, and therefore if your necessity will admit it to avoyd such wholly, if not to use them with such qualifications as may make them l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Besides what wee have sayd of Silke wee shall find the Indian profitable to himselfe, and as in the Staple of Wines, of which when he has received <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that which turnes to our advantage is, that the Indian communicating the knowledge of the Grape to his Neighbours, and they transmitting it all along as far as New Spain, will stir up the Spanish jealousie to interdict all Viti-culture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and as far as the extent of his power can fathome to prosecute severely all such Natives as shall make it a subject of their industry to the prejudice of Spaine. This must of necessity make strong combinations and leagues against the Spanish Tyranny, which though they are not of themselves able to shake off, yet will the Spanyard feare to extend himselfe further (except in such strength as at present his condition denies him) knowing the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans untinguishable thirst of Revenge, and his laying hold of all opportunities to put it in execution, with all the powers of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding cruelty and malice.</p>
               <p>And thus shall the Spanyard in case he attempts our supplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be constantly discovered by the siding Indian, and if there be a necessity to prevent his malice, by turning his designe upon his owne head, infinite occasion of intelligence may wee have from the enraged Native, how to attaque him in his strongest security, where either the distance or impassability of the way will make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident and carelesse.</p>
               <p>Further use may be made of the Native in fishing after Pearle, to which if wee allure him by a constant Trade with him for them, his owne profit will quickly enlighten his desire of more, and that desire quicken his industry.</p>
               <p>That Virginia affordes multitude of Pearles, Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to give publick information, where he tells us a Relation deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him of a Weroance, who had so great quantity of Pearle, and did so ordinarily take the same, as that not onely his owne skinnes that he weareth, and the better sort of his Gentlemen and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62483:26"/>
Followers are set with the sayd Pearle; but also his beds and hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are garnished with them, and that he hath such quantity of them that it is wonder to see: These are Mr. <hi>Lanes</hi> words exactly.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any difficulty in the discovery of this, or ingrossing the Trade; especially since wee are the Masters of the Countrey, and if any other Nation should attempt to partake in the benefit of our Trade, the strength of Virginia is at present such as may repell by violence, all Forraigne incroachments upon their trade and livelyhood.</p>
               <p>The Indians unanimously consent that twenty two mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beyond which, over a ledge of Hills, by a concurrent Relation of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, is the Sea, which can be no other but that Sea which washes the shore of China, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That this report of a great Sea Southwest beyond the Mountains, cannot have the least of fiction or confederacy, since all the Indians from Canada to Florida, doe unjarringly agree in the Relation, is obvious to the meanest apprehension.</p>
               <p>The discovery whereof, if we fall upon it by degrees, will bee a worke of no long time or difficulty, but the unexpressible profit and glory of the action, will rayse the noble head of this above example Countrey to such a high Zenith of wealth, power, and lustre, that it will be reputed a very remarkable degree of felicity to any Nation which shall reach to such a Verticall point of glory, as to bee repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but our second in these most noble considerations.</p>

               <p>First, the inconveniency or non feysibility of carrying so much provision as will serve the Discoverers, whose number, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, cannot bee lower then two hundred, if wee let slide into our deliberation the many unknowne Nations, through whose territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we are to make our passage, and which by common esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, are much more numerous in the Inland, then Marine Countreyes.</p>
               <p>Next admit wee undertake and compasse it with such a number, yet the discovery not being capable of secresie amongst such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of undertakers, the publick resentment of such a felicity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, not suffering people to be silent; wee should have this arrive to the Spanyards knowledge, who will roule all stones under

Heaven to dispossesse or prepossesse, and indeed the danger his Peru, Chili and Philippines, by such seating, may lie obnoxious to, will adde spurres to his inclination to prevent us, which till wee bee in in a condition to resist, may be effected with our absolute ruine.</p>
               <p>The safest way therefore is, by degrees to steale upon the design, and take our way thither, by ceasing of places of advantage, very frequently found in that Contry, which we may progressionaly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie at every twenty or five and twenty miles distance, and to these places we may constantly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
