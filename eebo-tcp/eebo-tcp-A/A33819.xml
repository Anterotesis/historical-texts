            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>HOw great and ſerious a joy doth ariſe to us from Your Excellencies Condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though we cannot otherwiſe make it appear; yet hence chiefly it may be ſhewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this moſt pleaſing Duty of expreſſing our Thankfulneſs, we have been ſomewhat tardy, and are yet ſolicitous; for ſuch is the nature of a good turne that it calls for a requital; but your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies Fortune and Greatneſs doth neither require nor brook it, whence it comes to paſs that we who are otherwiſe Bountiful, and are wont to return as much as we have received, becauſe we may ſeem to render perſons in other things moſt approved by our teſtemony, ſuch as it is, more allowable; at length being endowed with your moſt excellent Gift, we do freely acknowledge our deficiency. In the mean time we may juſtly pride our ſelves in this, that your Excellency, as well as our Learning, is ſo much the cauſe of our Happineſs, that none can commend your Gifts, or expreſs their worth, but will himſelf thereby grow more commendable: therefore have we Praiſe and Duty joyned, that we may not avouch how much we owe being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful, nor underſtand what we have received unleſs Learned: Your Excellency doth not only beſtow Gifts worthy your Nobleneſs, but alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by make way that we our ſelves may, in time, be worthy of your ſo great Favors: which is a reaſon of well-deſerving, proper only to your ſelf: neither
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108911:7"/>
indeed doth your Excellency only afford Patronage to Learning (which you only can do) but alſo make Arts more famous; and whatſoever there is any where of Sciences you do happily promote and adorne. Pardon us moſt Illuſtrious Marchioneſs if we often wonder to whom, at length, your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and we our ſelves, do ſo much owe thoſe excellent Arts, and your Excellencies Endowments; how it came to paſs that Eloquence, Poetry, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, things otherwiſe moſt different, ſhould without the help of a Tutor, without the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery of an Univerſity, at length, agree in a Woman: Indeed we who wonder that the Antients ſhould adore the ſame tutelar Godeſs both of Arts and Arms, what ſhall we think of your Excellency, who are both a <hi>Minerva</hi> and an <hi>Athens</hi> to your ſelf, the <hi>Muſes</hi> as well as an <hi>Helicon, Ariſtotle</hi> as well as his <hi>Lycaeum?</hi> Indeed ſuch is our condition that we can ſooner underſtand our own happineſs then expreſs yours, which is ſo far beyond the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of our expreſſions, as this preſent Deſcription, ſuch as it is, is beyond the neceſſity of a Fiction. We think it concerns us very much (who have the happineſs to underſtand ſo much of your Excellency) ſome way to teſtify, according to our genius and that of this place, then which none can admire you more, with what mind, withwhat deſires, with what real affections we do receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace your moſt Excellent Works; which part of our duty we do as ſincerely perform as it doth truly tend to the great honour of this floriſhing So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citey, that we enjoy your Excellencies undeſerved favour, whom all Learning doth commend, and all degrees of the Learned adore and honor. So much
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108911:8"/>
beyond Expectation it was (moſt Excellent Lady) that you the firſt of all, by your own example, ſhould make it appear that even Women may be Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. One thing we wiſh for, the enlargement of the fame of your Excellent name, and more ſignal vertues, that your moſt learned Works may appear in ſuch a language in which we read and admire <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Maro</hi> amongſt the <hi>Romans, Plato</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> amongſt the <hi>Grecians.</hi> Which if it ever come to paſs, we hope and alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe (your Excellency being willing) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our deſires, and the greater increaſe of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in a ſhort time, by the very augmentation of Sciences the World may be ſenſible what Eternity of Glory your Excellency hath obtained.</p>

                  <p>WE lately received, with abundance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Complacency, thoſe two tokens of your favour, with which your Grace hath been pleaſed, to honour us; Your Poems, and Philoſophical Letters, both which we entertain and embrace with that careful reſpect, which is due to thoſe high and noble undertakings, which will procure in all ages (while men have any humanity) condigne fame and renown to their Authors. In your Poems we admire that Life and Spirit, as alſo that Native, and Even Fancie, which, every where, is Conſpicuous. Your Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con is neither Pond nor Sea, but like a fair and deep River gently ſlides, and flow's in upon your Readers. In your Philoſophy there appears, every where, a clear and ſearching acuteneſs of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nothing forced, or Myſterious: All is plain and genuine, meer and natural Nature. We men find Nature and Truth very coy and ſullen, alas how we vex, perſecute, and chaſe her, who yet ſtill outruns us: Some imagine her to be in Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools and Quick-ſands, like another <hi>Scylla</hi> or <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis,</hi> and they find Her ſo now and then, in their ſhipwract Credit and Reputation. Some grope for her in Vacuums and empty ſpaces, with a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs not unlike their ſuppoſals. Some fancy her among Daemons and Spirits, as if ſhe were a Witch: Others torment her in the Fire, or Rack her, and force her rather to Belie, then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs her ſelf. But ſhe willingly ſhews herſelf all bare and naked to your Grace; Madam, you are one, if not the only one of your Sex, that owe Nature
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108911:12"/>
nothing; for whatever luſtre and beauty of body or mind, ſhe hath deckt and enriched you withal, your Grace has largely recompenſed her, and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly quit with her in theſe your elegant Poems, and Philoſophy. In a word, to be no longer troubleſom to your Grace, we would we could but expreſs what thankful acknowledgements we, in mind and thought, do conceive, for this twin-pledge of your Love, full of all Muſes and Graces; then we ſhould fall leſs, though ſtill continually, ſhort of ſo high a favour. May you live long, moſt Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Heroick Lady, to adorn, maintain, and nouriſh Learning, and Learned men, and Us, who are, in all offices of Honour and obſervance.</p>

                  <p>WE have received your Excellencies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable and moſt beneficial books with ſuch grandure and reverence of mind, as it is very fit we ſhould, as a pledge and warant of our future ſecurity; for ſeeing we are to Contend in a bruitiſh world for life, much more for honour, with the reproaches of an illiterate age, as it were now deſparing of attaining to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in our weighty affairs, leſt <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Philoſophy, and Learning ſhould grow infamous, Your Excellency hath only brought it to paſs, that we have hopes yet to live; the memory of our name being perpetuated in your Excellencies Books, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108911:15"/>
will not only ſurvive our Univerſities, but hold date even with Time it ſelf; and doubtleſs we ſhall live, for as much as it pleaſeth you, moſt Excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſo long as either Name or Honour remains, either to Virtue or Books; and incontinently this age, by the reading of your Books, will looſe its barbarity and rudeneſs, being made tame by the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy both of your ſtile and matter: and moreover it will not judge us to be no-bodies whom ſuch an accompliſh'd Princeſs hath not refuſed to make not only the Peruſers, but even the Moderators, and Judges of her Works. So as the very worth of your Excellencies Books, hath brought us, being willing, altogether perſwaded and convinced into a juſt admiration of your Excellency. However your Grace may ſee how much your Praiſes are impaired, not ſo much by the default of our Wit (though that be very great) as becauſe you have the hap to live in ſuch an unfortunate age. Antient <hi>Greece</hi> it ſelf, the ſole Governneſs of all juſt merits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in the cauſe of ſuch unparallel'd vertues, would have ſpent her ſelf in ten years Panegyricks; neither would there be any cauſe why <hi>Iſocrates</hi> ſhould prefer his <hi>Athenians</hi> (though they were <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Scholars) before <hi>Cambridge;</hi> to whom your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency (for ſuch honour doth your Grace procure) doth kindle a new, yet never periſhing, Light: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf would have reſolved all your Praiſes into Statues and Monuments of your name, by which there might ariſe continually <hi>Cornelia</hi>'s, and if there were any other, therefore the Glory of their Age, and the Honour of your Sex, becauſe your Excellency had not then a being, but reſerved by the Author of all things, and born in after times
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108911:15"/>
for the honour, and ornament of this age in which we live. The Titles and Triumphs are long ſince obſolete, and worn out, the honour of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> lives only in a little ſlender fame, and thoſe Marbles inſcribed with the names of ſo many of the Learned, are mouldered into duſt, and yet all theſe live, and flouriſh in their due Praiſes, and are the ſurvivors of all their admirers, and this Glory is only common to your Excellency, with thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Worthies, that as neither the famous Statues, nor the applauſe of their admirers, nor the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vote, but the ſolid Grace of their Works, and Virtue which is its own beſt Herauld, doth declare their merits: So your Excellencies moſt unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld worth, and our thankful acknowlegment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the furniture of tumultuous applauſes, hath ſet apart a place in our Library, that faithful Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Wits, for your Grace, where, according to our ſlender proviſion, which alſo the Cuſtome of our Anceſtors, by whom we are the better enabled, and our own ingenious confeſſion, we do with great earneſtneſs deſire; we henceforth with acclamations that ſuch an Illuſtrious Princeſs (reaſon being now reſtored, Philoſophy confirmed, Envy conquered) doth eſteem that in others which ſhe honours in her own perſon; We will therefore that this, whatſoever it is, be the argument of a Grateful mind.</p>

                  <p>OUr opinion is not in any wiſe altered; of all your Books in general we judge, as in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and equity we muſt of every one of them: and what unſpeakable eſteem we have for every one of them, neither are you ignorant, nor may we (as we did, or hereafter ſhall receive any of them ſeverally) forbear to publiſh to the World. This we think, and this, upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, we profeſs to be a return, that your Graces affection to the Commonwealth of learning (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your Perſonal advancement in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108911:17"/>
of Knowledge) hath, long ago, called for from all ingenious Scholars: This is a debt, which men of ſeveral profeſſions pay you daily, in conſideration of the pleaſure and profit they reap from your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, your Epiſtles, your Comoedies, and your Grounds: but eſpecially we of <hi>Cambridge</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and, with exceeding delight, peruſe (the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Honour that of late hath been done by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to this Community) your moſt judicious and elaborate Obſervations upon Experimental Philoſophy. For although we nothing doubt, but the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> will flouriſh, whileſt there is any regard in the World had to Learning, and Modeſty, yet to the Perpetuity of ſo famous, and antient a Corporation, we cannot but hope for an addition from the Eternity of your Labours. It is not therefore for nothing (moſt learned Princeſs) that far beyond what we can expreſs, we renown and admire your Grace, looking ever and anon upon, and glorying in that immortall ſtately Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric of Contemplation, which you have erected for the Wonder, as well as for Inſtruction of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It's true, our eyes are almoſt dazled, when we preſume to look up to that height of National honour, wherein you ſhine above moſt of your Sex. But (which is yet far more noble and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the luſtre of your Wit hath ſo ſurpaſſed the greatneſs of your Fortune, in glory, that we may now very plauſibly throw away our other Greek, and Latine Authors, and be content to learn only, what you teach in proper and good Engliſh. For, when you retire to Study, you take (as we ſee) nothing at all upon truſt; you ſit down at no Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers Feet, but enquiring into the Myſteries of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108911:17"/>
every Sect, you moſt exactly weigh, diſtinguiſh, and correct whatſoever <hi>Democritus</hi> laughed at, or <hi>Heraclitus</hi> wept, or <hi>Epicurus</hi> raved, or <hi>Pythagoras</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, or <hi>Aristotle</hi> underſtood, or <hi>Arceſilas</hi> was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of. Nor do you neglect, or omit, in caſe the <hi>Lord Verulam,</hi> or <hi>Harvey,</hi> or <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> or <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilaeus</hi> hath pretended to add to the atchievements of the Antients. This indeed, this it is (moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dutcheſs) to ſtudy, to reſolve, to determine, like a Royal and Impartial Profeſſor: But whither on the ſudden have you tranſported us? For that Principality (which is yours) in Learning admits (it ſhould ſeem) of no bounds, but in your happy and pregnant imagination alone. Nature is infinite; and you your ſelf, having nothing further to know in this, firſt diſcover, and then travel into another, World: we mean your Blazing World, which you enlighten with your own luſtre, and deſcribe to us far more accurately, then ever <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Critias</hi> attempted. After this manner in all ſorts of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if your Eminency proceed, <hi>Margaret</hi> will ſhortly paſs, not only for the name of the Dutcheſs of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> but alſo for the Cognizance of Philoſophy. So we dare, as it were, before hand, hope, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe our ſelves, who ſtudy continually to be more and more (if it be poſſible) then we are already.</p>

                  <p>BY the Bounty of ſeveral Benefactors, our Liberary is furniſhed with many large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; yet we have none we ſo highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, and are more proud of, then thoſe written &amp; given us by your Graces own hand. Jewels have their value crowded in a little room. The <hi>Sybills</hi> Leaves as they became fewer advanced their price. Among pieces all ſo perfectly excellent, we dare not otherwiſe offer at a Compariſon, then as the Subject leads and determins us. The Greatneſs and Miracle which hath appeared in the Life of the moſt Incomparable Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> could not but raiſe, in your Grace thoughts anſwerable to ſo glorious a Theame, and give us at the ſame
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108911:20"/>
time, both Wonder and Delight, to read the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of that full-blown Vertue and Glory, which with us appeared firſt in their bud and Bloſſome. The next Glory to that of having done ſuch Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is to have writ them ſo well and exactly. And, had the Sex allowed it, Your Grace had done the ſame Actions, and left Deſpair to any other Pen to have reached, their height. A grateful mind, which we deſire to Expreſs, is the Prologue to our new Requeſt: but our chief Truſt and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is in your own ready and natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all Acts of Bounty and Charity. They that are cunning in the Art of Begging, are ſo well verſed and ſtudied in Faces, that among an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, they know which to let paſs, and where to fix: they read at firſt ſight the Characters and Diſpoſitions of a ready and willing Goodneſs: and will ſometimes pitty them they Beg of, as carrying Faces apt to undo them into as low poverty as they themſelves ſuffer. Though perhaps we have not ſo particular knowledge af thoſe outward Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which might encourage this confident ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; yet the general Fame, beſides our own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will not ſuffer us to be ignorant, of thoſe of your great and generous Soul, which ſtayes not for opportunities offered, but ſeeks them, and to know where it is wanting, is all the argument neceſſary to your noble Bounty. We are ſo unhappily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Building, that we can neither leave off, nor go on without the help and aſſiſtance of others. Yet we could be content to change our deſigne, and wholly leave what we have in hand, to erect a Statue to your Graces Name and Memory. That as one <hi>Margaret</hi> ſtands with us famous to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity 
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108911:21"/>
for her Zeal to promote the growth of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which was then upon its recovery from a long and dark ignorance: ſo now your Grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with fairer advantage, being your ſelf, to the ſhame and reproach of our Sex, the great pattern and example of Learning. We deſpair of raiſing any more laſting Monument to your Name, then what already your Grace hath left with us. But, you will oblige here very many Beads-men and Votaries, who will make it a great part of their ſtudy, that the famous Acts of your Charity and Bounty, may be read not only in Stones, but Men, who ſhall for ever bleſs your Memory, and pray for your Happineſs.

                  <p>THat your Grace Might not want freſh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to oblige us, our Colledge was not hitherto a finiſht Building, and we owe the perfection of our Colledge to the late ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous obligements of your Grace, when you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured us with the Picture of the late Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Mary</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> your moſt noble Aunt, and our ſecond Found'reſs. 'Tis true, we here have lodged hitherto with Conveniences, enough to atteſt the Generoſity of your thrice noble Family, above as well our Expectations as Merits; and beyond what Learning durſt promiſe it ſelf from this Barbarous Age. Our Colledge Walls are as ſtrong, as our Noble Foundreſſes Deſignes were generous: and the Sun looks upon us ſtill, but as he ſhould, through no Crevices or Chinks, nor makes more day than we permit him to our melancholy Retirements. Nor would your Grace's Illuſtrious Aunt be now aſhamed of that fair addition ſhe made our Colledge, if the durable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the work can reflect any honour upon that generous Effort of her Charity. But we wanted the laſt advantage our preſent Buildings could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reive: the Effigies of the Noble Counteſs of <hi>Shrews<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> which would at once, ennoble her Foundation, and our acknowledgements; and remind the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity of Strangers, that this Age hath not been bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Illuſtrious Inſtances of Charity, and of our thankful reſentments of ſo great Encouragements to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108911:22"/>
Learning. Yea, my Lord, your Grace hath now inſtructed us, and may undeceive others: and the Statue of your Illuſtrious Aunt ſhall now encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our Studies, and ſuperintend over our Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency as her own Deputy: and we ſhall be aſhamed to have lived unprofitably, and unanſwerably to ſo noble a Benefaction; or that the Illuſtrious Counteſs of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> ſhould, amidſt the Joys, wherein She is ſurrounded by a bleſſed Immortality, have the diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to have loved Learning in vain, and have built us a Synagogue, and ſo nobly ſeconded the deſignes of the late moſt Serene Mother of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh: 'Tis true we ought to have owned the Honour to have ſet up ere now the Statue of the moſt Noble Counteſs of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> but that which excuſes all Immoralities, that which involved Kings, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, your moſt noble Family, and Learning, in one Common Deſolation, the late Rebellion, hindred us till now: We could only look on with Sorrow, the place deſigned for the Effigies of your Grace's moſt Noble Aunt, and ſigh that the barbarous wickedneſs of the times, which allowed no viſible remembrance of Saints or Kings, ſhould be able to defeat our Deſigne, to perpetuate, in this nature, Her Memory, and our Acknowledgements: But, we dare be bold humbly to conceive, this our late thankfulneſs will be no diſadvantage to her happy Memory, and that the Inſcription of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge upon her Statue, will hold even with the lateſt Date of time: and that it may not be the only miraculous Priviledge of ſome Rivers, after they have enricht their neighbouring Banks, to dive ſuddenly into the Earth, for the ſpace of ſome miles, and riſe again into their former greatneſs,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108911:22"/>
and acquire a newer, and more laſting glory, by being, ſo long, undiſcovered: thus ſhall the moſt Noble Counteſs of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> be not diſadvantaged (as far as our weak pretences can reach) by this our poſt-fact Acknowledgements, but, like Majeſty, by this diſtance of Years, command a greater Veneration. But if we dare pretend ſo much to honour the Memory of the Bleſſed now in Heaven, how ſhall we pay the Living, thoſe that by ſo great Obligations have deſerved all that we can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to of Gratitude and Eſteem, amongſt which, your Grace's Favours to our Colledge hath entitled you the Principal. My Lord, to ſuch we are poor in every thing but Prayers: and that your Grace may long live to be (as you are) the honour of this Age, your moſt Noble Family, and (which we take the boldneſs to be proud in) this Colledge: that, by that Civility, whereby you have made even your misfortunes Illuſtrious, and Crown'd Heads your Admirers, you may long unteach this Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Age that bruitiſh diſaffection to Learning; that you may ſurvive that envy which your Grace's Excellent Accompliſhments as well as our little Learning hath attracted, is the Deſire of</p>

                  <p>ON whom to father the rare, and admirable Method of Horſmanſhip, that ſingular, and uſeful Invention, which hitherto ſo many Nations, and ſo many ſeveral Societies of men, and ſo many Commanders in chief, have earneſtly deſired, though Strangers peradventure may, yet of all men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live We of the Univerſity cannot be to ſeek; becauſe every ſingle line, that <hi>Apelles</hi> draws, ſerves us for a ſufficient Character, and Cognizance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer: But in regard of our unfeigned, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Zeal for the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtles</hi> honour, We did heretofore (if your Highneſs remember) now and then entreat, and beſeech you not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs any longer (than neceſſity required) ſo learned, and uſeful, and compleat a Work. In that humble petition of ours whether we did as became us, or no, we determine not: only (with leave) we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the reaſonableneſs alone of our importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity prevailed at length with, and overcame a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral otherwiſe abſolute, and altogether invincible. Whereupon at this day (by your Princely favour) we ſee and with exceeding delight (as occaſion is) peruſe a ſecond demonſtration of your abilities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed now to publick view, for the benefit of all generous and high-ſpirited men in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo that no man hereafter may dream of any Perſon in any Place whatſoever, more Noble, or (in what part of Learning you pleaſe) more an accompliſhed Maſter, than your moſt Excellent ſelf: for, as if in the former Volume you had only vouchſafed us a taſt to whet our Stomachs, you now ſpread, and furniſh a Royal Table with all ſorts of Delicacies;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108911:27"/>
you now gratify the appetite of your Countrey-men; you now encounter, and anſwer the enquiry of <hi>Cambridge</hi> Philoſophers, in whoſe judgement your laſt adventure ſeems always to be the moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. If they will enter the Liſts, and compare, we challenge not only theſe old Profeſſors, <hi>Bellerophon, Seſostris,</hi> and <hi>Sarmenes,</hi> but alſo the later Authors of greateſt account in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Italy, Pignatel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Labrovius,</hi> and <hi>Griſon.</hi> Let them altogether appear, and either they muſt immediately vaniſh, or elſe ingenuouſly bluſh that they are but once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſame day with matchleſs <hi>Cavendiſh.</hi> And although they may ſeem, at firſt, ſomewhat more than ordinarily concerned, to be thus at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, yet as ſoon as ever they hear the Name of Duke <hi>William,</hi> they bow to your Sovereignty, and falling infinitely ſhort of your Glory, they confeſs you the moſt abſolute and only Maſter, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves your Pupils. But why do we mention theſe ſeveral Dreſſers, when as (if we look abroad) we may daily ſee both Kings and Princes reſorting to your Palace, condeſcending to ſit at your Feet, and intreating you as their Oracle to declare unto them, firſt where and of what Race to chuſe a Horſe for the Mannage, and then how to Feed, and Order, and Mount, and to Work, and Raiſe, and Stay, and Ride in all Voltoes, and Corvetts, Forward, Backward, Side-ways, on both hands, juſt as the Rider directs. For this ſame purpoſe, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only to be Matriculated into the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle's</hi> Academy, the renowned Cavaleers of all Orders attend, whether they be Knights of the <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> or the Knights of of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> or the Knights of the

And this you do, as with all imaginable ſucceſs, ſo likewiſe with ſuch wonderful obligingneſs, and conſtancy, that for a continual inſtigation thereto (we ſee) you need not the leaſt item from us; for that purpoſe the goodneſs of your own Nature, and the nobleneſs of your Spirit is abundantly ſufficient. But whileſt in this manner you regard Learning, and embelliſh Virtue, you give the World to know, that you are neither a Stranger to, nor unacquainted with the direct Road to Honour, and Glory; And thither indeed only you march with ſuch expedition and conduct, that you have already (beyond what an Univerſity can write) enriched our publick Treaſury with ſome laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monuments of your Skill and Gallantry. Shall we beg leave to remember your Book of Horſmanſhip, which we love to peruſe and boaſt of to Strangers? Or will you permit us, with all thankfulneſs, to name your laſt Favour, that accurate and faithful Hiſtory (which the moſt Excellent <hi>Margaret</hi> hath writ) of your Life, and Actions?

                  <p>I have, according to your commands, read your Excellencies Orations, and will not diſobey your Excellence, in concealing my Opinion of them. Was it to condemn any thing, either in matter or the language, having your Excellencies Warrant for it, I would freely expreſs it, and if it be otherwiſe, I beg your Excellencies Favour, that Truth may not paſs for Courtſhip, as being to ſo great a Lady from ſo mean a man, it is in danger to be ſuſpected, which your Excellence hath been pleaſed to foreſee and forbid. I am, I confeſs, no great reader, of late, of new Books, having tried formerly, that to find in them the leaſt Jewel it muſt be ſifted out of a great deal of Rubbiſh, and the worſt is, that their Authors take up Errors upon truſt one from another, which the better they adorn with new dreſſes, the greater injury they do to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. To make up ſuch Volumes out of Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Bees gather Hony from this and that Flower, is rather laborious Induſtry than fine Wit; But to ſpin out of one's own Bowels, not Cobwebs as Spiders do, but rich Tiſſues of Gold and Silver, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes a great Fancy well improved, with much thinking. As every man is not capable of ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Productions, ſo is not every Woman; but that Women are naturally as capable of it as Men, if not more, may eaſily be proved by making an exact compariſon of both their Temperaments and Organs, which would be a diſcourſe too long to be inſerted in a Letter, and your Excellence hath ſo clearly decided that Queſtion by your unimitable Works, that it ſaves ſufficiently that trouble. The
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108911:42"/>
greateſt Maſters in Oratory having been neceſſitated to acknowledge, that the beſt art conſiſts in hiding of it, it may be inferred, that it is yet better to have none at all, as a natural Amble is to be preferred to that which is got with Tramells, or the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Walking of a Gentleman more eſteemed than the affected Demarch of a Dancer: and it is truly a very rare thing to be a great Scholar without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquainted with the Univerſities, and Learned without the help of Teachers. As there is variety of Sciences, ſo there are ſeveral ſorts of Capacities to acquire them, ſome proving excellent in one kind, ſome in another; but to be capable of all, as well Philoſophy as Playes, and Poems as Orations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to a very few, whoſe Statues ſhould be erected in all the eminent Places in the World, for their Glory, and our Admiration. I can hardly ſtop my Pen from deſcribing what I have marked in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; for to ſet down my particular Obſervations, they are of ſo many extraordinary Things, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Terms (and I am capable of no other) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them to be underſtood, and I am extreme ſenſible, that even what is commonly called Defect, here becomes comly, like ſome Moles in a beautiful Face, and that what ſeemes ſtrange at firſt, becauſe it croſſes the uſual Methods of our Studies, gives at laſt occaſion of amazement, to ſee your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency go ſo far in the way of knowledge, with ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill, in a manner, and that others ſhould run continually like Squerils in a Cage, without advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing forwards; which happens, I believe becauſe they dare not, or cannot go one ſtep without Stilts, and your Excellence truſts to the goodneſs of your Legs, having been pleaſed to allow me the

                  <p>HAd I returned you this Letter of Thanks, for the great Honour you did me in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me your Plays, before I had read them, it would have lookt like a peece of Flattery, and my Praiſe of you would have made me like a Blind man, who fell in love with a Beauty which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw. But having taken time to read them all over, and ſome of them more than once, I can now upon a clear Judgement aſſure your Ladyſhip, that my entertainment was ſo great, that I know not whether I read them or ſaw them Acted. For though the Plots, Acts, and Scenes, be dreſt in ſeveral ſhapes, and have that which is the life of Pleaſure, a muſical variety, yet the Wit, and rich Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of them is ſo much every where the ſame, that I fancied my ſelf a Spectator in the peruſal, and was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108911:43"/>
doubtful, whether your Ladyſhip with your Book had not ſent me the new Theater too. I never in any Dramatick Writings met with more Honour and Virtue matcht with more Sharpneſs and delight. Which had it come from ſuch a Pen as <hi>Ben Jonſon</hi>'s, who was always powring Oyle into his Lamp, and owed moſt of his Excellencies to his laborious Induſtry and Art, I ſhould the leſs wonder. But coming from a Quill held by a Ladys Hand, who made it not her Toyl but Recreation to do rarely, confirms me in an Opinion which I have long held, That the beſt Art is nothing but the beſt Imitation of Nature; and that your Books are the true face, and others but the painted. Madam, as I look upon you as a great Princeſs, (for you are ſo) ſo that which renders you to be the Glory and happieſt of your Sex, is that you can bring forth ſuch Children of your Mind in a Wilderneſs, and in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Walks can chuſe all the Muſes to be your Maids of Honour.

I am one of thoſe many, that are perſwaded, that your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſpent more Treaſure to maintain the Royal Cauſe, in the late Warrs, beſides the hazard of your Perſon, than any Subject in the three Realms; and am at wonder that it is not moſt eminently rewarded and repayed. My gratious Lord; I having been one from my youth addicted to the ingenuity of Poetry, whereof your Honour hath been a great Patron, did betake my ſelf, thirteen years ſince, to write three Books in Verſe, Latine and Heroick, to bewail the moſt barbarous murther committed upon the perſon of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr. The work is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſince finiſht, and ſhall in due time be publiſht; In the third Book thereof, mention being made of his Majeſties moſt Heroick Champions, theſe Verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, ſet forth your Excellency as I was able;</p>

But now your Excellencies late ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of exceſſive Charity, in ſending me by Dr. <hi>Morley,</hi> the Works of your moſt Honourable, Vertuous, and Learned Conſort, hath chidd my Ingratitude unto a Bluſh beyond Confuſion; and made me feel ſome of <hi>Du Cartes</hi> Paſſions, transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from your firſt gift to your ſecond: I ſhould have conſecrated all my pains, to your never dying Fame, as to a prime Patron of Learning, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Books from you; Books rare and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, diſtilled from the Brain of a moſt Noble <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> a Lady, your own Lady, whom delicacy of Education, height of Birth and Place, might well have exempted from ſuch inferiour employments:

And in the number of theſe your Bouuty hath given me a right to account my ſelf. For which eminent Grace and Favour while I ſtrive to ſhew my ſelf Grateful, I find

my Faculties wholly taken up with Admiration: and that Reaſon I ſhould make uſe of, to help me expreſs my ſentiments decently, is dimmed with the Glories of the Perſon to whom I addreſs, If, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I am not able to acquit my ſelf of that Duty, as I ought; you are to reflect on the exceeding difficulty of it.

                  <p>Your Wit, Madam, is above all Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; your Induſtry above Belief; your Labours, in Writing, above humane patience; your Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity above Imitation; your Notions above any, but your own Subtlety; and all above your Sex.

You ſolve Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems with more eaſe than others have propoſed them: and your Pen hath this particular advantage, that it leaves no Darkneſs on the Paper beſides that of the Ink. Where you treat of Arguments for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly handled by others, you either give them more light, or contract what they had before into a narrower and more familiar Compaſs; and upon all occaſions you either produce new things, or ſpeak old ones after a new manner; ſo that you ſtagger the truth of that ſaying of the wiſe Man, <hi>That nothing is new under the Sun.</hi> Your Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

for the moſt part are Natural, yet Select; at once explaining and adorning your Matter: and they who read your Books with deſign to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in points of Philoſophy, find themſelves at the ſame time introduced alſo in Rhetorique.

                  <p>IN obedience to your Commands ſent me by your Servant in his laſt Letter, I have put your Book of Tales into the Hand of a fit perſon to tranſlate them into <hi>Latine</hi> as I think either Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity can afford. Being an exact Maſter of both Languages, and enabled with a <hi>Genius</hi> ſit for ſuch an undertaking. I have alſo read as much of your Poetry tranſlated by a young Scholar as hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to paſt his Pen. In ſome parts whereof I find him happy enough. But your Excellent Fancy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it ſelf ſometimes in Terms of Art, and Words only known to Philoſophy, he tells me the hardeſt part of his Task will be how to find out current <hi>Roman</hi> Words to match them. To remove which difficulty, I have directed him to read <hi>Lucretius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he proceed farther; who having ſoftned the moſt ſtubborn parts of Natural Philoſophy, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them run ſmoothly in his tunable Verſes, by an eaſy Imitation will teach him to do the like. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in theſe two particulars moſt readily ſerved you, I ſhould return you my Studied Thanks, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books you are pleaſed to ſend me, if they did not make me unhappy, by converſing with the Children of your Mind at ſo great a diſtance from the incomparable Parent.

                  <p>I Am very ſorry that my unhappy Fate hath neceſſitated an unbecoming Slowneſs in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a Favour, that requires all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of Gratitude, and exceeds them. But yet, had I nothing elſe to ſay in excuſe of my no ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier return to the laſt Noble effects of your Graces goodneſs, it were ſufficient; That my ſence of that mighty Honour was too big for my Pen; and when I began to ſpeak my reſentments of it, I found my ſelf as unable to expreſs them, as to deſerve their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Bet yet, Madam, this is not all the reaſon, for I was from home when your Grace's Preſent came, and have been ſo almoſt ever ſince; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I had not added to my want of merit on other accounts, that alſo of appearing inſenſible, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in endeavours of acknowledgment; I muſt ſay endeavours, for my Gratitude can riſe no higher. Since my receipt of your Grace's ingenious Works, I have, as my occaſions would permit, caſt my Eyes again into them, and I am ſorry they cannot dwell there, where I find ſo pleaſing, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive an entertainment. And though I muſt crave your Pardon for diſſenting from your Grace's Opinion in ſome things, I admire the quickneſs, and vigor of your Conceptions, in all: In which your Grace hath this peculiar among Authors that they are, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, your own, your Grace being indebted to nothing for them, but your own happy Wit, and Genius; a thing ſo uncommon even among the moſt celebrated Writers of our Sex, that it ought to be acknowledged with wonder in yours. And really, Madam, your Grace hath ſet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108911:51"/>
us a patern, that we ought to admire, but cannot imitate. And whereas you are pleaſed ſometimes to mention your being no Scholar, as an excuſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, your modeſty ſuppoſeth; By that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment you ſhew our imperfections that pretend we are ſo, rather than diſcover any of your own.</p>
                  <p>As for the laſt Trifle I was bold to preſent to your Graces Eye, it is much indebted to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging reception you were pleaſed to afford it; and there is nothing that ſets ſuch a luſtre on your Graces great Wit, and Intellectual Perfections, as that ſweet candor of your Spirit that renders you ſo acceſſible, even to your meaneſt admirers. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your Grace is pleaſed to object againſt ſome part of the deſign of my Diſcourſe, that it ſets the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſenſe higher than that of Ratiocination; I humbly deſire that your Grace would conſider, that there are two ſorts of Reaſoning, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe that the Mind advanceth from its own imbred <hi>Idaea</hi>'s and native Store, ſuch are all Metaphyſical Contemplations. And thoſe natural reſearches which are raiſed from experiment, and the objects of ſenſe. The former are indeed moſt perfect when they are moſt abſtracted from the groſneſs of things ſenſible, but the others are then moſt compleat when they are moſt accomodated to them; and when they are not, they are Aery, and Phantaſtick. Now what I have ſaid about thoſe matters is to tie down the mind in Phyſical things, to conſider Nature as it is, to lay a Foundation in ſenſible collections, and from thence to proceed to general Propoſitions, and Diſcourſes. So that my aim is, that we may ariſe according to the order of nature by degrees from the exerciſe of our Senſes, to that of our Reaſons;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108911:52"/>
which indeed is moſt noble and moſt perfect when it concludes aright, but not ſo when 'tis miſtaken: And that it may ſo conclude and arrive to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it muſt begin in ſenſe: And the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments our reaſons have to work on, by ſo much they are the more likely to be certain in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, and conſequently more perfect in their actings. But Madam, I doubt I begin to be tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and therefore, at preſent dare add no more, but that I am,</p>

                  <p>I Received a freſh obligation from your Grace in the excellent Hiſtory you were pleaſed to order for me. In which your Grace hath done right to one of the moſt Illuſtrious Hero's of our Age, and erected a laſting Monument to his Virtue. And in it, Madam, your Grace hath ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wonderfully twiſted the Faithfulneſs of an Hiſtorian, with the Affections of a Wife; And your Illuſtrious Lord hath in this an Honour beyond the other great Subjects of Hiſtory, That his Grace hath not only as much deſerved to be Celebrated as they, But hath moreover the happineſs of the neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to an Heroine, whoſe Pen is as Glorious as his Sword. And 'tis not eaſy to ſay which is really the greater Wonder, the Famous Loyalty of that great Perſon, or the uncommon Excellence of the Pen that deſcribed it. But I muſt take up from a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in which, when I have ſaid all I can, I ſhall be defective; and return to the laſt Letter wherewith your Grace was pleaſed to Honour me. For the buſineſs of Witches upon which your Grace reflects again in this, I have ſpoken many things more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it in ſome Additions to my Conſiderations, which I am now ſending to the Preſs. As ſoon as that Diſcourſe is extant, I ſhall beg your Graces acceptance of it. In the interim thoſe things may be ſuperſeded.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Lower Nature</hi> in my laſt, Madam, I meant, the meer Animal, and Plaſtick Faculties, whoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Impetus</hi> is the cauſe of many of our irregularities and vices. As to the reſt, I acquieſce in your Grace's Determinations; And whereas your Grace is pleaſed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108911:54"/>
to Excuſe the liberty of Arguings; 'tis Madam with me that which leaſt of all things needs to be excuſed. For I profeſs the largeſt freedom of Diſcourſe and Inquiry. As for violent and captious Diſputes and Oppoſitions, I indeed much diſlike the immodeſty, and immoralities of them; But for free and ingenious exchange of the Reaſons of our particular Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 'tis that which diſcovers Truth, improves Knowledge, and may be ſo managed as to be no diſintereſt to Charity. Your Grace Madam, I know is a Perſon of ſo much Honour and Judgement, as not to take any thing amiſs from my liberty in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing my apprehenſions, which I uſe not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude upon any, but to propoſe to their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Enquiries; and for my ſelf there is nothing obligeth me more than the knowledge of variety of Conceptions.

My moſt Noble Lord (were it not known by experience that great Perſons, and great Minds, are moſt apt to ſtoop from their own height, and own mean and inconſiderable ſervices offered to them) I ſhould ſay it was too low a Condeſcenſion in your Grace, to take notice of my readineſs to comply with your Deſires: Wherein (beſide the diſcharge of my Duty) I did likewiſe ſerve the ends of my Ambition; it having ever been the Vanity of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to think themſelves dignified by the Honours done to their General. This made me with great Delight employ my ſelf in Deſigning that for your Grace, which I ſhould be ſorry to live to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, being already unhappy enough, in Burying too many Princes. For the thing it ſelf I am glad to ſee the King do that which is ſo decent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him, as to order your Grace a Tomb among the Kings, who have always been ſo near to him, and who ſtood up ſo cloſe to his Father in extremity of Danger, and ſo bravely, that had not God deſigned to reſtore the Crown, in his own Miraculous way, it had certainly been done before by your Hand.

                  <p>AMong many other things, by which your Grace is pleaſed to diſtinguiſh your ſelf from other Writers, this ſeems to be not the leaſt remarkable; that whereas they imploy only their wit, labour, and time, in compoſing Books, You beſtow alſo great ſumms of Money in Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Yours: and not content to enrich our Heads alone, with your rare Notions, you go higher, and adorn our Libraries, with your elegant Volumes. To that general Charity, which diſpoſeth you to benefit all Mankind, you have added a ſingular Bounty, whereby you oblige particular Perſons: and out of a Nobleneſs peculiar to your Nature, you cauſe your Munificence to Rival your Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
                  <p>This, <hi>Madam,</hi> among many other your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, Gratitude commands me to acknowledge; Your Grace having been pleaſed to number me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108911:56"/>
thoſe, whom you vouchſaſed to honour with ſuch extraordinary Preſents. For which I know not how to ſhew my ſelf duely thankful, otherwiſe than by celebrating your Generoſity, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſome account of the good effects they wrought in me, while I peruſed them. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Noble End for which you wrote them, and my inability to make you a more proportionate retribution; will not, I hope, be unacceptable to you. To this purpoſe, therefore, I am bold to ſend your Grace this rude Paper. Which yet I deſign, not as a Panegyric of your worth (for what affects us with admiration, ſtrikes us alſo with dumbneſs: and Stars are beſt diſcerned by their own luſtre) but as a ſhort Scheme of my own grateful Sentiments. And if I be not ſo happy, to deliver them in Language agreeable to the dignity of the Subject, I humbly beſeech you to conſider, that ſuch occaſions offer themſelves very rarely; and that nothing is more difficult, than to make the Pen obſerve <hi>Decorum,</hi> where Reaſon is put into diſorder, Juſtice, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> requires you ſhould pardon the effects of that aſtoniſhment, whereof your Wonders are the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>They tell us, that the End of all Books is either profit, or pleaſure: but I think that diſtinction (as many other in the Schools) might well be ſpared: becauſe, in truth, profit ſuppoſeth pleaſure; and pleaſure is the greateſt profit; nor am I aſhamed to profeſs, that in all my reading I have no other aim but pleaſure. It will not then, I hope, <hi>Madam,</hi> be thought derogatory to the Profitableneſs of your Grace's Books, If I acknowledge my ſelf to have received very great pleaſure in reading them. And
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108911:57"/>
this pleaſure was ſo charming, it ſo far tranſported me, as often to make me wiſh, you might never entertain a reſolution of cauſing your works to be Tranſlated into any other Language: that ſo all Ingenious Forreigners, invited by the Fame of your moſt delightful Writings, might be brought to do Honour to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, by learning it on purpoſe to underſtand them. For I am zealous for the Reputation of my native Language, and of ſo communicative a temper, as to deſire all men ſhould participate of what I find delectable. Beſides, I could not but remember, that I had known a great Man of our Nation, who ſtudied <hi>Italian,</hi> only to acquaint himſelf with the Mathematiques of <hi>Galileo,</hi> in his <hi>Del Movimento,</hi> and <hi>Saggiatore;</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,</hi> meerly out of love to the Incomparable Hiſtory of <hi>Don Quixot:</hi> and was thereupon the more apt to promiſe my ſelf that your Grace's Works, no leſs admirable in their kind, than either of thoſe, would have the like influence upon ſome of the <hi>Bons Eſprits</hi> beyond Sea. But this, <hi>Madam,</hi> was only my Wiſh: it is not now my Counſel. Should I here particularly recount to you, what the things were, that raiſed this ſo great delight in me, I ſhould both offend by prolixity, and tacitly caſt diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the reſt.

                  </p>
                  <p>For your <hi>NAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RAL Philoſophy;</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and free, and may be, for ought I know, Excellent: but give me leave, <hi>Madam,</hi> to confeſs, I have not yet been ſo happy, as to diſcover much therein that's <hi>Apodictical,</hi> or wherein I think my ſelf much obliged to acquieſce. But, that may be the the fault of my own dull Brain: and Oracles have been after found true, that were at firſt Dark and <hi>Enigmatical.</hi> Again I am ſomewhat ſlow of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief alſo; a continual ſeeker: as conceiving, I have too much cauſe to be of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s opinion, that <hi>Men may, indeed enquire and determine what is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but God alone knows what's true, in the things of Nature.</hi> Nor am I ſingle in this Sceptical Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The <hi>ROYAL SOCIETY</hi> it ſelf (the Tribunal of Philoſophical Doctrines) is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution exceedingly ſtrict and rigid in the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Theories concerning Nature; no reſpecter of Perſons or Authorities, where Verity is concerned; ſeldom, or never yielding aſſent without full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction: and that's the Reaſon why it made choice of theſe three Words for its Motto, <hi>Nullius in verba.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Madam,</hi> can be no diſcredit to your Philoſophy in particular, becauſe common to all others: and he is a bold Man, who dares to exempt the <hi>Phyſics</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf, or of <hi>Democritus,</hi> or <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi> or <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> or any other hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to known. For my part, Seriouſly, I ſhould be loath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108911:58"/>
to affirm, that they are any other but ingenious Comments of Mens Wits upon the dark and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable Text of the World; plauſible Conjectures at beſt; and no leſs different, perhaps, from the true Hiſtory of Nature, than Romances are from the true actions of <hi>Heroes.</hi> Nor will I adventure to determine, which of the two, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or your Grace, hath given us the beſt definition of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul: He, when he calls it <hi>Entelechia;</hi> or you when you ſay, it is a <hi>Supernatural ſomething, &amp;c.</hi> So difficult is it to make a judgement of what ſeems incomprehenſible.</p>
                  <p>Nor are you to be diſcouraged, <hi>Madam,</hi> If your Philoſophy have not the fate to be publickly read in all Univerſities of <hi>Europe,</hi> as your Grace, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs out of a moſt Heroic ambition to benefit Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, deſires it ſhould. For, while Men are Men, there will be different Intereſts, and conſequently different Opinions: nor is the multitude of Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers a certain ſign of the Soundneſs, but of the Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of any Doctrine. If, therefore, the World, which is obſtinate (you know) and governed by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, will not be induced to eſteem, what you think uſeful; the blame lyes not at your Door, and you ought to conſolate your ſelf with this reflexion; that you have ſufficiently teſtified your good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and done more than your Duty, in publiſhing your Conceptions. Beſides, the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Univerſities have, of late years, proclamed open War againſt the tyranny of Dogmatizing in any Art or Science: and as for thoſe of the <hi>Roman Religion;</hi> there is, I fear me, but little hope, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them your Proſelites. Becauſe thoſe canting Polititians, called <hi>School-men,</hi> having made a new and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108911:58"/>
party-colour'd Veſt for the Church, of a kind of Drugget, conſiſting of the Thrums of <hi>Peripatetic</hi> Philoſophy, cunningly interwoven among the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den threads of the Chriſtian Faith; and prevailed, upon Princes to make it Piacular for any Scholar to appear with his Judgement clad in any other Livery: it is not very unlikely, the Profeſſors there will ſoon be brought to offend their Superiors, by laying aſide the defence of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Maxims, to aſſume the Patronage of New. So that in my ſilly conceipt, as the Cabbage is obſerved to ſtarve the Vine, if ſet too near: ſo the Philoſophy of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and others of the ſame myſtical Tribe, will hinder the growth of yours, in the ſame Ground.</p>
                  <p>For your <hi>MORAL</hi> Philoſophy (for ſo I take liberty to call your occaſional Reflections upon the Actions, Manners, and Fortunes of Men) Your Grace has not, indeed tied up your Pen to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious rules of Method, or the formality of a new Syſteme in <hi>Ethics:</hi> but (what is as well) you have opportunely, and under various heads, diſperſed many uſeful remarks, concerning Prudence, as well Civil, as Domeſtic, in moſt of your Writings. And this, it may be preſumed, you were pleaſed to do, not for want of Skill to reduce your rules of life into the order of dependence and connexion; but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to ſhew your plenty, and ſurprize your Readers with good counſel even where they leaſt expect it. You choſe rather to regale us with delicate Fictions, under the veil whereof wholeſom inſtructions are neatly contrived, than to embaraſs and tire us with the obſervation ofa long train of Precepts, which are never ſo effectual, as when naturally flowing from agreeable Inſtances and Examples: Your very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes 
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:108911:59"/>
contain adviſo's, and your digreſſions are ſeaſonably inſtructive: like wiſe Husbandmen, you plant Fruit-Trees in your Hedge-rows, and ſet Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries and Rasberries among your Roſes and Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. This, <hi>Madam,</hi> is a piece of no ſmall art, though not obvious to common Eyes: and if any diſlike the courſe you have taken in thus ſcattering and diſguiſing your <hi>Morals;</hi> I would have him asked this Queſtion, Whether or no it be folly for a man to refuſe to gather Oranges and Citrons, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the trees that offer them, are not ranged in the Order of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s <hi>Quincunx?</hi> or whether a Noſegay be leſs fragrant, becauſe pluck'd from Flowers grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſperſedly? To all who have read your <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tales,</hi> with the ſame purity of Mind, with which you wrote them, and are withal qualified to ſearch into the Mythology of all your imaginary <hi>Dialogues:</hi> to all ſuch, I ſay, it is evident, that you have drawn the Images of all the <hi>Virtues,</hi> on one hand, and their oppoſite <hi>Vices,</hi> on the other, ſo much to the life; that men, beholding them, muſt be, by grateful violence, compelled to love the Pulchritude of thoſe, and abhor the deformity of theſe. Now, this, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> you could not have done had you not firſt had the <hi>Idea</hi>'s of all Virtues within your ſelf: it being abſolutely neceſſary for a Painter, firſt to conceive the form or ſimilitude of the thing he intends to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, in his own Imagination; and then to make the reſemblance according to that form. So that in ſtrictneſs of truth, thoſe Pictures we call <hi>Originals,</hi> are but Copies, yea Copies of Copies: as being firſt drawn from the life in the Phantaſy, and after pourtrai'd upon Tables. Beſides this, your Grace is further happy, in that the <hi>Morals</hi> of your <hi>Pen</hi> are
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108911:59"/>
clearly exemplified in thoſe of your <hi>Life;</hi> in which I have never heard any thing blamed, any thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed, unleſs whether it hath been more <hi>Innocent,</hi> or more <hi>Obliging.</hi> In fine, the Documents of both your <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> ſeem to be ſo good, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is able to moderate his Paſſions, and regulate his Actions by them, needs not to ſeek further af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Happineſs:</hi> nor need I fear to pronounce him ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at ſuch perfection, that it will not be eaſy for him to be brought to do ill, either out of <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> or out of <hi>Deſign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For your <hi>POETRY;</hi> therein your Grace hath more than a ſingle advantage above others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Your Vein appears equally facile, equally free, and copious upon all occaſions, in all ſorts of arguments. The Buskin and the Sock are equally fit for your Muſes Legs. Your Phanſy is too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous to be reſtrained: Your Invention too nimble to be fettered. Hence it is, that you do not always confine your Senſe to Verſe; nor your Verſes to Rhythme; nor your Rhythme to the quantity and ſounds of Sillables. Your Deſcriptions, Expreſſions, Similies, Allegories, Metaphors, Epithets, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, all flow in upon you of their own accord, and in full Tides: and Verſes ſtand ready minted in the Treaſury of your Brain, as Tears in ſome Womens Eyes, waiting to be called forth. So that in you is verified the Doctrine of <hi>Plato,</hi> in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled <hi>Io;</hi> that <hi>Poeſy</hi> is not a faculty proceeding from judgement, or acquired by labour and induſtry; but a certain divine Fury, or <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> which ſcorning the controle of Reaſon, tranſports the Spirit in Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as <hi>Jove</hi>'s Eagle did <hi>Ganymed,</hi> or as Witches are ſaid to be wafted above the Clouds on the wings
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108911:60"/>
of their Familiars. Which is, perhaps, the ground of that old ſaying, <hi>nemo fit Poeta,</hi> no Poet is made, but born ſo: as the rage and liberty of a Poetic Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius gave occaſion to paint <hi>Pegaſus</hi> with Wings, in a flying poſture, and without a Bridle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In your whole <hi>Oglio</hi> of Poems, I find nothing which is not intirely <hi>Your own.</hi> Like good Houſewifes in the Countrey, you, make a Feaſt wholly of your own proviſions: yea, even the Dreſſing, Sawces, and Garniture of the Diſhes are <hi>Your own.</hi> And were <hi>Perilius Fauſtinus</hi> revived (he, who out of envy to the Glory of <hi>Virgil,</hi> made and publiſhed a large Catalogue of his Thefts from <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Heſiod)</hi> he could hardly diſcover ſo much as a ſingle Verſe borrowed, by you, from any Poet, antient or modern. So circumſpect you are to avoid being thought a Plagiary, that you walk not in beaten Paths, but decline even the rules and methods of your Predeceſſors, and ſcorn Imitation, as a kind of Theft. A commendation, <hi>Madam,</hi> due to very few, perhaps to none beſides your ſelf. As your Grace, therefore, owes all your Poeſy to the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of your own happy Genius alone; ſo we owe all the Pleaſure we are ſenſible of in reading your Poems, to you alone. I may have many rivals in theſe my thankful acknowledgements, you can have no Competitor in the Glory of their occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>This double Felicity is augmented by the acceſſion of two others, no leſs worthy admiration. <hi>One</hi> is, that as you have made your ſelf an <hi>Original,</hi> ſo are you likewiſe ſecure from being <hi>Copied.</hi> You have indeed, given the world an illuſtrious Example; but you have given what it cannot take, the Example
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108911:60"/>
being of that height, that it is hardly attainable. You provoke our Emulation, and at the ſame time caſt us into deſpair. Your Poetical Fancies rather brave, than inſtruct our capacities: and by ſetting before our Eyes things inimitable, you vex our ambition, and oblige us to an unprofitable trouble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another</hi> is, that you exceed all of your delicate Sex, not only in this age, but in all ages paſt. It would puzle the beſt Hiſtorian to find your Parallel among the moſt famous Women: and in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the <hi>Roman</hi> greatneſs, even while that Glorious Nation held the Empire as well of Virtue and Wit, as that of the World, I cannot meet with an <hi>Heroine,</hi> to whom I dare to compare you. There are, I confeſs, who tell us of a Noble <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, one <hi>Sulpitia,</hi> who compoſed a Hiſtory of <hi>Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s times, in Hexametre Verſes, and wrote many Elegant Poems beſides; and who hath been highly celebrated by <hi>Martial, Tibullus, Sidonius Apollinaris,</hi> and of late by <hi>Scaliger</hi> alſo, as an eminent Pattern both of a Chaſt and Immaculate Life, and of a neat Poetical Wit: and once I had ſome thoughts of drawing a Parallel betwixt that Lady and your Grace. But, upon a ſecond examination of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Remarks, wherein I had fanſied the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance chiefly to conſiſt; and a more ſerious review of the Story of her Life, and the remains of her Pen, (extant among the <hi>Fragments</hi> of <hi>Latine Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,</hi> and uſually annexed to <hi>Petronius Arbiter)</hi> I perceived, I could not proceed in that reſolution, without diſadvantage on your part, by a conference ſo unequal; and thereupon reſumed my former co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation, that your Grace's Statue ought to be placed

alone, and at the upper end, in the <hi>Gallery of Heroic Women,</hi> and upon a Pedeſtal more advanced than the reſt.

                  <p>I Owe it to your <hi>Graces</hi> ſingular condeſcention, and goodneſs, that my Letters are not diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and I ſee a great deal of Generoſity, in your <hi>Graces</hi> acceptance, of ſuch mean things, as my ſlender ſtock of Knowledge can impart. As for your Inquiry about the Plaſtick Faculties; I Anſwer, that they are thoſe, whereby the Body is formed at firſt, and by which the Alimental Juices, are after, through the whole courſe of Life, orderly diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the purpoſes of growth and nutrition: But whether, as your <hi>Grace</hi> inquires, they are Faculties inherent, in the Soul, or are only Mechanical Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108911:64"/>
of the Body I cannot determine certainly. But I rather incline to the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> who will have the Soul to be the Bodies Maker, and they affirm (as is ordinary; though with ſome diverſity in the Names and Preſentation) That there are three ſorts of Faculties, which they Phancy as Analogous parts, or Regions in the Soul, <hi>(Viz.)</hi> The <hi>Mind,</hi> ſo they call the higheſt Faculties of abſtract Reaſon, and Underſtanding, which is the <hi>Firſt.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> they call the <hi>Soul, (Viz.)</hi> as it is united to the Body, and exerciſeth the operation of Senſe. The <hi>Third,</hi> is the Image of the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that are called Plaſtical, that move and turn the Body, but are devoid of Underſtanding, or Senſe; Now how the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is Immaterial, can manage and order Corporeal Motions is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of which Philoſophy as yet hath given no account, as I have particularly taken notice, and proved in my <hi>Sceptis Scientifica,</hi> but yet the thing ought not therefore to be denied, becauſe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the moſt obvious ſenſible things is to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; And by this we can only prove, that we have yet no certain Theory of Nature: And, in good earneſt, Madam, all that we can hope for, as yet, is but the Hiſtory of things as they are, but to ſay how they are, to raiſe general <hi>Axioms,</hi> and to make <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> muſt, I think, be the happy priviledge of ſucceeding Ages; when they ſhall have gained a larger account of the <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> which yet are too ſcant and defective to raiſe Theories upon: ſo that to be ingenious and confeſs freely, we have yet no ſuch thing as Natural Philoſophy; Natural Hiſtory is all we can pretend to; and that too, as yet, is but in its Rudiments, the advance of it your
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108911:64"/>
                     <hi>Grace</hi> knows is the deſign and buiſineſs of the <hi>Royal Society;</hi> from whom we may reaſonably at laſt expect better grounds for general Doctrines, than any the World yet hath been acquainted with; but this, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, is an excurſion. I therefore return to your <hi>Graces</hi> Letter, which inquires ſome things, about my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Souls</hi> Original: As to this I would not be underſtood to affirm peremptorily a thing, which the greateſt part of Men, neither have, nor can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, only I conſider it as an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that may be taken up to ſatisfy thoſe minds that are much troubled at the ſeeming inequalities of Providence; and whether true, or falſe, this I will take the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be confident in, That the Doctrine of the <hi>Souls Praeexiſtence,</hi> doth beſt ſuit with the appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the World. And beſt Anſwers for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice and Goodneſs, in all the affairs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; In this Madam, I am a little <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> and this ſtep further, I think I may take, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty; That the Doctrine hath ſo much to ſay for it ſelf, from Reaſon, and the higheſt Antiquity, as to render it fit to be conſidered, and indeed, ſince the two other wayes, are confeſſedly deſperate, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks there ſhould be no harm in examining this; which is all I pretend to. But particularly to your <hi>Grace</hi>'s <hi>Quaery,</hi> Whether were <hi>Souls</hi> Created or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created? I Anſwer, no doubt Created: But then I do not ſee how that follows, which your <hi>Grace</hi> is pleaſed to infer, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Sin was then Created, For our <hi>Souls</hi> in their State were Spotleſs and Innocent, as the Angels of God. That Mankind was ſo firſt, and fell by a voluntary Tranſgreſſion, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Doctrine; and how we may ſuppoſe it was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the way of <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> your <hi>Grace</hi> will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108911:65"/>
ſee eaſily, when I ſhall have procured that Book of mine, I have mentioned, and promiſed your <hi>Grace,</hi> but cannot yet light on. The other part alſo of your <hi>Graces</hi> Diviſion: <hi>Viz.</hi> That if thoſe <hi>Souls</hi> were Eternal, they are Gods; is I humbly conceive a miſtake likewiſe, ſince though the World, had been Created from Eternity (which even the Schools confeſs poſſible) it had nevertheleſs been a Creature, by reaſon of its dependence upon another, for its being, and to have been produced, and yet from Eternity, is no abſurdity, our Faith affirms it, in the Eternal Generation of the Son, and Proceſſion of the Holy-Ghoſt, and to take an inſtance with which we may make more bold: If the Sun had been from Eternity no doubt it would have ſhone E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, and yet it's Beams had been effects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent; And whereas your <hi>Grace</hi> ſaith again, That what is Immaterial is a God: I muſt here alſo take the boldneſs, to enter my Diſſent to your Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; Indeed Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> denys all Immateriality to Created Beings, but I think upon grounds preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and unſafe, That our <hi>Souls</hi> are Immaterial in their Natures, hath been ſufficiently proved by ſome late Philoſophers; particularly by the moſt learned Dr. <hi>H. Moore,</hi> and I alſo have done ſomething about this, in my Book of <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> If your <hi>Grace</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands my Reaſons; they ſhall be ready at the leaſt intimation, of thoſe commands which I ſhall ever account a ſingular Honour to obſerve. For the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Praeexiſtence,</hi> which your <hi>Grace</hi> rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, to be no certain Argument of the truth of it, I humbly ſay I have not alledged it, for a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the thing, but to take off the prejudice we are apt to have againſt all ſuppoſed Novelties,

and to ſhew that it is not ſo deſpicable, an <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> but that ſeveral great minds of former times, even in the Ages of the beſt Antiquity have owned a kindneſs for it, and conſequently that we cannot, without ſome immodeſty, deny it a favourable hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, But madam, I forget my ſelf, and the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration I ought to have of your <hi>Grace</hi>'s Time and Patience, and therefore only add, that I am,</p>

                  <p>UNto the Rich and Incomparable Preſent of your Excellencies Works, wherewith you have been pleaſed to Honour the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, I have, by the ſpecial appointment of Mr. <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> given a juſt reception; which word I confeſs we could not uſe without being guilty of great rudeneſs, but that we have placed them by that Illuſtrious Piece wherewith his Excellency your Renowned Lord had before Honoured us, which is it ſelf Incomparable. Indeed <hi>Madam,</hi> the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity finds her ſelf oppreſſed herein with ſo many Obligations in one, that She knows not where to begin her Acknowledgments; as conſidering, that not only her Repoſitories are dignified to be the Cabinet of ſo rich a Jewel, but that She is ſingled out by your Excellency, and valued above the reſt of the World for her Approbation, and (as your Excellency pleaſes to ſtile it) to be a Judge of it. Alas, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> that is an Office we dare not aſſume, not only without cenſure of Arrogance, but even of Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; for ſeeing that every one is to be judged by their Peeres, who ſhall undertake to be Judge of that that hath no Peer? We may ſee other things by the Light, but to perceive the Light it ſelf we cannot call for another Light; ſo neither may this gallant Work be Judged but by its own Innate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and the ſplendor it ſelf carrys in it. No, <hi>Madam,</hi> 'tis Honour enough for us that we are taught by it, we will not uſurp upon it; and ſhall count it our Pride and not our Shame to be out-done by ſo Tranſcendent an Example. We acknowledge that we are become inſtructed in the Sciences which our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:108911:69"/>
ſelves profeſs; <hi>Philoſophy, Oratory, Phyſick, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,</hi> we write them over our Doors, but we find them herein at a farr cheaper rate ſent home to thoſe Doors, and that by a hardineſs of Invention which your Excellency firſt hath ſhewed unto the World, and that an eaſy one too, by ſending us to that common and neglected Miſtreſs, even Nature her ſelf, to whoſe Benignity if we would confide (as your Excellency hath done) we ſhould make far greater Progreſſes in the ways of Knowledge and Wiſdom (as likewiſe your Excellency hath done) than through all the tedious Diſciplines wherewith we are detained and vexed in our rugged Nurſeries. Two things do juſtly leave us, <hi>Madam,</hi> under a ſurprize and admiration of your Excellencies great Production; Firſt, that it ſhould proceed from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo high Honour and Fortune; for Ignorance in ſuch things as thoſe is appointed by the World unto ſuch Eſtates, and thought a kind of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive belonging unto Wealth: And next, that it ſhould proceed from a Sex unaccuſtomed to, and commonly excuſed from ſuch painful and elevated Inquiſitions. For (as your Excellency hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) men do aſſign to your Sex nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and Trifles for their Portion, and under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Courtſhip do confine them in their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only to ſome inferiour Qualities, and ſo in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect but to a kind of delicate Barbariſm: But herein your Excellency hath ſhew'd great Courage in breaking through that Obſtruction, and by a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male and unuſual Chevalry have reſcued your whole Nation and Sex from the oppreſſion and injury in this point, and of that great Giant, the World. For our part of your Univerſity, we muſt needs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

And in fine, my ſelf, <hi>Madam,</hi> (who am allowed the Honour to be the Cuſtos of your immortal Donary) muſt be obliged to borrow from a Womans Eloquence exemplified in the Work it ſelf, whereby to expreſs worthily the Reſentments due unto it by thoſe that have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed me, and particularly mine own, who am,</p>

ſome Teſtimony of a proportion'd reſpect and wonder, though perhaps there may be <hi>Indeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> in the boldneſs of ſuch unknown Addreſſes.

                  <p>THe greateſt Favour I could have expected in Anſwer to my boldneſs, was but a pardon for the confidence of that intruſion; But that your Grace ſhould ſo generouſly accept my Trifles, and make me ſo Glorious a return as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in your moſt ingenious Letters, this, <hi>Madam,</hi> was an Honour as much beyond my expectation, as deſert; and exceeds all my poſſibilities of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment. But if ever any thing happen within the reach of my indeavours, by which I may ſerve or gratify your Grace, I ſhall then give evidence of the great reſentment I have of this condeſcention, and the Veneration which is due to a Perſon of ſo obliging and ſo unuſual a Virtue. Your Grace, I know, is Nobly inquiſitive, and hath a rich ſtock of generous Apprehenſions; and Perſons of this Character uſe to be pleaſed in the peruſal of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of others Conceptions; And on this account I preſume, that thoſe notions I ſometimes entertain my ſelf with, may not be unacceptable, being not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the road and common track. And if your Grace pleaſe to permit, and pardon my Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I ſhall take occaſion to give you my ſenſe of ſome things that are not of the meaneſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For the preſent I am obliged to anſwer the particulars of your Grace's Letter, in which your Grace hath very much obliged me by thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you are pleaſed to excuſe; and to them I make this humble return.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That whereas your Grace calls the Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the belief of Witches, <hi>probable Arguments,</hi> I am apt, with ſubmiſſion, to think ſome of them to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:108911:71"/>
be as great demonſtrations as matter of Fact can bear; being no leſs than the evidence of the Senſes, and Oaths of ſober Atteſtors, and the critical inquiries of Sagacious, and ſuſpitious Perſons; which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Evidence, your grace knows, ſome of thoſe Relations have to prove them. And there is a particular Story which is ſufficiently famous, and of part of which I my ſelf was a Witneſs, which I think is not ſubject to juſt Exception. 'Tis that of the Drum in the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Mompeſſon</hi> of <hi>Tedworth</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi> Of this, <hi>Madam,</hi> I ſhall take an occaſion to give your Grace a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, if you have not yet been acquainted with the circumſtances of that unuſual diſturbance. But to confine my ſelf now to your Grace's conſiderations on the ſubject; The ſecond thing I obſerve, is,</p>
                  <p>The intimation of an Argument againſt the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of Witches, becauſe <hi>they are not mentioned by Chriſt, and his Apostles,</hi> concerning which I humbly deſire your Grace to conſider.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Negative Arguments from Scripture uſe not often to be of any great ſignification or validity. Our Saviour ſpake as he had occaſion, and the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of what he ſaid, or what he did, is not recorded, as one Evangeliſt intimates. He ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe large unknown Tracts of <hi>America,</hi> gives no intimations of the Exiſtence of that nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People, much leſs any inſtructions about their Converſion. He gives no particular account of the affairs and ſtate of the other World, but only that general one, of the happineſs of ſome, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of others. He makes no diſcovery of the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia</hi> of Art, or Nature, no not of thoſe whereby the propagation of the Goſpel might have been
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:108911:71"/>
much advanced; <hi>viz.</hi> The Myſtery of <hi>Printing,</hi> and the <hi>Magnet.</hi> And yet no one uſeth his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in theſe Inſtances as an Argument againſt the being of things, which are the evident Objects of Senſe. I confeſs the omiſſion of ſome of theſe particulars is pretty ſtrange and unaccountable, and an argument of our Ignorance of the Reaſons and Menages of Providence, but I ſuppoſe of nothing elſe; or if it were, I crave leave to add,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Goſpel is not without intimations of Sorcery, and contracts with evil Spirits. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid our Saviour did his Miracles by their aſſiſtance, <hi>He caſts out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub. And he denys not the ſuppoſition or poſſibility of the thing in general, but clears himſelf by an appeal to the Actions of their own Children, whom they would not ſo ſeverely criminate. And beſides this,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apoſtles had intimations plain enough of the being of Sorcery and Witchcraft, as ſeems to me evident from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. <hi>Rev,</hi> 22. 15.</p>
                  <p>'Tis very true as your Grace ſuggeſts, that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Ignorance of Cauſes make Men many times to impute the Effects of Art, and Nature, to Witchcraft and Diabolick Contract. And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People think God, or the Devil to be in every thing extraordinary. But yet, <hi>Madam,</hi> your Grace may pleaſe to conſider, That there are things done by mean and deſpicable perſons, tranſcending all the Arts of the moſt knowing and improv'd <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> and above all the Eſſays of known and ordinary Nature. So that we either muſt ſuppoſe that a ſottiſh ſilly old Woman hath more knowledge of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:108911:72"/>
the intrigues of Art, and Nature, than the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed Artiſts, and Philoſophers, or confeſs that thoſe ſtrange things they performe, are done by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foederacy with evil Spirits, who, no doubt, act thoſe things by the ways and applications of Nature, though ſuch as are to us unknown. This, <hi>Madam,</hi> is, I conceive, as much as is neceſſary to be ſaid to the Argumentative part of your Graces excellent Letter.</p>
                  <p>As for the following Periods, I am moſtly of the ſame Opinion with your Grace, in the way that I underſtand them. Nature is in a continual motion (for there is no ſuch thing as Reſt in the World) and perhaps that is not purely Mechanical, but may, in great part (at leaſt as to the beginnings and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it) be aſcribed to the Soul of the World, which poſſibly is the great <hi>Archeus</hi> that formes Plants, Animals, and other more curious <hi>Phoenomena.</hi> And there is no doubt but (as your Grace ſuggeſts) that much wickedneſs is cauſed by the meer impulſe of Lower Nature; and I believe ſeveral Men are determined to Actions of Vice by the odneſs of their particular make and contexture. But whereas your Grace ſaith that nothing but God himſelf can be perfect, I cannot ſo well underſtand that. <hi>Abſolutely ſo, and in all kinds,</hi> 'tis true, I grant it, but your Grace doth not ſeem to intend the propoſition in that ſenſe. And to be Perfect in a lower kind is but to have all the parts and faculties that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſuch a being, in that order, diſpoſition, and all other circumſtances which are ſuitable to its <hi>Idea,</hi> and proper for its reſpective ends. And in this ſenſe I think all things are perfect in their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; according to what your Grace ſaith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108911:72"/>
That [God cannot create any Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, being abſolute Perfection himſelf] which appoſitely fits mine, but I can not ſee how it ſo well conſiſts with your Graces former aſſertion, except it be intended to infer, <hi>That God made nothing;</hi> a Propoſition which methinks your Grace ſhould not own; but ſome things that follow ſeem to look that way, when you are pleaſed to ſay [Neither can I conceive how God could actually make or act any thing, either in a Mechanical manner, or a Free, being not locally moving] To which I humbly ſay that if your Grace doubts the poſſibility of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation out of nothing, I think I can ſpeak ſome things as a Philoſopher, that may render it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. Nor is actual motion in the Deity neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to his actions, ſince he is Immenſe and needs not local motion to render him preſent by his Eſſence, or his Virtue, to any place of the great Univerſe, being Eternally there by the Infinity of his being, and his Power. And whereas your Grace is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſay, that God is no Mechanick, I conſent that He is not ſo properly, in that he needs not material Inſtruments to act by. But yet he hath made all things by a kind of Geometry; in Number, Weight, and Meaſure, ſaith the <hi>Holy Oracle.</hi> And there is a ſort of Mathematicks in all the Works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Madam,</hi> I have made bold with your <hi>Graces</hi> Patience, in confidence of your Candor, and your goodneſs, which I implore, for the Pardon of this Voluminous Trouble. And in order to it, I have this to ſay, that I could not well have ſaid leſs without having been wanting in ſome of your <hi>Graces</hi> Periods; and there is ſomething elſe, in which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108911:73"/>
I deſpair of being ever able to ſay enough, and that is, to expreſs how much I am,</p>

                  <p>I Well know that the Generous never propoſe to themſelves any other End of their Favours, beſides Content, which neceſſarily reſults from the purſuance of their own Noble Inclinations, but only the Benefit of the Perſons, upon whom they chooſe to confer them: and that therefore they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſelect ſuch Subjects, whereon to exerciſe their Beneficence, that ſeem more likely to husband it, by a ſilent Devotion, and modeſt Acknowledgment, than to abuſe it, by attempting a Retribution. And this, <hi>Madam,</hi> both teacheth and aſſureth me; that though the Favour you were pleaſed to do me, in ſending me one of your admirable Books, newly publiſhed, under the Elegant and moſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date Title of <hi>The WORLDS OLIO;</hi> be ſo eminent an one, as to require from me a more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Expreſſion of my Gratitude, than either my Wit, or Fortune, or Intereſt can ever be able to make: yet none can be more acceptable to you,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108911:73"/>
than this, <hi>That I intend ever to continue your Debtor.</hi> So much, therefore, I here ſolemnly profeſs; and moſt faithfully promiſe you, that I never will, ſo much as in a wiſh for a Capacity of Retaliation, prophane the Freedom of the Obligation your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs moved you to lay upon me.</p>
                  <p>But, not to ſtate the Particulars of my Debt, at leaſt in brief; might give you juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that I underſtand not the Value of what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. And, therefore, I humbly ask your leave, that I may acknowledge to you, that you have highly benefited me, in my <hi>Reputation,</hi> in my <hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay you have benefited me in my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;</hi> in that you have declared me capable of ſo ſingular an Honour, as to be in the number of thoſe Perſons, whom you thought worthy to receive ſo rich a Preſent, from ſo Noble a Hand. For me to have ſat among the Multitude, whom your Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner invites to feaſt upon your <hi>OLIO,</hi> had been proportionable enough to the degree of ſo ordinary a Judgement, as mine: but to be among thoſe few, whom your ſelf had nominated for your Chief Gueſts, was a Grace infinitely above my Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have benefited my <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> in that your <hi>Philoſophical Phancies</hi> have furniſhed me with variety of ſuch Novel Conceipts, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſundry the moſt difficult Problems in Nature; as that if my Memory be but faithful enough to retain them, I ſhall never be unprovided of ſomwhat that is poynant and grateful, to entertain Curioſity withall: and whenever my own Reaſon is at a loſs, how to inveſtigate the Cauſes of ſome Natural Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108911:74"/>
or other, I ſhall relieve the Company with ſome one pleaſant and unheard of Conjecture of yours. So that by reading of your <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> I have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus much of advantage; that where I cannot Satisfy, I ſhall be ſure to Delight: which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than I dare promiſe from any other Diſcourſes of the ſame Title; in ſo much as they generally leave the Mind in a kind of Anxiety and Regret, when ever they fail to afford it Satisfaction. And, certainly, if it be (as ſome hold) reaſonable to allow, that the Fictions of Poets, and Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſts do uſually take as ſtrong hold of mens Minds, and Charm their Affections as powerfully, as the moſt Authentique Narrations of Hiſtorians; though the Reader well underſtands the Paſſages related by theſe, to be certain Truths, and the adventures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Thoſe, to be meerly Imaginary; and this, becauſe Delight is equal on both ſides: if this, I ſay, be juſtifiable, that man can run but little hazard of his Judgement, who ſhall affirm, that your Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Fayeries in the Brain, and of our Thoughts being their Conſults and Suggeſtions; and your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Fayeries digging for Stones in the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Teeth, to repair their decay'd Tenements in the Head, is the Cauſe of the Tooth-ach; are as worthy the hearing, as the moſt ſolid demonſtrative Theory of any Philoſopher whatever; inſomuch as theſe may yield both as high and laſting a Delight as that. I ſay Delight as High and Laſting; for, to ſpeak my Thoughts clearly, the Pleaſure that ariſeth from the comprehenſion of the moſt perfect and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious Demonſtration in <hi>Geometry,</hi> I never could find, either in height or duration, much to exceed that, which I have ſometime been affected withall,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108911:74"/>
at the recital of a Facetious Poetical Extravagancy, of which I had not afore heard. Nor do I believe, that the Raptures, and Exultations of <hi>Don Quixot</hi> were much inferior to that famous one of <hi>Archimed,</hi> which tranſported him out of himſelf, as well as out of the Bath, into a loud Exclamation, <hi>I have found it, I have found it.</hi> And the Reaſon of this Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity may be well enough thought, to conſiſt chiefly in the unſatisfiedneſs of our Nature, which always hurrying our Minds on to Novelties, cauſeth us to put an equally cheap rate upon all things we think already in the poſſeſſion of our Underſtanding; and to value acqueſt of a freſh, though perhaps uſeleſs, and abſurd Opinion, above the calm fruition of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and irregular Maxims. But, this <hi>(Madam)</hi> being a Paradox, ought to have more room, than can be ſpred in a Letter, whoſe deſign'd Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Thankfulneſs: and beſides, ſhould I adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture further, to avouch it, the ſame could not but much redound to my diſadvantage; inſomuch as it might render me ſuſpected for ſomething of a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and conſequently incapable of the Honour and Pleaſure of ſometimes attending you, and hearing your more than ingenious Diſcourſes. For as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, in one of your Prefaces, or Epiſtles to your Readers, you have been pleaſed expreſly to declare; <hi>That you never Converſed, ſo much as one Hour, with any Philoſopher, or Profeſſed Scholar, in your whole Life:</hi> and that, doubtleſs, muſt have proceeded from your conſtant Averſion to ſuch blunt Company; not from your want of opportunities to hear what they could ſay. Becauſe, being always Educated among the Nobleſt, and moſt Knowing Perſons of our Nation; you could hardly eſcape the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108911:75"/>
of the moſt Learned in all the Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; unleſs you purpoſely withdrew your ſelf from their Society, or ſhut your Ears againſt their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Madam,</hi> among thoſe, who have peruſed your Writings, I meet with a ſort of Infidels, who refuſe to believe, that you have alwayes preſerved your ſelf ſo free from the Contagion of Books, and Book-men. And the Reaſon they give me, is this; that you frequently uſe many Terms of the Schools, and ſometimes ſeem to have Imp'd the Wings of your high-flying Phanſy with ſundry Feathers ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Univerſities, or Neſts of <hi>Divines, Philoſophers, Phiſicians, Geometricians, Aſtronomers,</hi> and the reſt of the Gowned Tribe. For inſtance, of <hi>Divines,</hi> when you ſpeak of <hi>Praedeſtination, Free will, Tranſubſtantiation, &amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> when you mention <hi>Quantity, Diſcrete</hi> and <hi>Continued,</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> and <hi>Firſt Matter, Attoms, Elements, Motion, Dilatation,</hi> and <hi>Contraction, Rarefaction,</hi> and <hi>Cenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Meteors, &amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> when you diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of <hi>Choler, Phlegme, Melancholy,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and ſpeak of the <hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> of <hi>Venricles</hi> in the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Brain,</hi> of <hi>Veins, Arteries,</hi> and <hi>Nerves,</hi> and expatiate upon <hi>Fevers, Apoplexies, Convulſions, Droqſies,</hi> and divers other Diſeaſes, with their particular Cauſes, Symptoms, and Cures: Of <hi>Geometricians,</hi> when you touch upon <hi>Triangles, Squares, Circles, Diameters, Circumferences, Centres, Lines,</hi> ſtreight and crooked, and their proportions each to other, and that invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Problem, the <hi>Quadrature of the Circle:</hi> Of <hi>Aſtronomers,</hi> when you ſpeak of the <hi>Horizon, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, Aequator, Zodiack, Ecliptick, Tropicks, Poles of the World,</hi> and of the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> and in a manner
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108911:75"/>
run over the whole Doctrine of the Sphere, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the model of the Univerſe, and caſt ſome tranſitory glances alſo upon the Doctrine Theorical concerning the Motions of the Orbs, and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. Nor can I, indeed, hope to diſſolve the ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe mens unbelief; untill I ſhall be better able to convince them, that all theſe Scholaſtical Terms and Notions may be brought into the World with us, and afterwards drawn forth of the Soul, by ſolitary Meditation, and the labour of ones own Thoughts; and are not rather inſtilled into it, and impreſt upon it, by often Hearing, or Reading the Diſcourſes of others, who profeſs thoſe Arts and Sciences to which they belong, and for the more plain and methodical teaching whereof, they were firſt Invented and Recorded. But I fear me, while I inſiſt thus particularly upon the Reaſon alleadged by theſe men, in defence of their Diffidence, I may fall into the ſame danger, for the avoidance of which, I even now left my Paradox deſtitute of Aſſertion: and therefore I lay by that ſubject, and take up another more opportune and conſiderable, as to the diſcharge of my Duty, and confeſſing how many wayes you have obliged me.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge, therefore, in the laſt place; that my <hi>Affections</hi> muſt own you for their Benefactreſs. For thoſe many Moral Apothegms, and Satyrical Remarques upon the Manners of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which you have frequently inſperſed upon the Leaves of your Book, are ſo pathetically delivered, and with ſuch vigour of proper and familiar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage preſſ'd home to the Boſome of every man; as that that perſon muſt be irrecover ably loſt in the darkneſs of Vice, who doth not, through thhm, clearly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108911:76"/>
diſcern the Luſtre and Amiableneſs of Virtue, and thereupon inſtantly abominate his former Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and become your perfect Proſelite. When a Young, Noble, Beautiful, Witty, and Sprightly Lady, one on whom all the Pleaſures of the World ſeem to be Enamoured, and in throngs offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be accepted and commanded by her; when ſuch an one, I ſay is heard to Preach up <hi>Temperance, Abstinence, Modeſty, Chaſtity, Solitude,</hi> and the ſuppreſſion of all irregular ſenſual Appetites. What <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> is there, who muſt not bluſh at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Vicious Acts, and being convinced, that the delights of a Soul, well ordered according to the rules of Virtue and Honour, are infinitely more charming and deſirable, than the moſt magnified Pleaſures of the Body, ſwimming in an Ocean of Luxury, and Laciviouſneſs; firmly reſolve with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, thenceforth to ſeek for Felicity, not in the ſhort Titillations and Blandiſhments of the Senſes, but in the Purity and conſtant Serenity of the Mind. Is it poſſible, that any of our Ladies, ſhould retain her pretences of <hi>Platonick Love,</hi> or continue the practiſe of her petty Arts of Daubing and Painting, of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, Mediſanſe, and Detraction: after ſhe hath once read your ſmart Invectives againſt them, and ſolid Arguments to ſhew, that they may all be juſtly ſuſpected for Bawds to procure and conceal the fruition of that Pleaſure, which doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the admiring converſation of Souls, but in the cloſe Conjunction of Bodies, and the ſatisfaction of that rank Appetite of the Fleſh, commonly called Luſt? In a word; what Sex, Age, Conſtitution, Condition is there, whoſe moſt ſecret Ulcers, the ſharpneſs of your Wit and Pen hath not launced
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108911:76"/>
open to the bottom; and afterward preſcribed moſt eaſy and certain Remedies for the Cure of them? So that I may well conclude this Paragraph with ſaying that your Moral Eſſayes contain wiſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts enough in them, for the Reformation of the Age we live in, and that, certainly, is ſo bad that no Man need ever fear a worſe.</p>
                  <p>And, now, Incomparable <hi>Madam,</hi> having done my Homage to you, in token of what I hold by the tenure of your Wit and Bounty, it remains, that I humbly beg your Pardon for the rude and tedious manner of it. And that, I hope, you will grant me, when you have conſidered, that the Devotion may be ſincere, where the Ceremonies are imperfect; and I have aſſured you, that I will never omit to pay you thoſe Dues of Thanks, and conſtant Obſervance, that belong to you, from me, as one whom your Goodneſs hath made,</p>

                  <p>SEeing your <hi>Graces</hi> ſingular Genius, hath long ſince been experienced, and fully diſcovered to us; for ſuch as is both accompliſh'd with all various Learning, and furniſhed with a Native Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie; that for its high abilities, it is able; and for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108911:77"/>
its eminent Candor, it uſually obtains infinitely upon the favourers of Learning: We obliged on both theſe accounts, were unwilling to incurr ſo great a Crime, as not chearfully to Conſecrate to your <hi>Grace,</hi> theſe our Acknowledgments, as Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Eternal Obſervance. Your <hi>Graces</hi> goodneſs having this, peculiar and above others, that 'tis neither forced by Solicitations of Friends, nor Importunities of Petitions, but voluntary and of its own accord flowes out, and delivers it ſelf. Truely every more than ordinary Spirit is powerfully drawn out to what is like it ſelf, invites, embraceth, and preſerves, whatever bears the name of any kind of Excellency, as allyed to it.

and profound Speculations. It muſt neceſſary, be that that moſt capacious Soul of your <hi>Grace,</hi> expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating it ſelf ſo far into all ſorts of Learning, is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired; that almoſt Infinite Comprehenſion of ſo many and ſo great Notions informes us, how great a meaſure of the Heavenly Spirit hath poſſeſt your <hi>Grace;</hi> and that no ſingle Deity hath enlarged this one Soul unto the Immenſe Tracts of all the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. With theſe happy Omens hath your <hi>Grace</hi> reached unto, whatever in the Arts ſeemed good unto your <hi>Grace</hi> when ſome Diviner <hi>Genius</hi> of your <hi>Grace</hi> our Princeſs, judged the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any clear Truth, would be beneficial. And whereas it was your <hi>Graces</hi> Work, not to give Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but Magiſterially to Prononce, as from an Oracle; (yet ſuch is your <hi>Graces</hi> condeſcention) that all your <hi>Graces</hi> Tenets are aſſerted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with moſt Cogent Arguments: as if we did not owe a Belief, and had not a certain Devotion obliging our Aſſent to your <hi>Graces</hi> bare Aſſertion. Henceforth therefore do we Deſtine our ſpare hours unto theſe kinds of Studies, and are reaching unto the perfection of Philoſophy, ſeeing your <hi>Grace</hi> hath judged theſe Speculations ſuch as are worthy your <hi>Graces</hi> Intentions, and nearer <hi>Approximations:</hi> for ſuch an happy clearneſs of Wit ſhall render every theng diſcoverable and fully to be comprehended, and that moſt free inclinination of your <hi>Graces</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor will communicate every thing diſcovered to your <hi>Graces Cantabrigians.</hi> Yet leſt we ſhould give our ſelves up to unworthy Eaſe, and Conſecrate our ſelves to Sloth, your <hi>Grace</hi> hath left us one very difficult Task, namely Thankfulneſs.

                  <l>HEnceforth be Dumb, ye Oracles of Wit;</l>
                  <l>Ye humbly muſt to Fate ſubmit:</l>
                  <l>How ſoon muſt ye decline! How low muſt fall!</l>
                  <l>Since She is gone who did Inſpire ye all?</l>
                  <l>Her Books are the beſt Patterns for the Pen,</l>
                  <l>Her Perſon was the beſt of Subjects too;</l>

In Wit and Senſe She did excel all Men;</l>
                  <l>And all her Sex in Virtue did outgoe.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Though Grief affords ſome Floquence,</l>
                  <l>Henceforth expect but little Senſe;</l>
                  <l>For, ſince ſhe's gone, all we can do</l>
                  <l>Will but the Pangs of Dying-writers ſhow.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>VVhen the bright Ruler of the Day</l>
                  <l>Th'<hi>Horizon</hi> of his Preſence has bereft</l>
                  <l>Some feeble ſtreaks of Light are left,</l>
                  <l>Yet darkneſs ſoon muſt come, and all that light decay.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Our Sun's forever ſet, we have no hope</l>
                  <l>Of this as of the other Sun's return:</l>
                  <l>VVe all in Darkneſs muſt forever grope,</l>
                  <l>And we for ever muſt in Tears her abſence mourn.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Philoſophers</hi> muſt wander in the dark;</l>
                  <l>Now they of Truth can find no certain mark;</l>
                  <l>Since She their ſureſt Guide is gone away,</l>
                  <l>They cannot chuſe but miſerably ſtray.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>All did depend on Her, but She on none,</l>
                  <l>For her <hi>Philoſophy</hi> was all her own.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>She never did to the poor Refuge fly</l>

                  </l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>She could a Reaſon for each Cauſe preſent,</l>
                  <l>Not truſting wholly to Experiment,</l>
                  <l>No Principles from others ſhe purloyn'd,</l>
                  <l>But wiſely Practice ſhe with Speculation joyn'd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>None was more good, and once none was more fair:</l>
                  <l>She was not as moſt of her frail Sex are;</l>
                  <l>Who 'ave Fruitful <hi>Wombs</hi> but Baren <hi>Brains,</hi>
                  </l>

Though we no Iſſue of her Body find</l>
