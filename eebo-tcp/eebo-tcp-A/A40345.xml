            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OH People! my Bowels yearn, my Bowels yearn towards you, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in any meaſure are after the Lord: O that you would now (I SAY, THAT YOU WOULD NOW) return with all your hearts unto Him, and obey the Voice of his Power in you; then ſhould you be made able to ſtand, and endure the fiery Tryal which is come and coming. Oh! the Day haſtens wherein all Profeſſion that is not grounded in the Life and Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (what ever the ſhew of it be) will be ſo ſhaken, that an utter (I SAY, AN UTTER) blaſting and withering ſhall come upon it; and for that cauſe the Lord doth, and will yet ſuffer Great Tryals (YEA, I SAY, GREAT TRYALS) to come both upon the Profeſſors and Poſſeſſors of his Name; that ſo his Children (the <hi>Poſſeſſors</hi>) may be manifeſted unto all, and diſcerned from all that are but <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> though never ſo fair and ſeemingly covered: for all Coverings, but what is of the Power and Spirit it ſelf, ſhall be too narrow; and all that are not covered with the Spirit and Power of <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> their ſhame and nakedneſs ſhall appear more and more.</p>
            <p>This is the Teſtimony which the Spirit and Word of Truth giveth; therefore he that hath an ear to hear, let him hear, before the Day of his Viſitation be wholly paſt, and the things belonging to his peace be hid from his eyes: for yet a little while and the voice ſhall be, <hi>He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill</hi>; for the Spirit of the Lord ſhall not alwayes ſtrive with fleſh, but his Plagues and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be poured out upon ſuch as will not be gathered in the Day of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Long-forbearence, and Free-love; and he or ſhe that loveth Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Husband, Wife, Children, Houſe or Land, Liberty, Honour, or any thing more than the Life of the Lamb, ſhall be counted not wortthy of Him, and plainly manifeſted ſo to be. Reade this who can; and he that can receive it, let him: for the time draweth nigh (YEA, I SAY, THE TIME IS COME) that theſe Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings muſt be fulfilled.</p>
