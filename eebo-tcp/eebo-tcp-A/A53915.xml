         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE</head>
            <p>WOMAN of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is the Faireſt and
moſt Beautiful, kind Nature hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beſtow'd on her a delicate
and fine habit of Body, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
her only for an eaſie Life,
and to perform the tender Offices
of Love; whereas, ſhe compos'd
Man of more robuſt Principles,
that he might be able to protect
the Woman, to delve and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
the Earth, and to undergo
the other Toils of Life.</p>
            <p>But by reaſon of this Curious
Frame, the Fair Sex (as other
<pb facs="tcp:63569:3"/>
fine things are) is ſubject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Injuries, for beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Calamities, there are many
great and dangerous Diſeaſes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to Women ariſing from
their Conſtitutions, monthly Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
Pregnancy, Labours and
Lying in.</p>
            <p>Their Conſtitution diſpoſes
them to Hyſteric Diſeaſes, which
reſemble almoſt all the Diſeaſes
Mankind is ſubject to, <hi>viz.</hi> An
<hi>Apoplexy, Epilepſie, Palpitation of
the Heart, Coughs, Violent Vomiting,
Colick, Stone in the Kidnies,</hi> and
many other. Pains and ſometimes
Swellings in the Jaws, Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Hands, Thighs and Legs
accompany theſe Diſeaſes. Nor
can the Teeth free themſelves
from this Diſeaſe: but the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:63569:3"/>
cmomon Pain, is the Pain of the
Back. A dejection of Mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
accompanies this Diſeaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</p>
            <p>A Suppreſſion or Immoderate
Flux of the Courſes, cauſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diſorders in the Body, ſo alſo
does their Flowing before their
due time, or their ſtaying longer
than they ſhould, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
with other Diſeaſes
renders the Cure difficult.</p>
            <p>All the time their being with
Child, which is a nine Months
Sickneſs, they are inclined to
Nauſeouſneſs, Vomiting, to
Pains of the Back, Reins, and
Hips, violent Coughs, Swellings
of the Legs and Thighs, Piles,
and many other Diſeaſes, and
upon ſome Indiſpoſitions of the
<pb facs="tcp:63569:4"/>
Body to Miſcarriage, which is
the worſt and moſt dangerous of
all. When they are in Labour,
and when they lie in, they are
encompaſſed with many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and dangers, <hi>viz.</hi> an ill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the Child, ſuppreſſion
of the Lochia, Floodings, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
after Pains, Apoſtemations
of the Breaſts, and many other
Diſeaſes. So that if Nature had
not wiſely tacked an Appetite to
things neceſſary, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
the Preſervation of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
and of Species too would
not have been near ſo well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided

            <p>The following Treatiſe is a
Collection from <hi>Rodericus a Caſtro</hi>
and others, that have wrote well
of Womens Diſeaſes, and I judge
<pb facs="tcp:63569:4"/>
it may be ſerviceable to Ladies and
Gentlewomen, who charitably
diſpence Phyſick, and give advice
to their poor Neighbours in the
Country, where there is no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
near; and it may be alſo
of uſe to Phyſicians, Chyrugeons
and Midwives, it being a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Treatiſe of Womens Diſeaſes
and the Methods and Medicines
contained in it, being approved
and frequently practiſed by the
moſt Renowned Authors of each
Phyſical Province.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Hyſteric Diſeaſe.</head>
               <p>THIS Diſeaſe proceeds from a
weakneſs and confuſion of the
Spirits, and is not only very
frequent, but alſo ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
various, that it reſembles almoſt all
Diſeaſes Mankind is ſubject to: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hard Labour, or ſome great diſturbance
of the Mind, it occaſions an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> which
ends in a <hi>Palſie</hi> of half the Body. Sometimes
it produces violent <hi>Convulſions</hi> very like
the <hi>Falling-Sickneſs,</hi> and theſe are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call'd <hi>Mother-fits.</hi> Sometimes it poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the outward part of the head, cauſing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63569:8"/>
violent pain continually fixt in one part,
which may be cover'd with the top of the
Thumb, and violent Vomiting accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
this pain. It alſo occaſions ſometimes
a great Palpitation of the Heart, and
ſometimes the Woman coughs without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion,
but ſpits up nothing. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ruſhing violently upon the region
under the Heart, it cauſes violent pain
much like the twiſting of the Guts, and
the Woman Vomits exceedingly, and caſts
up a green Matter, and ſometimes Matter
of an unuſual Colour; and often after the
Sick have been almoſt deſtroy'd by the ſaid
pain, and the reachings to Vomit, it is at
length carried off by the <hi>Jaundice</hi> tinctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſurface of the Body like Saffron.
The Sick is much dejected, and Deſpair as
certainly accompanies this kind of Hyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic
Diſeaſe, as the Pain and Vomiting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mention'd. When this Diſeaſe falls
upon one of the Kidnies, it plainly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
by the pain it cauſes there a fit of the
<hi>Stone;</hi> and it is difficult to diſtinguiſh it
from the <hi>Stone,</hi> unleſs perchance ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
accident diſturbing the Womans
mind a little before ſhe was taken ill, ſhews
that it was an Hyſteric Diſeaſe. Nor is
the Bladder free from this falſe Symptom;
for it does not only cauſe pain there, but
it alſo ſtops the Urin. Sometimes falling
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63569:8"/>
upon the Stomach it cauſes continual Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
and ſometimes a Looſneſs when it
is ſettled upon the Guts, but no pain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies
either of theſe Symptoms.</p>
               <p>And as this Diſeaſe afflicts almoſt all the
inward parts, ſo ſometimes it ſeizes all the
outward parts, occaſioning pain, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Swelling in the Jaws, Shoulders,
Hands, Thighs, Legs; but the Swelling of
the Legs is plainer ſeen than the reſt, and
contrary to Swellings in the Dropſie, is
moſt in the Morning; nor being preſſed
does it leave a pit, and moſt commonly it
ſwells only one of the Legs. Nor can
the Teeth free themſelves from the aſſaults
of this Diſeaſe, tho they are not hollow;
and tho there is no apparent Defluction,
that may occaſion the pain, yet it is no
whit gentler nor ſhorter nor eaſier Cured.
But the pain of the Back is moſt common,
which moſt certainly all feel, how little
ſoever they are afflicted with this Diſeaſe.
Moreover this is common to the foreſaid
pains, that the place whereon they were,
is tender and akes as if it were ſoundly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but this tenderneſs goes off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
And this is worth obſerving, that
often a notable coldneſs of the outward
parts makes way for theſe Symptoms,
which for the moſt part does not go off
till the fit ends; which coldneſs is almoſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63569:9"/>
like that wherewith a Carcaſs grows ſtiff,
yet the Pulſe is good. Moreover all Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric
Women complain of a dejection
and ſinking of the Spirits, and ſometimes
laugh exceſſively, and at other times cry
as much, without any real cauſe for either.
But the moſt proper and almoſt inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Symptom, is a Urin as clear as Rock-water.
Sometimes ill fumes are belched
up, and ſometimes the Wind that comes
from the Stomach is ſower juſt like Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
But their Minds are more affected
than their Bodies; for an incurable Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is mixt with the very nature of the
Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>A day would ſcarce be ſufficient to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
up all the Symptoms belonging to this
Diſeaſe, and I think <hi>Demetrius</hi> reckn'd
pretty right, tho he miſtook the cauſe of
the Diſeaſe, when he ſaid, in an Epiſtle
to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that the Womb was the
cauſe of Six hundred Miſeries and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Calamities. The external cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of this Diſeaſe are either violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Body, or which is much oftner,
vehement diſturbances of the Mind; to
theſe diſorders of the Mind which are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the occaſion of this Diſeaſe, is to be
added emptineſs of the Stomach by reaſon
of long faſting, inmmoderate Bleeding, a
Vomit or Purge that works too much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63569:9"/>
In order to the cure, I order that eight
Ounces of Blood be taken from the right
Arm, and that the following Plaiſter be
apply'd to the Navel.</p>
               <p>Take of Galbanum diſſolved in Tincture of
Caſtor and ſtrain'd three Drachms, of Tacama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haca
two Drams, mix them, make a Plaiſter.</p>
               <p>The next Morning let her uſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Pills.</p>
               <p>Take of the Pill Coch-major two Scruples,
of Caſtor powder'd two Grains, of Peruvian
Balſam four drops, make four Pills; let her
take them at five in the Morning, and ſleep
after; repeat them twice or thrice, every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or every other Morning, according to the
Womans ſtrength, and as they work.</p>
               <p>Take of the Waters of Black-Cherries, Rhue,
and Compound Briony, each three Ounces; of
Caſtor ty'd up in a rag, and hanged in the Viol
half a Dram; of Fine Sugar a Sufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
make a Julep, whereof let her take four
or five Spoonfulls when ſhe is faint, dropping
into the firſt doſe, if the fit is violent, twenty
drops of the Spirit of Harts-horn.</p>
               <p>After the Purging Pills juſt deſcribed are
taken, let her uſe the following.</p>
               <p>Take of the filings of Steel eight Grains,
with a ſufficient quantity of extract of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
make two Pills, let her take them early
in the Morning, and at five in the Afternoon,
for Thirty days, drinking upon them a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63569:10"/>
draught of Wormwood Wine. Or if ſhe like a
Bolus better;</p>
               <p>Take of the Conſerves of Roman Wormwood,
and of the yellow peel of Oranges each one
Ounce, of Angelica and Nutmegs candied and
of Venice Treacle each half an Ounce, of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
Ginger two Drachms, make an electuary
with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Oranges.</p>
               <p>Take of this electuary one Drachm and an
half, of the filings of Steel well rub'd eight
Grains, make a Bolus with a ſufficient quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Syrup of Oranges, to be taken in the
Morning, and at five in the Evening, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it a Glaſs of Wormwood-wine.</p>
               <p>Take of choice Myrrh and Galbanum each
one Drachm and an half, of Caſtor fifteen
Grains, with a ſufficient quantity of Balſam
Peru, make twelve Pills of every Drachm; let her
take three every Night, and drink upon them
three or four Spoonfuls of Compound Briony
Water through the whole courſe of this proceſs.</p>
               <p>But if theſe Pills move the Body, which
ſometimes they do in Bodies that are very
eaſily purged, the following may be uſed
inſtead of them.</p>
               <p>Take of Caſtor one Drachm, of Volatile Salt
of Amber half a Drachm, with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of extract of Rue, make twenty-four
ſmall Pills, let her take three every Night.</p>
               <p>But Steel Medicines, which muſt be noted,
occaſion ſometimes in Women great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63569:10"/>
both of Body and Mind, and not
only on the firſt days, which is uſual almoſt
in every body, but alſo all the time they
are taken: In this caſe the uſe of Steel muſt
not preſently be interrupted, but Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
muſt be given every night for ſome
time in ſome Hyſteric water that they may
the better bear it.</p>
               <p>But when the Symptoms are mild, and
it ſeems the buſineſs may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Steel, I think it ſufficient to Bleed and
to Purge three or four times, and then to
give the altering Hyſteric Pills above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
morning and evening for ten days,
which method ſeldom fails, when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
is not violent, yea the Pills alone
Bleeding and Purging being omitted, do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a great deal of good.</p>
               <p>But ſome Women can't bear Hyſteric
Medicines, and are much injured thereby,
therefore they muſt not be given to ſuch.</p>
               <p>If the Blood is ſo very feeble, and the
confuſion of the Spirits ſo great, that Steel
ordered to be uſed according to the method
preſcribed is not ſufficient to cure the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
the Sick muſt drink <hi>Tunbridge</hi>-waters
or the like, for they cure Diſeaſes more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
than any preparation of Iron; but
if in drinking of them any Sickneſs happen
that belongs to Hyſteric Symptoms, the
Sick muſt forbear drinking them a day or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63569:11"/>
two, till that Symptom that hindred their
paſſage is quite gon. And it is to be noted,
that Purging muſt be avoided all the time
the Woman drinks theſe waters. But if
this Diſeaſe does not yeild to Steel-waters,
the Sick muſt go to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and when ſhe
has uſed the waters of it three mornings
following, the next day let her go into the
<hi>Bath,</hi> and the day following let her drink
them again, and ſo let her do by turns for
two months, for in theſe and others of what
kind ſoever they are, the Patient muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in the uſe of them till ſhe is quite well:
<hi>Venice-treacle</hi> uſed often and a long time is
a great remedy in this Diſeaſe. Spaniſh-wine,
with Gentian, Angelica, Worm-wood,
Centory, and other ſtrengthening
things infus'd in it, does a great deal of good,
ſome ſpoonfuls of it being taken thrice a
day, if the Woman be not thin and of a
cholerick habit of Body. And truly a large
draught of Spaniſh-wine taken by it ſelf at
bed-time for ſome nights has been very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to ſome Women. Jeſuits-powder
alſo wonderfully comforts and invigorates
the Blood and Spirits, a Scruple of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken morning and evening for ſome
weeks.</p>
               <p>But if the Remedies above-mentioned
don't well agree, which often happens in
thin and choleric Conſtitutions, then a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63569:11"/>
Milk-dyet may be uſed, for ſome Women
(which one would wonder at at firſt) that
have been a long while afflicted with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteric
Diſeaſes, and could be relieved no
other way, have been recovered by Diet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves for ſome time only with
Milk; and eſpecially thoſe that Labour
with an Hyſteric Cholick, which can't be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed
by any thing but Opiates, to which
repeated Women are much accuſtom'd,
the pains returning as ſoon as the vertue
of the Opiate fades. But riding on Horſe
back or in a Coach every day for a long
while is the beſt remedy.</p>
               <p>This is the general way of Curing this
Diſeaſe, which is apply'd to the original
cauſe, namely, the weak conſtitution of
the Blood, and ſo is to be uſed only when
the Fit is off, therefore as often as the Fit
comes join'd with any one of the fore-ſaid
Symptoms, if the Diſeaſe be ſuch or ſo great
an one that it will not bear a Truce till it
may be cured by Medicines that ſtrengthen
the Blood and Spirits, we muſt preſently
make uſe of Hyſteric Medicines, which
by their ſtrong and offenſive ſmell, recall
the diſorderly and deſerting Spirits to their
proper Stations; whether they are taken
inwardly or ſmelt to, or outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
ſuch are Aſſa-faetida, Galbanum, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Sal Armoniac, and laſtly whatever
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63569:12"/>
has a very ungrateful and offenſive ſmell.</p>
               <p>In the next place you muſt take notice,
that if ſome intollerable pain accompanied
the fit, or violent Vomiting, or a Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
then beſides the Hyſterics above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
Laudanum is to be uſed, which
is only able to reſtrain theſe Symptomes.
But in quieting the pains which Vomiting
occaſion we muſt take great care that they
are not mitigated either by Laudanum or
any other Opiat before due evacuations
have been made, unleſs they exceed almoſt
all humane patience. Therefore in luſty
Women and ſuch as abound with Blood a
Vein muſt be opened, and the Body purged,
eſpecially if they have been lately ſeized
with the fit. But if weak Women and thoſe
of a quite contrary Conſtitution labour with
ſuch a fit and pain, and have been afflicted
with it not long ago, it will be ſufficient to
cleanſe their Stomachs with a gallon of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
drink taken in and ejected by Vomiting,
and then to give a large Doſe of Venice-Treacle,
and a few ſpoonfuls of ſome Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
Liquor, that is pleaſing to the taſte,
with a few drops of Liquid Laudanum, to
be taken preſently after. But if the Sick
has Vomited a great while, and there is
danger leſt by a further provocation by
Vomits the Spirits ſhould be put into a rage,
and the Sick too much weakened, in this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63569:12"/>
caſe you muſt give Laudanum without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
and ſuch a Doſe that is ſufficient to
vanquiſh it.</p>
               <p>But here two things are to be chiefly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
firſt that when you have once begun
to uſe Laudanum after due and neceſſary
evacuations, it muſt be taken in the ſame
Doſe, and muſt be often repeated till the
Symptom is quite conquered: only ſuch a
ſpace muſt be betwixt each Doſe, that we
may know what the former has done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we give another: and then when we
treat the Diſeaſe with Laudanum, we muſt
do nothing elſe, and nothing muſt be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated,
for the gentleſt Gliſter of milk and
ſugar is ſufficient to ſpoil whatever has
been repaired by the Laudanum, and to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
a return of the Vomiting and pain.
But though the Pains above mentioned are
apt to overcome the vertue of the Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
yet violent Vomiting indicats the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
Doſe of it, and that it ſhould be very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
repeated, for by reaſon of the Vomiting,
the Laudanum is caſt up before it can do
any good, unleſs it be given afreſh after
every time the Sick Vomits, and chiefly in
a ſolid form, and if it be given in a liquor
the quantity muſt be ſo ſmall that it muſt
but juſt wet the Stomach, ſo that by reaſon
of the ſmall quantity of the matter it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be caſt up, for inſtance, ſome drops
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63569:13"/>
of Liquid Laudanum in one ſpoonful of
ſtrong Cinnamon-water, or the like; and the
Sick muſt be admoniſhed to keep her ſelf
quiet preſently after taking the Laudanum,
and that ſhe keep her Head as much as is
poſſible immoveable, for the ſmalleſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Head provokes Vomiting more
than any thing elſe; and when the Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ceaſes, and is as it were tam'd, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
to give a Doſe of Laudanum morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and evening to prevent a relapſe, which
alſo ought to be obſerved after a Looſneſs,
or Hyſteric pains.</p>
               <p>And becauſe frequent mention has been
made of Liquid Laudanum in this Chapter,
and it is much uſed in other Diſeaſes Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are ſubject to, I will here ſet down
the beſt way of making it.</p>
               <p>Take of Spaniſh-wine one pint, of Opium two
ounces, of Saffron one ounce, of the Powders of
Cinnamon and Cloves each one Drachm; let them
be infuſed together in a Bath for two or three
days, till the liquor comes to the conſiſtence of a
thin Syrup; ſtrain it and keep it for uſe. The
Doſe is ſixteen or twenty Drops, to be taken in
a ſmall draught of Beer, or in ſome diſtilled-water.</p>

               <p>THE Green-ſickneſs is an ill habit of the
Body proceeding from Obſtructions,
it is accompanied moſt commonly with a
beating of the Heart, difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and a longing for abſurd things, and
an unfitneſs for motion, and other Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms;
the Face and whole Body are pale,
and ſometimes of a leaden and green colour,
there is an inflation, and as it were a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the Eye-lids; the Legs alſo ſwell,
eſpecially about the Ankles; there is a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and often a laſting pain of the Head, the
Pulſe is quick, the Sick are drowſie, and
have an averſion for wholſome food; laſtly,
the Diſeaſe increaſing and the Obſtructions

Diſeaſe is confirmed.</p>
               <p>This Diſeaſe moſt commonly is not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,

               <p>THE flux of the Courſes is an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſign that a Woman is mature, yet
there are ſome Women that never had them,
tho' they have had converſation with their
Husbands, and ſome of them have had
Children, and others not; ſome of them
have enjoyed good health, and others have
been ſickly: the cauſe of this defect is in
general two-fold, the firſt is common to
the whole Body, namely, becauſe a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is fleſhy, laborious, and her parts
are ſo diſpoſed that every Member takes up
and expels what is convenient for it, ſo
that there is no room for a menſtruous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
theſe are of a hot Conſtitution and
ſuch as are termed Virago's, they are of a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63569:14"/>
brown Colour, of a compact Body, and
their Loins and Buttocks are large, ſo are
the Breaſts and Shoulders, they have a great
voice, are ſtrong and hairy, and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
tho' it be the reaſon that Women
are in health, yet it is contrary to their
Sex, and the Courſe of Nature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be accounted vitious. But other
Women are ſickly upon this account.</p>
               <p>If this Diſeaſe proceed from an hot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies
of the Womb, it may be known
by a great pain in the part, and by the
heat of the whole Belly: a dry Imtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
may be known by long Fevers going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and a thin habit of Body, but in time
they grow Groſs and Cachectical by reaſon
of the want of this evacuation. If it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from an ill Formation, there are ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of the Belly, pain and a weight.</p>
               <p>If it ariſe from a hot Intemperies, as it
doth moſt commonly, it muſt be Cured by
four kinds of Remedies, firſt by cooling
Diet, they muſt eat Chicken, Veal, or the
Broth wherein hath been boiled cooling
Herbs, as Endive, Sorrel, Lettice, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
and the like; Oranges are alſo good,
and roaſted Apples, and ſtewed Prunes;
their Drink muſt be ſmall Beer; their Sleep
and Exerciſe muſt be moderate; for violent
Exerciſe and frequent walking are plainly
injurious, and ſo are diſturbances of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63569:15"/>
Mind. Secondly they muſt Bleed twice or
thrice a Year in the Foot, and for ſome
days they muſt take ſuch things as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to qualifie the hot and bilious Humours,
as the waters and ſyrups of Purſlain, Succory
Endive, Violets, and the like, and let them
be Purged with the following Medicines.</p>
               <p>Take of the beſt Rhubarb two Scruples, infuſe
it a whole night in four ounces of Endive water,
ſtrain it in the morning, and add to it an ounce
of Manna, or of the pulp of Caſſia, and an
ounce of ſyrup of Roſes ſolutive.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let them uſe ſuch things as lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely
attemperate the heat of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and Part; as Conſerve of Roſes, or
of Violets, with Endive-water, or a Ptiſan
before Meals, or Goats-milk in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the flowers of Violets and Borrage:
But the uſe of Cooling Apozems is much
praiſed in this Caſe.</p>
               <p>Take of cleanſed Barly three pugils, of the
Roots of Borrage and Succory, each Ounce, of
the leaves of Burrage, Succory, Endive, Fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
and Sorrel, each one Handfull, of the Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Flowers, and of the Cold Seeds, each one Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,
of Anniſeeds one Dram, of Prunes Twelve,
of Raiſons one Ounce; Boyl them in a ſufficient
quantity of Water to one Pint and an Half; to
the ſtrained Liquor add a ſufficient quantity of
Sugar, make a clear Apozem, aromatize it with
a Drachm of the Species of the three Sanders.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63569:15"/>
But if you intend to have it Purge a little, add
towards the latter end the Leaves of Senna, and

               <p>If the Diſeaſe proceed from Dryneſs, it
muſt be Cured with moiſtning Meats of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63569:16"/>
good Nouriſhment, and with Drinks; and
the Woman muſt walk often, but not ſo
much as to tire her ſelf, and Frictions
muſt be uſed above the region of the Womb,
that the parts may be dilated ſo that the
menſtruous Blood may be allured to the
Womb. Baths are alſo proper, and Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made of mucilages of the Seeds of
Pſyllium and Quinces and the like; and
Glyſters alſo do good.</p>
               <p>Take of the Decoction of Marſh-mallows,

Butter three Ounces, mingle them, make a

               <p>But all Evacuations muſt be avoided, for
they increaſe the Dryneſs.</p>
               <p>If the Diſeaſe proceeds from an ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
Medicines are moſt commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable;
and therefore you muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to leſſen the Blood, if it abound, or
to divert it another way; therefore you
muſt Bleed three or four times a Year in the
Arm, or in the Foot, if Blood ſeem to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in the Womb. But if the ſtrength
of the Woman cannot bear Bleeding, then
ſhe muſt uſe a thin Diet, and frequent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
and Frictions all over the Body, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
early in the Morning, for ſo the
Blood may be turned from the Inner Parts
to the Outward, and part of it diſcuſſed.
Baths moderately hot are alſo good, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63569:16"/>
theſe things may be ſufficient for Married
Women, which by converſation with their
Husbands are ſomewhat diſcharged; but
they will not be ſufficient for Maids and
Widows; and therefore it will be neceſſary
to provoke the Hemorrhoids or to open Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues.
But if the Diſeaſe proceed from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate
Obſtructions, it muſt be treated as
is propoſed in the Chapter of the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

               <p>THE Menſtruous Flux happens to
break out by contrary wayes, upon
two accounts; for either Nature providing
for the ſafety of the Womans Body, when
ſhe knows there is any Impediment in the

accuſtoms her ſelf to another, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
about, ſhe ſometimes uſes this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
ſometimes that; for in ſome the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous
Blood is diſcharged by the Mouth,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63569:17"/>
in others through the Noſtrils, by the Eyes
and Bloody Tears, by the Dugs and Piles,
alſo by the Fingers and Urine, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by a Redneſs in one of the Cheeks,
and if there be an Impediment in the
Womb, that hinders the paſſage of the
Blood that way, it is better it ſhould flow
<hi>theſe ways than not at all, for ſo ſays Hippocrates,
Menſtruis deficientibus ſanguinem e naribus
erumpere bonum est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cauſe of this Diſeaſe is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſome violent Paſſion of the Mind, or
ſome great diſturbance happening when the
Courſes are near flowing; it comes alſo
from Obſtructions of the Womb, or by
reaſon of violent Pains, and great Diſeaſes
of the upper Parts, alſo from the weakneſs
of them, when the VVomb and lower Parts
are ſtrong; for the weak Parts always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what the ſtronger put upon them.
It alſo comes from ſome external Cauſe,
as by drinking cold Water unſeaſonably,
or by waſhing the Feet and Legs unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
or by the uſe of Vinegar, when the
Courſes are near.</p>
               <p>The Scope of the Cure is Two-fold,
the Firſt is the Evacuation of the Blood
abounding, the other is the Recalling of it
to the lower Parts, which is chiefly done
by Cooling the upper Parts, and by Heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Moiſtning, and Opening, the lower
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63569:17"/>
Parts; but both may be well anſwered by
Bleeding in the Foot three or four days
before the Blood flows, and by applying
Cupping-glaſſes to the Thighs Legs and
Hips, ſometimes Dry, but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
with Scarification, and alſo by
provoking the Hemorrhoids, by Frictions,
by Walking, by hot Baths natural or
artificial; by Fomentations made of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Herbs, by Unctions, Peſſaries, and
uterine Gliſters. But ſee more of this in
the Chapter of Suppreſſion of the Courſes.
The two following Remedies are peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
proper for this Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Foot for ſeveral Months at
the times we have mentioned, and the
Bath-waters wherein the Woman muſt be
Bathed early in the Morning, and muſt
continue a while in them; but this muſt

               <head type="sub">Of the Courſes coming before their due
time, and of ſtaying longer than they
ſhould.</head>
               <p>IN many Women the Courſes flow before
their accuſtomed time, and ſometimes
they ſtay longer than they ſhould; and
this anticipation and delay are ſometimes
orderly and ſometimes diſorderly. The
Cauſes are either the Vice of the Womb, as
the ill Figure of it, or a Solution of the
Continuum, and ſometimes a hurt on ſome
other account; as a Vitious humour that
irritates before the time, by reaſon of
plenty of Blood, or the thinneſs or ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of it; the quantity of humours occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning
it may be known by the dulneſs of
the Body, by the ſanguine habit of the
Woman, by a ſedentary and idle Life, by
exceſs in eating and drinking, or by ſome
other Evacuation ſtopped or leſſened. The
Acrimony of the Blood may be known by
the Heat, Eroſion, and Pain in the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or by the Vitious habit of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Body, and the courſe of her Life
foregoing, or by the Diet ſhe was wont
to uſe, and the like. But if it come lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63569:18"/>
and without pain, the retentive
faculty is weak; it may alſo be occaſioned
by a blow or fall.</p>
               <p>If it proceed by reaſon of the Looſneſs,
and fault of the retentive faculty, it muſt
be ſtrengthened by proper Remedies; if it
come from a plenitude, it muſt be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
by a ſparing Diet and moderate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
and by taking away ſo much Blood
as is agreeable to the ſtrength in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Month, or a little before the
Courſes flow. Frictions alſo in the Arms,
and in all the upper parts of the Body are
proper; the Woman muſt abſtain from
Wine, and all Strong-waters, and inſtead
of them Chalybeats muſt be uſed; and if
theſe things do not do the buſineſs, ſhe
muſt be blooded in the Arm; but if it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from the Acrimony of the Humours,
ſhe muſt eat freely Meat of good nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and muſt exerciſe a little, and ſuch
Medicines muſt be uſed as attemperate the
humours, and ſhe muſt be purg'd, and
Uterine Gliſters muſt be injected made of
two Ounces of Oyl of Violets, and four Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Decoction of Mallows; but care
muſt be taken that the Courſes be not quite
ſtopped, becauſe it is dangerous. Laſtly,
if a blow, a fall, or difficult labour occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
this diſeaſe, the following Cataplaſm
muſt be applied to the Womb and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:63569:19"/>
Take of the Powders of Dragons-blood, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe,
Maſtich, and of the greater Comfry,
each two Drams, with a ſufficient quantity of
Turpentine make a Cataplaſm.</p>
               <p>If the Woman be of a hot Conſtitution,
apply the following Plaiſter.</p>
               <p>Take of the Powders of Roſes, Myrtles, and
Balauſtins, and Maſtich, each one Drahom, of
fine Flour one Ounce, with the Whites of Eggs
make a Plaiſter.</p>
               <p>The Courſes ſtay beyond their time by
reaſon of age, when they are about to go
away, or by a vice of the whole Body or
of the womb: If it proceed on the account
of age, you muſt only endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
thoſe inconveniences which are wont
to follow, eſpecially the Gout, and a pain
in the Hip, which may be done by a ſpare
Diet, much exerciſe, and by bleeding
yearly, till Nature has been accuſtomed
to the want of the menſtruous Purgation:
But if it proceed from a Vice of the whole
Body, it muſt be treated as a ſuppreſſion
of the Courſes. If it proceed from a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
diſorder of the Womb, it requires
a peculiar Cure, and is a Symptom of the
kind of the vitiated action of Excretion,
either becauſe it is hindred by the ill For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or a groſs Humour that Obſtructs.
The Cauſes therefore are theſe three, which
are contrary to the anticipation of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63569:19"/>
Courſes, <hi>viz.</hi> the weakneſs of the Faculty,
the fault of the Humours, and the dulneſs
of the Senſe. The impotence of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is occaſioned by the frigidity, or moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
of the Temperament, or by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
Figure of the Inſtrument; the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is faulty upon the account of its thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſiccity and clammineſs: The Senſe
is rendred dull moſt commonly by moiſture
abounding. The weak Faculty by reaſon
of Frigidity, is known by the Womans
perceiving a weight and diſturbance after
the time of the coming of her Courſes is
paſt. The fault of the Inſtrument may be
known by what went before, as by hard
labour, a tumour, cicatrix, leaping or a
fall, whereby the Womb, or a part ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to it is diſplaced, or the figure of
it deformed. The fault of the Humour
may be known by thoſe things that are
evacuated by the Blood, as if it be whitiſh
it may be ſeen, if it be groſs and clammy,
a ſedentary life, and a groſs and flegmatic
Diet went before; the Woman is of a ſoft,
pale and leaden habit of body, and is fat;
and by the Bloods flowing ſlowly, and by the
long continuance of the Courſes ſometimes,
and by their ending in a ſlime. If when
they ſtay a long time before they come,
the Woman does not perceive any diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the Womb and neighbouring Parts,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63569:20"/>
the Senſe is dull. If the Diſeaſe ariſe from
a thick and clammy Humour, as it does
moſt commonly, it muſt be cured accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Galen,</hi> with three ſorts of Remedies;
Firſt, by a thin and heating Diet, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
exerciſe, and frictions of the Legs:
Secondly, by attenuating and heating Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
made of opening Roots of Calaminth,
Fennel, Saxifrage, Burnet, Hyſop, and
the like, Saffron and Cinnamon being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to them, and the Cure muſt be begun
preſently after the Purgation of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Let the Woman take every Morning
five or ſix Ounces of the following Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem.</p>
               <p>Take of the Roots of Smallage, Fennel, and
Parſley, each two Ounces, of the Leaves of
Feverfew, Cat-mint, Penny-royal, Maiden-hair,
each one Handful and an Half, of the
Seeds of Aniſe and Fennel, each one Drachm
and an Half; boyl them in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Water to a Quart; in the ſtrained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
diſſolve of the Syrups of Mugwort and
Maiden-hair, each three Ounces; the Syrup of
Hyſop, or of the Five Opening Roots made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Vinegar is alſo very good, being mixed with
the Waters of Fennel, Cat-mint, Penny-royal,
and Parſley, and other things may be uſed
which are mentioned in the Chapter of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Courſes. 3dly, She muſt be Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with Agarick Trochiſcated, or with the
Pill of Maſtick, Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:63569:20"/>
Take of the Pills of Agarick, and Aloephar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
each two Scruples, with the Syrup of Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort;
make four Pills.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thoſe things which draw the
the Blood downwards muſt be uſed, as
bleeding in the Foot three or four days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the accuſtomed time of the Courſes;
theſe things being done, the Legs and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Belly muſt be fomented with a decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Fenugreek, Camomile, Dill, Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
Fennel, Parſly, Daucus. And while
ſhe is bathing let her take one of the Tab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
called Diacalaminth; afterwards let the
Parts be fumed with Spices, and uſe Fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Ligatures to the Legs, and let
Cupping-glaſſes be applyed to the Claves of
the Legs without ſcarification; and if the
Courſes do not yet flow, let the Woman
be purged every third day with four or
five of the Pills mentioned before. Let the
lower Belly be anointed with the Oyls of
Capers, White Lillies, Dill, Cinnamon,
and Saffron, and let Uterine Gliſters be
injected made of four Ounces of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of Penny-royal, Horſe-mint, Thym,
and Creſſes, with two Ounces of Oyl of
Rue, or of Dill, which wonderfully rouze
the dull ſenſe of the Womb.</p>

Secondly, from the mixture of ſome putrid

according to the nature of the humours;

               <p>The Cure is in a manner the ſame which

for an exact courſe of Diet being ordered,
the Woman muſt be purged with Agarick
trochiſcated, or with the Pill of Maſtich,
if a Phlegmatic humour abounds; if a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious

be uſed, and moderate exerciſe, which
purge the Body and Womb; and if the

cauſe, a Vomit uſed by Intervals is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that what is daily heapt up there

               <head type="sub">Of the Complication of the Courſes with
other Diſeaſes.</head>
               <p>THere is ſcarce any thing that does di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
Phyſicians more, and which
makes them err ſo much, as the complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Courſes with Diſeaſes; and
this happens chiefly ſix ways. Firſt, When
a Diſeaſe happens juſt when the Courſes are
about to come. Secondly, If by reaſon of
the invaſion of a Diſeaſe, the Courſes come
before their due time. Thirdly, If the
time of the Courſes and of the Diſeaſe
are complicated, ſo that they come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Fourthly, If the Courſes being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
delayed or leſſened, a Diſeaſe
comes upon them upon an other account.
Fifthly, If by reaſon of a Diſeaſe pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting,
a ſuppreſſion or delay of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
is the cauſe of the increaſe of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
and its Symptoms. Sixthly, If when
there is a Diſeaſe, the Courſes flow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:63569:22"/>
If therefore the Courſes are juſt about
to flow, when the Diſeaſe is beginning, or
in the proceſs of it, we muſt conſider
whether the Diſeaſe be one of thoſe, which
is occaſioned by the Womb, in which caſe
if the Diſeaſe requires bleeding without
any delay, we muſt draw it from the foot,
that it may be let out by a convenient
way, that the Womb may be evacuated,
and the cauſe expelled. But if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
ariſes from the whole Body, or from
ſome principal member of it; that Vein
of the Arm (moſt affirm) muſt be opened,
which chiefly reſpects the part affected:
but this opinion, if it be generally received,
ſeems to me injurious, and we ought rather
to diſtinguiſh concerning the number of
the days, the acuteneſs of the Diſeaſe, and
the plenitude of the Body; for if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
be not acute, Blood ought to be
drawn from the Foot, and eſpecially, if the
Woman be within three or four days of
her Courſes, and in this caſe ſhe ought to
be blooded in the Foot, although the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
be acute, and this both reaſon and
experience confirms; for Nature is to
be evacuated that way ſhe tends, if it be a
convenient place; for if the Woman be
blooded in the upper parts, we often ſee
that ſhe becomes delirious, and that watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
ſleepy Diſeaſes, difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63569:23"/>
and at length Death it ſelf follow. But
if there be eight days, or thereabouts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time of the Courſes, and there is a
great plenitude, and the Woman cannot
be ſo ſufficiently evacuated by the Foot,
as the Diſeaſe requires, then all agree that
ſhe muſt be blooded in the Arm, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if the Diſeaſe be acute; but purging
Medicines, Vomits, and Sudoriſicks muſt
be deferred till the Courſes are over, or
you muſt uſe thoſe that are very gentle,
leſt Nature ſhould be hindred, or divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for if ſo, the Blood may be unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
detained, or may ruſh upon ſome
principal part, or increaſe the Diſeaſe.
But if it happen that the Womans Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are procraſtinated, it is lawful to
Purge; for ſometimes we ſee that Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brings the Courſes. If the Diſeaſe be
Chronical, it is beſt to Purge eight days
after the Courſes are gon off.</p>
               <p>But if the Courſes come before their
due time in Diſeaſes, which is the ſecond
way of complication, nothing in curing
Womens Diſeaſes is ſo difficult and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
eſpecially at the beginning of the
Diſeaſe, before univerſal Remedies have
been given; for at other times if we do
nothing, there is the leſs perplexity; but if
at the beginning you Bleed or Purge, you
hinder the menſtruous Purgation, and if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63569:23"/>
you do neither, the Diſeaſe increaſes.
Thoſe things that are proper for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
ſtop the Courſes; and if they flow,
they do not relieve the Diſeaſe, becauſe
they are then Symptomatical; for ſuch
an evacuation, is almoſt always pernicious
at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at that time ſeldom promotes any
uſeful evacuation; wherefore we muſt
diligently conſider what good or hurt
comes from it, and from what cauſe the
anticipation of the Courſes in Diſeaſes
proceeds; for in the beginning and in the
increaſe, as we ſaid, it is full of danger,
but in the ſtate and declination, the crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Courſes, if they flow eaſily, is
wont to be advantageous, by reaſon of the
fitneſs of the Seaſon for evacuation, if it
be not complicated with ſome other eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations
of Nature. The Anticipation of
the Courſes proceeds from many cauſes:
but from whatever cauſe it come, if there
be a plenitude, the Cure muſt be begun
by bleeding in the Foot. But if the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
flow at their accuſtomed time, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to come at the beginning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
you muſt firſt wait on Nature, and
if after twelve hours the Flux is not, or is
not like to be ſufficient, you muſt bleed
in the Foot, to compleat the natural eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation
of the Woman; and moreover,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63569:24"/>
you muſt take away ſo much Blood, as
the Diſeaſe requires, for we muſt reſpect
Cuſtom and the Diſeaſe too, and this may
be underſtood of violent Diſeaſes; yet it is
chiefly to be uſed in ſmall ones; and
therefore that they ſhould not grow to be
violent, you muſt incourage the Courſes
by all means, by Ligatures, Frictions, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories,
Gliſters, and other things, which
are ſufficient to provoke the parts near the
Womb; and if the Diſeaſe ariſe from a
cold cauſe, you muſt give ſuch Medicines
as promote the Courſes, and alſo reſpect
the Diſeaſe: But if a Purge be neceſſary,
you muſt defer it till the Courſes are over,
leſt the Blood being moved and diſturbed
thereby, greater miſchief ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned.</p>
               <p>But if the Diſeaſe be one of the greateſt,
as a Quinſey, Frenſy, Pluriſie, or an acute
Fever, you muſt firſt bleed in the Foot,
afterwards the ſame day, you muſt bleed
in the Arm; but in the mean while you
muſt apply Ligatures to the Legs whilſt
the Blood flows, and this is good Practice;
for the Indication of the moſt violent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
is always to be reſpected before that
Indication which is taken from the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and in the ſame manner you muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the other Seaſons of the Diſeaſe,
wherein you ought to defer Purging, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63569:24"/>
and Sweat, if the Diſeaſe requires
them, till the Courſes are gone off; for the
Indication of the Courſes is greater than
the Indications of theſe helps, unleſs a
Sanies flow beyond the appointed time,
which is not to be accounted at that time
to proceed from fulneſs, and in this caſe,
an Indication for purging being urgent,
you may Purge.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Caſe was, when upon the
Courſes ſtopt a Diſeaſe came. In this caſe
we muſt firſt conſider whether the Courſes
are but now ſtopt, or whether they have
been ſtopt a long while; and moreover,
whether the Diſeaſe proceeds from this
ſuppreſſion; for if it ariſe from hence, you
muſt without doubt bleed in the Foot firſt,
nor muſt we Purge, Vomit, or Sweat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and afterwards in the Arm, if the
Diſeaſe require it, eſpecially if it be four
days paſt the accuſtomed time of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
But if the ſuppreſſion be new, and
the Diſeaſe not urgent, before you uſe
other means, you muſt expect a while the
flowing of the Courſes, eſpecially if you
do not underſtand rightly the nature of
the Diſeaſe; for it is more ſecure, the
Courſes being ſtopt to bleed in the Foot
than to Purge, Vomit, or Sweat. But if
notwithſtanding bleeding in the Foot, the
Courſes flow but ſlowly, you ought to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63569:25"/>
give ſuch Medicines as move them; and it
will be proper to give them before they
begin, if you ſuſpect that Nature will not
do the buſineſs throughly her ſelf.</p>
               <p>But if the Courſes delay, and the Diſeaſe
grows worſe thereby, moſt affirm that the
Cure muſt be begun by thoſe helps, which
the Diſeaſe and its Cauſe require, without
reſpect to bleeding in the Foot. But I am
not of the ſame Opinion; for in ſlight Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
and in ſuch as will bear a Truce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
has taught me that it is beſt to
bleed in the Foot; for the indication from
the Courſes ſtopt is more to be minded than
a ſmall Diſeaſe, and therefore they ought
to be provoked, firſt by Ligatures, Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſſes,
Frictions, and Medicines, and
afterwards you muſt provide for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe:
But if the Diſeaſe be violent, as a
Quinſie, Pleuriſie, or the like; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
thoſe Remedies muſt be given which
the Diſeaſe requires, without conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Veins of the Foot.</p>
               <p>But when the Courſes ſhould come at the
time of the Diſeaſe, and are ſtopt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Diſeaſe and its Cauſe, without
doubt we ought to bleed in the Foot, and
to take away ſo much Blood, as the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the Womb requires, or till the
Courſes flow, and if there be occaſion we
may Purge gently, and not divert the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63569:25"/>
Courſe of Nature. Laſtly, if when the
Diſeaſe is preſent, the Courſes flow by drops
before their time, you muſt proceed as in
the ſecond Caſe concerning the Anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Courſes in Diſeaſes: Or, if it
happen at their due time, you muſt treat
them as in the third Caſe when the Courſes
happen with the Seaſons of the Diſeaſe;
only the dropping of the Courſes ſignifies
a greater oppreſſion of Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
requires larger bleeding.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Courſes coming difficulty, and with
violent Symptoms.</head>
               <p>THis Diſeaſe is like a Dyſury or adifficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Urine, for it is accompanied with
Pain and a great diſturbance, the Symptoms
often come before the Courſes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with the Courſes; the Blood comes by
drops and is attended with violent Pain.
This Symptom comes upon an Obſtruction
of the Courſes, ſometimes upon Solution
of the Continuum, an Ulcer, Eroſion, and
painful diſorders in the neighbouring parts,
The Courſes, as was ſaid before, come ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
drop by drop, and ſometimes plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63569:26"/>
ſometimes by intervals, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
continually; ſometimes orderly, and
ſometimes diſorderly.</p>
               <p>It is moſt commonly occaſioned by the
ſame Cauſes from whence a ſuppreſſion of
the Courſes proceeds, but gentler; for there
is not a total Suppreſſion, but an unequal
Obſtruction of the Veſſels of the Womb,
by reaſon of thick clotted, and feculent
blood, which ſtretches the Veſſels, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
violently endeavouing to Evacuate it,
a groſs wind ariſes, which diſtending the
Veſſels, and the neighbouring parts, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
the violent pain, which continues un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the clods are ejected. Sometimes the
Blood flows plentifully, yet the Courſes are
counted difficult and leſſened; becauſe tho
a great quantity is evacuated, yet it is not
anſwerable to the plenitude. The ſecond
Cauſe is an Ulcer, or ſome preternatural
Tumour in the Womb or neighbouring
parts, which are provoked and hurt by the
commotion of the Blood. The third is the
acrimony of the Humours. This Diſeaſe
is known by a pain in the Head, a pain in
the Stomach, Reſtleſneſs, pains in the Loins,
and of the lower Belly, juſt like the pains
of Child-bearing, coming with the Courſes,
or eight days before. There is often alſo
fainting and convulſions, and a palpitation
of the Heart; and by theſe you may know,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63569:26"/>
that the Blood is clotted or thick, and a
ſmall ſwelling is ſometimes perceived in
one or both of the Groins, by reaſon of
clotted Blood contained in it; and juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the evacuation of the clotted Blood,
the pain is moſt violent, and at the ſame
time if wind be joined with it, it breaks
from the Womb or backwards with a noiſe,
and there are wandring pains about the
Loins and Hips. If an Ulcer be the cauſe,
Sanies or Pus is mixed with the Blood, and
the Courſes flow always with a fixed pain.
This Diſeaſe afflicts Virgins and thoſe that
are Barren. The Cure is two-fold, the firſt
reſpects the Cauſe, the ſecond the mitigating
the Pain. If it proceed from feculent groſs
and clotted Blood, a thin Diet and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Exerciſe muſt be ordered, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
that cauſe Revulſion and Evacuation,
muſt be uſed. Blood therefore muſt be drawn
from the Arm if there be a great quantity
of it, but if the quantity be ſmall, from the
Foot; and the clotted Blood that cannot be
evacuated, muſt be drawn out by Cupping-glaſſes
applied to the Thighs and Legs with
Scarification, and by Ligatures upon the
Legs, and the Humour may be turned by
applying Leeches to the Fundament if the
pain continue after the Courſes are ſtopp'd,
but they muſt not be uſed before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:63569:27"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Evacuation muſt be uſed with
this diſtinction, when feculent and gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Blood is the cauſe, you muſt Bleed;
when an Ulcer, Wind, or an Acrid Matter,
you muſt Purge moſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Paſſages muſt be Relaxed
and Opened, and the Pain mitigated;
wherefore, if the matter be thick, ſlatulent,
feculent, or clammy; a Dram of Venice
Treacle, or of Mithridate muſt be taken at
Bed-time in three Ounces of Balm-water;
and Baths muſt be provided, and Lotions
for the Legs made of a Decoction of Marſh-mallows,
of the Seeds of Flax, Fenugreek,
Dill, Rhue, and Mugwort, and the Feet

and the lower Belly muſt be Fomented after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with Flannel dipt in Wine and Oyl
of Roſes, or with a Bladder half full of
warm Oyl; but it will be better to anoint
the Navel, and the region below it with
Oyl of Saffron, of White-lillies, the Seeds
of Flax, of Capers, of Yolks of Eggs, or
of ſweet Almonds, among which or with
one of them muſt be diſſolved a Drachm of
Treacle, a Peſſary dipt in the ſame is alſo
is of great uſe; or the foreſaid Parts may
be annointed with Hens-fat and Butter; or
with Butter and ſome of the foreſaid Oyls.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63569:27"/>
The following Oyntment is alſo very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>Take of the juice of Angelica one Drachm, of
Oyls of Capers and of White-lilies, each one
Ounce and an half, of White-wine half an
Ounce, with Wax make an Oyntment.</p>
               <p>The following Cataplaſm is alſo very
good.</p>
               <p>Take of common Oyl, of ſweet Wine, and
freſh Butter, each two Ounces, of Bran three
Ounces; boyl them gently, apply them hot and
repeat them frequently.</p>
               <p>But if acrid and eroding Matter be the
cauſe you muſt uſe gentle Oyntments, and
Fomentation of warm Water, or Purſlain
and Lettice Water with Emulſions of the
cold Seeds; and the Parts muſt be anointed
with the Oils of ſweet Almonds, of Violets
and of Roſes.</p>
               <p>If the Diſeaſe proceeds from an Ulcer,
you muſt endeavour the Cure of it, and you
muſt mitigate the Pain by injecting uterine
Gliſters made of four Ounces of warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and if the heat be very much, the
Water muſt be ſweetned with Sugar, and
you muſt add one Drachm of the white Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Rhaſis. Or, the Gliſter may be
made with three Ounces of Allum-water,
which is of excellent uſe; or with ſo much
Barly-water with an Ounce of Syrup of
Roſes; or with Milk-water with Sugar; or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63569:28"/>
with an Ounce and an half of Milk it ſelf,
with the like quantity of a Decoction of the
Leaves and Seeds of Plaintain, to which
may be added half an Ounce of the emulſion
of the cold Seeds; and if the Pain and Heat
is very violent, inject two Ounces of the
Decoction of Henbane, or white Poppies.
But if theſe things will not do the buſineſs,
ſome Opium muſt be mixed with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
before mentioned. Laſtly, if other
remedies will not do the buſineſs, an Iſſue

               <head type="sub">Of the Cloſure of the Womb.</head>
               <p>VIrgins labouring under this Diſeaſe are
ſaid to be Imperforate. This cloſure
is wont to be in three places, <hi>viz.</hi> in the
mouth of the Womb, in the neck of it, and
in the Privities. It is occaſioned either in
the firſt Formation when a Membrance co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the Orifice of the Womb, or its Neck,
or by a Wound, or Ulcer preceding,
which growing together ſtops the Neck of
the Womb, or joins the Lips, or it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by Humours, or a Compreſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:63569:28"/>
If the Cloſure be in the Privities, it may
be eaſily known, but if it be in the Neck,
or Orifice of the Womb, it is not found
out till the Courſes begin to flow, or till
Women are Married; for at the time of the
menſtruous Purgation, Pains and Gripes are
perceived in the region of the Womb at
certain times, with a ſenſe of weight, yet
no Flux follows. Moreover, you may gueſs
at it, if the Maid be of good habit of Body
not Cachetical, and without Obſtruction,
the Diſeaſe continuing the Womb ſwells,
ſo that Virgins ſeem to be with Child, and
ſometimes the whole Body, which looks li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:
But if the Neck of the Womb be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
it may be known in the firſt Copualti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe it cannot admit the Virile Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
Laſtly, if the Orifice of the Womb
be ſhut, it is difficultly known, but it may
be found out by the hand of a Skilful Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife.</p>
               <p>As to the prognoſtick, if the Cloſure be
in the Orifice of the Privities, it is eaſily
Cured by a ſmall Section: But if it be in the
inner Parts, the Cure is much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
               <p>When a Membrane ſhuts the paſſage, it
is eaſily Cured, but when the Cloſure is from
fleſhy Matter, as it happens after Ulcers,
then the Cure is much more difficult.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:63569:29"/>
The Cloſure of the inner Orifice of the
Womb is Incurable, for Chirurgcial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
cannot work upon it.</p>
               <p>If the Cloſure of the Womb be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from the Birth, it muſt be opened by
ſimple Section; but if it takes its riſe from
an Ulcer, as it often happens in the French-Pox;
we muſt conſider, whether it be an
Excreſcence of Fleſh that does not wholly
ſtop the paſſage; and whether it quite ſtops
For if it be only an Excreſcence, we muſt
endeavour (convenient Evacuations going
before) firſt to hinder the increaſe of the
Fleſh by drying and diſcuſſing Medicines,
and afterwards we muſt leſſen the Fleſh by
Medicines made of Frankincenſe, Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort,
the Bark of Frankincenſe, Roſes, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauſtins,
Maſtick, Myrrh, Aloes, and the
like; and if theſe things are not ſufficient,
we muſt uſe burnt Allom, Unguentum,
Aegyptiacum, and the like; or the Fleſh
may be cut off by that Inſtrument that is
uſed for extirpating a Polipus. But if the
Neck of the Womb be wholly ſhut, we muſt
endeavour to renew the Ulcer, and to take
off the ſuperfluous Fleſh by the foreſaid
Medicines, or it muſt be cut.</p>
               <p>If a Tumour ſhut the paſſage of the
Womb, it muſt be removed by proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
               <p>If it be occaſioned by a Compreſſion of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63569:29"/>
the Neck of the Womb, that which cauſes
the Compreſſion muſt be removed, namely, a
Stone in the Bladder, a Tumour of the right
Gut, or the like.</p>
               <p>When the paſſage is too narrow, it moſt
commonly proceeds from hardneſs and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and therefore you muſt uſe moiſtning,
emollient, and relaxing things; as half

muſt put a leaden Pipe, or white Wax fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

let a Peſſary made of Cotten be uſed

abate Daily, but on the contrary in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In Women with Child after the

the Child may be ſenſibly perceived by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Swelling is not at all hard, nor is it
always contained within the Limits of the
Womb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the inward Mouth of the
Womb be touched by a Skilful Midwife,
ſhe will find it not exactly cloſed, as it is in

and ſomewhat painful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Women with Child are moſt

               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:63569:30"/>
A Suppreſſion of the Courſes is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and many deſperate Diſeaſes ariſe
from it.</p>
               <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe muſt be varied
according to the variety of the Cauſes, and
firſt, if it proceed from too great a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Blood, bleeding muſt be ordered in
the Arm, and a large quantity of Blood
muſt be taken away; afterwards it muſt
be drawn downwards by opening the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Veins about the time the Woman uſed
to have her Courſes before ſhe was ill.</p>
               <p>If by reaſon of want of Blood the Courſes
ſtop, as after long Fevers, after great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations,
and when the Body is much
waſted, you muſt not endeavour to provoke
the Courſes till the Body is repleniſh'd, and
a ſufficient quantity of Blood is bred, which
being done they generally flow of their own
accord; but if it happens that Nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgets
her Office, ſhe muſt be rous'd up
by opening the lower Veins, and by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
propoſed in the Chapter of Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
Diſeaſes: But the quantity of Blood
muſt be moderate, leſt the ſtrength ſhould
be dejected, and the Sick ſhould fall into a
Conſumption. yet it muſt be carefully no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that every waſting of the Body does
not ſhew a want of Blood, but only that
which ſucceeds great Evacuations, and the
like. For ſometimes it happens that the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63569:31"/>
Courſes being ſuppreſſed and detained in
the Veins, occaſion an ill quality, whereby
the Blood is rendred unfit to nouriſh the
Parts, upon which account the Body waſts,
tho the Veins are full of Blood, in which
Caſe large bleeding is required.</p>
               <p>As to the ſuppreſſion of the Courſes
which happens by a prepoſterous motion
of the Blood, when it is evacuated by
bleeding at Noſe, by Vomiting, Spitting,
or Hemorrhoids, and other parts, the
Cure of it is perform'd by repelling the
Blood from the parts through which it
flows contrary to Nature, and by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it back to the paſſage of the Womb.
The firſt is performed when the Blood
ruſhes out of the upper parts, by waſhing
the Arms, Head, and Face, with cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and by forbearing the exerciſe of
thoſe parts, eſpecially ſinging and ſpeaking
aloud. The ſecond is perform'd by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the lower Veins, three or Four days
before the Blood breaks out, and by Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſſes
applied to the Thighs and
Legs ſometimes with, ſometimes without
Scarification, by provoking the Hemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoids,
by Running, by Walking, Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and Baths made of opening Herbs;
but the Bath water is eſpecially commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Sick muſt bath in them often
a good while after Meals, but the water
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63569:31"/>
muſt not riſe above the Navel, and at the
ſame time the upper parts be cool'd by fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them.</p>
               <p>If the Blood flow by the Hemorrhoids,
the Cure is very difficult; for if you uſe
things to draw downwards, they bring
them alſo to the Fundament, and if you
uſe aſtringent things to it, they by near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the parts, repell what ſhould be
brought to the Womb; ſo that the only
way of Cure is to apply ſuch things to the
Womb as may allure the Blood thither,
after you have uſed ſuch things as draw the
Blood downwards.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Barrenneſs.</head>
               <p>BArrenneſs proceeds from many cauſes,
but they may be reduced to four Heads,
according to the four Natural Operations
which are required to perfect Conception.
The firſt is that the Woman in Copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
receive the Mans ſeed: Secondly, that
it's retain'd a due time: Thirdly, that it
is nouriſhed in the Womb: Fourthly, that
the Woman afford due Matter for the
forming and neceſſary increaſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broy;
and hence four impediments of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
ariſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Reception of the Seed is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by many cauſes, as immature Age,
when by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the
Genital paſſages the Woman cannot admit
the Mans Yard, or at leaſt not without
great pain, which makes her diſlike Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation;
and Old Age has the ſame effect;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63569:34"/>
for in elderly Virgins the Genital parts
for want of uſe, are rendr'd ſo ſtrait,
that they can't eaſily receive the virile
Member, and ſuch as are lame, or
have their Limbs diſtorted, or their Hips
depreſſed, can ſcarce lye in ſuch a poſture
as is neceſſary for a fit Reception of the
Seed; too much fat alſo ſtops the paſſages,
and makes the Copulation incommodious:
And laſtly, a cold intemperies of the
Womb makes the Woman dull, ſo that
ſhe ſcarce injoys any pleaſure in Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or is ſo flowly moved, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Orifice of the Womb does not open
ſeaſonably to receive the Mans Seed. The
Paſſions of the Mind alſo are a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance,
eſpecially hatred between
Man and Wife, whereby the Woman
having an averſion for ſuch pleaſure does
not ſupply Spirits ſufficient to make the
Genital parts turgent at the time of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation;
nor does the Womb kindly meet
the Seed, and draw it into its Cavity, from
whence and from mixture of both the Seeds,
Conception ariſes.</p>
               <p>The Reception of the Seed may be alſo
hinder'd by Swellings, Ulcers, Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Narrowneſs or Diſtorſions of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nital
parts, or of the Neighbouring parts,
or by a ſtone in the Bladder or the like.</p>
               <p>Conception may be alſo hindred by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63569:34"/>
the Seed is not retained upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of too great moiſture of the Womb,
namely when its fill'd with many excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
humours, whereby being render'd
too laxe it cannot be contracted, as it
ought to retain the Seed received, but this
chiefly happens by reaſon of miſcarriage
or hard labour, whereby the Fibres of the
Womb and its inner Orifice are torn, but
the Whites are the moſt common cauſe of
Barrenneſs.</p>
               <p>Conception is alſo hindred when the
Seed is not ſufficiently nouriſhed in the
Womb, as when the Intemperies of the
Womb is ſo very cold, that it extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
the Seed, or ſo hot as that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipates
it, or over-moiſt or dry.</p>
               <p>The Age fit for Conception is from
fourteen to fifty, and therefore thoſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that are younger or older do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
by reaſon of a defect of Seed and
menſtruous Blood, yet it muſt be confeſſed,
that ſome Women have conceived who
never had their Courſes.</p>
               <p>A diſproportion betwixt the Mans and
Womans Seed is alſo the occaſion of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs,
tho there is no ſenſible defect in
either, and it happens ſometimes that the
ſame Man has Children by another Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and the ſame Woman Children by
another Man, when together they were
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63569:35"/>
Childleſs. It comes to paſs ſometimes
that after a Woman has converſed ten or
more Years with her Husband, and has
not conceived, afterwards ſhe has had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the cauſe whereof is the change of
her Conſtitution by time.</p>
               <p>Having made frequent mention of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Seed, I muſt here acquaint you that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Learned Phyſicians and Anatomiſts deny
that Women have any Seed, for ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſend forth no humour as is called Seed,
and yet they are Fruitful enough, yea ſome
after they have begun to emit ſuch an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
tho indeed they took great pleaſure in
Copulation, yet grew leſs fruitful than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
'Tis alſo ſaid by ſome that a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Air or Vapour ariſing from the Mans
Seed, and not the Seed it ſelf cauſes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;
but paſſing by Controverſies and
nice Speculations, I according to my way
of Writing, ſet down ſuch Methods and
Medicines as are approved of for the Cure
of this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>And Firſt, the narrowneſs of the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
parts by reaſon of youth, in progreſs
of time will grow large enough, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is no need of any other Cure,
but in the mean while Copulation muſt be
forbid, for by the too early uſe of it, the
natural conſtitution of the parts is diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
but if it proceed from ſmall ſtature
or age, it is incurable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:63569:35"/>
Over-fatneſs may be corrected by a
ſpare and proper Diet, and by convenient
evacuations.</p>
               <p>If Barrenneſs proceeds from a diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Diet, as from exceſſive eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Woman muſt be reduced to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
courſe of Life.</p>
               <p>Such as are robuſt and of a manly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
muſt by all means be reduced to a
womanly ſtate; that they may become fit
for generation, they muſt forbear ſtrong
Meats and Labour, and the Courſes muſt
be forced, and by Bleeding and Purging
and the like, the habit of the Body muſt
be rendred cold and moiſt.</p>
               <p>But the moſt frequent cauſe of Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is a cold and moiſt diſpoſition of the
whole Body and of the Womb, which the
Whites often accompany, and for the
cure in this caſe, the Whites muſt be cured
by the method preſcribed in the Chapter
of the Whites, and the following things
muſt be ordered, which are peculiarly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>And Firſt the flegmatick humours muſt
be evacuated by Medicines that purge
Sweat and force Urine, and revulſion muſt
be made by Iſſues in the Arms, Neck and
Legs, and the principal parts muſt be
ſtrengthened by Treacle, Mithridate, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Alkermes and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:63569:36"/>
Afterwards ſuch things muſt be uſed as
are proper by a ſpecific quality to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the Womb and to help Conception.</p>
               <p>Take of the roots of Eringo and Satyrion
candied each one Ounce, of green Ginger can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
half an Ounce, of Hazel Nuts, Pine
Nuts, and Piſtachies each ſix Drams, one
Nutmeg candied, of the Seed of Rocket and
Creſſes each two Drams, of the aſhes of a
Bulls Piſle, of the Reins of Scinks and of the
raſpings of Ivory each one Dram, of confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Alkermes three Drams, of Diambra
and ſweet Diamoch each one Ounce and an half,
of Ambergrieſe half a Dram, with the Syrup
of candied Citrons, make an Electuary, let her
take the quantity of a Nutmeg at bedtime,
drinking upon it a glaſs of good Wine.</p>
               <p>Some count the Secundine of a Woman dried
and powderd very effectual, one Drachm of it
being taken.</p>
               <p>The Seeds of Biſhops weed are alſo much
commended.</p>
               <p>Many good Authors affirm, that if a
Woman drink ſix Ounces of the juice of
Garden Sage with a little Salt, the fourth
day of her Menſtruous Purgation, and a
quarter of an hour after has Converſation
with her Husband, ſhe will infallibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
And by the uſe of this remedy
<hi>Aetius</hi> ſays, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Women became
fruitful after a great Plague.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Parts of Women that ſerve for
Generation.</head>
               <p>THE Parts ſerving for Generation in
Women may be divided into the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
the Womb, the Teſticles, and the
Veſſels that prepare and carry. That part
is called the Privities which appears at firſt
ſight without diſſection, it reaches from the
lower part of the Os Pubis, within an Inch of
the Fundament; it is leſs and cloſer in Maids,
than in thoſe that have born Children. It
hath two Lips, which toward the Pubes
grows thicker, and meeting upon the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Os Pubis makes that riſing that
is called the Hill of <hi>Venus;</hi> its outward ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
is Skin covered with Hair, as the
Lips are, which begin to grow in this place
about the age of Fourteen; the inner ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Hill of <hi>Venus</hi> chiefly conſiſts
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63569:37"/>
of Fat, which makes it bunch up, which in
Copulation hinders the bones of the Pubes
of the Man and Woman to hit one againſt
another, which would by cauſing pain abate
the Venereal pleaſure. A Muſcle ſpringing
from the ſphincter of the Fundament lies
under this Fat. Its Office is to ſtraighten
the Orifice of the Sheath. The Nymphs
and the Clitoris appear when the Lips are
drawn a little aſide: The Nymphs ſtand next
the Urine, as it ſpouts out from the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and keeps the Lips from being wet;
they are placed on each ſide, juſt within the
Lips, they are two fleſhy and ſoft Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
beginning at the upper part of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
where they make that wrinkled
membranous Production, which cloaths the
Clitoris like a Fore-skin: They are in ſhape
and colour like the Thrils that hang under
a Cocks Throat, they have a red ſubſtance
partly Fleſhy, partly Membranous; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Soft and Spongy, compoſed looſly of
ſmall Membranes and Veſſels, ſo that they
are very eaſily diſtended by the influx of the
Animal Spirits and Arterial Blood. They
are larger in grown Maids than in Young,
and grow larger upon the uſe of Venery,
and after the Bearing of Children; their uſe
is to defend the inner Parts, and to cover
the paſſage of the Urine, and a good part
of the Orifice of the Sheath in the upper
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63569:37"/>
part of the Privity. Betwixt the Nymphs
is placed the Clitoris; it anſwers to a Man's
Yard, in ſhape, ſituation, ſubſtance, erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and differs from it only in length and
bigneſs. Thoſe that are called Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrodites
have it ſo long and big, as to be
able to Converſe with Women in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Men. They are not of two Sexs as
is commonly reported, only their Stones
are placed in the Lips of the Privities, and
their Clitoris is preternaturally extended:
But in moſt it does not appear unleſs the
Lips are drawn aſide: It is a little, long and
round Body, it lies under the fat of the
hill of <hi>Venus,</hi> and puffs up in Venery, and
ſtraightening the Orifice of the Sheath
makes it embrace the Virile Member the
more cloſely: Its outward end is like the
Glans of a Men's Yard, and as the Glans
in Men is the ſeat of the greateſt pleaſure
in Copulation; ſo is this in Women:
There is as it were a hole in it, tho indeed
there is really no ſuch thing, moſt of it is
covered with a thin Membrane from the
Conjunction of the Nymphs: It has two
pair of Muſcles, the upper are round and
ſpring from the bones of the Hip; theſe by
ſtraitening the roots of the Nervous Bodies,
that ariſe on each ſide from the bunching of
the Os Iſchium detain the Blood and Spirits
in them, and ſo erect the Clitoris, even as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63569:38"/>
thoſe in Men do the Virile Member; the
other riſe from the Sphincter of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and theſe ſerve to ſtraiten and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Orifice of the Sheath: It has Veins,
and Arteries, and Nerves, which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
large. In ſome <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Countries the
Clitoris is wont to be ſo large, that for its
deformity, and the hindrance it cauſes in
Copulation, they uſed to cut it quite out,
or to ſear it, to hinder its growth.</p>
               <p>The Sheath is ſo call'd becauſe it receives
the Virile Member like a ſheath, it is ſoft
and looſe, uneven and wrinkly, of a ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
but ſomewhat ſpongy Subſtance,
which is puft up in Copulation to embrace
the Yard the better: Its about ſeven fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
breadth long, and as wide as the
ſtrait Gut; but the length and width
differ in reſpect of Age, and as the Woman
is more or leſs provoked to Copulation:
The wrinkles are much more numerous and
cloſe in Virgins, than in thoſe that have
Born many Children, and in Whores that
uſe frequent Copulation, and in Women
that have had the Whites a long while.</p>
               <p>It has very many Arteries and Veins,
ſome whereof inoſculate one with another,
and others not. By the Arteries that open
into it, the Courſes ſometimes flow in
Women with Child, that are full of Blood.
Theſe Veſſels bring plenty of Blood to it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63569:38"/>
in Copulation, which by heating and puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
up the Sheath increaſes the pleaſure,
and hinders the Man's Seed from cooling,
before it is conveyed to the Womb. All
along the Sheath there are abundance of
Pores, from whence a thin Humour always
flows, eſpecially in Copulation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes
the pleaſure of the Woman, and is
that which is ſuppoſed to be her Seed. Near
its outer end, under the Nymphs, in its
upper part, it receives the Neck of the
Bladder. In Virgins its paſſage is ſo narrow,
that at their firſt Converſation with a Man,
they have commonly more pain than plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
by reaſon of the extenſion of it by the
Virile Member, which breaks ſome ſmall
Veſſels, from whence Blood iſſues.</p>
               <p>The Hymen is a thin nervous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,
interwoven with fleſhy Fibres, and
endowed with many little Arteries, and
Veins, behind the inſertion of the Neck of
the Bladder, with a hole in the midſt, that
will admit the top of ones little finger,
whereby the Courſes flow, it is alſo called
the Girdle of Chaſtity. But it is broken
and bleeds at the firſt Copulation, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cloſes again. But tho' a Man when
he finds theſe ſigns of Virginity, may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
conclude he has Married a Maid;
yet if they are wanting, it does not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
follow that Virginity is wanting;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63569:39"/>
for the Hymen may be corroded by ſharp
Humours flowing through it with the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and from other Cauſes; or, if a Maid
be ſo indiſcreet as to become a Bride while
her Courſes flow, or within a Day after,
then the Hymen and the wrinkled Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane
of the Sheath are ſo relaxed, that the
Virile Member may enter without any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and ſo give ſuſpition of Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,
when there is really no occaſion for
it. Sometimes in old Maids the Hymen is
ſo ſtrong that it cannot be penetrated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty; and in ſome it is naturally
quite cloſed up, and ſo their Courſes are
ſtopt, which much endangers their Life; if
it be not opened with a Chirurgical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Myrtle-berry Caruncles lie cloſe to
the Hymen, the largeſt of 'em is uppermoſt,
ſtanding juſt at the Mouth of the paſſage
of the Urine, which it ſhuts after making
water; oppoſite to this at the bottom of
the Sheath there is another, and in each ſide
one. But of theſe, there is only the firſt in
Maids, the other three being made by the
broken Hymen. Theſe three when the
Sheath is extended diſappear in Labour, and
cannot be ſeen till the Sheath is contracted
to its natural ſtraitneſs.</p>
               <p>The Sheath near its outer Orifice, has a
Sphincter Muſcle about three fingers broad
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63569:39"/>
that contracts it as the caſe requires; and
therefore Men and Women need not doubt
but that their Genitals will be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
for the Sheath is ſo artificially made,
that it can ſuit with every Penis.</p>
               <p>The Womb is ſeated in the loweſt part of
the Belly, betwixt the Bladder and ſtraight
Gut, its hindmoſt part is looſe, that it
may be extended as the Child increaſes, but
its ſides are tied faſt by two pair of Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Its ſubſtance is whitiſh, nervous,
and compact in Virgins, but a little ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and ſoft in Women with Child. It has
two Membranes, the outer is ſtrong and
double ariſing from the Peritoneum, the
inner being proper is Fibrous and more
Porous. Betwixt theſe Membranes, there
is a certain fleſhy and fibrous contexture,
which in Women with Child, together
with the ſaid Membranes, imbibes ſo much
of the nutritious Humours, that then flow
thither, that the more the Child increaſes,
the more fleſhy, fibrous, and thick does the
Womb grow, ſo that in the laſt months it
is an inch thick, and ſome times two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
breadth, tho' it be extended to ſo much
greater compaſs, than it has when a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is not with Child, and yet within three
weeks after Delivery it is as thin as before,
and contracts ſo wonderfully, that it may
be held in ones hand. In Virgins it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63569:40"/>
two fingers breadth broad, and three
long; in thoſe that have Copulated, it is
a little bigger, it is like a Pear, only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
flattiſh above and below, but in Women
with Child it becomes more round. In
Maids its cavity is ſo ſmall, that it will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contain a large Hazel-nut; it is divided
be a Line that goes length-ways, much like
that in a Man's Cod. Its Arteries ſpring
partly from the Spermatick and Hypoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrick;
they run along the Womb, bending
and winding, that they may be extended
without danger of breaking, when the
Womb is ſtretched with the Child. The
monthly Courſes flow by theſe Arteries in
greateſt quantity into the Womb it ſelf:
But in leſs quantity by the Branches that
open into the Neck of the Womb, and a
ſmall quantity of the Courſes come out of
the Sheath. It is much diſputed what is the
reaſon of the Courſes, whether they flow
by reaſon of too great quantity of Blood,
or whether at ſet times; there is alſo a
fermentation of the Blood, which opens the
orifices of the Arteries: But it is moſt
probable that it proceeds from a fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at appointed times, for if a Woman
feeds high and ſo breeds much Blood, the
Courſes flow never the ſooner, tho' per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they may be in a greater quantity; and
if ſhe uſe the greateſt abſtinence and ſpare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63569:40"/>
of Diet, they will not be the longer
before they come, ſo that when through
ſuch effervency the Blood flows plentifully
into the Veſſels of the Womb, and the Veins
of the Womb are not able to carry it all
back again by Circulation, it flows out of
the extremities of the Arteries ſo long, till
the too great quantity of the Blood is leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened,
and the fermentation ceaſes, which it
does uſually after three or four days. The
Courſes ſeldom flow in Women with Child,
and the wanting of them is their firſt item
of having Conceived.</p>
               <p>The Veins ſpring from the Preparantes,
and from the Epigaſtrick, the Nerves from
the greateſt plexus of the meſentery of the
Intercoſtal Pair, and from the loweſt plex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
of the ſame, and alſo from the Nerves
of the Os Sacrum, and the ſame run alſo to
the Teſtes or Ovaria. Theſe plexus of
Nerves are chiefly affected in Hyſterick Fits,
and are Convulſive, and often happen when
the Womb is not at all in fault; and the
Ball that ſeems to riſe from the bottom of
the Belly in theſe Fits, and to beat ſtrongly
about the Navel, which is uſually ſuppoſed
to be the riſing of the Womb, is nothing
but a Convulſion of theſe Nerves; for ſome
Men are troubled with the ſame Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:63569:41"/>
The uſe of the Womb is to receive into
its capacity the principals of the formation
of the Fetus, to afford it nouriſhment, and
to preſerve it from injuries, and at length
to expel it.</p>
               <p>The neck of the Womb ſeems to be a
part of the Fundus, only it is much more
narrower, for its cavity is no wider in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
than a ſmall Quill, and in Women
with Child its inner orifice does either quite
cloſe its ſides together, or is daubed up with
a ſlimy yellowiſh Humour, ſo that nothing
then can enter into the Womb. It has the
ſame Membranes, and the ſame Veſſels
with the Womb.</p>
               <p>Womens Teſticles differ much from
Mens, their ſituation is within the Body, on
each ſide two fingers breadth from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Womb, to the ſides whereof
they are knit by a ſtrong Ligament; they
are flat on the ſides, in their lower part
oval; their Superficies is more rugged
and unequal, than in thoſe of Men, they
differ in bigneſs, according to Age; in
thoſe newly come to Maturity, they are
about half as big as thoſe of Men, but
in ſuch as are in Years, they are leſs
and harder, tho' they ſometimes grow
preternaturally to a vaſt bigneſs, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Quarts of Liquor has been found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in them, in a Dropſie of the Womb;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63569:41"/>
they have but one Membrane that encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
them round; but on their upper ſide
where the preparing Veſſels enter them,
they are about half way involved in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Membrane that accompanies thoſe
Veſſels, and ſprings from the Peritoneum;
when this cover is removed, their ſubſtance
appears whitiſh, but is wholly different from
Mens Teſticles; for Mens are compoſed of
Seminary Veſſels, which being continued to
one another are twenty or thirty Ells long, if
they could be drawn out at length without
breaking; but Womens do principally conſiſt
of a great many Membranes and ſmall Fibres,
looſly united to one another; among which
there are ſeveral little Bladders full of clear
water; the liquor contained in thoſe Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
has been always ſuppoſed by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> to be Seed
ſtored up in them; but Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi> and
many Learned Phyſicians and Anatomiſts
ſuppoſe theſe little Bladders to contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Seed, but that they are truly
Eggs, analogous to thoſe of Fowl and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Creatures, and that the Teſticles ſo
called are not truly ſo, nor have any ſuch
Office as thoſe of Men, but are indeed an
<hi>Ovarium,</hi> wherein thoſe Eggs are nouriſhed
by the ſanguinary Veſſels diſperſed through
them, and from whence one or more, as
they are fecundated by the Man's Seed, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63569:42"/>
and are conveyed into the Womb by
the Tubae Falopianae: If you boyl theſe Eggs
their Liquor will have the ſame colour,
taſt, and conſiſtency with the white of Birds
Eggs, and they do not want ſhells, becauſe
they are ſufficiently defended by the Womb.
Theſe Eggs in Women are commonly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the number of twenty in each Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
whereof ſome are far leſs than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The Spermatick Veſſels are of two ſorts;
Arteries and Veins; the Arteries are two
as in Men. They ſpring from the great
Artery a little below the Emulgents (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rarely either of them from the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
it ſelf) and paſs down towards the
Teſtes, not by ſuch a direct courſe as in
Men, but with much twirling and winding
among the Veins, with which they have
no inoſculation, as has been generally ſaid.
But for all their Winding, when they
are ſtretched out to their full length, they
are not ſo long as thoſe of Men. The
Veins are two, ariſing as in Men, the right
from the Trunk of the Cava, a little below
the Emulgent, and the left from the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
it ſelf, but they are much ſhorter
than in Men; both the Arteries and Veins
as they paſs down are covered with one
common Coat from the Peritoneum, and
near the Teſtes they are divided into two
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63569:42"/>
Branches, the upper whereof is implanted
into the Teſticle by a Triple-root, and
the other is ſubdivided below the Teſtes
into three twigs, one of which goes to
the bottom of the Womb, another to the
Tuba and round ligament, the third creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the ſide of the Womb, under its
common Membrane ends in its Neck,
where it is Woven with the Hypogaſtrick
Veſſels like a net. By this way it is that
the Courſes ſometimes flow in Women
with Child, for the firſt Months, and not
out of the inner Cavity of the Womb.</p>
               <p>The uſe of theſe Spermatick Veſſels is
not to Miniſter to the Generation of Seed,
according to the Ancient Doctrine, but to
the Nutrition of the Eggs in the <hi>Ovaria</hi>
or Teſtes, according to the new, and to
the nouriſhment of the Fetus, and of the
solid parts, and the expurgation of the
Courſes.</p>
               <p>The carrying Veſſels that go ſtraight
from the Teſtes to the bottom of the
Womb, and were ſuppoſed to emit the
Seed from the Stones into the bottom of
the Womb, are accounted by <hi>de Graef</hi> only
Ligaments of the Teſticles to keep them
in their place; for they come not to the
Inner Cavity of the VVomb. The Fallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian
Tubes are very ſlender and narrow
Ducts, nervous and white, ariſing from
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63569:43"/>
the horns or ſides of the VVomb, and at
a little diſtance from it they become lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and twiſt like the tendrel of a Vine,
till nearer their end, where ceaſing their
winding they turn very large, and ſeem
membranous and fleſhy, which end is very
much torn and jagged like rent Cloths,
and has a large Foramen, which lies
cloſed, becauſe thoſe jaggs fall together,
but it being opened, they are like the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Orifice of a Braſs Trumpet. Theſe
Tubes, according to Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> are the
ſame in VVomen, that the horns of the
VVomb are in other creatures, for they
anſwer to thoſe both in ſituation, connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
amplitude, perforation, likeneſs, and
alſo Office. The capacity of theſe Ducts
varies very much; for in the beginning, as
it goes out of the VVomb, it only admits
a Briſtle, but in its progreſs, where it is
largeſt, it will receive ones little finger;
but in the outmoſt extremity, where it is
divided into jaggs, it is but about a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo wide. They are very uncertain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in their length, for from four or five
they ſometimes increaſe to eight or nine
fingers breadth long. Their uſe is in a
fruitful Copulation to grant a paſſage to
a more ſubtile part of the Maſculine
Seed, or to a Seminal Air towards the
Teſtes to bedew the Eggs contained in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63569:43"/>
them, which Eggs, one or more being by
that means fecundated, and dropping off
from the Teſtes, are received by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of the Tubes, and carried along
the inner Cavity to the Womb. But it
may be objected that the narrowneſs of
the Tubes are not fit for ſuch a uſe; yet

               <p>COnception is nothing elſe but an action
of the Womb, whereby the prolifie
Seeds of the Man and Woman are there
received and retained, that an Infant may
be engendered, and formed out of it.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63569:44"/>
There are two ſorts of Conception, the
one true, according to Nature, to which
ſucceeds the Generation of the Infant in
the Womb; the other falſe, as a falſe
Conception, Mole, or any other ſtrange
Matter.</p>
               <p>It is not abſolutely neceſſary, that the
Mans Seed ſhould be received, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
entire; for a ſmall quantity of it may
be ſufficient, nay a meer ſteam of it, to
impregnat.</p>
               <p>Conception may be known by the more
than ordinary delight in the act, and
ſome few Months after, the Woman per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
a ſmall pain about her Navel, and
ſome little Commotions in the bottom of
her belly. The inward Orifice of the
Womb is exactly cloſed, ſhe longs for
ſtrange things, ſhe is often troubled with
Nauſeating and Vomiting, her Courſes are
ſtopt, the Navel ſtarts, her Nipples are
very obſcure or dark coloured, with a
yellowiſh circle round about, her eyes
are dejected and hollow, the Whites of
them dull and troubled, her Blood, when
ſhe has Conceived ſome time, is always
bad; the Belly is flat: Yet it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that ſome of theſe ſigns are
alſo to be found upon an Obſtruction of
the Courſes in Virgins; wherefore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon Conception muſt not be too
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63569:44"/>
poſitive, eſpecially, when the Woman is
upon tryal for her life, for ſome upon
having their Courſes have been judged not
with Child, and yet after Execution have
been found to be ſo.</p>
               <p>The Infant moves it ſelf manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the forth Month, ſooner or later as
the Woman is ſtrong or weak. Some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
feel it from the ſecond, others about

are very ſmall, but grow greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably,

               <p>A Mole is deformed and uſeleſs Fleſh
contained in the Womb, and is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by the corrupted Seed of the Man
and Woman, for it is never generated
without the uſe of Copulation; it is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with a Membrane and ſticks to the
Womb, the longer it is retained in the
Womb the harder it grows, and is more
difficultly expelled: Moſt commonly there
is but one, yet ſometimes more; when it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63569:45"/>
is ejected in the ſecond Month it's called
a falſe Conception.</p>
               <p>It's difficult to diſtinguiſh a Mole, from
being with Child, for the Courſes are ſtopt,
the Belly grows big by degrees, and the
Breaſts are increaſed. But the firſt ſign of
it is a leaden colour in the Face, the Belly
is harder and ſorer than when a Woman
is with Child, and it is very troubleſome
and painful to go with, and it falls on
whatſoever ſide ſhe turns; there is a great
wearineſs in her Legs and Thighs, ſhe
finds a great heavineſs at the bottom of
her Belly, and her Urin is obſtructed; but
it may be certainly known, if no motion
be felt after four or five Months, or when
her Reckoning is out. Some have a Mole
two or three Years, and ſometimes much
longer.</p>
               <p>As to the Cure, I ſhall ſpeak only of that
part of it which may be performed by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
for if it ſtick much to the bottom of
the Womb, or is very large, it will ſcarce
be expelled unleſs a Chyrurgeon extract
it.</p>
               <p>Give the Woman a Spoonful of Syrup of
Mugwort Morning and Evening for three
days following, either by it ſelf or mixt
with an Ounce of Penny-royal-water; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Purge her every other day, or every

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63569:45"/>
or a Dram may be taken at a time early in

till they begin to work; let her be purged
in this manner five times.</p>
               <p>Things that looſen muſt be alſo applied
frequently to the Womb to open the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages

               <p>THere is a great diſpute whether a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who hath two or more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at once, conceived of them at one
or ſeveral coitions: Some will have this
to be ſuperfoetation; but there are ſigns
whereby we may know the difference, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
both Children were begotten at once,
or ſucceſſively one after another. Supefoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> is a rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
Conception, when a Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already with Child conceives again the
ſecond time. That which makes many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that there can be no Superfoetation
is, becauſe as ſoon as a Woman has Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
her Womb cloſes, and is exactly
firm, ſo that the Seed of the Man, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary to Conception, finding no place
nor entry, cannot, as they ſay, be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
nor contained in it: But it may be
anſwered, that tho' the Womb be uſually
exactly ſhut and cloſe, when a Woman
has Conceived, yet it may be ſometimes
opened to let paſs ſome ferous ſlimy Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or eſpecially when a Woman is
much delighted in the act of Copulation.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63569:46"/>
But this ſecond Conception is very rare;
for we muſt not imagine, that when a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
brings forth two or more Children
at once, there is a Superfoetation; becauſe
they are almoſt always begot in the ſame
act, by the reception of abundance of Seed
into the Womb.</p>
               <p>When a Woman brings forth one or
more Children at a Birth, begotten at
once, which are uſually called Twins, it is
known by their being both almoſt of an
equal bigneſs and thickneſs, and by having
but one common after-birth, not ſeparated
one from the other, but by their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes:
But if there are ſeveral Children,
and a Superfoetation, they will not have a
common burthen, nor will they be of an
equal bigneſs.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Of a hundred Women that

burthen common to them both, which is a

contain'd in them, of the um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical
Veſſels, of the parts of a Child
that differ from thoſe of the adult.</head>
               <p>THE Womb-Cake, otherwiſe called
the Womb-Liver, for the likeneſs of
ſubſtance, is ſoft, and has innumerable Fibres
and ſmall Veſſels; it is two Fingers breadth,
thick in its middle, but thinner near the
edges, and a quarter of a Yard over from
one ſide to the other, when the Infant is
near the Birth; on that ſide next the Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
it is ſmooth and ſomething hollowiſh,
like Navelwort, and is knit to the Chori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but on that next the Womb, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unequal, having a great many bunchings,
whereby it ſticks faſt to the Womb.
VVhen there is but one Child in the Womb,
it is but one; but if there be Twins there
are two Womb-Cakes, and a particular
rope of Umbilical Veſſels is inſerted into
each from each Child; it grows not out of
the Womb originally, but its firſt rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
appear like a woolly ſubſtance on
the outſide of the outer Membrane that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63569:47"/>
inveſts the Embrio called Chorion, about
the eighth or ninth Week, upon which in
a ſhort while a red fleſhly and ſoft ſubſtance
grows, but unequally and a little in knobs,
and then it preſently thereby ſticks to
the Womb, and is very conſpicuous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the twelfth or thirteenth Week, till
now the Infant is increaſed and nouriſhed
wholly by the appoſition of the Criſtalline
or albugineous liquor, wherein it ſwims
looſe in the inner Membrane, called <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios,</hi>
having no Umbilical Veſſels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to receive any thing from the Womb-Cake.
But when it grows bigger, and
begins to want nouriſhment, the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Umbilical Veſſels begin to grow
out of the Navel by little and little, and
are extended towards the Womb-cake, that
they may draw out of it a more nouriſhing
juice, and carry it to the Infant, as Plants
do from the Earth by their roots. It has
Veſſels from the Womb and from the
Chorion; the former are of four kinds,
Arteries, Veins, Nerves, and Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts;
all which tho' they be very large,
and viſible in the Womb, and alſo where
the Womb-Cake is joyned to it, yet they
ſend the ſmalleſt Capilaries to the Womb
it ſelf. Thoſe that come from the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion
are Arteries and Veins. The Arteries
and Veins that come from the Womb,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63569:48"/>
ſpring from the Hypogaſtricks, and alſo
that branch of the Supermaticks that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
into the bottom of the Womb;
thoſe that come from the Chorion are the
Umbilical Veſſels of the Infant. The
Womb-Cake after it is joyned to the
Womb, ſticks moſt firmly to it for the firſt
Months, as unripe Fruit does to the Tree,
but as the Infant becomes bigger and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and nearer to the Birth, by ſo much
the more eaſily will it part from the
Womb, and at length it falls out of the
Womb, and makes part of the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth.</p>
               <p>Next to the Womb-Cake follow the two
Membranes, <hi>viz.</hi> Chorion the outer, and
Amnios the inner, wherein the Child is
wrapt: Betwixt theſe two after the Child
is perfectly formed, there is a third, <hi>viz.</hi>
Allantois. The Chorion is pretty thick,
ſmooth on the inſide, but without ſomewhat
unequal and rough, and in that part of it
which ſticks to the Womb-cake, and by it
to the Womb, it has very many Veſſels
which ſpring from the Womb it ſelf and
the Umbilical Veſſels. Twins are both
incloſed in one Chorion, but have each a
particular Amnios; it inveſts the Egg or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally,
which Egg being brought to the
Womb, and becoming a Conception, this
Membrane imbibes the moiſture that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dews
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63569:48"/>
the Womb plentifully at that time.
This Liquor that it imbibes, is thought
to be the Nutritious Juice that ouzes out of
the Capilary Orifices of the Hypogaſtrick
and Spermatick Arteries, and is of the
ſame nature with that which afterward is
ſeparated in the Womb-cake, and carried
to the Infant by the Umbilical Vein; and
with that alſo which abounds in the Amnios
even till the Birth.</p>
               <p>The Amnios is the inmoſt Membrane
that immediately contains the Child; it is
not knit to the Chorion in any place ſave
where the Umbilical Veſſels paſs through
them both into the Womb-cake; it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thin, ſoft, ſmooth, and pellucid, and
encompaſſes the Infant very looſly, it has
Veſſels from the ſame Origins as the Chori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
From a limpid Liquor contained in
this Membrane, the firſt lineaments of the
Embrio are drawn. But becauſe this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
is ſo very little, there ſweats through
this Membrane preſently part of that Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious
Albugineous Humour that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Chorion, which it had imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
out of the Womb, and by the addition
of this Humour to the undiſcernible Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
of the Embrio, it receives its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.
But tho' the Amnios have its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Nutricious Liquor at firſt only by
Tranſudation, yet when the Umbilical
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63569:49"/>
Veſſels, and the Womb-cakes are formed, it
receives it after another manner, for then
being ſeparated from the Mothers Arteries
by the Placenta, and imbibed by the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilical
Veins of the Infant paſſes directly to
its Heart, from whence being driven a
great part of it down the Aorta, it is ſent
forth again by the Umbilical Arteries, out
of whoſe Capillaries diſperſed plentifully
through the Amnios, it iſſues into its cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
A third Membrane which inveſts the
whole Infant is the Allantoides; it has the
ſame Figure as the Chorion and Amnios,
betwixt which it is placed in their whole
circumference. Now, tho' it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that this as well as the other two is
originally in the Egg, yet there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of it, till after the Umbilical
Veſſels and the Womb-cake are formed,
and the albugineous Liquor ceaſes to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
by the Chorion out of the Uterus; but
as ſoon as the Infant begins to be nouriſhed
by the Umbilical Veſſels, and the Urachus is
permeable, then preſently this Membrane
begins to ſhew it ſelf, containing a very
thin Liquor, which is the Urine of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
brought into it by the Urachus, and
wherewith it is filled daily more and more
till the Birth: It may be known from the
Chorion and Amnios by this, that they have
numerous Veſſels diſperſed through them;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63569:49"/>
but this has not the leaſt viſible Vein or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
it is very hard to ſeparate the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion
from it, but towards the Birth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
ſo turgid with Urine, that the Amni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os
which immediately contains the Infant,
ſwims <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> Office of ſeparating
the Serum from the Blood, for otherwiſe
it would be affected with an Anſarca; I
ſay, the Serum is ſeparated in the Kidneys,
and glides down from thence into the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
wherein there is a pretty large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
when the Infant is five or ſix months
old: Now it flows not out of the Bladder by
its orifice, becauſe at that time the Sphincter
is too contracted and narrow, and if it
ſhould paſs that way, it would mix with
the nouriſhing juice wherein the Infant
ſwims in the Amnios, and wherewith by
taking it in by its mouth, it is partly nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
and ſo would defile and corrupt it.
Nature therefore has provided it another
paſſage by the Urachus inſerted into the
bottom of the Bladder, which tho it grows
ſolid like a Ligament after the Child is
Born, as the umbilical Vein does, yet
while the Infant is in the Womb, it is open
and conveighs the Urine into the Allantoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63569:50"/>
that is placed betwixt the Chorion
and Amnios, where it is collected and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
till the Birth.</p>
               <p>The Naval-ſtring is membraneous, wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,
and unequal, and ariſes from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;
it reaches to the Womb-cake; it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
half an Ell long, and a finger thick,
The Veſſels contained in this ſtring, and
covered with the common coat called Funi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus
are four, one Vein, two Arteries,
and the Urachus; the Vein is larger than the
Aretries, and ariſes from the Liver of the
Infant at the trunk of the Vena porta, and
from thence paſſing out of the Navel it
runs along the Funiculus to the Womb-cake,
into which it is implanted by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Roots; but before it reaches it,
it ſends ſome little twigs into the Amnios.
The umbilical Vein ſerves for conveying to
the Infant the nutricious juice ſeparated in
the Womb-cake from the Mothers Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
but together with this juice returns
ſo much of the Arterial blood, that comes
from the Infant, as is not ſpent upon the
nouriſhment of the Womb-cake, or of the
Chorion and Amnios.</p>
               <p>In the Funiculus are included alſo two
Arteries, which are not both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ſo big as the Vein; they ſpring out
of the inner Iliacal branches of the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and paſſing by the ſides of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63569:50"/>
they riſe up to the Navel, out of
which they are conducted to the Womb-cake,
in the ſame common cover with the
Vein and Urachus wherewith they are twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and wreathed like a Rope. Spirituous
blood is driven from the Infant by the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of its Heart to the Womb-cake, and
the Membranes, for nouriſhment, from
which, what Blood remains circulates back
again to the umbilical Vein together with
nutricious juice, imbibed afreſh by its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillaries
diſperſed in the Womb-cake. But
beſides Arterial Blood, there flows out of
the Navel by them part of the Nutricious
juice, that was imported by the umbilical
Vein, I ſay flows out by theſe Arteries, which
by their branches, that are diſperſed
through the Amnios, diſcharge it by their
little mouths into it. The fourth Umbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Veſſel is the Urachus, or Urinary Veſſel,
it is a ſmall, membranous, round Pipe indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a ſtraight cavity ariſing from the
bottom of the Bladder up to the Navel;
out of which it paſſes along within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cover and opens into the Allantoides.
Theſe four Veſſels, as has been ſaid above,
have one common cover, which alſo keeps
each of them from touching the other; it is
called Funiculus; it is membranous, round
and hollow, indifferent thick, conſiſting of
a double coat, the inner from the Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63569:51"/>
and the outer from the Paniculus
carnoſus. It has ſeveral knots, which Dr.
<hi>Wharton</hi> thinks are little Glands, through
which the nutricious juice diſtills out of the
capacity of the Funiculus into the cavity of
the Amnios.</p>
               <p>Midwives gueſs by their number how
many more Children the Mother ſhall have,
but without reaſon. When the Infant is
Born, its Navel-rope is wont to be tyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one or two fingers breadth from the
Navel, with a ſtrong Thread caſt about it
ſeveral times, and then about two or three
fingers breadth beyond the Ligature to be
cut off; what is not cut off is ſuffered
to remain till it drop off of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p>As to the way how the Infant is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
there has been great Diſputes, ſome
affirm by Blood only, and that received by
the Umbilical Vein, others by Chile only
received in by the Mouth; but indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different degrees of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that an Egg paſſes from Conception to
an Infant ready for the Birth, it is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
variouſly. For, Firſt, As ſoon as an
Egg Impregnated deſcends into the Womb,
it preſently imbibes through its outer
Membrane ſome of that albugineous Liquor,
that at this time plentifully bedews the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Superfices of the Womb, ſo that as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63569:51"/>
ſoon as the firſt Lineaments of an Embryo
begin to be drawn, out of that Humour
contained in the Amnios, they preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
increaſe by the appoſition of the
ſaid Liquor filtrated out of the Chorion
through the Amnios into its cavity; and
this ſame Liquor, that thus increaſes the
firſt rudiments of the Embryo, Dr. <hi>Harvey</hi>
calls Coliquamentum. But when the parts
of the Embryo begin to be a little more
perfect, and the Chorion becomes ſo denſe,
that not any more of the ſaid Liquor is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed
by it, the Umbilical Veſſels begin to
be formed, and to extend to the ſide of the
Amnios which they penetrate, and both
the Vein and Arteries paſs alſo through the
Allantois and Chorion, and are implanted
into the Womb-Cake, that at this time,
firſt gathering upon the Chorion joins it
to the Womb; and now the Hypogaſtrick
and Spermatick Arteries, that before caſt
the nutricious Juice into the cavity of the
Womb, open by the orifices into the
Womb-cake, where they depoſite the ſaid
juice, which is abſorded by the Umbilical
Vein, and by it conveyed, firſt to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
then to the Heart of the Infant, where
the thinner and the more ſpirituous part of
it is turn'd into Blood; but the more groſs
and earthy part of it deſcending by the
Aorta enters the Umbilical Arteries, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63569:52"/>
by thoſe branches of them, that run
through the Amnios, is diſcharged into
its cavity.</p>
               <p>The groſſer nutricious Juice being depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
by the Umbilical Arteries in the Amni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,
as ſoon as the Mouth, Gullet, and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and the like are formed ſo perfectly,
that the Foetus can ſwallow, it ſucks in ſome
of the ſaid Juice, which deſcending into
the Stomach and Inteſtines, is received by
the Lacteal Veins, as in grown Perſons.
The Infant therefore is nouriſhed three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways, but only by one Humour: Firſt,
by appoſition of it, while it is yet an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Embrio, and has not the Umbilical
Veſſels formed: But after theſe are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
it then receives the ſame nutricious
Juice by the Umbilical Vein, the more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
and thin part whereof it changes
into Blood, and ſends forth the groſſer part
by the Umbilical Artery into the Amnios,
which the Infant ſucks in at its Mouth,
and undergoing a new Concoction in its
ſtomach, is received out of the Inteſtines
by the Lacteal Veins, as is done after the
birth.</p>
               <p>A Child in the Womb differs from an
adult Perſon in many parts, the parts are
leſs, the colour of the whole reddiſh, the
Bones ſoft, and many of them griſtly and
flexible in the Head: There are ſeveral
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63569:52"/>
differences: Firſt, the Head, in reſpect to
the proportion of the reſt of the Body,
is bigger, the Crown is not covered with
Bone, but only with a Membrane; the
Bone of the Forehead is divided, as alſo
of the under Jaw, and the Os Cuneiforme
is divided into four. The Bone of the
hinder part of the Head is diſtinguiſhed
into three, four or five Bones. The Brain
is ſofter, and more fluid, and the Nerves
very ſoft. The Bones that ſerve the Senſe
of Hearing are wonderfully hard and big;
the Teeth lie hid in the little holes of
the Jaw-bone; the Dugs ſwell, and out of
them in Infants new born, whether Male
or Female, a ſerous Milk iſſues forth
ſometimes of its own accord, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with a gentle preſſure: The Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae
of the Back want their ſpinous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
and each of them made of three
diſtinct Bones: The Heart is remarkably
big, and its Auriculae large: There are
two Unions of the greater Veſſels, that are
not conſpicuous in grown Perſons: Firſt,
the Foramen ovale, by which there is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
open, out of the Cava into the Vein
of the Lungs, juſt as each of them are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening,
the firſt into the right Ventricle,
and the latter into the left Ventricle of the
Heart, and this Foramen, juſt as it opens
into the Vein of the Lungs has a Valve
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63569:53"/>
that hinders any thing from returning out
of the ſaid Vein into the Foramen: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Arterial Channel, which two
fingers breadth from the Baſis of the Heart
joyns the Artery of the Lungs to the Aorta;
it has a pretty lage Cavity, and aſcends a
little obliquely from the ſaid Artery to
the Aorta, into which it conveys the
Blood, that was driven into the Artery of
the Lungs, out of the right Ventricle of
the Heart, ſo that it never comes into the
left Ventricle, as the Blood that is ſent
out of the left Venticle into the Aorta ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came in the right, except a little that
is returned from the nutrition of the Lungs,
but paſt immediately into it out of the
Vena Cava by the Foramen ovale, ſo that
the Blood paſſes not through both the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles,
as it does after the Child is born.
You may know whether Infants killed by
Whores, and which they commonly affirm
were ſtill-born, were really ſo or no, by
putting the Lungs of the Infant in Water;
for if they were ſtill-born the Lungs will
ſink, if alive, ſo as to breath never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while, they will ſwim. The Gland
Thymus is very large, and conſiſts as it
were of three Glands; the Umbilical Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
go out of the Abdomen; the Stomach
is narrower, but pretty full of a whitiſh
liquor: The Caul is ſcarce viſible, the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63569:53"/>
Guts are ſeventimes longer than the Body;
the Excrements in the ſmall Guts are fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
and yellow, but in the thick ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hard and blackiſh, ſometimes green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh;
the Caecum is larger than uſual, and
often fill'd with Faeces: the Liver is very
large, and extends it ſelf into the left ſide,
and covers all the upper part of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
it has a paſſage, which is not in
grown Perſons, called the Veiny Channel,
which ariſing out of the Sinus of the Porta,
carries the greateſt part of what is brought
by the Umbilical Vein directly, and in a
full ſtream into the Cava above the Liver:
But this paſſage preſently cloſes, as ſoon
as the Infant is born, and turns to a liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as doth the Urachus and the two
Umbilical Arteries. The Spleen is ſmall;
the Gall-bladder is full of yellow or green
Choler; the Sweet-bread is very large and
white; the Kidneys are bigger and unequal
in their Superficies; the Renes Succentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riati
are exceeding large; the Ureters
are wide, and the Bladder ſtretched with
Urine; in Females the VVomb is depreſſed,
the Tubes long, and the Teſtes very large;
the little Bones of the VVriſts and Inſtep
are griſtly, and not firmly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Its Knees are drawn up to the Belly,
its Legs bending backwards, its Feet acroſs,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63569:54"/>
and its Hands lifted up to its head, one of
which it holds to the Temple or Ear, the
other to the Cheek, where there are white
ſpots on the Skin, as if it had been rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
upon; the Back-bone turns round,
the Head hanging down towards its Knees,
its Face commonly towards the Mothers
Back; but near the birth, ſometimes a
VVeek or two before, it alters its ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and tumbles down with its Head to
the Neck of the VVomb, and its Feet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
then the VVomb alſo ſettles down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and its Orifice relaxes, and opens;
and the Infant moving up and down tears
the Membrans wherein it is included, and the
waters flowing into the Sheath; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Membranes come forth whole; at
the ſame time the neighbouring parts are
looſened and become fit for diſtenſion, and
the Bones near are ſo much relaxed in their
Joynts, that they make way for the Infant,
and the motion of it ſo much diſturbs the
VVomb, that the Fibres of it and the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Belly contract altogether to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
it.</p>

Child.</head>
               <p>THE Woman ought to be kept in a
good moderate and clear Air, and ſhe
muſt Eat what ſhe likes beſt, and be ſure
not to Faſt too long; only ſhe muſt obſerve
not to eat too much at a time; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the Stomach, which is always weak in
this condition, ſhe may Drink a little
Wine, or for want of it ſtrong Beer at
Meals. As to Sleep, a Woman with Child
requires more ſleep than ſhe does at other
times. As to Exerciſe and Reſt, ſhe muſt
order her ſelf according to the different
times; for at the beginning ſhe ought to
keep her ſelf quiet, and not to uſe Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Riding on Horſe-back, or in a Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
or indeed in a Coach is not ſafe at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
time of her being with Child, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when ſhe is near her time, for ſuch Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
often cauſe Miſcarriage. But ſhe
may Walk gently, or be carried in a Chair.
She muſt not carry or lift heavy Burdens,
or lift up her Arms too high, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to dreſs her own Head. Let
her Exerciſe be gentle walking in low-heel'd
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63569:55"/>
Shoes; but ſhe had better Reſt too much
than Exerciſe too much, for more hard La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
are occaſioned by violent Exerciſe
than by any other thing. Moreover, it is
convenient that the Woman ſhould abſtain
from Copulation the laſt two months, for
the Body is very much moved, and the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compreſſed in the action, which cauſes
the Child to take a wrong poſture.</p>
               <p>If the Belly be bound, as it is often at
this time, Prunes ſtewed, or Veal Broath
may be often uſed, or the following Gliſter
may be uſed.</p>
               <p>Boyl an Handful of Mallow Leaves, in
three quarters of a Pint of Milk, let the Milk
juſt boyl up, add to it two Ounces of brown
Sugar, and a little freſh Butter, ſtrain it for
uſe.</p>
               <p>She muſt moderate her Paſſions, and great
care muſt be taken that ſhe be not Frighted,
and that Melancholy News be not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told her, but you muſt endeavour to
keep her as chearful as poſſibly you can, the
ſudden ſurprizes of joy muſt be alſo avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for exceſſes on either hand are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial.
The Cloaths of a Woman with
Child ſhould ſit eaſie, for any immoderate
preſſure is apt to make the Child deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and hurts the Breaſts, and very often
cauſes miſcarriage. Unneceſſary Bleeding
muſt be avoided, ſo muſt all ſtrong Purges
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63569:55"/>
but if Purging is requiſite, only ſuch things
as Purge gently muſt be uſed, as Caſſia,
Rubarb, and Manna. The Caſſia is beſt
ſucked out of the Canes, the Rubarb may
be chewed, and an Ounce and a half or
two Ounces of Manna may be diſſolved in
Poſſet-drink, and uſed upon occaſion in the
Morning.</p>
               <p>Vomiting often afflicts Women with
Child, but if it be moderate and at the
beginning and without great ſtraining it is
beneficial; if it continues longer than the
third or fourth Month it ought to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died;
in order to which let the Woman
uſe good food, and a little at a time, and
let her uſe with her meat the juice of Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
ſhe may eat now and then Broth mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the yolk of an Egg, for it's very
nouriſhing and of eaſie digeſtion, and after
meals let her eat a little Marmalade of
Quinces, and ſhe may drink a Glaſs of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret;
ſhe muſt forbear fat meat and Sauces,
and ſweet and ſugar'd Sauces. But if the
Vomiting continues notwithſtanding this
regular Diet till the Woman is above half
gon, ſhe muſt take the following Purge.</p>
               <p>Take of Tamarinds half an Ounce, of Sena
one Dram, of Rubarb one Dram and an half,
boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of water, in
three Ounces of the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve an
Ounce of Manna, and an Ounce of Syrup of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63569:56"/>
Succory with Rubarb; make a purging potion
to be taken in the Morning. It may be repeated
once or oftener upon occaſion.</p>
               <p>And it may be proper for the Woman in
the Winter time to were a Lambskin or
the like upon her Stomach and Belly.</p>
               <p>If pains of the Back, Reins and Hips are
violent, the Woman muſt be blooded, and
take at bed-time ſixteen drops of the Liquid
Laudanum mentioned at the latter end of
the Chapter of Hyſteric Diſeaſes in a glaſs
of Canary Wine, or in any thing elſe ſhe
likes, and ſhe muſt keep her Bed till the
pain abates; if the pain is continual, the
Belly muſt be ſupported with a Swaith fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If after the third or fourth Month the
Breaſts are very painful, 'tis convenient
the Woman ſhou'd bleed in the Arm, if
ſhe be full of blood, and uſe a Diet that is
moderately cooling and nouriſhing; but if
the pain comes at the beginning, we ought
to leave the whole buſineſs to nature, only
the Woman muſt have a care that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
no blows on thoſe parts, nor muſt
ſhe be ſtrait laced, for fear the Breaſts
ſhou'd impoſtumate.</p>
               <p>If incontinence or difficulty of Urin be
occaſion'd by the weight and bigneſs of the
Belly, the Woman may remedy it, and
eaſe her ſelf, if when ſhe wou'd make wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63569:56"/>
ſhe lift up with both her hands the
bottom of her Belly, or ſhe may wear a
large Swaith fitted for this uſe, to bear up
the Belly, but the beſt way is to keep her
in Bed.</p>
               <p>If a ſharpneſs of Urin cauſes an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
on the Neck of the Bladder, it may
be appeaſed by a regular cooling Diet, and
emulſions of the cold Seeds uſed Morning
and Evening.</p>
               <p>Take of blanched Almonds number twelve,
of the four greater cold Seeds each one Dram
and an half, of the Seeds of Lettice and white
Poppies each half a Dram, beat them in a
Marble Mortar, and pour on them gently three
quarters of a pint of Poppy Water, make an
emulſion for two doſes, add one Ounce of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
of Violets and half a Dram of Sal Prunella.</p>
               <p>If the Inflammation and Sharpneſs of
Urine be not removed by the things above-mention'd,
a little Blood may be taken
from the Arm, and the neck of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>Take of the roots of Marſh-mallows one

Pellitory, and Violets, each one handful,
of the Flowers of Melilote one handful, of the
Seeds of Flax and Fenugreek each two Drams,

But if the Woman notwithſtanding ſhe
obſerves theſe directions cannot make wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it muſt be drawn out with a Catheter

               <p>If the Woman be troubled with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Cough ſhe muſt be blooded in the Arm
at any time of her being with Child, for
this is apt to occaſion miſcarriage, and all
ſalted and ſpiced meat and ſharp things
muſt be forborn. She may now and then
uſe juice of Liquoriſh, Sugar Candy, and
Syrup of Violets, and if the Body be bound
a Gliſter of Milk and Sugar may be inject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The following Syrup is very proper
in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Take half a pint of Claret Wine, one Dram
of Cinnamon, half a Dozen Cloves, and four
Ounces of Sugar, burn the Wine, and boyl it
to the conſiſtence of a Syrup, whereof let the
Woman take three ſpoonfuls at Bedtime.</p>
               <p>The Woman muſt go looſe in her
Clothes, and if the Rheum be very thin,
and the Cough tickles much, Sixteen drops
of the Liquid Laudanum mentioned in the
Chapter of Hyſteric Diſeaſes muſt be now
and then taken at bedtime in ſome liquor
ſhe uſes to drink.</p>
               <p>If the Legs and Thighs ſwell and are
painful, they muſt be ſwaithed with a
Swaith three or four Fingers broad, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to ſwaith from the bottom; but in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63569:57"/>
this caſe 'tis beſt for the Woman to be
kept in Bed; if there be ſigns of fulneſs of
blood, ſhe muſt be blooded in the Arm.</p>
               <p>If the big bellied Woman be troubled
with the Piles, and abound with Blood,
ſhe muſt be blooded in the Arm, and if her
Body is Coſtive, the emollient Glyſter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
above muſt be uſed, and afterwards
to eaſe the Pain they muſt be anointed oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
with Populean Ointment mixt with a
few Grains of Opium: For inſtance,</p>
               <p>Take of Populean Ointment one Dram, of
Opium five Grains, beat them well together in
a Mortar, and anoint the Piles with it twice or
thrice a day.</p>
               <p>But if the Inflammation and the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

the part affected, and let her keep her
Bed.</p>
               <p>If the Piles bleed of themſelves immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
(for if the Flux be moderate at
this time the Woman being full of Blood
ſhe may be relieved thereby) a cooling and

as three parts of Fountain water, and one

roaſted Apples, Barly-broths, and the like,
alſo thickning and cooling Juleps and Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>Take of the Waters of Plantain and Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
hordeated each four Ounces, of diſtilled
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63569:58"/>
Vinegar half an Ounce, of True-bole and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons-blood

Fits thirty drops, of Syrup of Myrtles one
Ounce and an half, mix them and make a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep,
let her take four or five Spoonfuls every

               <p>Take of the four greater cold Seeds, each

Emulſion, to which add three Drams of pearled
Sugar, and half an Ounce of the Juice of Cevil
Orange, mingle them, let her take four Ounces
thrice a day.</p>
               <p>Bleeding in the Arm is alſo proper in
this caſe to turn the Flux.</p>
               <p>If a looſneſs comes upon a Woman with
Child, and continues above five days, ſhe
muſt uſe Food of eaſie digeſtion and little

Wine mixt with Water, wherein Iron has
been quenched, and now and then Milk
boyl'd with thrice the quantity of Water,
or the white Decoction made in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
manner.</p>
               <p>Take of Calcined Harts-horn powder'd two

till half is conſumed, ſtrain it gently through
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63569:58"/>
a linnen rag, and add to it three Ounces of
Syrup of Quinces.</p>
               <p>And before Meals ſhe may eat a little
Marmalade of Quinces. But note, that
before ſhe uſes theſe aſtringents, it will be
convenient to purge off the ill humours with
the following Potion.</p>
               <p>Take of Rubarb one Dram and a half, of
Sena two Drams, boyl them in a ſufficient
quantity of Water, to three Ounces of ſtrain'd
Liquor, add one Ounce of Syrup of Succory
with Rubarb, and two Drams of Cinnamon-water.
Let it be taken in the Morning.</p>
               <p>But if the Looſneſs turn to the Bloody-flux,
the caſe is very dangerous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after the uſe of the purging Potion
above mention'd, if the Woman has
ſtrength enough to bear it, you muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
give ſixteen drops of the Liquid

in two or three Spoonfuls of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-water
hordeated or the like, which
muſt be repeated every night at bedtime,
and in the Morning too, if the Flux con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
violent, and to keep up the ſtrength
four or five Spoonfuls of the following Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep
may be taken often.</p>
               <p>Take of the Waters of Black-cherries and
Strawberries each four Ounces, of Epidemic
water and Compound Scordium-water, and of
Cinnamon-water hordeated each one Ounce, of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63569:59"/>
Pearls prepared one Dram and an half, of
Chryſtaline Sugar a Sufficient quantity, make
a Julep.</p>
               <p>The VVomans Drink in this caſe muſt be
the Milk water, or the white Decoction
above deſcribed, and when ſhe is very
weak, ſhe may take for her ordinary Drink,
a quart of Fountain water boyl'd with half
a pint of Sack; and ſhe may eat ſometimes
Panada, and ſometimes Broth made of lean
Mutton, and ſhe muſt be kept in Bed:
Moreover a Gliſter made of half a pint of
Cows Milk, and an Ounce and an half of
Venice-treacle muſt be injected daily.</p>
               <p>If the VVoman has her Courſes after
the fourth or fifth Month of her being with
Child (for ſome VVomen have them till the
Fifth Month, without any manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to themſelves or their Children)
you muſt endeavour to ſtop them then, and
before too if you ſuppoſe they ſlow by
reaſon of the heat and acrimony of the
Blood, or the weakneſs of the Veſſels, and
not from an abundance of Blood, which
may be known by her having her Courſes
much when ſhe was not with Child.</p>
               <p>To ſtop this Flux, the VVoman muſt be
kept in bed, and forbear all things that
may heat the Blood, eſpecially anger; ſhe
muſt uſe a ſtrengthening and cooling Diet,
feeding on Meat that breeds good blood
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63569:59"/>
and thickens it, as Broths made of Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Necks of Mutton, Knuckles of Veal,
wherein may be boyl'd cooling Herbs; ſhe
may eat new lay'd Eggs, Gellies, Rice-milk,
Barly-broth, and the like, and Iron
muſt be quenched in her Beer, and ſhe muſt
forbear Copulation, and the Belly muſt be
bathed about the region of the VVomb with
Tent, wherein Pomegranate-peel, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence
Roſes and Cinnamon has been boyl'd.</p>
               <p>But if the VVoman be taken with Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the caſe is extreamly hazardous, and
if it continues violent, ſhe muſt be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
without delay, for otherwiſe death
will neceſſarily follow: Yet it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it muſt not be done preſently as
ſoon as the Flux is perceived, becauſe ſome
ſmall Floodings have been ſometimes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by keeping quiet in bed, by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Arm, and the uſe of Remedies
above mention'd: If therefore the Blood
flows, but in a ſmall quantity, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
but a little while, ſhe muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered;
but if it flows in ſo great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
that ſhe falls into Convulſions and
Faintings, the Operation muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
whether ſhe has pains and throws
or not.</p>
               <p>And becauſe in Floodings, weakneſs and
faintings ever follow, we muſt endeavour
to preſerve that little ſtrength the VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63569:60"/>
has left, and to increaſe it if poſſible,
that ſo ſhe may be able to bear the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
to which purpoſe there ought to be
given her from time to time good ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
Broths, Gellies, and a little good
VVine, ſhe muſt always ſmell to Vinegar,
and have a warm toaſt dipt in VVine and
Cinnamon appli'd to the region of her heart,
which do her more good than ſolid Food,
and to prevent the Blood from flooding in
great abundance before ſhe can be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
a Vein in her Arm may be open'd to
turn the courſe of it, and Napkins dipt
in VVater and Vinegar may be apply'd all
along her Reins.</p>
               <p>If the Woman be troubled with a bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of the Womb, her beſt way is
to keep in Bed; but if ſhe cannot conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
do ſo, ſhe muſt wear a broad
Swaith to keep up her Belly; but if the
bearing down proceeds from humours that
relax the Ligaments of the VVomb, ſhe
muſt be kept to a drying Diet, her Food
being rather roaſted than boyl'd, and muſt
refrain from Copulation and muſt not be
ſtrait Laced.</p>
               <p>If the lips of the Privities are much
ſwelled, by reaſon of watery humours fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon them, you muſt ſcarifie with a
Lancet all along the Lips, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
may diſtil out, and you muſt fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

the Parts with the following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
               <p>Take of the leaves of Bays, Sage, Roſemary,
and of the Flowers of Camomile each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
boyl them in a Sufficient quantity of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

               <p>If an ill habit of body and ill humours

               <p>The peculiar Diſeaſes of the VVomb, as
over great Moiſture, Swellings, Ulcers,

let the Woman be purged with

               <p>If a Swelling be the cauſe, you muſt

But if an Ulcer be the cauſe, the cure of it
muſt be performed by ſtopping the Fluxion
of the humours, and by cleanſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinating
the Ulcer; and firſt if the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
abound with Blood, or if the Ulcer be

times of the Courſes, to leſſen them, for

of Oxymel of ſquills half an Ounce, mingle

draught of Poſſet Drink after every time ſhe
Vomits.</p>
               <p>The days the Sick does not Purge, a

               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:63569:63"/>
Take of the leaves of Agrimony, Knot-graſs,

one Dram, of Raiſins half an Ounce, of red
Sanders one Scruple, boyl them in Chicken

               <p>If there be a Fever, and if a great
quantity of matter be evacuated, Whey
is very proper, half a pint or more being
taken in a Morning with a little Honey
of Roſes, and if there is an Hectick Fever
and the Body begins to waſt, Aſſes milk
muſt be taken with Sugar of Roſes for a

               <p>Turpentine waſhed in ſome proper wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>To cleanſe dry and heal the Ulcer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
injections are propoſed, but they
muſt not be uſed till the Inflammation is
taken off, and till the pain is quieted, and
therefore upon account of the Inflammation
an Emulſion of the cold Seeds, or the
Whey of Goats Milk, or Milk it ſelf may
be injected firſt, and if neceſſity requires,
a Decoction of Poppy heads and tops of
Mallows may be injected. Some Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63569:64"/>
ſay, the Sick may be much relieved
by injecting frequently warm water, and
when the heat and pain is quieted, we
may uſe ſuch things as cleanſe, beginning
with the gentle, and proceeding gradually
to the ſtronger. The gentle are Whey
with Sugar, a Decoction of Barly with
Sugar, or Honey of Roſes, but Simple
Hydromel cleanſes moſt. But if the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
be very ſordid, the following Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be uſed.</p>
               <p>Take of the roots of Gentian, Rhaponticum,
Zedoary, and round Birthwort each one Ounce,
of White-wine three pints, boyl them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of a third part; in the ſtrain'd Liquor
diſſolve half a pound of Sugar, and keep it for
uſe; a little <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Aegyptiacum may
be added to it if there be occaſion to cleanſe
more.</p>
               <p>If the Ulcer be deep, the fume menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
above may be uſed; when the Ulcer is
very obſtinate, Cinnabar muſt be added,
which is of excellent uſe.</p>
               <p>If theſe Diſeaſes happen when a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

becauſe bigbellied Women cannot ſo

               <p>Take of Kermes Berries and Tormentil

and an half, make a Powder, whereof give
now and then half a Dram, or as much as
will lie on the point of a knife, or let her take
every Morning ſome grains of Maſtich: Or</p>

and ſhavings of Harts-horn each one Dram,
with Syrup of Quinces make an Electuary, of
which let the Woman take often the quantity

               <p>The following Lozenges are very good

               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:63569:65"/>

the cauſe, whether it be outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
the Sick be ready to miſcarry, we
muſt do the beſt we can with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
remedies, and in the firſt place ſo ſoon
as Pains and Throws ſhall be perceived
in the lower part of the Belly, and in the
Loins, we muſt endeavour to allay them
both by Medicines taken inwardly and
outwardly apply'd according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Cauſes, and if Crudities and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63569:65"/>
Wind are the cauſe, as they are moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when the cauſe is within, a Powder
muſt be given made of <hi>Aromaticum Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
and Coriander Seeds, and we may
give of the Imperial Water if Flegm and
Wind abound.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time let Carminative Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
be apply'd below the Navel of the
Patient, ſuch are Bags of Aniſe Seeds, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel

Camomile, Elder, Roſemary and Stechas,
mixt together, or a Roſe Cake fryed in a
Pan with rich Canary, and ſprinkled with
Powder of Nutmegs and Coriander Seeds,
or the Gaul of a Wether new kill'd or
his Lungs lay'd on warm. If by theſe
means the pains ceaſe not, let a Gliſter be
injected made of Wine and Oyl, wherein
two Drams of <hi>Philonium Romanum</hi> may be
diſſolved, or Narcoticks may be given
inwardly in a ſmall quantity to allay the
Violence of the humours and wind, as we
are wont to do in pains of the Colick. But
if Blood begins to come away, Frictions
and painful Ligatures of the upper parts
muſt be uſed to turn the courſe of the
Blood, and if the Woman be full of Blood,
it will not be amiſs to take ſome Blood
from her, eſpecially before it begins to
low, but it muſt be taken away at ſeveral
times a little at once.</p>
               <p>

Cypreſs Nuts, Acorn Cups, Balau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,

of Red Roſes and Balauſtines may be
boyl'd in Red Wine and apply'd hot to
the Womans Belly: And the Plaiſter
above mentioned may be uſed. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that the two following Medicines
will certainly retain the Child in the
Womb if they be uſed before it is torn
from the Veſſels of the Womb.</p>
               <p>Take of leaves of Gold, Number twelve,
of Spodium one Dram, the Cocks treading

               <p>THE ſigns preceding a natural La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
a few days before, are ſinking
down of the Belly, which hinders a
Woman at that time in walking as
eaſie as ſhe uſed to do, and thence flows
from the Womb ſlimy humours, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by nature to moiſten and ſmoothen
the paſſage, that its inward Orifice may
the more eaſily be dilated, when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
which beginning to open a little
at that time ſuffers that ſlime to flow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>The ſigns accompanying preſent Labour
are, great pains about the Region of the
Reins and Loins, which coming and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
by intervals, anſwer in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Belly with reiterated Throws,
the Face is red and inflamed, becauſe the
Blood is much heated by the continual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of the Woman to bring forth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63569:67"/>
the Child, as alſo becauſe that during theſe
ſtrong Throws, her reſpiration is ever
intercepted, for which reaſon much Blood
hath recourſe to the Face, her Privy
Parts are ſwelled, becauſe the Infants
head often thruſts, and cauſes the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Parts to diſtend outwards; upon
which account they appear ſwell'd in this
manner; ſhe is often ſubject to vomiting,
which makes many believe, who know
not the cauſe of it, that the Women are
for this reaſon in danger: But it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
the ſign of a ſpeedy delivery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the good pains are then excited and
redoubled every moment, until the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>When the Birth is very near, Women
are troubled with an univerſal trembling,
and chiefly of the Legs and Thighs, with
the heat of the whole Body and Humours,
which then flow from the Womb, and they
are often diſcoloured with Blood, which
with the ſigns above mentioned is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
ſign of the nearneſs of the Birth.
This the Women uſually call ſhows, and
if one then puts up their Finger into the
Neck of the Womb, they will find the
inner Orifice dilated, at the opening
whereof, the Membranes of the Infant
containing the Waters preſent themſelves,
and are ſtrongly forc'd downwards with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63569:67"/>
every pain the Woman has, at which
time one may perceive them to reſiſt the
Finger, more or leſs as the pains are
ſtronger or weaker. Theſe Membranes
with the Waters in them, when gathered
(that is, when they are advanced before
the head of the Child, which makes the
Midwives call it the gathering of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)
preſenting themſelves at this inward
Orifice, do then reſemble very well to the
touch of the Finger, abortive Eggs which
have yet no ſhell, but are only covered
with a ſimple Membrane. After this
the pains redoubling continually, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes
are broken by the ſtrong impulſe
of the Waters, which incontinently flow
away, and then the head of the Child is
eaſily felt naked, and preſented at the
opening of the inward Orifice of the
Womb: now all theſe or the greateſt part
of them meeting together, at what time
ſoever of a VVomans going with Child
it be, whether at the full time or no, one
may be aſſured ſhe will ſoon be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But great care muſt be taken not to
haſten her Labour before the neceſſity of
it be known by theſe ſigns; for that
would but torment the VVoman and Child
in vain, and put them both in danger of
their lives:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:63569:68"/>
Labour contrary to nature is when the
Child comes in an ill Figure and Situation,
as when it preſents any otherwiſe than
the Head firſt; as alſo when the Waters
flow away a long time before it is born;
alſo when the After-burthen comes firſt.
The Labour is alſo grievous when accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a Fever, or any other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Diſeaſe which may deſtroy the Child
in the Womb; alſo when pains are ſmall
and come ſlow with long intervals and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
profit, upon which account the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is extreamly tired; but the wrong
poſture of the Infant is moſt commonly
the cauſe of difficult Labour. As ſoon as
it is known that the Woman is certainly
in labour by the ſigns above mentioned,
then muſt all things neceſſary to comfort
the Woman in her Labour be got ready,
and the better to help her, care muſt be
taken that ſhe be not ſtrait laced; a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſtrong Gliſter may be given her, or
more than one, if there be occaſion, which
muſt be done at the beginning, before the
Child be too forwards, for afterwards it
is very difficult for her to receive them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
in the mean while all things neceſſary for
her Labour ſhould be put in order, as well
for the Woman as the Child; her Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes
Stool, or rather a Pallet-bed girted
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63569:68"/>
placed cloſe by the Fire, if the Seaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it; the Pallet ought to be ſo placed,
as to be turned round about when there
is occaſion, the better to help the Woman.
If the Woman be full of Blood, it may be
convenient to Bleed her a little, for by
this means her Breaſts being diſingaged,
and her Reſpiration free, ſhe will have
more ſtrength to bear down her pains,
which may be done without danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Child being about that time rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be born, hath no more need of
the Mothers Blood for its nouriſhment,
which has been often practiſed with good
ſucceſs. Beſides, this Evacuation often hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
her having a Fever after delivery,
and to preſerve her ſtrength, it will be
convenient to give her ſome good Gelly
Broaths, new laid Eggs, or ſome Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of burnt Wine from time to time,
or a Toaſt dipt in Wine, avoiding ſolid
Food. Above all ſhe muſt be perſwaded
to hold out her pains, bearing them down
as much as ſhe can, at the inſtant when
they take her. The Midwife muſt from time
to time touch the inward Orifice with her
Finger, to know whether the Waters are
ready to break, and whether the Birth
will follow ſoon after; ſhe muſt alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
all the bearing place with emollient
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63569:69"/>
Oyls, Hogs greaſe or freſh Butter, if ſhe
perceive it can hardly be dilated; and
all the while ſhe muſt be near her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to obſerve her geſtures diligently,
her complaints and pains; for ſo ſhe may
gueſs pretty well how the Labour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
without being obliged to touch
her Body ſo often. The Woman may by
intervals reſt her ſelf on the Bed to refreſh
her ſelf, but not too long, eſpecially if ſhe
be a little ſhort thick Woman, for they
have always worſt Labours, if they lie
much on their Beds in their Travail, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of their firſt Children, than when
they are prevailed with to walk about
the Chamber; (but they muſt be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under the Arms, if it be neceſſary)
for by this means the weight of the Child
cauſes the inward Orifice to dilate ſooner
than in Bed. When the Waters of the
Child are ready and gather'd, the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
ought to let them break of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
for the breaking of them before
the Infant be wholly in the paſſage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
the Labour; for by the too haſty
breaking of theſe Waters, which ought
to help the Child to ſlide forth with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
eaſe, he remains dry, which hinders
afterwards the Pains and Throws, ſo that
they cannot be ſo effectual in excluding
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63569:69"/>
the Child, as otherwiſe they would have
been: It is therefore better to let them
break of themſelves, and then the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
may eaſily find the Child bare by the
part which firſt preſents, and ſo judge
certainly whether it comes right, that is
with the Head, which ſhe will find hard,
big, round, and equal; but if it be any
other part, ſhe will perceive ſomething
unequal and rugged, and hard or ſoft,
more or leſs according to the parts; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
let her diſpatch to deliver her
Woman, if ſhe be not already, and aſſiſt
the Birth, which ordinarily happens ſoon
after, if natural, in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>After the Waters be broke of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
as above-ſaid, let the Woman be
preſently placed on the Pallate provided
for her to this purpoſe, near the Fire,
or ſhe may, if ſhe like it better, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in her ordinary Bed; for all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are not accuſtomed to be delivered
in the ſame poſture, ſome will be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on their Knees, others ſtanding, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with their elbows on a Pillow, upon
a Table, or the ſide of a Bed, and others
lying upon a Quilt in the midſt of the
Chamber. But the beſt and ſureſt way
of Delivery is in Bed, to avoid the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63569:70"/>
and trouble of being carried
thither afterwards, in which caſe it ought
to be Furniſhed rather with a Quilt than
a Feather-bed, having upon it Linnen
and Cloaths in many folds, with other
neceſſaries to be changed upon occaſion,
that the Woman may not be incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
afterwards with the Blood, Waters,
and other filth, which is voided in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
The Bed muſt be ſo made, that
the Woman being ready to be delivered,
ſhould lie on her back upon it, with her
Head and Breaſt a little raiſed, ſo as that
ſhe be neither lying nor ſetting; for in
this manner ſhe breaths beſt, and will
have more ſtrength to help her pains,
than if ſhe ſunk down into her Bed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this poſture ſhe muſt ſpread her
Thighs abroad, folding her Legs a little
towards her Buttocks, ſomewhat raiſed
by a ſmall Pillow underneath, and her Feet
muſt be ſtaid againſt ſome firm thing;
moreover let her hold ſome By-ſtanders
with her Hands, that ſhe may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtay her ſelf during her pains. Being
thus placed near the ſide of her Bed,
with her Midwife by to help upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſhe muſt take courage, and further
her pains the beſt ſhe can, bearing them
down, when they take her, which ſhe may
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63569:70"/>
do by holding her Breath, and forcing
her ſelf all ſhe can, juſt as when ſhe goes
to ſtool. In the mean while the Midwife
muſt comfort her, and perſuade her to
endure her Labour bravely, and put her
in hopes of a ſpeedy delivery. The Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
with her Hand anointed with Oyl
or freſh Butter, may gently dilate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Orifice of the Womb, putting her
Fingers ends into its entry, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them one from another, and thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by little and little the ſides of the
Orifice towards the hinder part of the
Childs Head, anointing theſe parts alſo
with freſh Butter. When the Infants
Head begins to advance to the inward
Orifice, it is commonly ſaid it is crown'd,
and when it is come ſo far, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
begins to appear manifeſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the privy Parts, it is then ſaid that
the Child is in the paſſage, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in Travail imagins, tho it is no
ſuch thing, that her Midwife hurts her
with her Fingers, finding her ſelf as it
were ſcratched, and pricked with Pins in
thoſe parts, by reaſon of the violent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion,
which the bigneſs of the Childs
Head cauſes there.</p>
               <p>When things are in this poſture, the
Midwife muſt ſeat her ſelf conveniently
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63569:71"/>
to receive the Child, which will ſoon
come, and with her Fingers ends, her
Nails being cloſe paired, endeavour to
thruſt, as above-ſaid, this crowning of
the Womb, back off over the Head of the
Child; and as ſoon as it is advanced as
far as the Ears, or thereabouts, ſhe may
take hold of the two Sides with her two
Hands, that when a good pain comes, ſhe
may quickly draw forth the Child, taking
care that the Navel-ſtring be not then
intangled about the Neck, or any other
part, leſt thereby the After-burthen be
pulled with violence, and poſſibly the
Womb alſo, whereunto it is faſtened, and
ſo cauſe Flooding, or elſe break the ſtring,
whereby the Woman may come to be
more difficultly delivered. It muſt alſo
be obſerved, that the Head be not drawn
forth ſtraight, but ſhaking it a little from
one ſide to the other, that the Shoulders
may ſooner and eaſier take place, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after it is paſt, which muſt be
done without loſing any time, leſt the
Head being paſt, the Child be ſtopt there
by the largeneſs of the Shoulders, and be
in danger of being ſuffocated in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage:
But as ſoon as the head is born,
if there be need, the Midwife may ſlide
in her Finger under the Arm-pits, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63569:71"/>
the reſt of the Body will follow without
any difficulty. As ſoon as the Midwife
has in this manner drawn forth the Child,
ſhe muſt put it on one ſide, leſt the Blood
and Waters, which follow immediately
after ſhould choak it; afterwards let her
be very careful to examin that there be
no more Children in the Womb, which
ſhe may know, if putting her hand up the
entry, ſhe finds there another Water gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
If it be ſo, ſhe muſt have a care not
to go about to fetch the After-burthen,
till the Woman be delivered of all her
Children; wherefore the firſt ſtring muſt
be cut, being firſt tied with a Thred
three or four double, and the other end
muſt be faſtened with a ſtring to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Thigh.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Child is born, before
the Navel-ſtring is tied or cut, the Woman
muſt be freed of the After-burthen. To
perform this, the Midwife having taken
the ſtring muſt wind it once or twice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one or two of her Fingers of her
left hand joined together, the better to
hold it, wherewith ſhe may then draw
it moderately, and with the right Hand,
ſhe may only take a ſingle hold of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the left near the Privities, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
likewiſe with that very gently, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63569:72"/>
the Fore-finger of the ſame Hand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and ſtretched forth along the
ſtring towards the entry of the Sheath,
always obſerving to draw it from the
ſide, where the burthen cleaves leaſt.
Above all things care muſt be taken, that
it be not drawn forth with too much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
leſt by breaking the ſtring, you
are obliged to put the whole Hand into
the Womb to deliver the Woman, or
the Womb be drawn down forth with
it; alſo by drawing it out with too much
violence, a great flooding may thereby
happen. To facilitate the expulſion, the
Woman may blow ſtrongly into her
Hands ſhut, or ſhe may put her Finger
into her Throat, as if ſhe would provoke
Vomiting, or ſhe may ſtrive as if ſhe
were going to ſtool, bearing always down,
and holding her breath. When all theſe
circumſtances have been obſerved, if you
meet with difficulty, you may, if need
be, after that you know on which ſide
the After-birth is ſituated, command an
experienced Nurſe-keeper to preſs the
Belly lightly with the flat of her Hand,
directing it gently downwards by way of
Friction; above all being careful not to
do it too violently; but if all this be in
vain, then muſt the Hand be directed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63569:72"/>
into the VVomb to looſen and ſeparate
it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the VVoman is delivered of
both Child and Burthen, it muſt then be
conſidered whether there be all, and care
had, that not the leaſt part of it remain
behind, not ſo much as the skirts or clods
of Blood, which ought all to be brought
away with the firſt; for otherwiſe, being
retained, they cauſe great pains. When
the Woman has two Children, you muſt
not fetch the Burthen, as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
till both the Children are born, and
then it may be done without danger, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
and drawing it always gently ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by one ſtring, ſometimes by the
other, and ſometimes by both together,
and ſo by turns till all is come. When
the Infant comes right and naturally, the
Woman is brought to Bed, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with little help, for which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Midwifes are capable, and oft-times
for want of them, a ſimple Nurſekeeper
may ſupply the place. But when it is a
wrong Labour there is a great Myſtery
belongs to it; for then the skill and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a Surgeon is for the moſt part
requiſite.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Woman is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
and the Burthen come away, care
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63569:73"/>
muſt be taken that the looſening of it be
not followed with a Flooding; if it be
not, a ſoft cloſure muſt be immediately
applied to the Womb, five or ſix times
double, to prevent the cold Air entring
in and ſtopping the Veſſels, whereby the
Womb ſhould cleanſe by degrees when the
VVomb is ſo cloſed: If the VVoman was
not delivered upon her ordinary Bed, let
her preſently be carried into it by ſome
ſtrong Body or more if there be need,
rather than to let her walk thither; which
Bed muſt be ready warmed and prepared,
as is requiſite for the cleanſings. But if
ſhe were delivered on it, which is beſt and
ſafeſt to prevent the danger and trouble
of carrying her to it, then all the ſoul
Linnen and other things put there for
receiving the Bloud, VVaters, and other
filth, which comes away in Labour, muſt
be removed, and ſhe muſt be placed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
in it for her eaſe and reſt,
which ſhe much wants to recover her of
the Pains and Labour ſhe endured in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
ſhe muſt be placed with her Head
and Body a little raiſed for to breath the
freer, and to cleanſe the better, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of that Blood which then comes away,
that ſo it may not clod, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
cauſes very great pains. All this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63569:73"/>
will happen if they have not liberty to come
freely by this convenient Situation, in
which ſhe muſt put down her Legs and
Thighs cloſe together having a ſmall Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
for her greater eaſe, if ſhe deſire it
under her Hams, upon which they may
reſt a little. Being ſo put to Bed, let
her lie neither on one ſide nor the other,
but juſt on the middle of her Back, that
ſo the VVomb may repoſſeſs its natural
and proper place.</p>
               <p>It is an ordinary cuſtom to give the
VVoman, as ſoon as ſhe is delivered, two
Ounces of Oyl of Sweet Almonds, and as
much Syrup of Maiden-hair, which is
good to ſweeten and temper the inſide of
the Throat, which was heated, and hoarſe
by her continual cryes, and holding her
breath, to bear down her Throws during
her Labour; it is alſo good to prevent
the Grips; but this Potion goes ſo much
againſt the Stomachs of ſome VVomen,
that being forced to take it with an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
it may do them more hurt than
good; therefore let none have it, but
thoſe that deſire it and have no averſion
for it: But good Broath taken after ſhe
is a little ſetled may be more beneficial.</p>
               <p>Having thus accommodated her, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for her Belly, Breaſts, and lower
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63569:74"/>
parts, leave her to reſt and ſleep if ſhe
can, making no noiſe, the Bed-Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
being cloſe drawn, and the Doors
and VVindows of her Chamber ſhut, that
ſo ſeeing no light, ſhe may the ſooner
fall aſleep.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Bed is cleanſed from
the foul Linnen and other impurities of
the Labour, and the Woman therein pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
let there be outwardly applied all
over the bottom of her Belly and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities,
the following anodyne Pultiſs
made of two Ounces of ſweet Almonds
with two or three new laid Eggs yolks and
whites, ſtirring them together in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Pipkin over hot Embers till it comes
to the conſiſtence of a Pultiſs, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpread upon Cloath, muſt be applyed
to thoſe parts indifferently warm, having
firſt taken away the Cloſures which were
put to her, preſently after her Delivery,
and likewiſe ſuch clods of Blood as were
there left. This is a very fit Remedy to
appeaſe the Pains which Women common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuffer in thoſe Parts, by reaſon of the
violence then endured by the Infants Birth;
it muſt lie on five or ſix hours, and then be
renewed a ſecond time, if there be occaſion.
Afterwards make a Decoction of Barly,
Linſeed, and Chervil, or with Marſh-mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63569:74"/>
and Violet Leaves, adding to a Pint
of it an Ounce of Honey of Roſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
being luke-warm, Foment three or
four times a-day, for the firſt five or ſix
days of Child-bed, the bearing place,
cleanſing it very well from the Clods of
Blood and other Excrements which are
there emptied. Some Perſons only uſe
for this purpoſe luke-warm Milk, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Women only Barly-water. Great care
muſt be taken at the beginning that no ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
thing be given to hinder the cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but when ten or twelve Days are
paſt, and ſhe has cleanſed ſufficiently,
Remedies may then be uſed to fortifie the
Parts, for which purpoſe a Decoction is
very proper made of Province Roſes,
Leaves and Roots of Plantain and Smiths
water, and when ſhe has ſufficiently and
fully done Cleanſing, which is uſually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the eighteenth or twentieth Day, there
may be made for thoſe that deſire it, a
very ſtrong aſtringent Lotion to fortifie
and ſettle thoſe parts which have been
much relaxed, as well by the great exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
they received, as by the Humours,
wherewith they have been ſo long time
ſoak'd; this Remedy may be compoſed
with an Ounce and an half of Pomgranat
Peel, an Ounce of Cypreſs Nuts, half an
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63569:75"/>
Ounce of Accorns, an Ounce of ſeal'd
Earth, an Handful of Provence Roſes,
and two Drachms of Roch-allom, all
which being infuſed in a Quart and half
a Pint of ſtrong Red-wine, or that it
may not be too ſharp, ſome Smiths water
may be mixed with the Wine, afterwards
boil it to a Quart, then ſtrain it, ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſtrongly; and with this Decoction
Foment the inferior parts Night and
Morning to ſtrengthen and confirm them.
But they will never be reduced to the ſame
ſtate they were in, before the Woman
had Children. A ſmall Plaiſter of Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
with a little Civit in the middle may
be alſo applyed to the Womans Navel.
As for Swaiths they need not be uſed the
firſt Day, or at leaſt very looſly, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if there has been hard Labour, becauſe
the leaſt compreſſion of the Womans Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which is then very ſore, as the Womb
alſo is, proves a great inconvenience to
her; wherefore let her not be ſwaithed
until the ſecond Day, and that very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the beginning. The uſe of Swaiths
and of a good large ſquare Bolſter over
the whole Belly may be continued the firſt
ſeven or eight Days to keep it a little ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but they muſt be taken off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
often to anoint the Womans Belly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63569:75"/>
all over, if it be ſore, and if ſhe has After-Pains,
with Oils of ſweet Almonds and
St. Johns-wort mixed together, which
may be done every Day. But after that
time they may be degrees begin to ſwaith
her ſtraiter, to contract and gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the parts which are greatly extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
during her going with Child, which
may be then ſafely done, becauſe the
Womb by theſe former cleanſings is ſo
diminiſhed, that it cannot be too much
compreſſed by the Swaiths.</p>
               <p>Proper Remedies may be applied to the
Breaſts to drive back the Milk, if the
Woman will not be a Nurſe; but if ſhe
intends to be a Nurſe, it will be ſufficient
to keep her Breaſts very cloſe, and well
covered with gentle and ſoft Cloaths to
keep them warm, and to prevent the curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Milk; and if there be danger
of too much Milk being carried thither,
anoint the Breaſts with Oyl of Roſes
and a little Vinegar beat together, and put
upon them ſome fine Linnen dipt in it, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
that if the Woman do Suckle the
Child, ſhe give not the Breaſt the ſame day
ſhe is brought to Bed, becauſe then all her
Humours are extreamly moved with the
pains and agitation of the Labour; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let her defer it at leaſt till the next
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63569:76"/>
day; and it would be yet better to ſtay four
or five days or longer, to the end the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Milk, and the abundance of the
Humours, which flow to the Breaſt at the
beginning, may be ſpent, in which time
another Woman may give it Suck.</p>
               <p>Although a Woman be naturally Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
yet notwithſtanding ſhe muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a good Diet, to prevent many ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
which may happen to her during her
Child-bed, at the beginning whereof ſhe
muſt be directed in her Meat and Drink
almoſt in the ſame manner as if ſhe had a
Fever, that ſo it may be prevented, in as
much as ſhe is then very ſubject to it; for
this reaſon ſhe muſt be regular in her Diet,
eſpecially the three or four firſt Days,
in which time ſhe muſt be nouriſhed only
with good Broaths, new-laid Eggs, and
Gellies, without uſing at the beginning
more ſolid Meats: but when the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of her Milk is a little paſt, ſhe may
with more ſafety eat a little Broath at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or a ſmall piece of boyl'd Chicken,
or Mutton; afterwards, if no accident
happens, ſhe may be degrees be nouriſhed
more plentifully, provided that it be a
third part leſs than ſhe was accuſtomed to
take in her perfect health, and that her
Food be of good and eaſie Digeſtion; as
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63569:76"/>
for her Drink, let it be a Ptiſan made of
Liquoriſh, Figs, and Anniſeeds, boyled in
Water: She may alſo, if ſhe be not Feve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
drink a little white Wine well mixed
with Water, but not till after the fifth or
ſixth Day. But it is to be noted that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
Women of a ſtrong Conſtitution
require a more plentiful feeding; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
if they do not change the
quality, they muſt at leaſt retrench the
quantity of their ordinary Food.</p>
               <p>The Child-bed Woman muſt likewiſe keep
her ſelf very quiet in her Bed lying on her
Back, with her Head raiſed, and not turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
often from ſide to ſide; that ſo the
Womb may be the better ſettled in its
firſt Situation: She muſt free her ſelf at that
time from all care of Buſineſs, let her talk
as little as may be, and that with a low
Voice, and let no ill News be brought to
her, which may affect her, becauſe all
theſe things do cauſe ſo great a commotion
of the Humours, that Nature not being
able to overcome them, cannot make the
neceſſary Evacuation of them, which has
been the Death of many. The Woman
ought always to keep her Body open with
Gliſters, taking one once in two Days,
which not only evacuate the groſs Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but alſo by drawing downwards
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63569:77"/>
cauſe her to Cleanſe the better. When ſhe
has obſerved this Rule a Fortnight or three
Weeks, which is very near the time of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Cleanſed ſufficiently, that thoſe
Parts may be throughly cleanſed before
ſhe goes abroad, and begin upon a new
Score, let her take a gentle Purge of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
Caſſia, and Syrup of Cichory, with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb,
which is good to Purge the Stomach
and Bowels of thoſe ill Humours Nature
could not evacuate by the Womb: This
Purge may be repeated upon occaſion.</p>
               <p>Women in their firſt Labours have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times bruiſes and rents of the outward
parts of the Womb, and they muſt never be
neglected, leſt they degenerate into malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Ulcers; for the heat and moiſture of
theſe Parts, beſides the filth which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
flows thence, eaſily contributes to
it, if convenient Remedies be not timely
applied; wherefore as ſoon as the Woman
is laid, if there be only ſimple contuſions
and excoriations, apply a Pultiſs made of
yolks and whites of new-laid Eggs and Oil
of Roſes ſeethed a little over warm Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
continually ſtirring till it be mixed,
and then ſpread it upon a fine Cloath, and
apply it very warm for five or ſix Hours,
when being taken away, lay ſome fine Rags
dipt in Oil of St. Johns-wort on each ſide
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63569:77"/>
the bearing place, and renew them twice
or thrice a Day. Foment theſe parts with
Barly-water and Honey of Roſes to cleanſe
them from the Excrements which paſs,
and when the VVoman makes water, let
them be defended with fine Rags to hinder
the Urine from cauſing pain and ſmarting.
Sometimes the bruiſes are ſo great, that
the Bearing-place is inflamed, and a very
conſiderable abſceſs follows, in which
Caſe it muſt be opened juſt below the
Swelling in the moſt convenient place; and
after the Matter is evacuated, a deterſive
Decoction muſt be injected into the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
made of Barly-water and Oyl of Roſes,
to which Spirit of Wine may be added,
if there be any danger of Corruption, and
afterwards the Ulcer muſt be Dreſſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Art.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it happens that the Perine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
is ſo rent, that the Privities and the
Fundament is all in one; in this caſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cleanſed the Womb from ſuch Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as may be there with Red-wine, let
the Rent be ſtrongly ſtitched together with
three or four ſtiches, or more, according
to the length of the ſeparation, taking
at each ſtich good hold of the Fleſh, that
ſo it may not break out, and then dreſs it
with Linimentum Arcaei, or the like; clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63569:78"/>
a Plaiſter on, and ſome Linnen above
to prevent, as much as may be, the falling of
the Urine, and other Excrements upon it,
becauſe the acrimony of them would make
it ſmart, and cauſe Pain; and that theſe
parts may cloſe together with more eaſe,
let the Woman keep her Thighs cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
without the leaſt ſpreading until
the Cure be perfected: but if afterwards
ſhe happens to be with Child, ſhe will be
obliged to prevent the like miſchief to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint
thoſe parts with Emollient Oyls,
and Oyntments, and when ſhe is in Labour,
ſhe muſt forbear helping her. Throws too
ſtrongly at once, but leave Nature to
perform it by degrees, together with the
help of a Midwife well Inſtructed in her
Art; for uſually when theſe parts have
been once rent, it is very difficult to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the like in the following Travail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Scar there made does ſtraighten
the parts yet more; wherefore it were to
be wiſhed for greater ſecurity againſt the
like accidents, that the Woman ſhould have
no more Children.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of hard Labour.</head>
               <p>MAny Cauſes may be aſſigned that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
hard Labour, as the natural
weakneſs of the Mothers Body, or her
Age, ſhe being too Young or too Old; or it
may be occaſioned by Diſeaſes that ſhe
had with her big Belly, leanneſs or too much
dryneſs of the Body, or Fat compreſſing
the paſſages of the Womb, the ill confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Bones encompaſſing the
Womb, as in thoſe that are Lame, may
alſo occaſion it; Wind ſwelling the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
a Stone or Preternatural Tumour in
the Bladder that preſſes the Womb may
be the occaſion; ſo may the ill conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lungs, or of the parts ſerving
reſpiration, for the holding of the Breath
conduceth much to the Excluſion of the
Child. Various Diſeaſes of the VVomb
may alſo render the Delivery difficult, as
ſwellings, Ulcers, Obſtructions, and the
like. The hard Labour is occaſioned by
the Child, when by reaſon it is Dead, or
Putrified, or any way Diſeaſed it cannot
confer any thing to its own excluſion; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63569:79"/>
when the Body or Head is too large, or
when there are more than one; ſo Twins
moſt commonly cauſe hard Labour, or the
ill ſituation of the Child is the cauſe, or when
the Hands or the Feet offer firſt, or when
one Hand or one Foot comes out firſt, or
when it is doubled, or when the Membranes
break too ſoon, ſo that the VVater flows
out and leaves the Orifice of the VVomb
dry at the time of Excluſion, or when the
Membranes are too thick, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be eaſily broken by the Child.</p>
               <p>Cold and dry Air and a North-wind are
very injurious to VVomen in Labour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they bind the Body and drive the
Blood and Spirits to the inner parts, and
they are very injurious to the Child com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from ſo warm a place. And hot
Weather diſſipates the Spirits, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
the Child. Crude Nouriſhment and
ſuch as is difficultly concocted and binds
taken in a great quantity before Labours
renders it difficult, the Stomach being weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the common paſſages contracted,
which ought to be open in this Caſe.
Drowſineſs hinders the action of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The unſeaſonable motion of the
VVoman much retards the Delivery, as
when ſhe refuſes upon occaſion to ſtand,
walk, lie, or ſit, or ſlings her ſelf about
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63569:79"/>
unadviſedly ſo that the Child cannot be
Born the right way, being turned prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly
by the reſtleſneſs of the Mother. Urine
in the Bladder, or Excrements in
the right Gut, or the Piles when they are
much ſwell'd hinder Natures endeavours,
by narrowing the Neck of the VVomb.
Fear, Sorrow, Anger make the Labour
difficult. A Blow, a Fall, or a Wound,
may alſo much obſtruct the Labour. Want
of good aſſiſtance to lift the Woman up
juſt at the time of Delivery, and an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Midwife who orders the Woman to
endeavour an expulſion, and to ſtop her
breath when the ligaments of the Fetus
ſtick firmly to the Womb, ſo that the
Woman is tired before the time of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</p>
               <p>In hard Labour Women commonly give
a Spoonful or two of Cinamon-water, or
Cinnamon powder'd with a little Saffron,
or half a Dram of Confection of Alker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
in Broth, or half a Scruple of Saffron
alone in ſome Broth, or every hour a lit-VVine.</p>
               <p>If theſe things are not ſufficient the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:63569:80"/>

Birthworts, and of Troaches of Mirrh each
half a Scruple, of Saffron and Cinnamon each
Twelve Grains, of confection of Alkermes half
a Dram, of Cinnamon-water half an Ounce,
of Orange-flower-water, and of Mugwort-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Amber and of Cinnamon, and extract of
Saffron are very effectual in a ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

take Sneeſing Powder for it haſtens deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>The Midwife muſt frequently anoint
the Womb with the Oyls of Lilies or
of Sweet Almonds, and the Belly muſt be
fomented with a Decoction of the Roots of
Marſhmallows and Lilies, of the Leaves
of Mallows, Violets, Mugwort, of the
Seeds of Fenugreek and Flax, of the
Flowers of Camomile and Melilote. Sharp

               <head type="sub">Of the Caeſarian Delivery.</head>
               <p>THE Caeſarian Delivery is a dextrous
extraction of a Living or Dead Child
from the Mothers Womb, which cannot
be other ways excluded, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
endangering the Life of both, or of
either, and without ſpoiling the Faculty
of conceiving; and by this Art the firſt
<hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> was cut out
of his Mothers Womb, and therefore was
called Caeſar. This Caeſarian Section is
thought to be neceſſary, when the Mother
and the Child are ſo weak, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be preſerved any other way. The
uſe of it is twofold, one, that a living
Child may be extracted; the other, that
the Mother may be preſerved alive; and
tho' it is very hazardous, yet in a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
caſe it is better to do ſomething
than nothing; eſpecially when a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
is like to be broken by the death
of a Wife; or when a Family is like to
be extinguiſhed; or ſome Kingdom or
Principality is like to be loſt. In this
manner we find in the Annals of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:63569:82"/>
the King of <hi>Navar</hi> was preſerved; for his
Mother being wounded in the Belly by
the <hi>Saracens,</hi> as ſhe was Hunting, a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Man coming to her help, ſaw the Child
put its hand out of the Wound, and
drew it forth, and educated it privately;
and afterwards, when the Nobility was
contending about the Election of a Prince,
he brought out the young King, and ſo
the Controverſie ended.</p>
               <p>The cauſes which require this operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are, a too great Child, or Twins,
or more that endeavour to be born to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
or if a fleſhy Mole join to the
Child, the ill poſture of it, and if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be reduced to a better, either by its
own help, or the help of others; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is dead, or ſo much ſwell'd by
a Diſeaſe, that the Naturall paſſage is too
narrow: But in this caſe, it is beſt to
take it away peece-meal. The cauſes on
the Mothers part are the narrowneſs of
the paſſages, either naturally, by reaſon
ſhe is too young, or too old; or becauſe
the VVomb is ſhut, either by a Cicatrix
or a Callous. Moreover many tumours
in the Womb, or the Mouth of it may be
the cauſe: In theſe caſes, tho it be very
dangerous, yet it is very neceſſary to uſe
Section, and the operation may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63569:83"/>
performed, as may appear by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Experiments to him that reads
<hi>Rouſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before you enter upon this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
you muſt conſider, whether the
Child can be Extracted any other way
that is ſafer and eaſier. You muſt more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
conſider whether there are Signs of
Death, and if ſo, you muſt not enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Operation, leſt the Womans Death
be laid upon the Section, and your raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
But when you have througly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all things, if the Woman be of a
ſtrong Nature, tho by reaſon of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
ſhe is weak, you may venture upon
the Operation.</p>
               <p>Moſt Authors would have it made on
the left ſide of the Belly, becauſe it is more
free from the Liver; but I, ſays <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceau,</hi>
think it will be better and more
skilfully made juſt in the middle of the
Belly between the two right Muſcles: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in this place there is only the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and the white line to cut. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
then with more eaſe and ſpeed, the
Chyrugeon having placed the Woman ſo,
that the Belly may be a little raiſed; let
him take a good ſharp inciſion Knife,
very ſharp on one ſide, with which he
muſt quickly make an Inciſion, juſt in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63569:83"/>
middle of the Belly between the two
right Muſcles unto the Peritoneum, of the
length and extent of the Womb, or
thereabouts; after that he muſt only
peirce the Peritoneum with the point of
his Knife, to make an Orifice for one or
two of the Fingers of his left hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which he muſt immediately thruſt them
to cut it, lifting it up with them, and
conducting the Inſtrument for fear of
pricking the Guts, in proportion to the
firſt inciſion of the coverings, which hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, the Womb will ſoon appear,
into which he muſt make an Inciſion in
the ſame manner, as he did in the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneum,
being careful not to thruſt his
Inſtrument at once too far in; having
then ſo opened the VVomb, he muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
make an inciſion in the Infants Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes;
taking care not to wound it with
the Inſtrument, and then he will ſoon ſee
it, and muſt immediatly take it out of
the burthen, which he muſt nimbly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from the bottom of the VVomb,
and finding it to be yet living, let him
praiſe God for having ſo bleſſed and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
his Operation. But the Children
ſo delivered are uſually ſo weak, if not
quite dead, as it often happens, that it is
hard to know, whether it is alive or dead;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63569:84"/>
yet one may be confident the Child is
living, if by touching the Navel-ſtring,
the Umbilical Arteries are perceived to
move, as alſo the Heart, by laying the
Hand on the Breaſt, and if it prove ſo,
means muſt be uſed to fetch it to it self,
by ſpouting ſome VVine into the Noſe
and Mouth, and by warming it, until it
begins to ſtir of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But it is to be noted, that <hi>Mauriceau</hi>
much diſapproves this cruel Operation, and
ſays it ought not to be performed until
the VVoman is dead, for that the VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
always dies in the operation, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Secundine retained.</head>
               <p>IN a natural Birth the Secundine is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
excluded preſently after the Child;
and when it is not, the Life of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is much indangered. It is retained
by the too great thickneſs of the Coats,
the ſwelling of them, and by an afflux of
Humours occaſion'd by hard Labour; alſo
by the ſtrutting of the Mouth of the
Womb after the excluſion of the Child.
The External Cauſes are, Coldneſs of the
Air, whereby the Secundine is repelled,
and the Orifice of the Womb ſhut. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
perfumes, whereby the Womb is
allured upwards, violent paſſions of the
Mind, as Fear, and ſudden Frights, the
perverſeneſs of the Woman, who will not
abide in ſuch a poſture, or uſe ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
as are requiſite, the weight of
the Child, whereby the Navel is broken,
the After-birth remaining within, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſs
of the Midwife who cuts the
Veſſels of the Navel too ſoon, or does not
hold them in her Left Hand as ſhe ought,
for if ſhe let them go, they are drawn
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63569:85"/>
back into the Womb, and are hid there
with the Secundine.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to know when the Secundine is
retained in the VVomb, but ſometimes a
piece of it is ſeparated and remains in
the Womb, which is not ſo eaſily perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet it may be known, becauſe the
Womb after Delivery endeavours to eject
ſomething; but tho its endeavours are but
ſmall, a ſenſe of heat and pain is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Womb, and after a few
days a cadaverous ſmell exhales from the
Womb. The retention of the Secundine
is very dangerous, and if it continues
ſome days, an acute Fever, Nauſeouſneſs,
Faintings, difficulty of Breathing, Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the extream Parts, Convulſive Fits,
and at length Death follows.</p>
               <p>The Secundine retained, is expelled by
the ſame remedies, which are propoſed
for a dead Child, to which may be added
ſome Specificks deliver'd by Authors. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landus</hi>
ſays, he has given with ſucceſs
thirty drops of Oyl of Juniper. Some or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Woman to bite an Onion three or
four times and to ſwallow the Juice, and
preſently after to drink a ſmall draught
of Wine. The Juice of green Lovage
drank in Rheniſh-wine is alſo commended.
Sneeſing is alſo good; but the beſt way is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63569:85"/>
to have it drawn out by a skilful Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon,
before the Inflammation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.
If the Secundine cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by any means, but ſticks firmly to
the Womb, and putrifies there, Suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives
muſt be injected; to this purpoſe
Baſilicon may be diſſolved in the following
Decoction.</p>
               <p>Take of the Leaves of Mallows with the
roots three handfuls, of the roots of both the
Birthworts each ſix Drams, of Flax Seeds

to fetch them away, or to cauſe a ſpeedy
expulſion of them. But if when nothing
remains behind in the Womb, the Blood
notwithſtanding continues to flow, you
muſt Blood in the Arm to make diverſion,
and let her Body be laid flat, and not
raiſed, that ſo the Blood may not be ſent

her Loins Cloaths wet in cold Vinegar

the end her ſtrength may be preſerved,
which is extreamly waſted, let her take
every half Hour a little good ſtrong
Broath with a few Spoonfuls of Gelly,
and between whiles the Yolk of a new
laid Egg; but too much Food muſt not
be given at a time, becauſe her Stomach
cannot digeſt it. Her Drink muſt be Red
Wine with a little Water wherein Iron
has been quenched; and if there is the
leaſt appearance of Excrements contained
in the Guts, make no Scruple to give a
Gliſter to evacuate them. But if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

the Blood continues Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then the Woman will often have

               <p>THE Suppreſſion of the Lochia is one

a Woman in Child-bed, eſpecially if
they happen to be totally and ſuddenly
ſtopt the firſt three or four days, which
is the time they ſhould come down plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully.</p>
               <p>To bring the Lochia well down, let
the Woman avoid Paſſion, and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
of the Mind, which may ſtop
them; let her lie in Bed with her Head
and Breaſt a little raiſed, keeping her
ſelf quiet, that ſo the Humours may be
carried downwards by their natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
Let her obſerve a good Diet,
ſomewhat hot and moiſt, and apply an
Hyſteric Plaſter to her Navel.</p>
               <p>Take of the Conſerves of Roman Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
and Rue each one Ounce, of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Myrrh two Drams, of Caſtor, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63569:88"/>
Saffron, Volatile Salt of Armoniac, and
of Aſſa fetida, each half a Dram, with
a ſufficient quantity of the Syrup of the five
opening Roots, make an Electuary. Let her
take the quantity of a Large Nutmeg every
third Hour, drinking upon it three or four
Spoonfuls of the following mixture.</p>
               <p>Take of the Water of Penny royal and
Balm each three Ounces, of Compound Briony
water two Ounces, of Syrup of Mugwort
three Ounces and an half, of Saffron two
Drams, of Caſtor tied up in a rag and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a Glaſs one Scruple, mingle them.</p>
               <p>If theſe things are uſed preſently upon
the Suppreſſion, they generally take it off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but if they have been uſed ſo long that
all the quantity is taken, and the Lochia
are ſtill ſtopt, in this caſe we may uſe
Laudanum for once, but it is beſt to mix
it with Heſterick things: For inſtance,
take ſixteen drops of Liquid Laudanum in
a Spoonful of Compound Briony, or Water.
But it muſt be carfully noted, that if after
having once taken it, the buſineſs is not
done, Opium muſt not be repeated again,
but having waited a while, to ſee what it
will do, we muſt return again to Emme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoges
mixt with Hyſtericks, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
we muſt inject a Gliſter; but what
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63569:88"/>
was ſaid before of Opium, is to be taken
notice of in reſpect of Gliſters, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
the firſt bring down the Lochia, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be hoped for from more.</p>
               <p>Theſe things therefore being done, it
is ſafeſt and the duty of a prudent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
to wait and ſee what time will do,
for if the Woman live over the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
day, ſhe will be in a manner out of
danger, and then ſhe will be able to bear
ſuch a method as is proper and effectual
enough to force the Lochia.</p>
               <p>If the After-pains are more than uſual,
you muſt Swath the Womans Belly gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it may ſubſide, and not move hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and thither, as it often happens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
delivery, upon ſo ſudden an evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and then give three Ounces of Oyl
of Almonds freſh drawn, mixt with one
Ounce and an half of Syrup of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</p>
               <p>And Gliſters may be injected made of
Milk and Sugar, and yolks of Eggs, and
the Belly muſt be anointed with the Oyl
of Dill, or of Rue, or of Jaſmine. A Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
may be alſo made of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of Mugwort, Feverfew, Baulm,
of the Leaves of Bays, and Calaminth,
of the Seeds of Daucus, Cummin, and
Carraways, of the Flowers of Camomile
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63569:89"/>
and Wall-flower, made in Water and
White-wine, or in Milk. It is alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to cover the Belly with a Sheeps-skin,
freſh flead off, and appli'd hot. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Powder taken preſently after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
preſerves the Woman from Pain in
a wonderful manner; and ſome think if
the Woman takes it in her firſt lying in,
ſhe will never be troubled with theſe
Pains.</p>
               <p>Take of Comfry dryed one Dram, of the
Kirnels of Peach ſtones, and of Nutmegs,
each two Scruples, of Amber half a Dram,
of Ambergriſe half a Scruple, make a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whereof let her take a Dram with White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine,
and if there be a Fever with Broth.</p>
               <p>If the Woman after delivery be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

taken off by applying a Plaſter of Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num

and hard, ſometimes on the firſt,
ſometimes on the ſecond, third, or fourth

               <p>It begins and proceeds moſt commonly
in the following manner, after a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
indiſpoſition, the Fever begins moſt
commonly with a ſhaking and ſhivering,
which Heat preſently follows, and after
that Sweat, the firſt or ſecond day fits of
Heat and Cold ſucceed one another, and
then all the Blood being inflamed, the
Lochia if they were not ſuppreſſed before,
flow but little, or quite ſtop; if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
be acute, and of quick motion, it
comes to its height the third or fourth
day; the Heat is violent, and the Thirſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63569:90"/>
very much, the Pulſe vehement and quick,
watchings obſtinate, there is a great reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs,
that the ſick tumble from one
ſide of the Bed to the other continually;
the Urin is thick and red, and there are
many other grievous Symptoms; when
the Fever is in its ſtate, no Criſis is to be
expected, for I never ſaw this Diſeaſe
go off by a critical Sweat.</p>
               <p>The acute Diſeaſes of Women in Child-bed
are ſometimes accompanied with a
Quinſie, Pluriſie, Peripneumonia, Bloody-flux,
Small-pox, and the like; of theſe a
Quinſie, Pluriſie, and Peripneumonia, by
reaſon of the great Smilitude of the
Cauſe, and Analogy of the Cure, may be
conſidered together; preſently at their
firſt beginning we muſt endeavour that
the Blood fixed any where, and beginning
to be extravaſated be reſtor'd to Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
leſt an Impoſthume ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned;
wherefore internal remedies which
free the Blood from Coagulation muſt be
uſed, of which ſort are Diaphoreticks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with Volatile Salt, as Spirit of
Harts-horn, of Soot, and Urine, alſo
Teſtaceous and Bezoartick Powders, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis
Prunella, Decoctions and a Julep made

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63569:90"/>
ſuch things as have been found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
to be proper for Uterine Diſeaſes.
Moreover diſcutient Medicines, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe

Fomentations, and Cataplaſms,
muſt be carefully applyed to the parts
affected; in the mean while the violent
Motion and immoderate efferveſcence
muſt be driven far from thence, and the
filth muſt be driven as much as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
downwards; to this end Frictions,
Ligatures, Epiſpaſticks, and if there be
occaſion, Cupping Glaſſes, muſt be applied
about the Legs and Feet. If the Diſeaſe
be very violent Bleeding is indicated, and
unleſs there be a Plethora in the whole
Body, and the Inflammation be very acute
in the part affected, it were be beſt to open
a Vein in the Foot, or to apply Leeches
to the Hemorrhoidal Veins; but if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
urge, we may bleed in the Arm,
and afterwards, if it can be admitted, in
the Foot; but you muſt take notice, that
Bleeding muſt be cautiouſly uſed in theſe
Caſes, for unleſs it does good, which I
have ſeldom found, the Sick is in a worſe
condition, being render'd weaker there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p>The Bloody-flux is very often deadly,
and ſo much the rather, becauſe ſuch
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63569:91"/>
things as qualifie the Blood, and that
moderately bind, are indicated; but the
Flux of the Lochia forbids them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this caſe till ſhe has been well

               <p>The Indications in the Small-pox are

for a Week at leaſt with Water-gruel,
ſometimes made with Beer, ſometimes
made with Water mixt with White-wine,
or with Panada, and other things
of eaſie Digeſtion: Secondly, They muſt
take great care that they do not catch
cold, whereby the Pores and the Lochia
may be ſtopt; wherefore let them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue

Thirdly, The Lochia muſt be gently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked;
to this end Midwives when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hard Labour, there is danger of the
ſtoppage of the Lochia, give Sperma Ceti,
Iriſh Slates powdered, or White-wine
Tinctured with Saffron, and they make

               <p>THeſe Diſeaſes happen in Child-bed, for
want of a ſufficient evacuation, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the fault of the Blood, the Suppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, or too great an Evacuation; or by
Fevers, an ill Vapour ruſhing upon the
Brain, whereof <hi>Luſitanus</hi> mentions an
obſervation of a very Beautiful Lady,
that preſently after delivery fell Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
and was mad for a Month, but
by the uſe of a few Medicines recovered
her Senſes; and I, ſays <hi>Rodericus a Caſtro,</hi>
have often cured a Dutch Merchants Wife
who was frequently diſtracted after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
Theſe Diſeaſes are thus diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Melancholy is a Delirium without
a Fever, occaſioned by a Melancholy
humour poſſeſſing the Seat of the Mind.
Madneſs is more outragious, and a hot
Intemperies is the occaſion of it; whereas
Melancholy proceeds from a cold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63569:92"/>
An Epilepſie is a Convulſion
of all the parts of the Body, not perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
but by intervals, with a depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Senſe and Jugdment. Laſtly, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium
is an alienation of the Mind, and
proceeds moſt commonly from a bilious
Fever, and therefore is not a Diſeaſe, but
a Symptom.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the general Indications; if
theſe Diſeaſes proceed from an immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
Flux, it muſt be ſtopt, the ſtrength
muſt be kept up, and the cold and dry
Intemperies muſt be corrected. If they
proceed from a Suppreſſion of the Child-bed
Purgations, they muſt be forced; if
they are occaſioned by a fault in the

Chaps of the Nipples.</head>
               <p>IF the Milk flow too freely into the
Breaſts, a Thin and Spare Diet muſt
be ordered, and the Breaſts muſt be often
ſucked to prevent the Inflammation of them,
and the immoderate efferveſcence of the
Blood; and if it be not thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that the Woman ſhould give ſuck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it is cuſtomary on the firſt or third day
of Lying in, to apply over the Breaſts
moderately aſtringent Cerecloths, or the
Populean Oyntment, and <hi>Galens</hi> cooling
Cerate equally mixt, and ſpread on Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen;
ſome uſe Linnen dipt in Luke-warm
Verjuice, wherein a little Allom has bin
diſſolved, that ſo it may be more aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
but great care muſt be taken in the
application and change of theſe things,
that the Woman catch not the leaſt cold,
as alſo that no Inflammation or Impoſtume
be cauſed, inſtead of driving back the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63569:94"/>
Milk: Wherefore things are to be applyed
according to the variety of the caſe.</p>
               <p>But the beſt way to drive away the
Milk is the cauſing an ample Evacuation
of the Lochia, which is much further'd
by keeping the Belly open with Gliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>Milk is the occaſion of many tumours
of divers kinds: The differences may be
thus enumerated; if the Ferment of the
Breaſt be over active, it ſeparates the
Milk with too great violence, cauſing
thereby an over Fermentation in the
part, which uſually produces a Tumor
called a Phlegmon, if the Serum be hot,
or partakes much of Blood; otherwiſe it
raiſes a Tumor called an Oedema; or if
the matter be diſpoſed to Coagulate, the
Kings Evil: And theſe are the moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Species of Tumors generally repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ariſe from Milk, and either of
them may degenerate into a Scirrhus,
and that Scirrhus into a Cancer. The
Signs are Viſible; if the firſt happen,
there are all the Symptoms of a Phlegmon,
Heat, Redneſs, Tenſion, Pulſation, and
the like; if the Second, large diſtenſion
with pain, but no heat; if the Kings
Evil, then hard Kernels are eaſily felt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:63569:94"/>
Swellings made by the over eagerneſs
of the milky Ferment go eaſily off, if
no other Symptom attend them. Sucking
and drawing the Breaſt for the moſt part
diſcharges the Milk, as faſt as it can be
generated, and then all goes off well.
But if the Fermentation produce any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in the Blood, there is more or leſs
danger according to the quality of the
Tumor produced, <hi>viz.</hi> A Phlegmon is
apt to occaſion a Fever, Oedematous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
are apt to grow Ulcers, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Scrophulous, and Scirrhous, and
require a long time for their Cure. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it frequently happens to Women in
Child-bed, that their Breaſts do ſwell
extraordinarly by reaſon of abundance of
Milk, which flows into them, and occaſions
Inflammations, Impoſtumations, and the
like; therefore their Diet ought to be
ſlender, and of ſuch a quality as may leſs
diſpoſe the Humours to ferment, as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-gruel,
Panado, and the like. But
if the Inflammation be not violent, or the
Patient weak, Chicken Broath may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with Wood-ſorrel, Purſlain, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
boiled in it, or a boiled Chicken, a
Potched Egg, and ſuch ſort of Meats of
eaſie digeſtion. The Medicines proper to
diminiſh the Milk, are Lettice, Purſlain,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63569:95"/>
Endive, Succory, Smallage, and the like,
the Seeds of wild Rue, Cummin, Baſil
powdered and given to the quantity of
one Dram daily in Broath, will dry up
the Milk, as Authors write.</p>
               <p>The Milk is uſually drawn out of the
Breaſts by the Infants ſucking them: But
if the Child be ſo weak, it cannot ſuck,
or does not diſcharge them enough, ſome
body elſe muſt do it, or young Whelps
may ſuck them, or the Mother may draw
her own Breaſts her ſelf by an Inſtrument
ſold for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The ſwelling made by the Milk is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by the application of Night-ſhade,
Lettice, Plantain, Vine-tops, Bramble-buds,
Horſe-tail, and the like, or with the Oyl
of Myrtles and Vinegar.</p>
               <p>It may be diſcuſſed by the application
of Mints, Catmints, Rue, the Seeds of
Fenugreek, Cummin, Fennel, and the
like, or dried up by applying Cloaths dipt
in Lime water, or a Solution of Sacharum
Saturni in the Water of Frogs Spawn; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time fine Tow may be ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with Ceruſs, and applied to the Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits:
But theſe things muſt be only uſed
at the beginning of the Fluxion.</p>
               <p>But if the Inflammation be gon too far
towards Suppuration, then it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63569:95"/>
with Suppuratives, and opened by
Inciſion or a Cauſtick.</p>
               <p>Where the ſwelling has been hard, and
not inflamed, uſe the following Cerat.</p>
               <p>Take of the tops of Wormwood powdered
two Drams, of the Seeds of Fenugreek and
Fennel, each one Ounce and an half, of the
Juice of Henbane and Hemlock, each three
Ounces, of Oyntment of Marſh-mallows two
Ounces, of Ducks Fat, and Gooſe Greaſe,
each one Ounce, of Deers Suet two Ounces,
of Liquid Storax half an Ounce, with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
quantity of Wax, make a Cerat.</p>
               <p>Hemlock boyled in Wine, and beaten
up with Hogs Lard reſolves the hardneſs
of the Breaſts. Green Mints, or Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weed
are common applications, and of
good uſe, either alone or mixed with
other Medicines, in all the hard Swellings
of the Breaſt occaſioned by Milk. All
Plaſters applied to the Breaſts muſt have
a hole ſniped in them for the Nipples,
leſt they be fretted by them, eſpecially
that the Milk may be drawn forth whilſt
the Medicines lye on.</p>
               <p>But it is beſt to prevent ſuch Swellings
at the beginning by procuring an ample
and large Evacuation of the Lochia. For
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63569:96"/>
the Chaps and Excoriations of the Niples,
Rags dipt in Plantain-water may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
or the Oyntment called Diapom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pholigos
may be uſed: But great care
muſt be taken that nothing be applied to
diſguſt the Child; wherefore ſome only
uſe Honey of Roſes: But if the Excoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Pain be much, the Woman muſt
forbear giving the Child ſuck.</p>
               <p>If the Child has wholly ſucked off the
Nipples, the Milk then muſt be quite dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away, that ſo the Ulcers which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
may be the ſooner healed.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of want of Milk.</head>
               <p>THE cauſe of want of Milk is a Vice
of the Blood, the weakneſs of the
Body, or of the Child, the ſmallneſs of
the Breaſts, the narrowneſs of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
any immoderate Evacuation by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part, as by the Mouth, by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
by the Noſtrils, or by the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids,
by immoderate Cold, ill Diet,
Faſting, great Labour, or Sorrow.</p>
               <p>The whole Cure in a manner conſiſts
in Diet. If therefore it be occaſioned for
want of Blood, or by a dry Intemperies,
from whence it chiefly proceeds, it muſt
be cured by a hot and moiſt Diet, and
the Air muſt be moiſt and moderately
warm. Sleep is better than immoderate
Watching. The Bread muſt be Wheaten
and well fermented. Goats or Sheeps
Milk boil'd with Yolks of Eggs, and
ſweetned is good; ſo is Rice boild with
Milk and Honey, Potched Eggs, Chicken
Broath, Mutton or Veal Broath, or Broath
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63569:97"/>
of Pheſants, or the Fleſh of them with a
Sauce made of Rocket and Honey; the
Udders of Animals are alſo good. Of
Fiſhes, a Trout, Mullet, a Salmon, Soles,
Place, Pikes, and the like are good; and
for the ſecond Courſe, Sweet Almonds,
Raiſins of the Sun, Piſtaches, Pine Nuts,
Rocket, Parſnips roaſted under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
or prepared with Honey. <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorides</hi>
and <hi>Avicenna</hi> commend Fennel
and Smalage; Lettice is alſo good, ſo
are Cabbage, Wild Thime, Leeks, Rocket,
Fennel. Let her drink be ſweet Wine,
or White-wine, or Barley water with the
Seeds of Fennel, or Ale; wherein if you
boyl Butter, Sugar, and Bread, you'll
Scarce find a better Diet for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
The German Women uſe this for
their Meat and Drink almoſt all the time
they give ſuck. All things that are acid,
acrid, bitter and very hot muſt be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But if this defect proceed from heat
or choler, you muſt uſe cooling things,
and the Body muſt be purged according
to the Nature of the Humour: But if the
Blood be Flegmatick, and the Veſſels ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
you muſt open the Obſtructions
and attenuate the Blood; therefore you
muſt give hot things, as Smallage, Dill,
Penny-royal with Wine: But you muſt be
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63569:97"/>
careful not to give things that are too hot;
for they dry up the Milk. And as thoſe
things which Moderately provoke the
Courſes breed Milk, ſo thoſe that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
force them leſſen it.</p>
               <p>Blood is never to be drawn, nor are
ſtrong Purges to be uſed: But if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to uſe Purging by reaſon of the
fault of the Humours, the Nurſe muſt
take four days before ſuch things as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Milk, and ſuch Medicines muſt
be given as increaſe the Milk. As</p>
               <p>Take of thee Seeds of Fennel, of Leeks, and
Rocket, each two Drams, of Mace one Dram,

Ounces of the Broath, and waſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Breaſts

               <p>But if the want of Milk proceeds from
the ſmallneſs of the Breaſts, foment them
with a Decoction of Fenugreek, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momile
made in Wine, or with hot Beer

good, you muſt chuſe another Nurſe; but
you muſt try all things firſt, for change of

               <head type="sub">Of a Woman ſuckling her own Children,
and of chuſing a Nurſe.</head>
               <p>THE Mothers Milk is fitteſt for the
Child, becauſe it is moſt agreeable to
it Nature: Beſides the Mother will be
more vigilant and careful than a hired
Nurſe; for none can love, the Child ſo
well as the own Mother, who upon the
account of her affection is unwearied in
the attending of the Child, and thinks
ſhe never does enough for it, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
awaked by its crying; whereas
mercenary Nurſes often overlay Children
and ſuffocate them. Moreover the Body,
and the diſpoſition of the Mind are more
framed by the Milk and Nouriſhment,
than by the nature of the Seed; and as
you often obſerve that the Child is purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when the Nurſe is Purged; ſo the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Humours are in a manner the
ſame with hers, as Trees partake of the
nature of the Soil they are planted in. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it is the duty of a Mother to nurſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63569:98"/>
her own Child; for thoſe that do not are
but half Mothers, and to be ſure cannot
love them ſo well as thoſe that do. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account a <hi>Roman</hi> Youth of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> returning Rich and
Victorious from the Wars, being met by
his Mother and his Nurſe, gave his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Silver Ring, and his Nurſe a
Gold Chain; whereat his Mother being
offended; You, ſaid he, nouriſhed me on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Nine Months in the Womb, and then
rejected me, this Woman received me
into her Arms, and ſuckled me two Years,
and taught me to be orderly. The Water
nouriſhes what is bred in the Water, and
the Earth nouriſhes what is bred in the
Earth: Nor is there any Beaſt ſo cruel,
as not to nouriſh its young ones. Tygers,
Lions, and Vipers take care of their
young ones, and only Man makes Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of his: Oh! incredible and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Villany, what can be more cruel,
than to expoſe a tender Infant that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores
his Mothers help, as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſhe can get rid of it? But God in
his Providence often puniſhes their Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;
for their Milk often curdles in
their Breaſt, and occaſions dreadful pains,
ſo that thoſe Breaſts, which were denied
their Children are forced to be ſuckt by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63569:99"/>
Puppies; nor is this all, for their Breaſts
are often Inflamed and Suppurated, and
muſt be cut with Knives, or burnt with
red hot Irons, or becoming Cancerous,
the rotten Fleſh drops from them piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal.
But ſome will object in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
that they are either too young or too
weak, yet without doubt if they are able
to Conceive, they may Suckle too; for
God never gave them Breaſts full of Milk
to no purpoſe. But if they have not
Milk enough, which is the only real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
a Nurſe muſt be choſen, who ought
to be of an age betwixt twenty and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
ſhe ought to be of a ſtrong Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
well Coloured, not too Fat, nor
too Lean; ſhe muſt not have rotten Teeth,
nor a ſtinking Breath, nor be affected
with Scabs, Ulcers, the French-Pox,
Gout, Conſumption, or any other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.
Thirdly, Her Manners are to be
conſidered; for the Child ſucks them in
with the Milk; whereof the Nurſe ought
to be good tempered; ſhe muſt not be
ſubject to violent Paſſions, nor wholly
without Paſſion, nor of a weak Judgment;
ſhe muſt not be ſquint eyed, leſt the
Child ſhould be ſo; ſhe muſt be Chaſt,
and not have Converſation with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
leſt her Courſes ſhould flow, or the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63569:99"/>
Blood be diſturbed, and conſequently the
Milk; or be with Child, whereby the
Milk would be leſſened, and become vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious:
but ſome think that the Courſes
flowing moderately does not vitiate the
Milk, but rather cleanſes the reſt of the
Blood. Fourthly, we muſt conſider the
time from Delivery; for ſhe muſt not
give ſuck too near Delivery, nor too long
from the time of it. She muſt not give
ſuck until ſhe be free of the Child-bed
Purgations; the time moſt approved of,
is from the Second Month to the Sixth,
and ſhe ſhould have Nurſed a Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Fifthly, The Breaſts are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
which ought to be moderately
full, not looſe and hanging down; but
ſolid and firm, of a moderate bigneſs
and hardneſs, and the Veins of them
ſhould look blew, and diſperſed into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtreams, moderately elevated, that
they may contain the more Milk; for if
they are denſe, and the Milk is bound
up in them, and as it were ſuffocated,
the Child can ſcarce draw it, and ſo
either takes a diſtaſte, or if it ſuck on,
the Noſe is flattened by the preſſure.
Sixthly, The Paps muſt not be ſo ſhort
as that the Child cannot take hold of
them with his Lips, nor ſo long and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63569:100"/>
thick, as to fill the Infants Mouth, ſo that
it cannot readily uſe its Tongue to ſuck
or ſwallow. Seventhly, The nature of
the Milk muſt be conſidered, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the clearneſs and ſweetneſs of it,
which are the firſt requiſits, muſt be alſo
ſweet-ſented, not too thick nor too thin,
which may be tried by dipping a hair in
the Milk, hanging it up, if the Milk ſlide
off, it is naught, but if it compaſs the
whole hair it is good. Eightly, chuſe a
Nurſe which was laſt delivered of a Male
child. Ninethly, Such an one as is not
wont to miſcarry. Tenthly, She muſt not
be with Child. The Nurſe ſo deſcribed
on the firſt days ſhe begins to ſuckle muſt
uſe a ſimple Diet, leſt too much Milk
ſhould overwhelm the tender Infant. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
let her have good Meats: She
muſt not Drink exceſſively, ſhe muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from Wine, and from ſalt, ſharp,
and a ſtringent Meats, and Leeks, Onions,
Garlick, Rocket and Spices. She muſt
avoid all perturbations of Mind, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation;
let her moderately exerciſe
her Arms and upper Parts. Laſtly, Her
Diet muſt be ſuch, as the Nature and
Conſtitution of the Infant requires; if
the Child be of a hot Conſtitution, ſhe
muſt uſe a cooling Diet; but if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63569:100"/>
be of a cold Conſtitution, a little
Wine and Spices muſt be allowed, and
ſtronger exerciſe, and if the Nurſe be not
well, ſhe muſt be purged, and Diet muſt
be ordered according to the faults of the
Milk, and the diſorders of the Child. The
Nurſe muſt be always chearful, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſinging with the Child. She muſt
keep it clean. She muſt ſpeak diſtinctly.
She muſt aſſiſt the Child in ſucking by
preſſing gently her Breaſts; but ſhe muſt
not let the Child ſuck too much at once.</p>

               <p>Firſt, if the Privities are too moiſt,
ſuch things muſt be uſed as dry; the
following Uterine Gliſter is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>Take of Galls number four, of Spodium
two Spoonfuls, powder them very fine, and add
Six Ounces of Stiptic-wine; afterwards put
up the following Peſſary.</p>
               <p>Take of the Bark of the Pine two Drams,
Allom one Dram, of Cyprus one Pugil, boyl
them in Wine to the conſiſtence of a Pultiſs,
apply them often with a rag: Or infuſe
Galls in Rain-water eight days, and with ſoft
Wool ſprinkled with Sulphur, and dipt in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63569:103"/>
this Water and dried without preſſing, make
a Peſſary.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, And chiefly you muſt uſe
Aſtringents, Foment the Genitals with the
Water or Decoction of Acorns, unripe
Sloes, and of Horſe-tail; or Foment the
Parts with Allom-water, or with Stiptic-Wine,
that is, red and rough Wine boyl'd
with Galls, Leaves of Myrtles, Red Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Pomgranet-peel Balauſtines, and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Nuts: Or,</p>
               <p>Take of Cypreſs Nuts and Galls, each one
Pound, of Roch-allom, and the filings of Iron
prepared in Vinegar, each half a Pound, boyl
them in a ſufficient quantity of the Waters of
Galls, which Tanners uſe, and Foment the
Parts often with it.</p>
               <p>The following Water is counted excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
               <p>Take of Galls, and of Cypreſs Nuts, each
half a Pound, of Allom ſix Drams, Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armonick
half a Pound, of the Meal of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns,
and of old Beans, each half a Pound,
the Whites of twelve Eggs, of Powder of
Brick one Pound; let them be all finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and infuſe them three Days in Smiths
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63569:103"/>
Water, or in a decoction of Sloes, Medlars,
or Horſe-tail, with half a Pint of Roſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar;
then Diſtill them in a cold Still with
a gentle Fire; add to the Water that comes
off, of the Powders of Maſtick, Myrrh, and
Dragons Blood, each two Drams. Set the
water in the Sun in the Summer for ten
days, this ſtraitens the Privities, ſmoothens
the Belly, and makes the Breaſts ſolid.</p>

from Diſtempers of the Womb in
Childbed.</head>
               <p>THE Womb is ſometimes terribly
affected in Child-bed, and produces
Fevers of very Malignant and Veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Natures, which ſoon cauſe Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and worſe Tumours, in the Womb
it ſelf, and ſometimes in other parts of
the Body, there being none of them on
which the Uterine Ferment has not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.
The Exhorbitances or Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of that, whether from an hurt
in Labour, from part of the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth
left behind, from cold taken, or
the Lochia ſtopt, ſoon produce ſuch Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent
Diſtempers in the Blood as make
it caſt out a Tumor, either upon the
part it ſelf, or elſe outwardly upon the
Muſcles of the Body, where when they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:63569:104"/>
light, they prove corroſive, ſometimes
eating out the Fleſh in which they lodge,
which falls off in whole pieces, without
that change of colour in the Skin, which
is in Gangreens, ſo that ſometimes the
Bone it ſelf is laid bare by them.</p>
               <p>The Cauſes are hard Labour, the
Womb hurt, or part of the Secundine
left behind; Cold taken in Child-bed, and
a prediſpoſition in the Humours, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their peccancy in quantity or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>The Prognoſtick may be taken from
the largneſs, or other qualifications of the
Abſceſs, and the Symptoms that happen
to the Body thereupon. If the Tumor
happens only from ſome little diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
in the Womb of a Perſon other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of a good habit of Body, the cure
is hopeful. If part of the After-birth
be retained, there is no hope's of Cure
till that be removed, nay if it ſtay ſo
long, as to induce Putrefaction of the
part, it will be too late then to remove
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:63569:105"/>
If the Body be of an ill Habit, the
Tumours are apt to Degenerate into
very Venomous and Malignant Abſceſſes,
which if they do not ſuddenly kill, do
at leaſt produce ill conditoned Ulcers, hard
of Cure, and for the moſt part mortal
in the long courſe of the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>In the Cure of theſe Abſceſſes, you
are to inform your ſelf how the Womb
is diſturbed, and appeaſe that; and
if any part of the After-birth be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
to endeavour the bringing that
away, and by good Sudorificks, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
and the like, to expel the Venom,
and fortifie the Spirits againſt the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that is thereby contracted, and to
attemperate the heat, and the Acrimony
by Julips and Emulſions.</p>
               <p>The Swellings ariſing from theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire

                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:63569:105"/>
A young Woman after Child-bed was
ſeized with a great Pain and Swelling
in her Groin, with a Fever. Bleeding
and Lenient Purgatives to Evacuate the
Humours were preſcribed, alſo Cordial
Juleps, and the like, to attemperate the
Heat, and fortifie the Spirits; and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Repellents mixed with Diſcutients
in Fomentations, and Plaſters with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
were uſed, which diſperſed the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
in the Thigh, and reſtored that
part to its former temper: But in the
mean time the Tumor increaſed in the
Groin, and was ſuppurated after the
manner of a Bubo; it was opened, and a
deterſion was endeavoured; but the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
reaching down the Twiſt, the Matter
could not be diſcharged without laying
it more open, as in Sinous Ulcers, by
which method it was cured.</p>
               <p>A Gentlewoman in Child-bed was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Fever, and the Ninth Day
complained of a pain in her Foot. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutients
were preſcribed, together with
things proper for the Fever to breath
out the impacted Matter in her Foot;
but the pain increaſing, the upper part
of the Foot from the Inſtep to the Toes
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63569:106"/>
were Oedematous; but from the inſide
of the Ancle to the middle of the Sole
of her Foot inflamed, and ſeeming to
apoſtumate. The ill conſequences of an
Apoſtumation in that part amongſt the
Tendons and Bones, and where the
Skin is uſually ſo hard and tough, that
our ſtrongeſt Cauſticks could difficultly
penetrate, being feared; It was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to endeavour the reſtraint of the
Influx, and ſo to dry up the Humour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
the part; to which purpoſe was
applied the following Plaſter.</p>
               <p>Take of Barley Meal Six Ounces, of
Flax Seeds powdered Six Drams, of the
Flowers of Camomile and Elder, each three
Drams, of the Flowers of Red Roſes and
Balauſtins, each one Ounce; theſe with the
addition of Honey of Roſes and Oyl of
Myrtles were boyled to the conſiſtence of a
Plaster in red Wine, and at Bed-time
an Anodyne Draught was given to cauſe
reſt.</p>
               <p>The next Morning the Patient was
ſomewhat relieved, and when the Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
were taken off, the Tumor and
Inflammation ſeemed leſs. This way of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63569:106"/>
dreſſing was continued with Compreſs
and Bandage, and the Humour was in
few Days dried up, and the Foot ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
well; but there appeared again a
Swelling on the Foot, and Apoſtumated
in the Sole of the Foot in three ſeveral
places, which were opened with a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
to prevent the increaſe of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Eſchars were divided to
give a vent, and they were dreſſed with
<hi>Baſilicon</hi> and the Plaſter as before, and
the flowing of the Matter was indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to be hindred dayly by Compreſs
and Bandage; but the Poſition of the
Foot gave way, and it ſunk lower, ſo
that there was a neceſſity of applying
another Cauſtick, which proved effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to the Diſcharge of it; ſo that the
upper Orifices healed, but this laſt Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char
ſeparated ſlowly, and left the great
Tendon bare; the Separation was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by the uſe of Oyl of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
with <hi>Baſilicon</hi> applied warm, and
the Tendon was incarnated with a
Sarcotick compoſed of a mixture of
Powder of Orris, Myrrh, Sarcocoll, and
Mercury precipitate, with Honey of
Roſes and Turpentine, and the Ulcer
was cicatrized with the Epuloticks. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63569:107"/>
it was cicatrized the Sole of her
Foot was ſo relaxed and tender, that upon
ſetting it on the Ground it became very
much ſubject to a pituitous Swelling:
But by the uſe of a Fomentation and a
laced Stocking, the weak parts were
ſtrengthned, and ſhe was cured.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the Falling of the Womb.</head>
               <p>FOR the Cure of this Diſeaſe, regard
muſt be had to two things; the firſt
is to reduce the Womb to its natural
place; the ſecond is to ſtrengthen and to
keep it there.</p>
               <p>If the Womb be quite out or turned,
the Woman muſt firſt of all render her
Urine, and a Gliſter muſt be given to
Evacuate the groſs Excrements that are
in the right Gut, that ſo the Reduction
may be the eaſier performed: Then place
her on her Back with her Hips raiſed a
little higher than her Head, and then
foment all that is fallen out, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Wine and Water luke-warm, and
with a ſoft Rag put it into its proper
place, thruſting it back not all at once,
but wagging it by little and little from
ſide to ſide. In caſe this be too painful,
becauſe it's already too big and ſwell'd,
anoint it with Oyl of Almonds, for the
more eaſie reduction of it; but wipe oft
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63569:108"/>
the Oyl, as ſoon as it is reduced. But
if it cannot be put up by reaſon of the
great Inflammation and Tumor, there is
great danger that it will gangrene.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond part of the Cure,
which conſiſts in the retention of the
Womb in its place, and the ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, let the Woman keep her ſelf
in Bed upon her Back having her Hips a
little raiſed, her Legs croſſed, and her
Thighs joyned together to prevent the
falling of it out again. But the beſt way
is to put up a Peſſary into the Neck of
the Womb to keep it firm.</p>
               <p>Take of Oak Bark two Ounces, boyl it in
two Quarts of Fountain Water, add at the
latter end an Ounce of Pomgranat-peel bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Red Roſes, Pomgranat Flowers, each two
handfuls, and then add half a Pint of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine;
ſtrain it, and bath the part affected
with Flannels dipt in it in the Morning two
hours before the Woman riſes, and at night
when ſhe is in Bed; continue it till the Symptom
is quite gone.</p>

            <div n="27" type="chapter">
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:63569:108"/>
               <head>CHAP. XXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of a Dropſie and Inflation of the
Womb.</head>
               <p>THE Inflation and Dropſie are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
by almoſt all Authors; but
they are to be diſtinguiſhed; for there is
a certain Inflation of the Womb
which ought not to be called a Dropſie,
<hi>Viz.</hi> When the Womb is Inflated, and
ſtretched ſuddenly by Wind ruſhing in;
upon which account a violent Pain is
occaſioned; this often happens in Hyſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick
Diſeaſes. Wherefore a Dropſie of the
Womb is two-fold, one from Wind,
which is like a Tympany; another from
a watery Humour, which is like a Dropſie
of the Belly.</p>
               <p>As to the Diagnoſtick of theſe Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
many things are to be enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>Firſt, How they may be diſtinguiſhed
from an univerſal Dropſie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, How the Species of it may be
known, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it proceeds from
Wind, Water, or Flegm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:63569:109"/>
Thirdly, If it ariſe primarily from the
Womb, or be occaſioned by the fault
of ſome other part.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether the peccant Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be contained in the Cavity of the
Womb, or within the Membranes of it,
or in Bladders.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, How it may be diſtinguiſhed
from other Tumours of the Womb.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, How it may be diſtinguiſhed
from being with Child.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, How it may be diſtinguiſhed
from a Mola.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is diſtinguiſhed from an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Dropſie, for that in a Dropſie of
the Womb, the Tumour poſſeſſes more
the bottom of the Womb, and there is
not ſo ſoon a paleneſs and waſting of the
whole Body, as in an univerſal Dropſie.
Beſides, in a Dropſie of the Womb, the
thirſt and drineſs of the Tongue is not
conſiderable, and Wind breaks out by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals,
or a little Water flows out, which
manifeſtly ſhew, that Wind or Water is
contained in the Womb.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Species of Dropſies in
the Womb are thus diſtinguiſhed, if it
be occaſioned by Wind, the bottom of
the Belly ſounds being ſtruck; there are
pricking pains in the Belly, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63569:109"/>
run through the Diaphragm, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
Loins, Navel, and other parts,
and ſometimes the Wind does evidently
break through the Neck of the Womb;
the Diſeaſe grows worſe upon eating and
drinking, and they often belch, and are
better after it; they ſometimes perceive
a pain in the Region of the Hypogaſter,
ſo that they cannot bear an Hand laid
on it; theſe ſigns are alſo in an Inflation
of the Womb; but there is this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for an Inflation is but for a ſmall
ſpace, and a Dropſie from Wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
much longer.</p>
               <p>But if a Dropſie of the Womb is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by Water, that Region appears
ſoft and flaccid, for Wind cauſes a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
there is a greater weight in the
part, and a ſound as it were of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
floating, and Water ſometimes drops
from the part. And if it proceed from
Flegm, there is a greater ſoftneſs and
flaccidity of the part, which dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes,
and afflicts the neighbouring
parts with oedematous Swellings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If there be ſigns of the
whole Bodies being ill affected, as by
long or acute Fevers, by immoderate
Hemorrhagies, by weakneſs of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
ſwelling of the Liver or Spleen,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63569:110"/>
or by other obſtinate Diſeaſes of thoſe
parts, by which the Dropſie of the
Womb began, and increaſed with them;
there is good reaſon to conjecture that
the Matter of the Dropſie is received in
thoſe parts; but if when the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is well, ſuch a Tumour happens,
and ſucceeds particular Diſeaſes of the
Womb, as hard Labour, ſuppreſſion of
the Courſes, or too large an Evacuation
of them, or Ulcers and Tumours, we
may gueſs that the Dropſie of the
Womb proceeds from them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Matter which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the cavity of the Womb cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
a much greater Tumour than when
it is contained within the Membranes.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a Dropſie of the Womb may
be diſtinguiſhed from Tumours that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from a Phlegmon, or an Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
becauſe in theſe there is a Fever
and Pain upon the leaſt touching; it may
be diſtinguiſhed from the Scirrhous,
or Cancerous Tumour by the hardneſs
that reſiſts the Finger.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, When a Woman is with
Child, the Tumour is not equal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
but thruſts it ſelf out above the
Navel; and when a Woman is with
Child, after ſome Months ſhe is moſt
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63569:110"/>
commonly better; but the longer a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
laſts, the worſe it grows, and the
motion of the Child is plainly to be
felt after the third or fourth Month; yet
in a Dropſie that ariſes from Wind, a
palpitation may be ſometimes perceived
in the Womb, and when a Woman is
with Child, the Breaſts ſwell, but in a
Dropſie they wax ſmall.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In a Mole there is a weight
felt in the Body, which is not perceived
in a Dropſie of the Womb, and when
the Sick lies on either ſide, a weight is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as if a Stone rolled thither. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
in a Mole there are violent Fluxes
of the Courſes by intervals, namely, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
third or fourth Month, which does not
happen in a Dropſie of the Womb; and
laſtly, in a Mole the Breaſts ſwell, and
have Milk in them ſometimes, but there
is no ſuch thing in a Dropſie.</p>
               <p>As to the Prognoſticks, a Simple Inflati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Womb is not dangerous, but
if it continue long, it may turn to a
Dropſie.</p>
               <p>If Wind or Water is contained in
the cavity of the Womb it is eaſier cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
than when it is included in the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
or in Bladders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:63569:111"/>
This Diſeaſe is cured much the ſame
way as a Dropſie or Green-ſickneſs is;
but ſome things peculiar to this Diſeaſe
muſt be added: If the Diſeaſe be new,
and occaſioned by an Obſtruction of the
Courſes, and if there be a fulneſs of
Blood, Bleeding may be proper, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it is injurious; but Purging is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
neceſſary, and muſt be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated,
and after ſufficient Purging, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritives,
Diureticks, and ſuch things
as move the Courſes muſt be uſed,
to which may be added the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Take the Roots of Smallage, and Madder,
each half an Ounce, of the Leaves of Savin,
Feverfew, and Penny-royal, each one Pugil,
of the Seeds of Daucus, one Dram, boyl them
in the Broaths of young Pidgeons, and let
her take it ſtrained in the Morning for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Days. But before ſhe takes the Broath,
let her ſwallow one of the following Pills,</p>
               <p>Take of the beſt Caſtor, Myrrh and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
each half a Dram, of Saffron one
Scruple, with the Juice of Lemons, make
nine Pills; after the uſe of which Medicine,
violent Exerciſe muſt be uſed, that thereby
the Excrements bred in the Bowels, and in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63569:111"/>
the habit of the Body may be diſſipated, and
alſo all that which is contained in the Womb,
the Skins being broken by the violence of the
Exerciſe, and if the Woman Vomit eaſily, it
will be proper to Vomit her twice a Week.
The following Bolus is very effectual to diſcuſs
the Humour contained in the Womb.</p>
               <p>Take of Mineral Borax, half a Dram,
of Saffron half a Scruple, with the Juice of
Savin, make a Bolus, to be taken twice a
Week.</p>
               <p>Sudorificks are alſo very proper; in
the mean while the heat of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
muſt be ſtrengthened by things
taken inwardly, and outwardly applyed.
The Womb muſt alſo be ſtrengthened by
proper Topical Medicines: Firſt by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
and Baths made of a Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Roots of Briony, and wild
Cucumber, of the Leaves of Dwarf El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Mercury Elder, Wild-marjoram,
Calaminth, Wormwood, Rue, Sage,
Marjoram, Thym, Bays, Penny-royal,
Mugwort, of the Seeds of Broom, Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
Cummin, Aniſe, Fennel, of the Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Lawrel and Juniper, of the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Camomile, Melilot, Roſemary, of
which may be made Bags to be boiled in
Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:63569:112"/>
But that the forementioned Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may ſucceed the better, you muſt
apply it before and behind, and the Sick
ought to Sweat, if ſhe can, in the Bed
or in a Bath.</p>
               <p>In a windy Dropſie dry Fomentations
are more beneficial, with Bags made of
Grommel, Salt, Cummin and Bran, torri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in a Frying-pan, and ſprinkled with
Wine.</p>
               <p>After the Fomentation, anoint the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Belly with the Oyls of Nard, Dill,
Rue, Worm-wood, Southern-wood, and

an Old and Skilful Midwife was called,
ſhe ordered three Nutmegs to be groſly
beaten, which ſhe put into a Chaffing-diſh
with live Coals, and placed the
Chaffing-diſh ſo, that the Fume of the
Nutmegs by the help of a Funnel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
paſſed into the VVomans Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſhe received the ſame Fume
into her Mouth and Noſtrils after the

had Penetrated, the Woman cryed out
preſently ſhe muſt go to Stool, and as
ſoon as ſhe had ſo ſpoken a great noiſe

               <head type="sub">Of a Cancer of the Breaſt and Womb.</head>
               <p>A Cancer is the name of a Tumour
ariſing as it is thought from an
aduſt, or atrabilious Humour. It is
round, unequally hard, and if not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed,
of a Livid or Brown Colour with
exquiſite pricking Pain, the Veins ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
turgid in the Skin upon the surface
of the Tumour.</p>
               <p>The remote cauſe of this Tumour is
either a fault in the original Conſtitution
of the Body, or an acquired one, as by
a Bruiſe, or the like; or by an error in
Dyet.</p>
               <p>The differences of Cancers are many;
ſome are with Ulceration, others not;
ſome are looſe and moveable, and ſo hard
that they have knocked one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like Peebles; ſome are fixed to the
Bones, and ſome lie ſuperficially; other
differences may be taken from the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to which they owe their Original.
If the Matter be not very Corroſive, their
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:63569:114"/>
growth is ſlow, and they are not very
painful. Theſe are called the milder ſort,
and ſome of them affecting the Breaſt
have been palliated a long time with eaſie
remedies.</p>
               <p>A Lady laboured many Years of an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated
Cancer, it eat deep into the left
Breaſt, and was fixed to the Ribs, but
not with much pain; in progreſs of time
the Lips inverted, and united as it were,
and lay covered with a cruſty Scab, the
Humour in the mean while ſpent it ſelf
upon the Nerves and cauſed a Species of
the Palſie in ſome parts of her Body, and
the Gout in others. She lived long, and
in her latter Age tolerably healthful; this
is to be judged a Scirrhous Cancer, yet
by ill management, or by an increaſe of
acrimony, this and ſuch like frequently
terminate in raging Cancers, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Patient with exquiſite darting
pains; an inſtance or two whereof I ſhall
ſet down, to make the Young Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
more cautious in undertaking the
Cure of them.</p>
               <p>A VVoman had a painful hard Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in one of the Glands of her Breaſt;
ſhe was adviſed to forbear the uſe of
all Cataplaſms and Plaſters that might
heat her Breaſt, and to dreſs it with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:63569:115"/>
Stramonij, but ſhe was otherwiſe
perſwaded, and thereby increaſed her
Miſery. About half a Year after ſhe had
a ſtinking ſordid Ulcer with lips turned
out, and the Breaſts fixed to the Ribs,
with a hard unequal Swelling reaching to
the Clavicle and ſide of the Neck, Apoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in ſome parts and Ulcerated in
others, from the pectoral Muſcle it crept
up to the Shoulder, and affected the
Arm-pits, and by the compreſſion of
the Veſſels the upper part of the Arm
Swelled Scirrhous, from the Elbow
downwards it was Oedematous to the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
ends, ſhe made uſe of many Eminent
Phyſicians and Chyrurgeons in the City,
but dyed miſerably.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a ſort of Bleeding Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
which become ſuch either from the
eruption of ſome Veſſel, which makes
the vent often at the Nipple or ſome
other Pin-hole, the Breaſt remaining
whole, or elſe from the ſpreading of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
capillary Veſſels in a Fungus,
which in ulcerated Cancers is not rare.
Theſe do very much ſpend the Strength
of the Patient, ſo that ſhe ſoon Dyes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
and tabid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:63569:115"/>
Of all the Diſeaſes which afflict Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
the Cancer is the moſt grievous
and rebellious, and is generally Incure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by reaſon of its corroſive and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
venome fermenting in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
which ſo far as we can find,
yields neither to Purging, Bleeding, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellents,
Diſcutients, Suppuratives, nor
any other Medicine, inward or outward.
Thoſe which lie ſuperficially under the
Skin may be attempted by the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's
Hand, or if they riſe from an
External Cauſe, as a Bruiſe, or the like,
tho they lie deeper they may be cut off or
otherwiſe extirpated: But thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
from a corroſive quality in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
though they may be cut off, or
otherwiſe extirpated, yet the ſucceſs is
moſt doubtful.</p>
               <p>The Cure of a Cancer in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in theſe Intentions,</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the Generation of good
Blood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In Correcting and Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
the Atrabilious Humours in the
Body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In preventing the Growth
of the Tumour, and diſpoſing it to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:63569:116"/>
We endeavour to perform the Firſt
intention by an exact regulation of Diet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and way of Living, adviſing to abſtain
from ſuch ſharp, ſalt, and groſs Meats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as may diſpoſe the Blood to acrimony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and order ſuch as are Cooling and Moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
of eaſie Digeſtion and of good
Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>The Second intention is to prepare
and purge all the acrimonious Humours;
and if there be a Plethora, or a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Hemorrhoids, or Courſes,
a Vein may be opened and a Gliſter gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the Humours may be alſo eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
by a convenient Purge. as</p>
               <p>Take of the three Cordial Flowers, one
Handful, of Sena three Drams, of Dodder
of Thym, two Drams, infuſe them in Whey,
and ſtrain it, add an Ounce of the Purging
Syrup of Apples, and ſix Drams of Manna;
mingle them.</p>
               <p>Traumatick Decoction are alſo uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Take of the Roots and Leaves of Avens, of
the greater Celandine, of Burnet, Groundſel,
Gentian, Plantain, each one Handful, boyl them
in two parts of Water and one of Wine to the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:63569:116"/>
quantity of three Pints, ſweeten it with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and let a Pint be drunk thrice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The following Electuary is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckoned
very good.</p>
               <p>Take of the Powders of Frogs and Snails
prepared, each half an Ounce, of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of River Crabs, one Ounce, of the Bone
of a Stags Heart, one Dram, of Citron Peel
Candied, one Ounce, of the Conſerve of
Borrage and Wood-ſorrel, each two Ounces,
of the Syrup of the juice of Citron and of
Gilly-flowers, a ſufficient quantity, make an
Electuary. Take the quantity of a Cheſnut,
Morning and Evening.</p>
               <p>Emulſions, Diſtilled Milks, and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
are alſo very proper to attemperate
the Acrimony and to eaſe the Pains.</p>
               <p>The Third intention is to reſtrain the
growth of the Tumour, and to diſcuſs
it moderately. Whilſt the Humours are
are evacuating, we apply Repellents, and
afterwards we add Diſcutients; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellents
ought to be of the milder ſort,
leſt they render the Humours too groſs
and unfit for reſolution, as Lettice, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain,
Plantain, Navel-wort, Night-ſhade
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63569:117"/>
and Houſleek: Lentils boyl'd in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
alſo Clay tempered with Vinegar.</p>
               <p>The Medicines ready Compounded are
the White Oyntment, <hi>Nutritum Populeon</hi>
of Tutty and of burnt Lead, and Lead
it ſelf.</p>
               <p>All the Oyntments preſcribed, muſt
be beaten up in a Leaden Mortar. Thin
milled Lead is uſually worn in this Caſe;
ſo are Plates of Gold. Oyl of Frogs is
commended, and is made by Baking
them with Butter in their Mouths. Frogs
Spawn Water is proper to be uſed in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Cloaths being dipt in it and applyed,
but they muſt be ſhifted as often as they
dry. But in the Winter the following
Cerat is better.</p>
               <p>Take of a green Frog, three Drams, of
the Powder of River Crabs burnt, half an
Ounce, of Lytharge of Gold, two Ounces, of
burnt Lead and Tutty prepared, each two
Drams, of Cerus, ſix Drams, of the Juice
of Night-ſhade and Plantain, each ſix Ounces,
of Vinegar, two Ounces, of Oyl of Frogs,
and of Populeon Oyntment, each three Ounces,
of the Suet of a Calf, four Ounces, of Wax
a ſufficient quantity, make a Cerat. Or,</p>
               <p>Take of the Seeds of White Poppy, one
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63569:117"/>
Ounce, of the Seeds of Henbane, half an
Ounce, of Opium, one Dram, of Gum Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,
half an Ounce, powder them, and with
the Oyls of Roſes and Myrtles, each three
Ounces, of Wax a ſufficient quantity, make
a Cerat.</p>
               <p>This is proper in caſe of Pain, in the
extremity whereof you may double the
quantity of Opium, or in ſuch Caſes you
may Foment the Tumour with a Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Poppy Heads, Flowers of Roſes,
and tops of Mellilot, and apply the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Oyntment.</p>
               <p>Take of Old Treacle, one Ounce, of the
Juice of River Crabs half an Ounce, of the
Juice of Lettice, and of Oyl of Roſes, each
one Ounce and an half, of the Yolks of Eggs
roaſted under the Embers number two, of
Camphor, half a Dram, beat them in a Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Mortar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>The Diſcutients are Ceterach, Agrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Ducksmeat, Scabious, Thorn-apple,
the Juice of Coriander, Frogs, Snails,
River Crabs, Raiſins of the Sun ſtoned
and beaten, with Rue and Garden Night-ſhade
made into a Pultits are proper to
reſolve them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:63569:118"/>
Many ſuch Medicines are deſigned to
this purpoſe, Cancers requiring variety
of Applications.</p>
               <p>If notwithſtanding all your Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
the Tumour increaſes, and is like
to ulcerate, you may do well to forewarn
the Patient of the danger, and if it be
looſe, propoſe the extirpation of it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
it to them, leſt afterwards they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it when it is too late. But to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
this Operation Succeſsfully, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
ought to be of a ſtrong Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and of a pretty good habit of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and not in declining Age, when the
Courſes are ceaſed. It were alſo to be
wiſhed that the Cancer took its original
from ſome Accident or Bruiſe, and the
like; and the Operation ought to be
performed in the Spring or Autumn of the
Year.</p>
               <p>For a Cancer of the Womb Topicks
muſt be applyed, which moderately Bind
and Cool.</p>
               <p>Take of Oyl of Myrtles and of Roſes, each
two Ounces, of the Juice of Night-ſhade,
and of Houſleek, each one Ounce, beat
them all in a Leaden Mortar with a Leaden
Peſtle till they grow black, then add of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge
and of Ceruſs waſhed in Scabious wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63569:118"/>
each three Ounces, of Tutty prepared two
Drams, of Camphir, ten Grains, make a
Liniment, wherewith Anoint the Part three or
four times a-day.</p>
               <p>The following is ſaid to be better,
and with it the Tumours of the Paps,
which are counted Cancerous may be
Cured.</p>
               <p>Take of the Oyl of Yolks of Eggs, two
Ounces, of the Juice of Night-ſhade and
Speedwel, or of Houſleek, each half an Ounce,
of crude Mercury two Drams, stir them about
in a Leaden Mortar with a Leaden Peſtle,
till they acquire the conſistence of a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The foreſaid Liniments are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the Womb with a long Tent,
or with a Wax Candle wrapt round with a
Rag: But Injections may be much eaſier
uſed.</p>
               <p>Take of Barley water, half a Pint, of the
waters of Night-ſhade and Plantain, each
two Ounces, of the water of ſpeedwel one
Ounce, of the white Troches of Rhaſis, two
Drams, of Sacharum Saturni one Dram, make
an Injection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:63569:119"/>
If the Pain be very violent add to four
Oounces of the Injection, one Ounce of
Syrup of Poppies. If the Cancer be Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated,
the Doſe of the Mercury to be
added to the foreſaid Liniment muſt be
increaſed, and the Aſhes of River Crabs
may be conveniently added.</p>
               <p>But all theſe things are not ſometimes
ſufficient to appeaſe the violent Pain,
which ſometimes will not ſuffer the Sick
to ſleep or reſt, ſo that we are forced
ſometimes to uſe Narcoticks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
they are not injurious in this
Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>I knew a Woman, that was affected
with a Cancer in her Breaſt, who took
every Night for four Months, two or
three Grains of Laudanum, and was much
relieved thereby.</p>
               <p>If much Blood flow from a Cancer ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated,
as it often happens; inject into
the Womb the Juice of Plantain with a
little Frankincenſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Seeing a perfect Cure cannot
be expected, whether the Cancer be ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
or not, we muſt endeavour to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the breaking of it, and the increaſe
of it, when it is broken, and in both we
muſt qualifie the violence of the Pain by
ſuch things as evacuate the whole Body,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63569:119"/>
and by other Remedies which alter and
evacuate the melancholy Humour, and
hinder its growth, as by Bleeding in
the Arm, the Hemorrhodial Veins, in the
Foot, by the uſe of Potions, Apozems,
Juleps, Broath, Milk, Whey, Mineral
Waters, and the like, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
preſcribed; but Purging muſt more
eſpecially be repeated.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Worms, and of the Stone of the
Womb.</head>
               <p>THough many are of the Opinion that
Worms are Generated only in the
Inteſtines, yet it is manifeſt by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the Teſtimony of Learned
Men, that they are Bred in many other
parts of the Body, as in putrid Ulcers in
the Teeth, in the Ears, in the Reins, and
in the Bladder, tho' rarely, by reaſon
of the acrimony and ſaltneſs of the Urine.
In the Womb alſo Worms are ſometimes
generated, tho' it be rare, becauſe the
paſſages of it are ſo open that they will
not ſuffer the Humours, tho' they are
groſs and crude, to continue there ſo long
as to generate Worms. They are moſt
commonly Aſcarides, and they are moſt
commonly in the Privities, or in the
Neck of the Womb, they are very like
thoſe that are in the right Gut, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they creep thither from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:63569:120"/>
The material cauſe of Worms, is a
cold phlegmatick and crude Humour,
which is apt to putrifie.</p>
               <p>When there are Worms in the Womb,
the whole Body is reſtleſs and uneaſie,
the Mouth of the Womb is always
moiſt, the Women are thin and weak,
and ſometimes the Worms are expelled
with the Courſes, and ſometimes they
may be ſeen, the Lips of the Privities
being opened. Women ſo afflicted ſleep
diſturbedly, and often wake in a fright,
they have diſorderly Fevers, and all
other Symptoms which appear in Worms
of the Inteſtines.</p>
               <p>As to the Cure, we muſt endeavour to
hinder the generation of them, and to
kill them when they are generated; this
may be done by three ſorts of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By a thin hot and drying Dyet,
by acid and bitter Meats, yet they muſt
conſiſt of good Nouriſhment, and be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
concocted, and that are free from all
crudity; the fleſh of Chickens, of Hens,
of ſmall Mountain Birds, and the Broath
of them with the juice of a Lemon are
good: Among Fruits Oranges, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares,
Olives with Vinegar: Among
Herbs, Endive, Sow-thiſtle, and Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63569:121"/>
Let her Drink be a Decoction of
Cinnamon, Rubarb, the Seeds of Purſlain,
the Roots of China, Scorzonera, or Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaparilla.
All Meats of Milk, Fiſh, and
whatever generates Flegmatick Humours
muſt be avoided, and full Feeding, and a
diſorderly courſe of Dyet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe things muſt be uſed
which Concoct, and Purge off Phlegmatick
Humours; as Syrup of Wormwood, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory,
Succory with Rhubarb, of the acid
juice of Citron with the waters of the
ſame Herbs, or of Graſs, Purſlain, and
Sorrel, and the Flegm muſt be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Purged off with Pills of Maſtick, of
Agarick, or the like.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such things muſt be uſed as
kill Worms, and uterine Gliſters to that

That the Stones grow in every part of
the Body, <hi>Galen</hi> teſtifies, as in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Reins, Liver, Inteſtines, Lungs; and
therefore it is no ſtrange thing if they
ſhould be generated alſo in the Womb,
as <hi>Aetius</hi> writes: but they are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
like the Stones of the Bladder, nor
are they looſe, for if ſo they could not
continue in the Womb; but they grow to
the Tunicks of the neck of the Womb.
The cauſes of them are the ſame, as of
the Stone in the Bladder, namely, groſs
and viſcid Humours. The ſigns of them
are a dull pain in the Womb, and the
Courſes are inordinate, and a Finger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put up the Anus, the Stone may be
ſelt. But if the Stone be in the neck of
the Womb, the pain is great, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
the neighbouring parts, and the
Womb, and the Woman can not ſit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pain.</p>
               <p>As to the Cure, an emollient and lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
courſe of Diet muſt be uſed, and
the groſs and viſcid Humours muſt be Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
off: But the chief part of the Cure is
to be performed by extracting the Stone,
but firſt the parts muſt be quieted by an
emollient Gliſter made of a Decoction of
Mallows, Marſh-mallows, Fenugreek, of
the Seeds of Flax, and a great deal of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63569:122"/>
Oyl of Roſes and of Lillies to make the
Manual operation the eaſier, which muſt
be performed in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>The Womans Thighs being ſpread,
the Chirurgeon muſt thruſt up two of
the Fingers of his Left-hand, and with
his Right he muſt preſs the upper part
of her Belly to force the Stone out, and
this may be the eaſier done, if the Stone
be in the Neck of the Womb, but if it
be in the Womb it ſelf, the Operation
will be more difficultly performed: But
if the ſtone grow to the mouth or neck
of the Womb, and cannot be extirpated
this way, it muſt be cut out, the Woman
being rightly placed, and the parts dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a Speculum Matricis, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done, thoſe things muſt be injected
into the Womb which cure Ulcers, firſt,
Aſtringents, and ſuch things as ſtop
Blood, and afterwards drying things, and
an exact Courſe of Diet muſt be ordered,
and the Woman muſt be Purged twice
in a Year, leſt the Stone ſhould grow
again.</p>
               <p>The Cure of the Stone in the Bladder
in Women is to be managed much in the
manner as in Men, but it ſeldomer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
and is eaſier Cured, becauſe the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63569:123"/>
paſſage of the Urine is larger, and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and ſtraighter in Women. But if
it happen, and muſt be extracted, the
Chirurgeon muſt put two of the Fingers
of his Left-hand, (the VVoman being
placed as above directed) into the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and with his Right he muſt preſs
the Bladder, and force the Stone to the
neck of it, ſo as to make it paſs the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
that ſhuts the neck of the Bladder,
and then a little above the wings of the
Privities, at which place the Stone oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
he muſt cut, ſo that the Stone may be
extracted with a pair of Forceps. Laſtly,
the Ulcer muſt be Cured by Aſtringent,
and Incarnating Medicines.</p>

               <p>A Condyloma is a Tubercle ariſing
from an Inflammation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
the Knucles when the Hand is
ſhut. It is cured by four kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
Firſt by Diet and Purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
that reſpect the antecedent cauſe;
Secondly, By drying and repelling To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,
if the Callus be newly bred, as
by Baths and Vapours of a Decoction of
Vervain, of the Leaves of Brambles, of
Acacia, Ivy-leaves, to which muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by reaſon of the Pain, Camomile
Flowers; and if the Condyloma be
Inflamed ſuch things muſt be uſed as
mitigate the pain, as the following de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:63569:124"/>
Take of the leaves of Melilot, Mallows,
and Marſhmallows, each half an handful,
of the Seeds of Flax and Fenugreek, each
three Drams, of the Flowers of Camomile two
Pugils, boyl them, and to a Pint of the
Decoction, add two Ounces of Roſes, inject
it by a Syringe; or warm Milk may be ſo
injected. If the Condyloma being old is
grown hard, and does not yeild to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Medicines, <hi>Aetius</hi> commends as a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
remedy Mineral Miſy mixed with
Turpentine; or inſtead of it Roman Vitriol,
a Dram of the Troches of Steel reduced to
powder, and mixed with the Oyls of Roſes
and Wax, and made into an Oyntment with
half an Ounce of the Juice of Mullein is
alſo very good. The following is alſo much
commended.</p>
               <p>Take of Tuty thrice burnt and waſhed,
of Ceruſs waſhed, of the Froth of Silver waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
each two Drams, of the Yolks of two
roaſted Eggs, Wax, Sope and Oyl of Roſes,
each two Ounces; make an Oyntment.</p>
               <p>But if theſe things do no Good, it muſt
be cut off, and if there be many of them,
they muſt be burnt off, and the Ulcer
muſt be regularly cured: but cutting or
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63569:124"/>
burning in theſe parts is dangerous and
muſt not therefore be uſed unleſs there be
an abſolute neceſſity.</p>
               <p>If there be Hemorrhoids, they are
either in the Mouth or Neck of the
Womb, or in the Womb it ſelf, or in
the Privities; they are as divers as thoſe
in the Anus, they are either blind or
open; they are with or without Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
they differ alſo upon their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
Number and Figure; they are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by Chaps, and by a Condylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
but chiefly by groſs and feculent
Humours falling upon the Veins of the
Womb, or by an inordinate defluxion of
Menſtruous Blood into thoſe Veins. This
Diſeaſe may be known by a weight in
thoſe Parts, and Women ſo affected are
weak and ſubject to Spontaneous Laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
But if the Hemorrhoids of the
Womb, or Anus flow moderately, they
cure and prevent many Diſeaſes, and the
unſeaſonable ſtopage of them occaſions
the Falling Sickneſs, and many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.
They are cured as the Piles of
the Anus.</p>
               <p>There are four ſorts of Warts of the
Womb and Privities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:63569:125"/>
The Firſt are Acrocordones, which hang
as by a Thred.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thymus which is a rough
and oblong Tumour, and without pain,
if it be gentle and white, or rediſh;
but if it be Malignant it is livid and
painful.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Ficus or Mariſcae, which differ
from a Thymus only in bigneſs.</p>
               <p>The Fourth is Clavus, which is a
hard white and round prominence like
the Heads of Corns. Theſe Tumours in
general are of a Scirrhous nature, and
come by immoderate Copulation, and
are ſometimes Malignant, by reaſon of
the French-Pox. The gentle are known
by their white or rediſh colour, and by
the abſence of pain, the Malignant by
their hardneſs, leaden colour and pain.</p>
               <p>They are Cured by four ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By a Diet that is not apt to breed
groſs Humours, and by Catharticks to
Purge ſuch Humours off, and by Sweats,
if they are obſtinate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:63569:125"/>
Secondly, By diſcuſſing Medicines,
which are moſt proper for the Thymus
and Clavus as by dried Sage, with fat
Figs, or Old-ſhoes burnt and powdered
and mixed with Wine and applyed: But
the Soles of Shoes and a dried Gourd
powdered by themſelves, and afterwards
mixed and applied with Wine to Warts
do very well, or you may take of Rue
and Pennyroyal, each equal parts; let
them be burnt and powdered; the Bark
of Frankincenſe, the Leaves of Baſil
Wine and Vinegar, Shoomakers Ink,
boyl them in the VVater that drops out
of a Vine cut; moiſten the part with
this Decoction; this is reckoned an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Medicine.</p>
               <p>Prick with a Needle the Eye of a
Goat newly killed, and anoint daily the
part with the Liquor that flows from it,
and within Six Days, as <hi>Aetius</hi> writes;
Myrmecies will be extirpated, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
of broad Roots, and they itch.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Things that burn and eat are
proper for Myrmecies and Acrocordos, as
the juice of wild Cucumber with Salt,
or the like: But corroding things muſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63569:126"/>
not continue long upon the part, for
when they have been applied an hour or
thereabout, the part muſt be waſhed
twice or thrice with Aſtringent Wine;
and the Neighbouring parts muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by an Oyntment made with Bole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armenick,
ſealed Earth, Roſe-water and
Vinegar.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If they may be cut off, they
ought to be ſo, but ſome bind the root
of theſe with a Horſe-hair; and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
it daily till they fall off.</p>
               <p>In the Privities and Mouth of the
Womb, eſpecially in ſuch Women, as
have the French-Pox, Puſtles ariſe; they
often itch; they are occaſioned by the
abundance, and groſſneſs of a bilious and
aduſt Humour, or by the French-Pox,
they may be eaſily ſeen by a Speculum
Matricis. They are to be cured by four
ſorts of Remedies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By Meats of good juice, and by
abſtaining from all acrid, acid and ſalt
things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By Univerſal Evacuations, as
by Bleeding and Purging, and ſuch things,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63569:126"/>
as attemperate the Humour muſt be uſed,
as Syrup of Borrage, Violets, Fumitory
and Succory, and the like. Decoctions
of Sarſa, or of Guiacum with Sweating
are alſo very proper, and Purges and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorificks
muſt be often repeated.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Topicks muſt be applyed,
and if the Puſtles are gentle bathing is
proper, and afterwards waſh the part
with hot Wine and Nitre.</p>
               <p>For Puſtles and Scabs the following
Oyntment of has bin found very ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Take of the Roots Elecampane, Burnet and
ſharp pointed Dock, each three Ounces, of
Fumitory Water Six Ounces, of the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Vinegar, or of the best Wine, for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
of the Womb, two Ounces; having
bruiſed the roots well, infuſe them a day
and a night, then boyl them, and preſs them
strongly; to the ſtrained Liquor add half a
pound of Turpentine, of Oyl of Roſes three
Ounces, of Wax half an Ounce, boyl them
again to the Conſumption of half, and add
of Sulphur one Ounce and an half, of Cerus
five Ounces, of Roch-allom half an Ounce,
of Sal Gemma two drams, of Oyl of Eggs,
ſix Drams, mix them by beating of them well
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63569:127"/>
together, then waſh the whole Compoſition in
Fumitory Water.</p>
               <p>But if the Puſtles are Malignant, and
Obſtinate, you muſt uſe ſtronger Deſicca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
which correct the Venom of the
Puſtles, and at the ſame time you muſt
uſe ſudorific decoctions.</p>
               <p>Take of Plantain and Roſe Water each four
Ounces, of Sal Gemma, Nitre, and Allom,
each two Drams, of Sublimate one Dram
and an half, boyl them till a third part
is conſumed; to the ſtrained Liquor, add of
Verde-greeſe one Scruple; after you have
uſed this two or three dayes, you muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
a while, and uſe gentler things, and
return again to the uſe of it, till the Puſtles
are quite taken off.</p>
               <p>This moreover muſt be added, which
is of excellent uſe, having firſt bathed
with a decoction of Fumitory, Lupins,
Beans, and a little Salt.</p>
               <p>Take of the Roots of Elecampane cut
ſmall four Ounces, boyl them well in a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
quantity of Water with a little Vinegar
or Wine, then beat them in a Mortar and
Pulp them through a Sieve, and add of freſh
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63569:127"/>
Lard three Ounces, of Juice of ground El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and of Fumitory, each one Ounce and
an half, of Quick-Silver extinguiſhed in
faſting Spittle, or in the Yolk of an Egg,
half an Ounce, of Ceruſs and Lytharge, each
one Ounce, of Brimſtone one Dram and an
half, ſtir them about for an hour, and mix
the Powders by degrees.</p>
               <p>But becauſe Puſtles continue ſometimes
a long while, you muſt make an Iſſue in
the Leg, before they are quite dryed
up.</p>
               <p>Clefts and Chaps are ſometimes in the
Mouth of the Womb, as in the Anus,
Hands, Lips, and Nipples, by reaſon of
violent Cold, a North Wind, and the
like; they are ſmall, long and narrow
Ulcers, ſometimes deep, and ſometimes
only ſuperficial; they are alſo ocaſioned
by hard labour, by Acrid and Corroding
Humours, or by a great dryneſs in the
Womb.</p>
               <p>They are to be cured by five ſorts of
Remedies; by a moiſtening and ſmoothen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diet, avoiding ſuch things as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crid,
and ſtop the Belly; therefore let the
Woman eat Chicken, Mutton, Veal, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63569:128"/>
Broaths made of Succory, Bugloſs, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
Spinage, and the like; let her
Drink be rather Beer than Wine, ſhe
muſt avoid Cheeſe and Spices, Violent
Exerciſe, and Copulation: And if Acrid
humours be the cauſe, ſhe muſt be blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if there be a plenitude; afterwards
ſhe muſt be Purged with Caſſia, Manna,
and the like, and the Humours muſt be
attemperated with the Syrups of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory,
Roſes, Violets, Borrage, Fumitory,
and with the Waters of the ſame Herbs.
If they are occaſioned by hard labour,
and Bleed, the Blood muſt be ſtop'd by
the following Uterine Gliſter.</p>
               <p>Take of the leaves of Plantain one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
of Roſes four Pugils, boyl them in a
ſufficient quantity of Water till half is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.
To ſix Ounces of the ſtrained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
add of the Powders of Dragons Blood,
Bole armenick, Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort,
each half a Dram.</p>
               <p>If the Chaps are dry, hot, and itch,
the part muſt be Fomented with things
that moiſten, as the following Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:63569:128"/>

boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Water,
and let ſix Ounces be injected in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terine Gliſter, and anoint the
part affected with the Oyntment of Ceruſe
with Camphor; and if the pain and heat
be much, anoint it with the following Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Take of the Populeon Oyntment one Ounce,
of Camphor two Scruples, of Ceruſs waſhed
in Roſe Water one Scruple, and the white of
one Egg, mingle them.</p>
               <p>Oyl of Flax hot is alſo good for
Chaps of the Anus and Womb, ſo is
Pomatum; Oyl of the Yolks of Eggs, or
of Flax Seeds ſtir'd about in a Leaden
Mortar is alſo proper, and if they are
occaſioned by drineſs, Barly boyled in
Water in Linnen Baggs, and applyed
for nine days are very beneficial. But
if the Chaps are malignant, apply the
following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:63569:129"/>
Take of good Aqua vitae one point, of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate
powdered one Scruple, of Verdegreaſe
half a Scruple, the Whites of three Eggs,
ſtir them well together, and anoint the part
every other day, and apply over a Plaſter

to VVatchings, to Deſpair, and to
VVeeping and Sorrow, and ſometimes the
Melancholy is ſo high, as that they grow
almoſt Diſtracted, and are ready to make

               <p>There are three Degrees of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
according to which the Danger

varied accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Firſt, Is when the Signs are

               <p>The Third, Is when the VVoman, is

Grains of Stybium prepared may be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Thirdly things that diſcuſs Wind muſt

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63569:133"/>
with a ſufficient quantity of Wax make an
Oyntment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Such things muſt be uſed as
cauſe Sleep, whereof there is ſo great
want in this Diſeaſe, that this Symptom
often takes up the whole Cure; it happens
by reaſon of the ſiccity of the Brain, and
therefore things that moiſten are to be
uſed. To this purpoſe, the Feet and
Legs are wont to be waſhed with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of Mallows, Roſes, Camomile,
Violets, and the Flowers of Lettice, and
ſometimes Henbane, and the heads of

be very great, or in Womans or Goats Milk,
and if theſe things are not ſufficient, anoint
the Noſtrils with Populeon Oyntment; or take
of Oyntment of Roſes one Ounce, of Opium
four Grains, mingle them, and anoint the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63569:133"/>
Noſtrils, the Temples, and the Palms of the

Pulſe, and let her take inwardly the following
Emulſion.</p>
               <p>Take of Sweet Almonds blanched four
Ounces, of the Seeds of Melons, and Gouras,
each one Ounce, of the Seeds of Lettice, and
Poppies, each two Drams, beat them in a

               <p>Take of Cowſlip water, two Ounces, of
Diacodium, one Ounce.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſuch things muſt be uſed, as
ſtrengthen the Brain and Heart, apply the
following Epithem to the region of the
Heart.</p>
               <p>Take of the waters of Balm, Orange flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

White-wine, two Ounces, of the Juice of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant

Powders of Diamoſck, Diambra, of the Bark
of Citron, each half a Dram, mingle them;
or anoint the region of the Heart with the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63569:134"/>
Oyntment of Flowers of Oranges, and let her
Eat now and then Citron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bark Candied, or
the Roots of Bugloſs, or Scorzonera Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died.</p>
               <p>But if the Diſeaſe be ſo high, that the
Woman is plainly Delirious, which is
the third Degree of this Diſeaſe; the
ſame Remedies in a manner muſt be
uſed, only the moſt effectual muſt be
choſen, and care muſt be taken, that a
cold and dry Intemperies be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
and therefore leſs Blood muſt
be taken away, and ſhe muſt be Purged
ſtrongly with a Dram of the Pill De La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide
Lazuli, or with the like quantity
of the following.</p>
               <p>Take of Epithymum, ſix Ounces, of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garick,
four Drams, of the Bark of black
Hellebore, one Dram and an half, of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of ſimple Hiera, four Drams, with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
of Roſes make a Maſs. But the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Electuary is better.</p>
               <p>Take of the Stone called Lazulus, one
Dram, of the Leaves of Sena, one Dram
and an half, of the beſt Agarick two Drams,
of the Syrup of Purſlain, or of the Juice of
Fumitory or of Hops, three Ounces, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63569:134"/>
of Roſes or of Violets, one Ounce, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
them; let her take an Ounce once a
Week.</p>
               <p>And the Body muſt be moiſtned by
all means, by Baths and the like; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
and with a moiſtning Diet <hi>Galen</hi>
cured Melancholy, and ſuch things muſt
be uſed as provoke the Courſes; but if
they will not flow, the application of
Leeches to the Hemorrhoids is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
becauſe <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> ſay
that Melancholy Blood is drawn by theſe
Veins; they may be opened two ways;
by rubbing the Fundament with a courſe
Cloth, and by Leeehes, which muſt be
of a moderate bigneſs, and they muſt be
taken from a clear and running Water,
they muſt not be green, pale, nor hairy;
but reddiſh, and after they are taken
they muſt be preſſed, that they may
Vomit up the Venom, if they have any;
then they muſt be kept in a Glaſs full of
clear Water ſweetned with Sugar, and
the Water muſt be changed once a Week.
When they are to be applied, you muſt
Foment the part with a Decoction of
Camomile, Mallows, Mullein, and the
like; then rub it, that the Mouth of the
Veins may appear, and to each of them
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63569:135"/>
apply a Leech; if they will not ſtick,
anoint the place with Chickens Blood,
or the like; and whilſt they are ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
let a hot Decoction of Camomile,
Dill, Roſes, and Mallows be put under
them, that the vapour of it may comfort
them. A ſufficient quantity of Blood
being drawn, they generally fall off of
themſelves; if they do not, pinch them
by the Tails, or ſprinkle upon their
Mouths Aſhes, Salt, or Aloes. If the
Blood ſlow too long, apply Rags dipt
in ſtiptick Wine, or the white of an Egg
with ſome aſtringent Powder.</p>
