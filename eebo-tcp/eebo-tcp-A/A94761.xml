            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>YOU Princely Hectors of the Town,</l>

               <l>Come leave your God dammees, and herken to me,</l>
               <l>O 'tis pitty that fuel for Hell you ſhould be:</l>
               <l>Your Spirits Heroick, will quickly be quell'd</l>
               <l>When once the General Seſſions are held,</l>
               <l>For hee's not a Gentleman, that wears a ſword,</l>

               <l>No Iuſtice of Peace, nor Conſtables Bill</l>
               <l>Can move your brave courages for to be ſtill.</l>
               <l>Superiour Spirits, which know not to bow,</l>
               <l>Like <hi>Pompey</hi> no equal can pleaſing allow;</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But hark my poor Ranter, ile tell thee a tale</l>
               <l>Thy curſings and bannings will buy thee no Ale:</l>
               <l>Ile bring thee a Broom ſtick, or an Orange-taild ſlut.</l>
               <l>(With eight-pence in pock, ready dried and cut.)</l>
               <l>Shall out vapour thee more with a confident face.</l>
               <l>And ſooner be truſted in a deſperate caſe.</l>
               <l>Then prethee poor Hector go pawn 'way thy ſword</l>
               <l>And ceaſe to ſwear Dammee at every word.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For why? the Ale-brokers have vowed &amp; proteſted,</l>
               <l>(And I think they will keep it, unleſs they be baſted)</l>
               <l>To truſt you no longer reſolved they be,</l>
               <l>For building of Sconces both one, two, and three.</l>
               <l>Damne, damne ye, youl pay 'um to day, or to morrow,</l>
               <l>But next day is come, yet they do ſtill borrow:</l>
               <l>Fie, fie Sir, a Gentleman and wear a ſword,</l>
               <l>Yet break your God-dammees at every word.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Taylor comes oft with a peſtilent Bill,</l>
               <l>And faith he may come as oft as he will,</l>
               <l>But be little the better, unleſs for his pains</l>
               <l>With Dammees, and Rammees you addle his brains:</l>
               <l>Poor Snip, does return as light as he came,</l>
               <l>Home goes, and complains to his Stomachy Dame,</l>
               <l>Who rants, and tears, not afraid to be heard,</l>
               <l>And ſtraps him, and raps him with top of the yard.</l>
               <l>Then prethee my Ranter, that weareſt a ſword.</l>
               <l>Turn honeſt, and once be as good as thy word.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Turn-ball Whores cry they are undone,</l>
               <l>And muſt to <hi>Virginia</hi> pack one by one,</l>
               <l>And in truth they'l inrich that beggerly Nation.</l>
               <l>For never ſuch Planters came to a Plantation.</l>
               <l>You ſtole 'way their ſmocks, and petticoats all;</l>
               <l>Beſides did not pay 'um for what you did call.</l>
               <l>Fie, fie, my baſe Ranter, this is but a poor,</l>
               <l>A ſhabbed come off to plunder a Whore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But this is not all I have to ſay,</l>
               <l>I heard a complaint the other day,</l>
               <l>Of a Gentleman walking, in <hi>Lincolns</hi> Inne fields,</l>
               <l>Whom baſely you took and kickt up his heeles,</l>
               <l>Div'd into his pocket, and took ten and three pence.</l>
               <l>You would not have ſpard it if it had bin but fipence</l>
               <l>Thus poverty makes you Gentlemen bold,</l>
               <l>Turn Levellers all for another mans gold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But tarry, you ſpard not his cloak as I take it.</l>
               <l>Twere ſinne I confeſs as you Hectors do make it,</l>
               <l>To ſuffer ſuperfluous Coats on another,</l>
               <l>When he that hath two muſt give one to his brother</l>
               <l>But then to the Brokers this garment muſt march,</l>
               <l>And woe to the fellow if there come a ſearch,</l>
               <l>Thus one, two and three are ruind together,</l>

               <l>How many twice doubled God dammees out raps ye</l>
               <l>That the Conſtable and his train ſhall pay,</l>
               <l>For abuſing ſuch Gentlemen cleer as the day,</l>
               <l>Who ſcorn to own ignoble deſignes,</l>

               <l>Away you are guarded ro <hi>Newgate</hi> and then,</l>

               <l>Exposd to the weather contentedly want one,</l>
               <l>And you to your minds, I doe believe han't one,</l>
               <l>But patience perforce, My Ranters you know,</l>
