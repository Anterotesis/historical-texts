            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>A royall glimmering light streaming a loft;</l>
               <l>As <hi>Titan</hi> mounted on the Lyons backe,</l>
               <l>Had clothed himselfe in fierie pointed beames,</l>

               <l>Sleeping, or waking, as alone I lay,</l>
               <l>Mine eyes, and eares, and senses all were serued,</l>

               <l>For through the melting aire perfum'd with sweets,</l>
               <l>I might discerne a troope of Horse-men ride,</l>
               <l>Armed <hi>Cape de Pe</hi> with shield and shiuering launce;</l>
               <l>As in a plash, or calme transparent brooke</l>

               <l>A number numberlesse, appointed well.</l>
               <l>For turnament, as if the God of warre,</l>
               <l>Had held a Iusts in honour of his loue:</l>

               </l>
               <l>Therewith I heard the Clarions and the Shalmes,</l>
               <l>The Shakbuts, and a thousand instruments</l>
               <l>Of seuerall kindes: and lowdest of them all,</l>
               <l>A Trumpe more shrill than <hi>Tritons</hi> is at Sea,</l>

The same <hi>Renowne</hi> Precursor of the traine</l>
               <l>Did sound, (for who rings louder than renowne.)</l>
               <l>He mounted was vpon a flying horse.</l>

Of shot of Ordnance pealing in mine eares,</l>
               <l>As twentie thousand Tyre had plaid at Sea:</l>

               <l>A Garter brightly glistring in mine eye,</l>
               <l>A worthy ornament. Then I cald to minde,</l>

               <l>King <hi>Edward</hi> for his great atchiuements famed,</l>

               <l>

A great effect, grown of a slender cause,</l>
               <l>Graced by a King, and fauoured of his feeres,</l>
               <l>Famed by his followers, worthy Kings and Queenes,</l>
               <l>That to this day are Soueraignes of the same.</l>
               <l>The manner how this matter grew at first.</l>
               <l>Was thus. The King disposed on a time</l>
               <l>To reuell after he had shaken Fraunce,</l>
               <l>(O had he brauely helde it to the last)</l>
               <l>And deckt his Lyons with their flowre <hi>de Lyce,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Disposed to reuell: Some say otherwise,</l>
               <l>Found on the ground by Fortune as he went</l>
               <l>A Ladies Garter: But the Queenes I troe</l>
               <l>Lost in a daunce, and tooke it vp himselfe.</l>
               <l>It was a silken Ribban weaued of blewe.</l>
               <l>His Lords and standers by, seeing the King</l>
               <l>Stoope for this Garter, smiled: as who would say,</l>
               <l>Our office that had beene, or somwhat els.</l>
               <l>King <hi>Edward</hi> vvistlie looking on them all,</l>
               <l>With Princely hands hauing that Garter ceazd,</l>

Were small, his pleasure and his purpose was</l>
               <l>T'aduance that Garter, and to institute</l>
               <l>A noble order sacred to S. <hi>George:</hi>

               <l>And Knights to make, whom he would haue be tearmed</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Knights of the Garter.</hi> This beginning had</l>
               <l>This honourable order of our time.</l>
               <l>Heereon I thought when I beheld the King,</l>
               <l>But swifter then my thought by that I saw,</l>
               <l>And words I heard, or seemed to heare at least,</l>
               <l>I was instructed in the circumstance:</l>
               <l>And found it was King <hi>Edward</hi> that did march</l>
               <l>In robes, like those he ware when with his Lords,</l>
               <l>He held S. <hi>Gorges</hi> royall Feast on earth,</l>
               <l>His eldest sonne surnamed the <hi>Blacke Prince,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Though black of hue, that surname yet in Fraunce</l>
               <l>He wan; For terror to the Frenchmens harts</l>
               <l>His countenance was, his Sword an Iron scourge.</l>
               <l>He one a cole-black Coorser mounted was,</l>
               <l>And in his hand a battel-axe he hent:</l>
               <l>His Beuer vp, his Corslet was of Steele,</l>
               <l>Varnisht as black as Iett: his bases blacke,</l>
               <l>And black fro head to foote, yea horse and hoofe</l>
               <l>As black as night; but in a twinck me thought</l>
               <l>A chaungd at once his habite and his Steede,</l>
               <l>And had a Garter as his father had.</l>
               <l>

Right rich and costly, with embroyderie</l>
               <l>Of Pearle and Gold. I could on it discerne,</l>
               <l>The Poesie whereof I spake of yore;</l>
               <l>And well I wot since this King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes,</l>
               <l>Our Kings and Queenes about theyr royall Armes,</l>
               <l>Haue in a Garter borne this Poesie.</l>
               <l>Still as I lay, I gazd and gest at once</l>
               <l>What was this trayne, and whether it did bend:</l>
               <l>I found at last King <hi>Edward</hi> was the man,</l>
               <l>Accompanyed with Kings and Conquerours,</l>
               <l>That from the spacious aerie house of <hi>Fame,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Set forward royally to solemnize,</l>
               <l>Th'installment of some newe created knights.</l>
               <l>For loe, I saw in strange accutrements,</l>
               <l>Like to King <hi>Edwards</hi> and the Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Full foure and twentie Knights nor more nor lesse,</l>
               <l>In robes with precious collors of S. <hi>George:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And Garters all they had buckled with Gold.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fame</hi> in a Stoale of purple, set vvith eyes,</l>
               <l>And eares, and tongues, carryed a golden Booke;</l>
               <l>Vpon the couer this I sawe engraued:

                  </q>
               </l>
               <l>Me thought this saying could not but import,</l>
               <l>They should be noble men of golden mindes,</l>

               <l>Heerewith the golden booke did open fayre,</l>
               <l>And eathly I might read their names that next</l>
               <l>Went to the King. They were no common men,</l>
               <l>For to my seeming each one had a Page,</l>
               <l>That bare a faire Eschuchion after him,</l>
               <l>Whereon his armes were drawne: I haue forgot</l>

               <l>Honour went King at armes next to the Knights</l>
               <l>Halfe armed, like <hi>Pallas</hi> shaped for armes and arts:</l>

               <l>Some worthy wight let blazon his deserts.</l>
               <l>Onely a tale I thought on by the way</l>
               <l>As I obserued his honourable name.</l>
               <l>I heard it was his chaunce ore-tane with sleepe,</l>
               <l>To take a nap neere to a Farmers lodge,</l>
               <l>(Trusted a little with himselfe belike)</l>
               <l>This aged Earle in his apparell plaine,</l>
               <l>Wrapt in his russet Cloake lay downe to rest,</l>
               <l>His badge of honour buckled to his legge,</l>
               <l>Bare and vnhid. There came a pilfring swad,</l>
               <l>And would haue prayd vpon this ornament:</l>
               <l>And saied t'vnbuckle it, thinking him a sleepe.</l>
               <l>The noble gentleman, feeling what he meant,</l>
               <l>Hold foolish ladde (quoth he) a better pray;</l>
               <l>Thys Garter is not fitte for euery legge,</l>

               <l>The varlet ranne away. The Earle awaked</l>

               <l>Thys tale I thought vpon, told me for trueth:</l>
               <l>The rather for it praisde the poesie,</l>
               <l>Ryght graue and honourable that importeth much.</l>
