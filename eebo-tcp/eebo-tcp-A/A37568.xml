            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe following Sermon was preach'd at the Funeral of a young
Gentleman whom I dearly loved: and it was never antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
intended to be made more publick than at the time of
its delivery at the interment: But the misinterpretations that have
been put upon it by <hi>ſome,</hi> and the various reports that have ſprang
from thence by <hi>others,</hi> have neceſſitated me to do what I never thought:
And I am rather willing to ſubmit the <hi>whole</hi> to a <hi>Publick</hi> cenſure,
than that I ſhould lye under the ſuſpicion of abuſing the credit of the
deceaſed Gentleman, or be guilty of that unpardonable Rudeneſs, of
deſignedly blaming the Conduct and Guidance of his ſurviving Friends,
which the uncertain Reports that I have met withal ſince the Funeral,
do ſo plainly intimate. For I reckon now the noiſe is ſpread ſo far,
that thoſe who know nothing of this diſcourſe, but only by bare <hi>report,</hi>
and that too not begun or propagated upon ſubſtantial grounds, but as
Miſtake or Humor gave them firſt riſe and vent, they would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
me <hi>guilty</hi> of all that I am accuſed, if I ſhould decline this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and ſafeſt way of a Juſtification.</p>
            <p>I confeſs 'tis no great wonder if Offen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es happen; but yet it behoveth
all men to ſee, that they be not <hi>cauſeleſs:</hi> In this particular, I have
ſufficient reaſon to ſay, that it is not thro <hi>my fault,</hi> if any are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
'tis to be attributed to ſome other original than the following
Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> complained, and thought it a very hard caſe, that he ſhould
be accounted an Enemy to the <hi>Galatians</hi> for telling them the Truth,
<hi>Gal. 4. 16 (i. e.)</hi> 'twas very unjuſt, that they ſhould be wroth with
the Apoſtle for ſpeaking <hi>Truth</hi> tho it were <hi>harſh,</hi> and they fell under
the inevitable Laſh of a <hi>ſevere</hi> Conviction.—But <hi>MINE is</hi> a
<hi>WORSE</hi> caſe, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the cauſe of my being accounted an Enemy (if
I am ſo accounted) is not equally manifeſt with that of the Apoſtles;
for be had taxed them of tranſgreſſion in <hi>particular</hi> Duties, and made
the application of his reproof to <hi>particular</hi> perſons, and for this the <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders</hi>
againſt the Rules of Christianity were <hi>offended</hi> with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
that preacht it to them.—Had I done ſo, I confeſs, it might
<pb facs="tcp:61253:3"/>
have been a cauſe in ſome meaſure plauſible to juſtify ſome ſevere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of Anger, and an evil Reſentment. But even by <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
nothing is <hi>poſitive,</hi> only what is here mentioned is liable to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtructions;
and <q>Thoſe that don't know the circumstances of the ſad
miſchance of this Gentlemans Death will be apt to aſcribe it to a <hi>then</hi>
preſent Intemperance.</q>—But if that could have ſilenced this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy,
or allayed this Heat, I <hi>then</hi> did, and now do <hi>declare,</hi> I was
perſonally with him (within one hour) and neither his Relations, or
myſelf, or other Friends could in the leaſt ſuſpect it.</p>
            <p>But if other inferences may be drawn from ſo plain a Diſcourſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
their tendency may be, or allowing them to indifferent ſuppoſitions,
and ſo by conſequence may afford ſome ungrateful Concluſions; I hope no
good man, nor no wiſe man will ſay, that <hi>I</hi> am <hi>chargeable</hi> with all that
<hi>Jarrago</hi> of Inferences, that either Wit or Malice, Ignorance or Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
may gather thence. My aim was not (God is Judge and Witneſs)
to make ſcandalous reflections upon paſt actions, for I declare I know
nothing whereof to accuſe; but I thought, conſidering my method of
diſcourſe, what I ſaid was <hi>fairly</hi> deduceable from the words; and if
I have been <hi>particular</hi> in the directions, I am ſure I was <hi>deſignedly</hi>
general in the reproof.</p>
            <p>And that all thoſe that ſhall pleaſe to condeſcend ſo far, as to give
this little piece an <hi>indifferent</hi> reading, and afterward what <hi>cenſure</hi>
they pleaſe, may know fully and plainly the reaſon why 'twas publiſhed,
and judge from thence, whether there were any need of Jealouſy or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
which hath occaſioned ſo wide and common reports; I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it to your view exactly in the <hi>ſame</hi> Method and Language that
'twas firſt written, without ſo much as <hi>altering</hi> a ſentence, ſcarce a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle</hi>
word; (excepting only that in the repetition of ſome remarkable
Sentences, there might poſſibly be ſome accidental Tranſpoſition.) And
if the publication of it, may, upon ſecond thoughts with deliberate pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal,
ſatisfy thoſe who are particularly concerned in the ſad occaſion of
the Funeral, (that here are no particular Reprehenſions) if it may have
a favourable approbation from men unprejudiced; if it may any way tend
to the Reformation of any Perſon, that ſo God may have the <hi>Glory,</hi>
when <hi>theſe,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> of them happen, with the glory of <hi>God attending</hi>
them, I have my only aim, and beyond thoſe I wiſh no more.</p>

            <p>AMong all the troubles to which we are ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as we are <hi>men,</hi> and which we have drawn
upon our ſelves as we are <hi>ſinners,</hi> none is ſo
dreadful as <hi>death:</hi> the thoughts of being <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved</hi>
from this preſent place of abode to another ſtate,
have deep impreſſions upon our Spirits, and they alſo
very melancholy and <hi>diſtracting;</hi> and eſpecially the more
afflicting, when we find the events of ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to affect <hi>our ſelves,</hi> (i. e.) if we loſe a <hi>Friend,</hi> we are
grieved: But if we apprehend Death calling for us in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi>
it chills our Blood, and caſts a Damp upon our
Courage. Mirth and Jollity are neglected as inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
and <hi>unſatisfactory;</hi> and infinitely various ſurmiſes
do mutually diſturb our incompoſed Senſes; ſo much
that under the fears of <hi>approaching</hi> Death, we loſe the
very advantages of <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>natural</hi> averſion that all men have to dying,
or a final diſſolution, is mightily augmented by <hi>collateral</hi>
cauſes, <hi>v. gr.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Some are extreamly <hi>fond</hi> of this World. They are
here (as they think) well at eaſe, they have all that they
can <hi>need,</hi> and that makes them ſuppoſe, and believe, 'tis
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61253:4"/>
all that they ought to <hi>wiſh</hi> for; and therefore, <hi>here</hi> they
reſolve to fix their Tabernacles; and in this Region of
<hi>reputed</hi> Felicity, they would willingly <hi>continue</hi> a long time,
(at leaſt) and for <hi>ever</hi> if 'twere poſſible.</p>
            <p>Hence therefore ſome are unwilling to dye, becauſe
they muſt by that be <hi>deprived</hi> of all thoſe delightful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and ſtript of all thoſe conveniences, in which they
at preſent find ſo much <hi>Comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Some are afraid to dye (or unwilling at leaſt) and they
are ſuch, as have not the advantages of the former, but
yet have ſome <hi>tolerable</hi> conveniences, and enough to
<hi>counterbalance</hi> all their Troubles or Miſeries in the worſt
ſenſe, and many pleaſant <hi>intervals</hi> of Comfort; And they
never conſidered enough of a <hi>future</hi> ſtate, to think whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there might be any thing <hi>better</hi> in another world,
and therefore they would not leave this for an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they have the miſhap to meet with troubles, yet they
are not <hi>laſting,</hi> and a new Enjoyment <hi>wears</hi> off the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of a late bad accident—But now, if they ſhould be
<hi>diſplaced</hi> from ſuch a ſtate, whoſe circumſtances they have
ſo long reviewed, examined and approved, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
be lodged in another Region, with which they
are utterly <hi>unacquainted,</hi> this would be ſuch an <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi>
thought, as the moſt rigid Stoick with all his Philoſophy,
could not eaſily <hi>mitigate,</hi> and the Venom of it would
work ſo powerfully, that in a little time it would draw
on that <hi>very</hi> evil which their fear was intend to <hi>prevent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Others are afraid to dye, from the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of an <hi>ill ſpent</hi> Life; they are men who have lived
in an open Rebellion againſt that ſacred Majeſty which
governs the Univerſe, but eſpecially <hi>inhabiteth</hi> Eternity;
but yet have not lived ſo long, or ſinned ſo <hi>much,</hi> as to
wear out all <hi>Senſe</hi> of a Deity, or eraſe the <hi>natural</hi>
Apprehenſions of good and evil. But their memory is
tenacious enough to mind them of <hi>what</hi> they did; and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61253:4"/>
their Conſcience tells them what <hi>'twas,</hi> when done; and
when upon a review of their paſt actions, they can only
draw a <hi>ſad</hi> Catalogue of Error and Folly, or wilful Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
and repeated diſobedience, and yet at the
ſame time their own hearts tell them, that thoſe faults
muſt be <hi>accounted</hi> for to a Soveraign Judge, who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
juſt, and will neither be byaſſed or perſwaded to
paſs any ſentence upon any Perſon, otherwiſe than the
<hi>Merits</hi> of his Actions ſhall require: When by looking
backward, he ſhall ſee little or nothing that he dares <hi>own,</hi>
and yet looking forward, he can have no proſpect of any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
that he would willingly <hi>ſuffer;</hi> in a word, where
there is no remaining <hi>hope</hi> of any thing, but a fearful
looking for of <hi>Judgment,</hi> 'tis in this caſe no <hi>wonder</hi> if men
be unwilling to dye; for to ſuch men death is only an
<hi>inlet</hi> to damnation; which is the moſt amazing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that can be, next to the being in <hi>actual</hi> torment.</p>
            <p>But yet I ſay, if there were none of theſe <hi>accidental</hi>
reaſons to bring men out of love with death, yet even
that principle of <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> which is connatural
with our being, would engage us to uſe all poſſible law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means for our continuance here in this ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, an <hi>active</hi> faith, a firm hope, and an ardent

St. <hi>Paul,</hi> What mean ye to weep, and to break my
heart, I am ready not only to be <hi>bound,</hi> but to <hi>Dye</hi> for
the Name of the Lord Jeſus?—And the vaſt number of
Martyrs, that have <hi>ſo willingly</hi> ſubmitted to the Tyranny of
Perſecutors, doth fully convince us, that many in the
World did not think life the moſt <hi>valuable</hi> bleſſing.</p>
            <p>But yet ordinarily ſpeaking, this willingneſs to lay down
our lives, tho for Religions ſake, is a ſort of <hi>Violence</hi> to
our natural temper and conſtitution: and 'tis what no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61253:5"/>
one can, and would do, if he were not firſt perfectly
<hi>transformed,</hi> and altered from what he was; Nay, in
ſhort, this natural averſion that is lodged in the very
original of our frame is abundantly manifeſt in that peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, <hi>Jo. 12. 27. Father ſave me
from this hour, but for this cauſe came I unto this hour: (i. e.)</hi>
the terrible apprehenſions of his approaching paſſion, did
ſo <hi>diſmay</hi> him, that tho he came into the World on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to ſuffer, yet he deſired, that if <hi>poſſible</hi> it might be
paſſed by: <hi>Mat. 26. 39. Let this cup paſs from me,</hi> or at
leaſt that the time might be <hi>deferred</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—for we are ſo <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
to our ſelves, and ſo fond of our Eaſe, that an Evil
which we <hi>fear,</hi> is as pungent as that which we really <hi>feel.</hi>
And we have been told of ſome who have made their
lives extreamly <hi>miſerable,</hi> only by antedating their miſery,
and ſuſpecting that in time they <hi>might be</hi> ſo.</p>
            <p>I don't mean that <hi>this</hi> reſpected our Saviour, for he ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew
all conſequences, and he knew that he ſhould <hi>riſe</hi>
again, and be glorified at the right hand of God: But this
reſpects <hi>men,</hi> who can ſee no <hi>further</hi> than to what is before
them.</p>
            <p>But yet what <hi>Notions</hi> ſoever men may have of things,
what projects ſoever may <hi>divert</hi> them, what thoughts to
<hi>diſtract</hi> them, or what <hi>care</hi> ſoever they uſe for their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
certain it is, that no man can continue long
in <hi>this</hi> World: Our fears in <hi>this</hi> life don't ſet the <hi>other</hi> life
at a greater diſtance; nor do our enjoyments here give
us a ſurer <hi>Inheritance</hi> in this Life; but whatever our
worldly circumſtances are, our time here is but, and can
but be <hi>ſhort,</hi> for as for man <hi>his days are as graſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>To collect and repeat to you the various Epithets and
Emblems, by which the Writers of all ages have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the Shortneſs and Uncertainty of our Life, is not ſo
very material: The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had their Hieroglyphicks,
and the other Heathen their Maxims, and the Scriptures
have their Alluſions and Parables, their Repreſentations
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61253:5"/>
and Similitudes; but I will go no further than the <hi>Text,</hi>
which is very ſutable to the ſad occaſion of our preſent
meeting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mans Life is as graſs.</hi>] The <hi>Seaſon</hi> of the year tells us,
how ſoon it is withered, that which is green and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in the morning, and but lately refreſhed by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Dew from the kind Heavens, is e're noon, cut down,
and by Night utterly altered from what it was; the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
of it is gone, and no Art can <hi>recover</hi> it again. So
the <hi>Flowers</hi> of the field are beauteous and gay, more gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
than <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 29. and yet
as ſoon as they are pluckt from their Stalk, they begin to
<hi>fade,</hi> and in a very little time degenerate into a <hi>loathſom</hi>
Rottenneſs.—Nay, which is ſeemingly a leſs cauſe for any
conſiderable alteration, the very Temperature of the
Heavens, if but a little <hi>unſeaſonable,</hi> robs both Graſs
and Flowers of their <hi>Beauty;</hi> a rough wind, or a great
rain makes <hi>both</hi> to fade; and after <hi>Once</hi> ſuch an accident
happens, it is for ever irremediable, <hi>and the Place thereof
ſhall know it no more]</hi> (i. e.) they never grow in the ſame
place, nor recover their loſt <hi>Excellency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſuch are the days of man; <hi>as for man his days are as
Graſs.]</hi> Man is weak and helpleſs, <hi>born to trouble as the
Sparks fly upward,</hi> Job. 5. 7 <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by a <hi>natural</hi> and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
Tendency. And yet not ſo <hi>continually</hi> vexed by
croſs misfortunes, but there is <hi>enough</hi> in life to deſerve
<hi>Commendation,</hi> and to cauſe a moderate <hi>content:</hi> As we
rejoyce to ſee a <hi>flouriſhing</hi> Meadow, though within few
days, we reſolve to ſtrip it of its pleaſant Verdure; or as
we <hi>admire</hi> a pretty Flower, though within a ſhort time
that we have handled it, we are ſenſible that its <hi>Fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
will decay inſenſibly.—So in our Life there are <hi>many</hi>
things which are pleaſant and delectable, but their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
is <hi>uncertain;</hi> ten thouſand accidents may ſpoil a
<hi>great</hi> Fortune; or a ſudden and unthought of miſchance
may nip our blooming <hi>hopes,</hi> and in ſuch a time as all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61253:6"/>
things promiſe fair, there may happen (unawares) a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
change, which ſhall <hi>alter</hi> the Scene, as much as cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Meadow, or plucking a Flower, cauſes an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in thoſe refreſhing Objects.</p>
            <p>But then the parallel is not altogether alike in all points;
but with reſpect to man there is ſomething of a <hi>tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</hi>
Mans days and all worldly <hi>advantages,</hi> are here
but of a <hi>ſhort</hi> date, and uncertain continuance, ſo <hi>far</hi>
therefore like graſs or a flower. But further <hi>unlike</hi> to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for they as ſoon as they are corrupted, <hi>return</hi> again
to their firſt nothing, but man can never ſuffer an <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation;</hi>
The place of a man ſhall know him no more,
(i. e.) a man can never live a <hi>ſecond</hi> time in this world;
but there is an everlaſting duration reſerved for all men
in the <hi>next:</hi> And how fading ſoever <hi>temporal</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
may appear, certain it is, the ſubſequent ſtate can
admit of no <hi>alteration:</hi> the latter is a matter of <hi>faith,</hi>
the former is the ſubject of frequent <hi>experience.</hi> Mans
life, or his days are as graſs.</p>
            <p>It was long ſince ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. 10. the age of man is
threeſcore years and ten, which comparatively to what
men lived before the ſtood, may very properly be ſaid
to be but as an <hi>hand breadth, Pſal.</hi> 39. 5. But yet even
this <hi>ſhort</hi> period is but <hi>rarely</hi> attained, where <hi>one</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>conflict</hi> with the troubles and inconveniences of
old age, t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n are cut off, or taken away in the midſt of
their days, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 24. Or yet, if all could be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to come to the utmoſt <hi>deſirable</hi> period of an old
age, with the concurrent advantages of eaſe, peace and
honour, yet even ſtill their days would be like the <hi>graſs;</hi>
For we know by Experience, that the Graſs which we
<hi>reſerve</hi> for Winter, is mightily <hi>defaced</hi> by a bluſtering
North-Eaſt wind, and what remains uneaten by Cattle,
is trodden under foot, and by the return of the following
Spring is all <hi>rotten.</hi> And ſo—the oldeſt age will come to
a <hi>bound</hi> which it ſhall not paſs over; for <hi>one</hi> day muſt be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61253:6"/>
the <hi>laſt</hi> to every body. And our reſidence here below,
being only among ſuch objects as are <hi>various</hi> and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
we do by a ſympathy partake of their Nature, ſo far,
as to be neceſſarily ſubject to the ſame <hi>Inconveniences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true there are <hi>different</hi> diſtances of time when theſe
things happen, but that is but as 'tis in all <hi>mutable</hi> things;
ſome Flowers are very <hi>forward,</hi> but thoſe as ſoon decay,
others are later, e're they ſhow their Splendor, and they
accordingly <hi>continue</hi> longer.</p>
            <p>But then 'tis not only a <hi>natural</hi> decay or fading,
which will one time or other infallibly attend them,
which ſhows their mutability, but there is ſometimes a
force, and <hi>violence</hi> committed, and a rough ſtorm, or
but an <hi>unwary</hi> touch, may cauſe them to ſink into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>ſooner</hi> than elſe they would: in ſuch a caſe <hi>nature</hi>
is injured, and precipitated into an <hi>irreverſible</hi> ruine.
And in this caſe <hi>too,</hi> mans days are as graſs: 'Tis terrible
to think, (and I am ſorry 'tis the preſent caſe) how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have been <hi>cruſht</hi> into their Graves by <hi>ſurprizing</hi> acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>
            <p>How (ſeemingly) inconſiderable evils have produced
<hi>diſmal,</hi> and yet <hi>laſting</hi> effects; how many children have
been left <hi>Orphans,</hi> and how many women <hi>Widows,</hi> and
how many parents have been deprived of hopeful and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<hi>Children,</hi> even by ſuch ſad caſu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lties, as it lay not
in mans power to foreſee or <hi>prevent.</hi> Our own <hi>perſonal</hi>
knowledge too fully aſſures us of this truth, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
bring multiplied inſtances of ſuch woful miſhaps.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have been well in the <hi>morning,</hi> and as promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
as a <hi>Flower,</hi> have like a Flower (e're night) been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<hi>diſrobed</hi> of all their Beauty; when all our hopes and
<hi>expectations,</hi> all our future comforts, and preſent <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
have in one inſtant been <hi>ſupplanted,</hi> and all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of looking for the ſame hath for ever been <hi>taken</hi> from

Flower of the Field.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61253:7"/>
I am ſorry I muſt, (and I crave leave and the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of thoſe who are moſt intimately concerned in our
preſent loſs, that I may; and I pray that it may not add
<hi>new</hi> ſupplies to that ſorrow which is already as <hi>great</hi> as
ſo ſad an occaſion can <hi>deſerve,</hi> only let it not be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
than Nature can <hi>ſupport,</hi> or Religion <hi>juſtify)</hi> I am
ſorry that I muſt ſay, that this preſent Text hath now a
very full and <hi>parallel,</hi> tho a very <hi>fatal</hi> completion.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman was like a <hi>flower</hi> of the field (i. e.) he
wanted nothing that might render him <hi>amiable,</hi> he had
multiplied <hi>advantages</hi> both natural and accidental; <hi>v. gr.</hi>
a good apprehenſion with a judgment equal to his years:
and was very promiſing of being very <hi>ſerviceable</hi> in his
Country, for which he was well capacitated by a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Eſtate.</hi> And to procure him a publick reſpect in the
<hi>world,</hi> he had the Honor and Happineſs to be deſcended
from two very <hi>Worthy</hi> Families, of a truly <hi>gentile</hi> extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well as an antient <hi>deſcent;</hi> (tho I would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
much upon that, leſt I ſhould be thought to flatter
thoſe that are alive, and yet I ought not wholly to omit
it.)</p>
            <p>The <hi>Honor</hi> of Parents doth eaſily <hi>procure</hi> a general repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to their Poſterity: and where there is an Eſtate
proportionable to <hi>maintain</hi> that Character, ſuch men are
both <hi>lov'd and fear'd;</hi> which are two advantages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a good rich Gentleman may do abundance of <hi>good:</hi>
and ſuch a man's <hi>example</hi> would effectually commend Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to the general approbation and choice of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who in ſpight of <hi>Precepts</hi> live by Example.</p>
            <p>He had alſo the conſtant and uninterrupted aſſurances
of Love and Kindneſs from a tender Mother, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
Siſters; as well as the general reſpects of all thoſe
who had the Happineſs to be at all acquainted with him.
In a word, he had that <hi>double</hi> happineſs the Poet wiſhed
for, (i. e.) a ſound mind in a ſound body. Thus was he
like a <hi>Flower,</hi> and indeed of as <hi>fair</hi> a figure as moſt of theſe
adjacent parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61253:7"/>
But alas! What did all theſe <hi>ſignify?</hi> He is cut <hi>down</hi> like a
flower, and his days were but as the graſs: <hi>One</hi> ſtorm,
one little accident hath rendred all theſe advantages <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His <hi>Estate</hi> is leſt behind him; his Anceſtors are <hi>no more</hi>
to be accounted to him, now that he is laid with them in
the <hi>Dust:</hi> and of all his <hi>Friends</hi> (tho they all lament his
Death, yet) none can <hi>relieve</hi> him.</p>
            <p>All our moſt pious reſpects to our <hi>deareſt</hi> Friends are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
as ſoon as the Soul is <hi>parted</hi> from the body;
and tho Nature, and Civility, and Religion allow and
command, that we perform the <hi>charitable</hi> Office of a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial;
Yet Reaſon, and Senſe, and Prudence, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
tell us, that the <hi>paſſionate</hi> demonſtrations of kindneſs,
which the tenderneſs of the Female Sex doth eaſily afford,
as well as the nearneſs of the Relation doth ſo readily
prompt, are neither <hi>juſtifiable</hi> nor commendable.</p>
            <p>I will lament my Friend, as I am a <hi>man,</hi> but yet not ſo,
as thereby to give the world any temptation to ſuſpect
that I am no <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> I may be <hi>ſorry</hi> for the loſs of my
Friend; but I muſt take care that I be not ſorry as if I had
<hi>no Hope.</hi> Nature forces me to <hi>grieve:</hi> but Religion ſhall
give it its <hi>juſt</hi> Limits, that my grief may not be inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
            <p>And ſince the all-wiſe God hath been pleaſed at this
<hi>ſtrange</hi> rate, to cut off this young Gentleman, juſt as we
do the tender graſs, ſince he who was a <hi>flower</hi> for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deſireable <hi>qualifications,</hi> is alſo like a flower <hi>withered;</hi>
I adviſe, that all that hear of this <hi>dreadful</hi> accident, do
think upon it for their <hi>improvement</hi> in Holineſs.</p>
            <p>Many men are ſo fond, as, at any extraordinary acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to attempt to meaſure Providence; and caſt about
them, to ſee, where ſhould be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the <hi>great</hi> thing
that God hath done. The Diſciples themſelves were not
free of this fault. <hi>Jo. 9. 2. Maſter, who did ſin, this man or
his parents, that he was born</hi> blind? But this is a <hi>fallible,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61253:8"/>
and withal a preſumptious way to judge of the methods
of Gods Providence: Certain we are (or we are <hi>Atheiſts)</hi>
that God hath a <hi>determinate</hi> end, in all things that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in this lower world; but it is not proper for us, that
we ſhould be able to <hi>ſquare</hi> his Providence with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>chances</hi> of the world: It rather obliges us to <hi>adore</hi>
his goodneſs, in preſerving us, and his mercy in ſparing
us; and that <hi>we</hi> who are as much graſs (i. e.) as ſrail,
and equally mortal as this young Gentleman, ſhould yet
be continued <hi>alive,</hi> when he is denied the further Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>And therefore to make this Text, and this particular
inſtance of Providence ſerviceable to us, I ſhall infer theſe
four things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That we do not value our ſelves too much, upon what
we have.</item>
               <item>2. That we do not too much addict our ſelves to this
world.</item>
               <item>3. That we make a ſeaſonable preparation for a removal
hence.</item>
               <item>4. That we moderate our ſorrow for the loſs of any Friend,
how near or hopeful ſoever.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Theſe are all naturally contained in the premiſes, and
theſe may be beneficial to the rectifying our <hi>miſtakes,</hi>
concerning the <hi>odds</hi> betwixt this and the other world;
for 'tis too often ſeen, that thoſe who have <hi>moſt</hi> of this
world, are too regardleſs of the next, and don't dream
of a change that may <hi>enſue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 1.</note> We ſhould not too much <hi>value</hi> our ſelves upon
what we have. All the valuable bleſſings or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of this life, are ſubject to <hi>change</hi> and caſualties: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
here below is permanent and laſting. All <hi>animae</hi>
beings are uſeleſs and contemptible, as ſoon as their
breath is gone; and the moſt ſolid inanimate bodies, do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61253:8"/>
by <hi>degrees</hi> decay, and grow unfaſhionable: Marble is
defaced by weather, and Silver and Gold will ruſt: but
if this were not ſo yet we ſhould not value them <hi>much,</hi>
becauſe they can't long be ſerviceable to us, for we can't
live <hi>long</hi> to enjoy them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Infancy</hi> we are <hi>careleſs</hi> of thoſe things, that we
eſteem moſt precious in common eſtimate (in older age.)
A new born Babe hath no <hi>comfort</hi> from a large inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
nor doth the care and labour of <hi>buſie</hi> anceſtors,
who heap'd up wealth like the ſand, to leave their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
a <hi>luxuriant</hi> fortune, at all <hi>affect</hi> them: But all that
they need is a <hi>careful</hi> Nurſe and good attendance; and if
they are ſo happy as to enjoy <hi>theſe,</hi> they never project
any thing <hi>future</hi> for twelve or fourteen years next to
come: And after that age, it may be, the <hi>flattery</hi> and
information of ſome indigent or ſpungy dependents, ſhall
<hi>ſwell</hi> a wealthy young heir with mountainous thoughts
of incredible Riches, which are his undoubted right, and
of which he can't be deprived; and from thence (it may
be) he is hurried on to all thoſe <hi>extravagancies,</hi> which
are laid as temptations to <hi>pleaſure</hi> by vaſſal confidents;
till by <hi>eaſie</hi> degrees he becomes ungovernable, and moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
licentious too: and many times thoſe malevolent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations
have cauſed <hi>Minors</hi> to turn Bankrupt, and even
<hi>forfeit</hi> their Eſtates, before they had lived long enough
to <hi>enjoy</hi> them. And hence it hath happened, that thoſe
who had enough to live <hi>creditably</hi> with good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to <hi>convey</hi> to their Children a ſufficient fortune,
have themſelves <hi>caſtrated</hi> their own Fortunes, and lived
long enough to <hi>lament</hi> the direful inconveniences of their
<hi>own</hi> too haſty Folly. So that in this ſenſe (at leaſt) our
advantages, or expectations are but like graſs or a flower;
for thoſe who ſpend madly in <hi>hopes</hi> of what they <hi>ſhall</hi>
enjoy plentifully, dye <hi>Beggars</hi> commonly.</p>
            <p>But ſay <hi>this</hi> be not the caſe. (For tho in this degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
age, there are too many inſtances to prove the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61253:9"/>
of fair Fortunes, even by <hi>this</hi> means, yet 'tis not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſo, nor indeed is it <hi>moſtly</hi> ſo; yet) ſuppoſe then a
Family as well <hi>fix'd,</hi> as they can be wiſhed for by their
Friends, or themſelves deſire: ſay their circumſtances are
ſuch, as puts them <hi>beyond</hi> the frowns of Fortune, and the
<hi>worſt</hi> of miſchances ſhall not bring them to Neceſſity:
Suppoſe them abounding with all conveniences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
too, that they live in Wealth and Reputation, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and loved, in Health and Peace; that they have
a numerous Progeny, which ſtand daily round their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
like Olive plants, ſo that all that know them ſhall be
forced to ſay; Lo! Here is <hi>one</hi> that is <hi>truly</hi> bleſſed, Yet
alas how really <hi>inconſiderable</hi> are theſe things. N. B. If
a Parent have but one fit of <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> theſe things are ſcarce
<hi>regarded.</hi> A Dropſy, or the Gout, or a violent Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach
makes all theſe ſeeming <hi>ornaments</hi> appear <hi>invaluable;</hi>
and the reliſh which thoſe things afforded in health, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
in a ſingle minute inſipid and contemptible.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>this</hi> do not happen, or if a man don't perceive
their vanity by ſome <hi>inhabiliments</hi> of body, or ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

time as ſurely be <hi>deprived</hi> of it, as he now <hi>enjoys</hi> it.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe <hi>this</hi> don't firſt happen neither, (i. e.) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a Parent live a long time to enjoy what he hath (I
mean, free from any perſonal troubles) yet if an <hi>accident</hi>
(amidſt his Proſperity) happen to any of thoſe <hi>things</hi>
which he calls <hi>his own,</hi> even <hi>that</hi> ſowers the <hi>reſt</hi> of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments:
<hi>But</hi> a ſickneſs in a Family, fills the reſt that
are yet well with doubts and <hi>fears;</hi> but Death drives
men to thoſe degrees of <hi>Impatience,</hi> which they would
blame in others, and yet think they may juſtify in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
or at leaſt lawfully permit. And yet after all
Diſquietudes and Torments, the fate that hath befallen
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61253:9"/>
them is <hi>irreverſible;</hi> and the remembrance of what they
<hi>had,</hi> gives them a ſad conviction that 'twas not <hi>lasting;</hi>
and the conſideration that they ſhall <hi>no more</hi> enjoy it,
might inſtruct them too, that 'twas at beſt but like a
<hi>flower:</hi> That, that ſhould not be <hi>too much</hi> prized, of
which they might ſo many ways be deprived; That no
wiſe man ſhould <hi>glory</hi> in that, of which ſo many caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
might <hi>rob</hi> him; nor think himſelf much the <hi>better</hi>
for that which he is ſure he can't <hi>keep</hi> long.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 2.</note> We ſhould not too much addict our ſelves
to this world. I allow and affirm 'tis every mans <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to manage that Fortune, with which God hath bleſt
him, and to convey it as <hi>entire</hi> to his poſterity, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it from his predeceſſors. And he that doth not
make <hi>ſutable</hi> proviſions for his Family, according to his
<hi>Quality,</hi> is worſe than a Beaſt in any ſenſe, and in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
one, worſe than an <hi>Infidel,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 8. Which is
ſomewhat to be conſidered by thoſe, who <hi>frolick</hi> away,
not only their incomes, but their very <hi>patrimony;</hi> who
revel to perpetual exceſs; who drown their own ſorrows
in Wine <hi>abroad,</hi> when at the ſame time, their Wives and
Families are forc'd to feed upon their own <hi>tears</hi> at home;
ſuch there are, ſhame on them, who can ſo eaſily and
incredibly cancel all the <hi>Obligations</hi> of Nature, and prove
ſo unaccountably cruel to their own bowels, and yet put
it off with a <hi>Jeſt;</hi> who ſquander away their eſtates, by
Rioting and Drunkenneſs, by Folly and Madneſs; nay,
who mortage their Reputation, and damn their Souls,
only to pleaſe one <hi>ſingle</hi> ſenſe. And yet tell ſome of thoſe
Fellows, how imprudent they act, or how unreaſonable
it is, that one man ſhould ſo impoveriſh a Family to <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
generations; eſpecially that 'tis wonderfully unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to ſtarve his children at home, which could ſubſiſt
with comfort, upon his <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> expences, all theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions
are ſlighted, and in a contemptible ſort of way,
ſome have anſwered, <q>Let that God who feedeth the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61253:10"/>
                  <hi>Ravens,</hi> provide for the <hi>Rooks.</hi>
               </q> This is ſtupid wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
inferior to that of brute beaſts, and 'tis a <hi>ſordid</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
this therefore be ſure is not contained in the caution;
'Tis not <hi>Care</hi> that we condemn, but 'tis <hi>too much.</hi> N. B.
The <hi>neceſſary</hi> parts of our duty, are thro a miſtake <hi>stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
too far, and by that means perverted from their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
intent.</p>
            <p>Becauſe every man muſt <hi>improve</hi> his Talent, which
he hath received, therefore <hi>ſome</hi> think, that they muſt
not allow any <hi>relaxation;</hi> But they labour hard, and fare
hard; tire their bodies, and rack brains, how to encreaſe
their wealth, and yet as their <hi>riches</hi> increaſe, ſo do their
<hi>deſires</hi> too: And by how much the more they have, by
ſo much the more are they covetous and greedy.</p>
            <p>But <hi>this</hi> is to be <hi>too much</hi> addicted to the world, and
this is that which by conſequence we condemn. <hi>N.B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why we ſhould take <hi>ſome</hi> care in the
world, even for the things of the world, is, becauſe we
do not know but we <hi>may</hi> need them; and God never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
any body to be only an <hi>idle</hi> Spectator: and no
body pretends to challenge to himſelf an immunity from
all employments.</p>
            <p>But if a man have nought to do, he is exceedingly
more uneaſy than when ſurrounded with buſineſs; and
it hath often puzzled many mens brains, how to diſpoſe
of ſome of thoſe that they called <hi>idle</hi> hours: But now
the reaſon, why we ſhould not ſpend <hi>too much</hi> time upon
the things of this world, is, becauſe we can't tell how
long we ſhall enjoy them.</p>
            <p>I really believe, no man would much perplex himſelf
about <hi>fine</hi> houſes, or new purchaſes, that was aſſured he
ſhould dye within few months that he had <hi>obtained</hi>
them; and yet <hi>this</hi> may be any mans fate; for the days
of <hi>every</hi> man are but as <hi>graſs:</hi> and therefore methinks
'tis not only needleſs, but <hi>madneſs,</hi> to be very <hi>ſollicitous</hi>
in getting that, of which we have no aſſurance that we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61253:10"/>
ſhall keep it, but innumerable arguments to convince
us, that we <hi>muſt</hi> (or at leaſt <hi>may)</hi> be deprived thereof in
a ſmall time.</p>
            <p>Now this caution of not being <hi>too much</hi> addicted to this
☜ world, is ſuppoſed to contain a twofold prohibition.</p>
            <p>Firſt, With reſpect to thoſe things, that we are apt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to account <hi>neceſſary:</hi> ſuch as are a <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> for our
ſelves, and a competency for <hi>poſterity.</hi> Even thoſe, I
ſay, we muſt be careful not to extend beyond their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
limits; but we ought to <hi>moderate</hi> our deſires, by
the rules of Chriſtian contentedneſs: as knowing that
every thing beyond <hi>conveniency,</hi> is abſolutely <hi>ſuperfluous.</hi>
And thoſe who have the <hi>greateſt</hi> eſtates, can only have
but food and raiment; that the <hi>reſt</hi> is conſumed by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
or reſerved for <hi>Strangers,</hi> and it yields no other
fruit than trouble or ſorrow; <hi>trouble</hi> to keep it, and <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
if it be loſt. But eſpecially he that is a great <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer</hi>
of the World, is always unwilling to leave it; and
yet ſo <hi>fading</hi> is his nature, that he can't long enjoy it;
and therefore—from the uncertainty of our <hi>retaining</hi>
the things of the world, we ought in prudence to <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
our longing after them; and becauſe we can't long
<hi>enjoy</hi> them, we ſhould not much perplex ourſelves in
their <hi>purſuit,</hi> or weary ourſelves in their acquiſition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But there is a <hi>worſe</hi> caſe yet, many devote
themſelves to the world, upon no pretence of <hi>neceſſity,</hi>
or convenience, but they rather become its <hi>ſlaves,</hi> and
ſpend their whole time utterly in the <hi>pleaſures</hi> which it
affords, and in purſuance of its airy vanities; But <hi>this</hi>
the premiſes do <hi>highly</hi> condemn: For if the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of
our Life be a <hi>good</hi> argument, to prevent too much care
in <hi>lawful</hi> things, much more is it an argument to reſtrain
us from thoſe practices, which are not <hi>only</hi> unlawful, but
of <hi>pernicious</hi> conſequence. He that is born a man, and
endowed with a rational Soul, ſhould conſider, that he
hath <hi>ſomething</hi> elſe to do, than to live <hi>meerly</hi> to the fleſh:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61253:11"/>
that 'tis a very irrational method of <hi>ſpending</hi> his time, to
conſume the whole of it upon his <hi>worſer</hi> part; The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of what <hi>little</hi> ſatisfaction, he hath had in his
former frolicks, might induce a man to think, that
there is ſomewhat more <hi>ſutable</hi> to his excellent nature.</p>
            <p>The beſt of all worldly <hi>enjoyments,</hi> if they <hi>exceed</hi> the
Limit of Prudence and Sobriety, may be pleaſing for a
time ('tis true) as long as men are <hi>bereaved</hi> of their
ſences, through the height of Exceſs; <hi>(which is juſt as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
perſons reckon Fetters and Chains, an Ornament)</hi> But
alas! as ſoon as they <hi>return</hi> to themſelves, they find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſhame or ſickneſs; an aching Head, or a weak
Stomach, or rotten Bones.</p>
            <p>The <hi>tranſporting</hi> Pleaſures of a Frolick all vaniſh in a
night; and all that remains is a <hi>fear,</hi> that others will <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi>
the indecencies of which they were lately guilty
and have <hi>themſelves</hi> forgotten.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay, conſidering thoſe things are ſo truly
<hi>vanity;</hi> that they are all tranſitory, which periſh in the
uſing; that they are but imaginary <hi>Apparitions,</hi> and at
beſt no <hi>further</hi> grateful than they are <hi>fancied</hi> to be ſo, it
will follow, that they ſhould not be too <hi>eagerly</hi> courted,
nor ſhould we ſpend <hi>too much</hi> time in their purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 3.</note> Since our time here is ſo ſhort, and withal
ſo uncertain, we ought to make <hi>timely preparation</hi> for
our removal hence. <hi>Mans days are but as Graſs,</hi> conſume
in a moment; our days are ſwifter than a Poſt; our
time is but like a writing upon a ſand; and of this <hi>every</hi>
one muſt needs be ſenſible, that ever looks abroad in the
world; and yet there are not many that lay this to
heart as they ought, nor do they conſider their <hi>own</hi> frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when they ſee others drop into their Graves.—It may
be on a <hi>Funeral day,</hi> or on the news of ſuch a terrible
miſchance and <hi>fatal</hi> accident as <hi>this</hi> was; men may have
ſome natural ſuggeſtion that mortality is <hi>certain,</hi> and
death amazing; But the next <hi>merriment</hi> wears off the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61253:11"/>
ſenſe of it, and men follow their accuſtomed ſports or
buſineſs with as <hi>much</hi> eagerneſs, as if they ſhould <hi>never</hi>
dye; and lay Scenes for ſtrange projects, as if they were
<hi>immortal:</hi> and till they find themſelves <hi>arreſted</hi> by the
Meſſenger of Death [a grievous ſickneſs] <hi>they fancy it
will always ſtand at a vast diſtance from them.</hi> But this
ſhould not be ſo;—we know we muſt remove off from
this ſtage, and <hi>for ought</hi> we know the time is <hi>nearer</hi> than
we are aware.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman was as <hi>likely</hi> to live, as any perſon
here now preſent; and yet within one hour that I ſaw
him <hi>lively</hi> and well, I heard the <hi>ſad</hi> news of that acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
which drew on death <hi>irreſiſtably,</hi> againſt all our
good <hi>wiſhes,</hi> to the <hi>ruine</hi> of our hopes, and the <hi>grief</hi> of all
Spectators. Nay the change was ſo <hi>ſudden,</hi> and withal
ſo violent, that Art and Medicines were <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> and the
<hi>ready</hi> offices of all his Friends, were utterly unſerviceable;
but in a word, he was <hi>ſtupid</hi> in a moment, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo till he died, which was ſhortly afterward. And
methinks this <hi>ſingle</hi> inſtance is enough to add <hi>weight</hi> to
the Argument, and enforce the inference, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that all
men ſhould provide in <hi>ſeaſon</hi> for a removal hence.</p>
            <p>For who can tell, but the ſame or a like misfortune
may befal <hi>either</hi> of us; (tho yet, I ſay, conſidering the
circumſtances, they appear ſo amazing, that I heartily
do, and every one may, pray, from ſuch a death good
Lord <hi>deliver</hi> us.) But yet allowing only that a <hi>ſudden</hi>
death is but barely <hi>poſſible;</hi> yet who in his wits would
run the hazzard of a <hi>following Eternity,</hi> meerly for the
Love of a fading, periſhing, tranſitory, uncertain world.</p>
            <p>We muſt ſubſiſt, after our ſouls and bodies are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and therefore we ought ſo to ſpend our time in the
body, that it may turn to ſome account for our ſouls,
after our bodies are turned to <hi>duſt;</hi> which I expreſs, by
making a <hi>timely preparation</hi> for our removal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61253:12"/>
There is no one thing in which men are ſo <hi>contentedly</hi>
cheated, as in the notions of living and dying; nay <hi>worſe,</hi>
thoſe who will not allow <hi>others</hi> to impoſe upon them,
tho but to the damage of a <hi>penny,</hi> will yet impoſe upon
<hi>themſelves,</hi> in this caſe, which is a matter of <hi>infinite</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:
and many times hug their error ſo long, that
it proves irrecoverably <hi>damnable, (i. e.)</hi> men drop into
<hi>Hell,</hi> while they careſs themſelves with the <hi>fond</hi> hopes
of a following Heaven.</p>
            <p>And this is a madneſs which poſſeſſes the <hi>generality</hi> of
all mankind; they put death and the other world at a
<hi>great diſtance,</hi> and then think themſelves <hi>ſafe</hi> in all their
extravagancies; there they revel their ſenſes; indulge to
Luxury; make proviſion for the Fleſh; court the world;
and make but a <hi>ſport</hi> of damnation.</p>
            <p>And yet all this while, are confident, that they ſhall
have time enough to <hi>reverſe</hi> all this; and <hi>meet</hi> Death
long enough e're it call for them:—And that after
a life of <hi>ſin</hi> and vanity, they ſhall dye very devout <hi>Saints,</hi>
and partake of their Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Unaccountable ſtupidity! What is this that ſo <hi>bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>
men! What <hi>Circaean</hi> Cup ſhould have power ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſo to <hi>intoxicate</hi> them! And ſo utterly to diveſt them
of their Senſe and Reaſon! Nay what <hi>Amulet</hi> is that,
which can ſo powerfully <hi>reſiſt</hi> the Force and Charms of
the principles of Religion! and make them ſo <hi>regardleſs</hi>
of another world! to which yet they may be <hi>tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
for ought they know, in the ſpace of one hour.</p>
            <p>There are many who have ſerved this World with the
<hi>ſame zeal;</hi> coveted wealth with as <hi>much</hi> greedineſs; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
themſelves with as much <hi>liberty;</hi> carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon their <hi>appendant</hi> ornaments with as <hi>much ſtate;</hi>
in a world, that ſinned as <hi>boldly,</hi> and yet with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of the ſame <hi>ſecurity,</hi> in <hi>former</hi> days, that men do
<hi>now:</hi>—And yet many of us can tell how <hi>ſhort</hi> they fell
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61253:12"/>
in their expectations; that they died in the <hi>habit</hi> of ſin,
where there have been no <hi>appearances</hi> of any colour of
repentance; and ſome in the very <hi>act,</hi> where <hi>Charity</hi> it
ſelf can hardly ſuppoſe it; at leaſt, I'm ſure Reaſon will
not <hi>allow</hi> it.</p>
            <p>In a word, we have known ſome that have died in
ſuch a condition, as conſidering the circumſtances, and
with reference to the <hi>next</hi> world, I'm ſure no man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
would be content to dye in the <hi>ſame condition</hi> for
ten thouſand worlds.</p>
            <p>Well: Allow this; but conſider, if we uſe <hi>ſuch</hi> practices,
why may not we fear the <hi>ſome</hi> end: In ſuch a caſe fear
is <hi>beneficial;</hi> and foreſight is greatly advantageous;
and therefore we ſhould prepare in <hi>ſeaſon</hi> for our removal
hence.</p>
            <p>'Tis a fatal <hi>deluſion</hi> to reſerve the practice of piety to
the <hi>latter</hi> part of our lives: 'Tis an affront to God, that
we ſhould <hi>ſin away</hi> our Youth, our Strength, and our
Vigour, and at laſt bring him the <hi>lame</hi> offering of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
old age, which is rendred uſeleſs to our ſelves, thrô
the frequent <hi>debaucheries</hi> of Youth, which no arguments
could prevent: Briefly; Nothing can be ſaid to juſtify
thoſe, who believe a <hi>future</hi> ſtate, and yet all the time
which they live here, make no <hi>proviſion</hi> for it. (For I
reckon <hi>future</hi> reſolutions to be nothing but a trick to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
their conſciences in this world; though even thoſe
will render all <hi>reſolving</hi> penitents inexcuſable in the next,
at the day of Judgment.)</p>
            <p>Now when I ſay, we muſt make a timely preparation
☜ for our removal hence, I mean two things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Parents</hi> muſt take care to educate their Children
well; (expreſſed in the order of celebrating the Marriage
in our Church, by) bringing them up in the <hi>fear,</hi> and
nurture of the Lord; And <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 22. 6. calls it,
<hi>training up a Child in the way that he ſhould go.</hi> There is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61253:13"/>
nothing ſo much conduces to the making a <hi>timely</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for our removal hence, as doth a <hi>vertuous</hi>
education.</p>
            <p>When Children in their <hi>tender</hi> age, are accuſtomed
to have an <hi>horror</hi> of any thing that is evil, that grows
(with their age) into a perfect <hi>antipathy.</hi> And when
they are only <hi>timely</hi> warned that lying, ſwearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
will carry them to <hi>Hell,</hi> when they dye, <hi>this</hi> will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
ſuch terrible apprehenſions of <hi>damnation</hi> upon their
memories, as no <hi>Device</hi> of the Devil or his inſtruments,
can ever <hi>deface;</hi>—men ſo ſeaſoned with arguments
from <hi>terror,</hi> are <hi>proof</hi> againſt charms; and they will be
afraid to do <hi>wickedly,</hi> becauſe they know the end will be
<hi>Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>†Oh!<note place="margin">† Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think this ſhould no more be a ſcandal; than it would be an affront to wiſh all men Saints.</note> How happy would it be, if <hi>all Parents</hi> would
but take this care!</p>
            <p>But alas! Where is this almoſt to be met with? thoſe
who are extremely <hi>nice</hi> of every thing that relates to the
<hi>bodily</hi> health, and welfare <hi>temporal</hi> of their Children, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that (as we ſay) a Fly muſt not pitch on them, and
think them extreamly injured by any body, that offers
but to <hi>contradict</hi> them, in every little <hi>impertinent</hi> humour,
—Yet thoſe <hi>very</hi> perſons can be content to hear thoſe
very <hi>beloved</hi> Children, ſwear as <hi>ſoon</hi> almoſt as they can
ſpeak, and lye <hi>accuſtomedly,</hi> and miſ-call and curſe their
Play-mates, and yet at all this to be <hi>unconcerned:</hi> And in
all this the Child muſt be <hi>humoured</hi> (forſooth) or his
Spirits will be broken, though <hi>God</hi> be diſhonoured, and
his Laws trampled under foot.</p>
            <p>But alas! Whatever thoſe <hi>fond</hi> Parents may think, I
know that this comes up <hi>full</hi> to <hi>Ely</hi>'s ſin, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 29.
who honoured his Sons above God. For ſo thoſe, out of
a damnable Folly <hi>ruine</hi> their Children, only out of a fear,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61253:13"/>
that they ſhould ruine them, by <hi>reſtraining</hi> them.</p>
            <p>I will never perſwade Parents to be <hi>hard hearted,</hi> or
unnatural; But I ſay, if a <hi>Child</hi> do any thing that is evil,
correct him how <hi>young</hi> ſoever; but do it with that <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
that the violence do not exceed his ſtrength; Leſt
you prove a <hi>Murtherer</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Reformer.</hi> 'Tis ſaid by
<hi>a wiſe man, Prov.</hi> 23, 13, 14. <hi>With-hold not correction from
the Child: N. B. for if thou beateſt him with a rod, he
ſhall not dye: Thou ſhalt beat him with a rod, and ſhalt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his Soul from Hell.</hi> N.B. For thoſe <hi>little</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>tender</hi> years, and before cuſtom hath ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induced
an <hi>habit,</hi> will create an abſolute <hi>averſneſs</hi> to all
iniquity.</p>
            <p>And therefore, I ſay, that thoſe who have the care of
Children committed to them, if they do not <hi>reſtrain</hi>
them from ſin as often as they find them guilty, either
by <hi>Correction</hi> or <hi>Reproof,</hi> do what in them lies, to <hi>betray</hi>
☜ them over to Hell: And though the <hi>Indiſcretion</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Ignorance of thoſe Minors may in ſome meaſure
excuſe them from the <hi>formality</hi> of the guilt, provided
they dye in their <hi>tender</hi> age (<hi>i. e.</hi>) before they are come
to weigh things according to their nature, or make a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
between good and evil; yet ſure, this <hi>Indulgence</hi>
of Parents, Maſters or Guardians, can never be excuſed,
nor will God let it paſs <hi>unpuniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, if Children be <hi>allowed</hi> to ſwear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when
<hi>young,</hi> and afterward grow up to age, and ſet abroad in
the world, and meet with ſuch variety of temptations,
'tis then no wonder to hear that ſuch are <hi>incredibly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht.
For when thoſe who had no <hi>reſtraints</hi> in their
<hi>Infancy,</hi> nor no <hi>Curb</hi> in their Youth, meet with old Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners
in Wickedneſs, they don't come like <hi>Tinder</hi> to
a Spark of Fire, but rather they <hi>themſelves</hi> are all on a
<hi>Flame,</hi> and want nothing but the <hi>mode</hi> of the times to be
<hi>compleatly</hi> wicked; which in the more <hi>modern</hi> Language is
(tho damnable yet) gentile.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61253:14"/>
Now, whatever you may <hi>think</hi> of this, I aſſure you
'tis a <hi>fatal</hi> truth: And I have heard of, and know thoſe,
whoſe Parents have <hi>allowed</hi> them (when <hi>Children</hi>) to
practice <hi>constantly</hi> thoſe ſeveral wickedneſſes, which men
of <hi>Age</hi> ought to be aſhamed of.—that when a <hi>Boy</hi> of
ten or twelve years old, hath been able to ſwear briskly;
lye fluently, or talk to his elders <hi>ſaucily,</hi> with a little
mixture of <hi>Railery;</hi> and to the Female ſex a ſtory of
<hi>bawdy</hi> obſcenity: In a word, if he have been able to play
the <hi>Buffoon</hi> wittily, and act a <hi>Merry-Andrew</hi> with an air,
he hath been as much <hi>admired,</hi> and commended, as if
he underſtood all the <hi>depths</hi> of Learning, whether natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
or Theological.</p>
            <p>And then pray, what <hi>hopes</hi> that ſuch an one ſhould
ever reſtrain <hi>himſelf</hi> when abroad? Parents (naturally)
have ſome awful influence upon their Children; and it
muſt be a <hi>Rape</hi> and violence to their natures, to eraſe
the apprehenſions of it on <hi>either</hi> ſide. But ſin is of a <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling</hi>
nature: and the greateſt <hi>contrarieties</hi> agree, and
the moſt diſtant contradictions are <hi>reconciled,</hi> to make a
Conſpiracy in wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, thoſe who thus ſet up in the world (as I
may ſay) <hi>Licentiates</hi> in Iniquity, they generally grow
from ſin to ſin, and never <hi>dream</hi> of a Judgment to come.
—And no wonder, for they never <hi>heard</hi> of ſuch a thing.
For we can't ſuppoſe that ever ſuch <hi>Gallants</hi> ſhould go
to a <hi>Church,</hi> or look in a <hi>Bible,</hi> or read a good <hi>Book,</hi>
or hear a <hi>Sermon:</hi> Alas! No: That's none of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
they have no <hi>preſident</hi> for ſo doing, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
never did <hi>ſo</hi> before them, and therefore they ſcorn
to begin.</p>
            <p>Miſerable <hi>condition</hi> that theſe <hi>men</hi> are in! they <hi>never</hi>
had any <hi>acquaintance</hi> with Religion, and which is the
<hi>worſt,</hi> of their caſe, their Conſciences were <hi>ſtupified,</hi> before
they knew the <hi>voice</hi> of their admonitions!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61253:14"/>
And thus muſt they <hi>periſh</hi> eternally, except a <hi>Miracle</hi>
of mercy interpoſe for their reſcue; and that too, ſuch a
miracle as muſt come <hi>unaskt,</hi> for ſuch men (as I am
mentioning) know no other uſe of the name of God, than
to <hi>profane</hi> it by an horrid Oath, or interſert it with ſome
impertinent or <hi>cauſeleſs</hi> curſe.</p>
            <p>And how <hi>far,</hi> ſuch as theſe are from <hi>Destruction,</hi> let
all men conſider: and yet through <hi>whoſe</hi> occaſion let the
world judge.</p>
            <p>But now in ſhort, poſitively: <hi>Parents</hi> ſhould provide
for their Children, in this reſpect, <hi>ſenſonably,</hi> by giving
them good <hi>inſtructions, enlivened</hi> by their own Examples.
<hi>N.B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They muſt reprove them for <hi>little</hi> faults, and correct
them for <hi>great</hi> ones; they muſt keep them to the <hi>ſtrict</hi>
obſervance of the rules of good Morality; and the <hi>exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
which Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould demand from their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in point of practice, muſt be <hi>ſevere (i. e.)</hi> admit
of no diminutions: There muſt be no <hi>Commutation</hi> in
the exerciſe of <hi>tender vertue;</hi> for <hi>that</hi> will by degrees
tempt <hi>Children</hi> to believe that 'tis only <hi>indifferent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now when Parents keep a ſevere hand, and a
watchful Eye over their Children, and will allow no <hi>abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of their duty: but encourage and reward them for
doing <hi>well;</hi> and render Vertue <hi>amiable</hi> from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of that <hi>credit</hi> that attends it; and Laſtly, when
they recommend <hi>Religion</hi> to their choice from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That Gods Honor is concerned in it☜</item>
               <item>2. That their own eternal Happineſs depends on it; then
Parents have done their <hi>duty</hi> for their Children.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Secondly, And then there is no <hi>doubt,</hi> that thoſe who
have begun thus <hi>well,</hi> will ever fall <hi>back;</hi> thoſe who are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61253:15"/>
ſo forward in their way to Heaven, can't fail of <hi>arriving</hi>
thither with eaſe and comfort, as well as be received with
joy and <hi>glory.</hi> He that hath been <hi>accuſtomed</hi> to do well,
will not admit of any temptation to <hi>biaſs</hi> him: but his
whole converſation will be heavenly: his diſcourſe alway
<hi>grave,</hi> as if ſeaſoned with Salt, miniſtring <hi>Grace</hi> to the
Hearers: his thoughts alway <hi>limited;</hi> his deſires <hi>bounded;</hi>
and his actions will be ſo <hi>innocent,</hi> and withal his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſo <hi>obliging,</hi> and his <hi>ſociety</hi> ſo acceptable, and withal
ſo <hi>beneficial,</hi> that <hi>all</hi> that know him muſt commend
him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>which</hi> is a comfort to <hi>himſelf,</hi> he is alway in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for the coming of the Bridegroom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preparation</hi> for death includes more than a <hi>Death-bed-repentance;</hi>
or a faint Lord have mercy upon me. <hi>He</hi>
properly, and he <hi>only</hi> prepares for death <hi>aright,</hi> who lives
every <hi>day</hi> with that care and watchfulneſs, as if he were
to dye ere the <hi>night (i. e.)</hi> not to fall wilfully into any
<hi>notorious</hi> ſin, nor to <hi>allow</hi> little ones: but every night
confeſſes the Errors and Miſcarriages of the day <hi>paſt,</hi> and
endeavours what he can to <hi>avoid</hi> the ſame in after times:
In a word: 'Tis an <hi>Early</hi> beginning to <hi>live</hi> well, that
can be truly accounted a <hi>timely preparation</hi> for our remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
hence. <hi>N. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Inf.</hi> 4.</note> We ſhould moderate our ſorrow for the loſs
of any Friend, how near or hopeful ſoever. <hi>The days of
man are but as graſs,</hi> ſays the text. <hi>All Fleſh is graſs,</hi> ſaith
the Prophet, <hi>I ſay</hi> 40. 6. <hi>and all the glory of it but like a
Flower:</hi> well then—Are you diſcontented that your
graſs withereth? Or are you perplexed that a flower fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth?
No.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> doth not diſturb you, for you know 'tis <hi>natural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Be it ſo; mans days are no <hi>more;</hi> but his removal hence
is <hi>neceſſary;</hi> and will you, will you, it lies not in your
power to <hi>prevent</hi> that ſate, for that's a war in which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61253:15"/>
there's no diſcharge. And therefore to be <hi>angry</hi> that our
Friends <hi>dye,</hi> is to <hi>blame</hi> the wiſdom of God, who made
them <hi>mortal:</hi> or to be diſcontented that we can keep
them no longer, is to pretend to tell God, what ſeaſon is
proper for him to do what <hi>we</hi> would have done, which is
to put our ſelves above him: In a word, we have no more
<hi>ſolid</hi> reaſon to be grieved that our Friends dye (I mean
grief to exceſs) than that a Stone deſcends; or Water is
moiſt; or the Sun giveth light, or Fire burns; for all are
alike natural.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, if ever grief be allowed, when our
Friends dye, as Nature <hi>prompts</hi> it, and there are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who can conquer their paſſion ſo as to ſuppreſs it; then
in <hi>extraordinary</hi> caſes, it will follow that there ſhould be
<hi>extraordinary</hi> grief allowed? (will it not? may be a
Queſtion)</p>
            <p>I anſwer, no: or I ask to what <hi>purpoſe?</hi> will your Friend
be the more <hi>eaſy</hi> after he is dead, if you tear your Hair,
or rent your Cloths, or break your Reſt, or forbear your
Meat, and pine your ſelf into a Conſumption? If you
you can think ſo; ſpare no Labour, but rather take <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives</hi>
to heighten a diſconſolate paſſion to any degree,
<hi>this ſide</hi> your own expiration.—But if you can't ſuppoſe
that the deceaſed Perſon, for whom you ſo lament, and
whom you ſo paſſionately bewail, is at all <hi>benefited</hi>
thereby, pray then to what <hi>purpoſe</hi> is it? Or why make
ye this ado.—I am ſure, it can be no <hi>comfort</hi> or eaſe to
indulge thoſe phlegmatick paſſions: reaſon doth not
<hi>require</hi> them, nor religion tolerate them:—Or if no
other argument can <hi>convince</hi> men, how <hi>unſerviceable</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
grief is. in ſuch a caſe, I ſay, that others ſhall
ſhortly lament <hi>us,</hi> as <hi>we</hi> now do our late dear Friend.</p>
            <p>In a word, therefore in all the circumſtances of Life,
let our grief be moderate;<note place="margin">Summ. &amp; Appl.</note> in all our concerns of <hi>Eternity,</hi>
let us be very <hi>vigilant:</hi> Let it be our care to have Oyl
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61253:16"/>
alway in our Lamps. We are but as <hi>Flowers;</hi> we know
not how <hi>ſoon</hi> we may be gathered hence; let us be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that we be not found <hi>unprovided.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God ſhould think fit to call us off ſuddenly, are we
now <hi>provided?</hi>—I know many don't care to put this
queſtion much to themſelves: but they would rather
enquire after <hi>others</hi> that died in this manner: but <hi>that</hi> is
not any mans duty, for any one to mind <hi>more</hi> than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for himſelf. But this I know, and forwarn, and
teſtify, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that where God continues the means of
grace, and makes all men a <hi>free</hi> offer of glory, if they
will but <hi>labour</hi> after it; If men will prefer a Luſt to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life: Value Vanity beyond a Crown of Glory, prize
a Bubble before an Inheritance which fadeth not away;
if they ſlight the Threatnings of God; and contemn his
Judgments, and deſpiſe his Mercies, he will ſpeedily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
Vengeance on thoſe that ſo affront him. And thô
their time in <hi>general</hi> be but <hi>ſhort,</hi> yet God will cut off
ſuch in the <hi>midst</hi> of their days, haſten their Deſtruction,
and ſend them quick into Hell; and then they ſhall too
late perceive their Folly, which now they would not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>On the other hand. If from the conſideration of the
<hi>uncertainty</hi> of our continuance here, we <hi>provide</hi> our ſelves
for a <hi>removal;</hi> and make it our buſineſs to look out that
<hi>City, which hath Foundations, whoſe builder and maker is
God,</hi> Heb. 11. 10. If from the thoughts of a <hi>ſpeedy</hi> death,
weare perſwaded to mortify ſin in our members <hi>preſently;</hi>
if from the remembrance of leaving <hi>this</hi> world, we are
induced to fix our thoughts upon <hi>Heaven;</hi> If the thoughts
of leaving behind us all <hi>our Friends,</hi> engage us to make
Friends with the Mammon of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs;</hi> If the
leaving our <hi>wealth,</hi> prevails upon us to lay up a <hi>treaſure</hi>
In Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61253:16"/>
Then have we lived <hi>long</hi> enough, how <hi>little while</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have lived; then death ſhall never be <hi>ſudden,</hi> how
<hi>unexpected</hi> ſoever it may <hi>ſeize</hi> us. Laſtly, then our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
our honour and ſplendor, which are ſo many <hi>Flowers</hi>
on us in Life, of which death deprives us, ſhall be all
<hi>abundantly</hi> recompenced by a <hi>Crown</hi> of Righteouſneſs;
which ſhall be a laſting <hi>ornament</hi> to our head, to a never
ending Eternity.</p>
